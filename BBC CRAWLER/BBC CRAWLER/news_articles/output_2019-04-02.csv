Superdry chiefs quit after founder returns,"Julian Dunkerton co-founded Superdry in 2003 Superdry executives, including the chairman and chief executive, have resigned after founder Julian Dunkerton won his bid to be reinstated to the board of the company he founded. In a narrow victory on Tuesday, Mr Dunkerton won the support of 51.15% of shareholders who voted. After an emergency board meeting eight directors resigned en masse. Mr Dunkerton, who left the chain a year ago, has been appointed interim chief executive. He has blamed management for flagging sales and profits and has promised to revive the firm's performance. Superdry's board had threatened to resign if Mr Dunkerton won the vote. The chain's chairman, Peter Bamford, chief executive Euan Sutherland, chief financial officer Ed Barker, and remuneration committee chair Penny Hughes, resigned from the board ""and will stand down with immediate effect"" the firmsaid in a statement to the markets,external. Dennis Millard, Minnow Powell, Sarah Wood and John Smith have given three months notice and will stand down as directors on 1 July. Two board members remain: company secretary Simon Callander, and non-executive director John Smith. UBS and Investec alsoresigned as Superdry financial advisers on Tuesday,external. Peter Williams has been appointed as board chairman. Mr Bamford had earlier said the board would hold an emergency meeting this afternoon. ""Whilst the board was unanimous in its view that the resolutions should be rejected and 74% of shareholders other than Julian and James have voted against, there was a narrow overall majority in favour and we accept that outcome,"" he added. Mr Dunkerton had said he was ""delighted"" by the outcome of the vote. ""We have a wonderful opportunity to take this brand and this business to the next, exciting phase of its growth and development. ""I can't wait to get started and to work with the directors, the talented staff and our partners to deliver the future of Superdry. The hard work starts now."" The fashion chain had urged investors to reject Mr Dunkerton's return, saying it would be ""extremely damaging"". In a separate motion proposed by Mr Dunkerton, votes ahead of the meeting suggested a majority of shareholders (51.15%) were also in favour of the appointment of Peter Williams, chairman of online retailer Boohoo, as a non-executive director. The vote comes amid a long-running dispute over the clothing brand's strategy. Supercharge Superdry? No thanks, says firm What went wrong at Superdry? Don't come back, Superdry tells founder Mr Dunkerton - who owns 18% of the company - was chief executive until 2014, when former Co-op chief executive Euan Sutherland took over the role. However, Mr Dunkerton remained at the company as creative director until he left a year ago. Former Superdry chief executive Euan Sutherland took the helm in 2014 Since Mr Dunkerton's departure Superdry's shares have plunged by 65%, and he and Mr Sutherland argued over who is responsible for the brand's decline. The management had planned to branch out into childrenswear and was also trying to broaden its range away from the firm's roots of branded hoodies, jackets and T-shirts. In contrast,  Mr Dunkerton had argued the brand should continue to focus on products that made it famous. He said venturing into childrenswear was a mistake, saying a 16-year-old ""quite categorically"" will not want to wear the same brand as their five-year-old brother. ""Next steps will likely see the kidswear launch scrapped and a step up in new product innovation. We sense there will be some upfront costs and disruption before Julian's recovery plan starts to take shape,"" analysts at Peel Hunt said. Two big institutional shareholders - Investec and Schroders, which together control about 10% of the shares - backed Mr Dunkerton's return. But the company's second largest shareholder, Aberdeen Asset Management, sided with Superdry management, and influential investor advisory firms PIRC and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had both recommended that shareholders should reject Mr Dunkerton's re-election.

Embattled Trudeau expels 'whistleblowers',"Jody Wilson-Raybould (L) and Jane Philpott (R) Canada's prime minister has kicked two MPs from his party's caucus after they accused him of meddling in a criminal case involving an influential company. Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott had already resigned from PM Justin Trudeau's cabinet citing their concerns over the SNC-Lavalin affair. Now they have been expelled from Mr Trudeau's Liberal Party, months before a general election. The SNC-Lavalin controversy has cast a shadow over Mr Trudeau's leadership. Andrew Scheer, the leader of the opposition Conservatives, said on Tuesday that the prime minister had betrayed justice by removing two corruption whistleblowers. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trudeau repeatedly spoke about the breakdown of trust between Ms Wilson-Raybould and Ms Philpott and members of his staff. ""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,"" Mr Trudeau told the media shortly after informing his caucus. ""If they can't honestly say they have confidence in this teamâ¦ then they cannot be part of this team."" Ms Philpott has been vocal about her concerns with the government, and gave an interview in a national magazine last month in which she said ""there's much more to the story that needs to be told"". Mr Trudeau said his decision was sparked by the revelation that Ms Wilson-Raybould had secretly recorded a conversation she had with Canada's former top bureaucrat, which she released publicly on Friday. Ms Wilson-Raybould said the tapes backed up her claim that government officials inappropriately pressured her to shield SNC-Lavalin from prosecution. The Canadian firm is accused of bribing officials in Libya to win contracts under Muammar Gaddafi's regime. SNC-Lavalin has openly lobbied for an agreement that would allow it to avoid prosecution and instead face alternative penalties or measures, such as a fine. Ms Wilson-Raybould said members of Mr Trudeau's inner circle pressured her to cut a deal, and when she did not, she was removed from her position as justice minister. Trudeau crisis grows as minister resigns Ex-minister increases pressure on Trudeau Mr Trudeau has repeatedly denied that there was any wrongdoing by him or his officials. The political controversy, which has been dragging on for weeks, has caused Mr Trudeau's popularity to drop sharply in opinion polls a few months before a general election. He said he is expelling the women from the caucus to put an end to infighting, which he had vowed to stop when he was elected in 2014. Secret tape increases pressure on Trudeau Five quotes that sum up the Trudeau crisis ""Civil wars within parties is damaging because it signals to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than about them,"" he said on Tuesday. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has struggled to contain the political crisis Both women had said they still want to run again under the Liberal banner in the next general election, and expressed dismay they will no longer be a part of the party.

She reiterated her belief that the government put inappropriate pressure on Ms Wilson-Raybould, and criticised the government for attacking Ms Wilson-Raybould's credibility. ""This isn't about a lack of loyalty,""  she wrote in a statement Tuesday evening. ""On the contrary, I recommended that the government acknowledge what happened in order to move forward. This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty."" Ms Wilson-Raybould said she had ""no regrets"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Theresa May's statement in full,"Theresa May has said she will ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline to ""break the logjam"" in Parliament. The prime minister also said she wants to meet Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree a plan on the future relationship with the EU. Here is her statement in full. ""I've just come from chairing seven hours of Cabinet meetings focused on finding a route out of the current impasse, one that will deliver the Brexit the British people voted for and allow us to move on and begin bringing our divided country back together. ""I know there are some who are so fed up with delay and endless arguments that they would like to leave with no deal next week. I've always been clear that we could make a success of no deal in the long term. MPs push to prevent no-deal Brexit in law EU 'will not be hostage to Brexit crisis' ""But leaving with a deal is the best solution. So we will need a further extension of Article 50, one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal. ""And we need to be clear what such an extension is for, to ensure we leave in a timely and orderly way. ""This debate, this division, cannot drag on much longer. ""It is putting members of Parliament and everyone else under immense pressure and it is doing damage to our politics. ""Despite the best efforts of MPs, the process that the House of Commons has tried to lead has not come up with an answer. ""So today I'm taking action to break the log jam. ""I'm offering to sit down with the Leader of the Opposition to try to agree a plan that we would both stick to, to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal. ""Any plan would have to agree the current withdrawal agreement. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Brexit jargon explained ""It has already been negotiated with the 27 other members and the EU has repeatedly said that it cannot and will not be reopened. ""What we need to focus on is our future relationship with the EU. ""The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the Leader of the Opposition and I could put to the House for approval and which I could then take to next week's European Council. ""However, if we cannot agree on the single unified approach then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue. ""Crucially, the government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House, but to make this process work, the opposition would need to agree to this too. ""The government would then bring forward the Withdrawal Agreement bill. ""We would want to agree a timetable for this bill to ensure it is passed before the 22nd of May so that the United Kingdom need not take part in the European parliamentary elections. ""This is a difficult time for everyone. Passions are running high on all sides of the argument, but we can and must find the compromises that will deliver what the British people voted for. ""This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands and it requires national unity to deliver the national interest.""

Kuenssberg: Deal trumps party unity,"She was for budging. Today, the prime minister made her priority leaving the EU with a deal, rather than the happy contentment of the Brexiteers in the Tory party. For so long, Theresa May has been derided by her rivals, inside and outside, for cleaving to the idea that she can get the country and her party through this process intact. But after her deal was defeated at the hands of Eurosceptics, in the words of one cabinet minister in the room during that marathon session today, she tried delivering Brexit with Tory votes - Tory Brexiteers said ""No"". Now she's going to try to deliver Brexit with Labour votes. In a way, it is as simple as that. That could mean, three cabinet sources suggest, accepting many of Labour's demands for the deal - those six tests, which it has often, frankly, been assumed were designed to be impossible to meet. Irony would ring out if in the end they were all delivered because of the desperation of the Tory prime minister. One cabinet minister told me the offer to Labour is, ""You want soft Brexit - here it is. You help shape it."" Potentially, there are political smarts here - challenging Jeremy Corbyn to decide, finally, whether he leads a party that really is up for pushing through our departure from the EU, or a group that wants to fight it until its last breath. Either choice for him is complex given that his party is divided too. And ministers tonight don't hold out huge hope of a genuinely productive cross-party process. Frankly, they don't know if they can trust Mr Corbyn enough to come to a genuine agreement that Labour would stick to. Of course, for any opposition party the temptation might be always to play for political advantage. We know by now that is not necessarily exactly the same as the best interests of you and me. And whether it's Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn who sinks this still hypothetical process, it will be Parliament that takes the reins. That could, in turn, challenge reluctant Brexiteers to confront the reality that the prime minister's deal could be the best version of Brexit they are ever going to get - maybe, just maybe, swinging support for Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in the end. Stranger things have happened. But the prime minister has taken a huge risk with her party, and an implosion may stop any of this process in its tracks. There's what's described as ""genuine fury"" among Brexiteer ranks and ministers that the PM has made this choice. One senior Tory said she is ""making an art form of bad misjudgements - this is not just a Rubens or a Van Gogh, it's the whole Tate Modern"". As ever, there is a very big gamble that has just become a real risk. The prime minister can reach out for support from the other parties - and compromise to get it - and ultimately maybe get her deal through. But if and when she is able to do that, her party may be so split and so fractious that she may not be able to govern or do anything, ever again. If she were actually to strike some form of weird pact with the Labour Party over Brexit how long could it reasonably last? And how could it function and deliver a sustainable agreement when she has already said that she is leaving and another leader will soon be along to take charge of the second phase of Brexit? Perhaps right now we can only answer one question that for so long Theresa May has avoided answering. When it came to it, would she choose party unity or leaving the EU WITH a deal? To the irritation of many, but the relief of others, she's chosen trying to get it done with a deal.

How would another Brexit delay work?,"The European Union (EU) has accepted the UK's request for a Brexit delay until 31 January 2020, with an option to leave sooner if a deal is approved by Parliament. Delaying the UK's exit date requires an extension to Article 50, the part of the Lisbon Treaty that sets out what happens when a country decides it wants to leave the EU. Article 50 allows an initial two-year period for negotiations on the terms of exiting. It was triggered by then Prime Minister Theresa May on 29 March 2017, giving an exit date of 29 March 2019. But this date was extended twice, first to 12 April and then until 31 October, after Mrs May's deal was rejected in successive votes in the House of Commons. Now it is being extended for a third time - so how does this process work? The UK cannot make a decision about extending Article 50 on its own - it has to send a request to the 27 other EU countries. All 27 have to agree in order to secure an extension. On Saturday 19 October, Mr Johnson sent a letter, as he was compelled to by alaw known as the Benn Act. The law stated he must send an extension request should he fail to get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons by the end of 19 October. Mr Johnson also sent a second letter saying he believed that a ""further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners"". Nevertheless, on 28 October the EU agreed to the extension proposed in his first letter. The EU was not obliged to say yes. Once it received the UK's delay request, in the form of a letter, the 27 leaders consulted with each other on their decision. It was then made following a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. If EU leaders had decided to offer a longer extension they would have been likely to have met in person to set conditions of the extension. It's worth pointing out that Article 50 can also be revoked - effectively cancelling Brexit. The UK can in theory do that without consulting anyone else. That would mean that Brexit would not happen and the UK would remain in the EU on the same terms it has now. The Liberal Democrats are the only party to say that would they would revoke Article 50 without a referendum if they won a majority in a general election. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that a revocation should be ""unequivocal and unconditional"", suggesting that the ECJ would take a dim view of any attempt to withdraw an Article 50 notification and then resubmit it again a short time later.

MPs push to prevent no-deal Brexit,"This video can not be played Yvette Cooper: ""We're in a very dangerous situation"" A cross-party group of MPs has put forward a bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit in 10 days' time. If passed into law, the bill would require the PM to ask for an extension of Article 50 - which mandates the UK's exit from the EU - beyond the current 12 April deadline. Labour MP Yvette Cooper presented the bill - which supporters hope they can pass through the Commons in one day. The prime minister is expected to make a statement shortly. It comes after the cabinet, which remains split over Brexit, met for eight hours in No 10. The BBC's John Pienaar said Theresa May's ministers considered plans to ""ramp up"" no-deal Brexit preparations and a snap general election was also discussed. What could happen next? How did my MP vote on Brexit options? Ms Cooper's bill would make it UK law for the PM to ask for an extension to prevent a no-deal, but it would be up to the EU to grant it - or not. In March,MPs voted against leaving the EU without a deal, but it was not legally binding. Meanwhile, the EU's chief negotiator has said a no-deal Brexit is now more likely but can still be avoided. Michel Barnier said a long extension to the UK's 12 April exit date had ""significant risks for the EU"" and a ""strong justification would be needed"". France's President Emmanuel Macron and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar are meeting in Paris to discuss the impact of Brexit. This video can not be played Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the EU should be open to any ""credible proposals"" the UK put forward President Macron told reporters that the EU ""cannot be hostage to the political crisis in the UK"", and the government must come forward with ""credible"" reasons for an extension. He said these could include an election, second referendum, or alternative proposals for the future relationship, such as a customs union. Mr Varadkar said the UK was ""consumed by Brexit"", but the EU should not be. He said the EU ""needs to be open"" about any proposals the UK brings, including a longer extension, and they will do what they can to ""assist"". But he added: ""We gave the UK some time, some space and some opportunity to come up with a way forward... [but] as things stand, they will leave on 12 April without a deal."" Brexit deadlock: The Commons in numbers EU 'will not be hostage to Brexit crisis' What does a soft Brexit mean? Ex-Tory MP hits out at 'cowardly' cabinet Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who supports Ms Cooper's bill, said: ""This is a last-ditch attempt to prevent our country being exposed to the risks inherent in a no-deal exit. ""We realise this is difficult. But it is definitely worth trying."" Ms Cooper said the UK was ""in a very dangerous situation"" and MPs ""have a responsibility to make sure we don't end up with a catastrophic no deal"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One, she added: ""We have been attempting to squeeze into just a couple of days a process that really should have been happening for the last two years - a process of trying to build a consensus around the best way forward. ""It is what the prime minister should be doing. It is the prime minister's responsibility to ensure we don't leave the country less safe."" Normally the government chooses which bills to present to Parliament in order for them to become law. But - much to the government's disapproval - MPs voted to allow backbenchers to take charge of business in the Commons on Wednesday. This gives backbenchers the opportunity to table their own bills, such as this one from Yvette Cooper. A copy of the bill shows that they want to push it through the commons in one day. As the backbenchers will be in charge, they will also be able to vote to set aside more time on another day, if they need to complete the process or hold further indicative votes. However, the bill would also have to be agreed by the House of Lords and receive Royal Assent before it became law - which if the Commons agrees it on Wednesday, could happen as soon as Thursday. Brexiteer Tory Sir Bill Cash said trying to go through these stages in one day made it a ""reprehensible procedure"". But Speaker John Bercow said that, while it was ""an unusual state of affairs"", it was ""not as unprecedented as he supposes"" - citing recent bills on Northern Ireland that have been passed at the same speed. In the latest round of indicative votes on Monday,MPs voted on four alternativesto the PM's withdrawal deal, but none gained a majority. MPs rejected a customs union with the EU by three votes. A motion for another referendum got the most votes in favour, but still lost. The votes were not legally binding, but they had been billed as the moment when Parliament might finally compromise. The Independent MP Chris Leslie tweeted that MPs would be seeking more time for indicative votes to take place on Monday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On occasion he said he had acted as a go-between for the Army and the local community. C4 told the court he was present during the incident where Fr Hugh Mullan and Francis Quinn were shot and killed on waste ground near Springfield Park. The shootings occurred amid disturbances sparked by the introduction of internment without trial in Northern Ireland He said he and others had been pinned down whilst trying to help women and children, including his own sister-in-law, from a mixed area, escape across the waste ground. C4 said he saw two soldiers wearing red berets on the roof of Springmartin Flats, which were unfinished at the time. He had been practising on a Army shooting range just the week before, he said, and was well aware of the noises made by various weapons. C4 said the soldiers were firing SLRs (self-loading rifles). He had earlier watched as soldiers and a Ferret scout car had moved into the area. He said he watched Fr Mullan being shot and said the priest screamed for some time. Ten people were killed in the shootings Later, after the priest was hit a second time, C4 said he listened to him pray for a while in both English and Latin, before he died. During the shooting C4 said he could see the two soldiers and watched the muzzle flashes from their weapons. The off-duty soldier was nicked in the leg by one bullet as well, he said. He reported hearing handguns fired earlier from Springmartin which he thought came from loyalist paramilitaries. Later in the evening C4 said there was firing from two Lee Enfield rifles at a factory on a different side of the waste ground. He also said that an Army major asked him not to testify at the inquest in 1972. Later on Tuesday, a previous television interview C4 had given was played to the court. In it he described lying in the waste ground under fire. Soldiers from the Parachute Regiment were based at Henry Taggart Army base ""I looked up,"" he said. ""I saw them. I could see they were paras by the berets they were wearing."" In the interview, he said the soldiers later created ""ghost gunmen"" to justify having opened fire. ""I was quite, not shocked, disgusted, by the fact that the soldiers did lie,"" he said. C4 later said that at the 1972 inquest into Father Mullan's death he'd been called a traitor by an officer of the Parachute Regiment and had been threatened. Of his own military career, he said: ""I served with honour. To me, part of that was the truth."" Later C4 was questioned at length by a barrister for the Ministry of Defence. The former soldier told him: ""Don't think this is easy for me, it's not. My loyalties are being torn apart.""

"Sturgeon: May 'kicking can' over BrexitTheresa May wants a further extension to the Brexit deadline - but Nicola Sturgeon says she's ""kicking the can"".Scotland politics","Nicola Sturgeon has accused Theresa May of ""kicking the can"" after the prime minister said she would ask the EU for a further Brexit deadline extension. Mrs May called for talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to ""break the logjam"" in the Commons over Brexit. Ms Sturgeon said the prime minister was ""kicking the can and delaying making any decision"" on how to compromise. The first minister had earlier proposed cancelling Holyrood's Easter recess if the UK is heading for a no-deal exit. Westminster looks set to sit through its Easter recess as MPs attempt to agree a plan for the UK's exit from the EU, and the Scottish government said it would be ""weird"" if MSPs took time away from Holyrood if a no-deal exit was looming. Theresa May to ask for further Brexit extension Mrs May has been unable to win backing for her proposed Brexit plan, suffering three defeats in the Commons, while MPs have failed to unite around any alternative after a series of ""indicative votes"". The UK's departure from the EU was put back from 29 March to 12 April following a summit of European leaders late in March. If MPs or ministers cannot come up with a plan, which is accepted by the EU, then the UK will leave without a deal. After an all-day meeting of her cabinet on Tuesday, Mrs May said she would ask the EU for a further extension to the deadline to ""break the logjam in parliament"". She said she wanted this delay to be ""as short as possible"" - before 22 May, so the UK does not have to take part in European elections - and that she would seek talks with Mr Corbyn to agree a new approach.

In a post on Twitter, Ms Sturgeon responded: ""This does seem very much like the PM kicking the can and, yet again, delaying making any decision that could break her cabinet. ""What is missing is an answer to the question that many MPs faced up to last night - what is the compromise she is willing to make?"" The SNP leader favours having a second referendum on EU membership, but her MPs have also backed proposals that would keep the UK in the single market and customs union to keep the option of a softer Brexit on the agenda. She said: ""The sensible way forward - and I think one the PM would take if this was a serious attempt to build consensus - is to agree to fight an election, seek a longer delay and allow the option of a public vote on what the Commons says."" The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford added: ""Scotland has been utterly ignored throughout the Brexit process. ""The SNP has shown we are willing to find a compromise position to end the impasse, but out priority remains stopping Brexit in its tracks. ""Time is fast running out and the prime minister must now seek a long extension to Article 50, bring this back to the people through a fresh referendum, and keep the option to revoke Article 50 on the table to avoid a no-deal Brexit."" In her Downing Street statement, Mrs May said: ""This is a difficult time for everyone. Passions are running high on all sides of the argument, but we can and must find the compromises that will deliver what the British people voted for. ""This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands and it requires national unity to deliver the national interest."" Mrs May made a statement at Downing Street offering talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Ms Sturgeon had earlier agreed with her own cabinet that Holyrood's Easter recess should be curtailed if the UK is heading for a no-deal Brexit. MSPs are due to have two weeks away from the parliament from 8 April, clashing with the latest deadline. A spokesman for the first minister said ""MSPs should not be on holiday"" while the UK is ""staring down the barrel of the disaster of no-deal"". The move would have to be confirmed by Holyrood's cross-party business bureau management group of MSPs, but has been backed by the Greens and the Lib Dems. A spokeswoman for the Scottish Parliament said the bureau would consider its position ""before the close of business on Thursday"". It is understood the current proposal is that if the UK is heading for a no-deal exit on 12 April, Holyrood would sit that Thursday and Friday to provide updates and communicate resilience plans. Brexit Secretary Mike Russell said MSPs would need to ""discuss issues involved, hear about work being done on resilience, and to prepare for the terrible situation we'd find ourselves in"". MSPs could return to Holyrood to sit during the upcoming Easter recess Ms Sturgeon's official spokesman said that if the UK was ""staring down the barrel of the disaster of no-deal, then members of the public would find it weird if parliament was in recess and not focused on the issue in front of them"". He added: ""The first minister's view is clearly MSPs should not be on holiday when the biggest, most momentous, potentially most damaging issue to hit Scotland and the UK since the Second World War is about to take place."" The Scottish Greens said it would be ""quite right"" for Holyrood to sit in light of the ""unprecedented crisis"" of no-deal, while the Lib Dems said there would be ""a lot of frightened people out there"" who would ""need reassurances that their representatives are dealing with any issues that arise in a focused and collaborative way"". However a number of MSPs hit out at the idea of recess being a ""holiday"", withseveral stressing,externalthat it was rather ""a chance to catch up on local issues"" and hold constituency surgeries.

"Coffee cup ban sees sales fall ÃÂ£250kBoston Tea Party's owner said global coffee shop brands were ""putting profits before the planet"".Bristol","Boston Tea Party has 21 branches around England An independent coffee chain said it has seen sales fall by Â£250,000 since it banned single use cups last summer. Boston Tea Party (BTP) has called for major national and international brands to follow suit. Owner Sam Roberts said it had factored the loss in takings into its plans and that too many operators were ""putting their profits before the planet"". Rebecca Burgess, chief executive of plastic pollution campaign group City to Sea, praised BTP's ""bravery"". The chain, which has 22 branches around England and is based in Bristol,started the banin June 2018. This video can not be played Sam Roberts explains the move to ban one-use cups despite it losing them money Customers must bring a reusable cup, drink in or pay a deposit on a cup they can return to any branch. Boston Tea Party usually sells Â£1m in takeaway coffees per year but it is down 25%. Mr Roberts says thankfully the business is supported by a strong food offer and most customers are supportive of its stance on single use cups. But he agrees a smaller coffee shop would struggle to finance a ban. Boston Tea Party says it has stopped 125,000 cups going to landfill since last June when it brought in the ban He said: ""We have lost around 25% of our takeaway coffee sales but we modelled that into our costs as passing trade who don't want to get involved in the cup loan scheme. ""We felt this was a financial loss we had to take and we want this to be a call to action to other companies. ""Those using a 25p off a reusable cup scheme - we know first-hand this has a very low penetration and when we launched that scheme ourselves, only 5% of customers took it up. ""There's too many operators not dealing with the problem and putting their profits before the planet. ""At the moment bigger businesses are deploying a smoke and mirrors strategy and not resolving problems while seeming like they are doing something about it. ""We are 100% committed and there's no going back."" Mr Roberts said the firm had stopped 125,000 cups going to landfill, sold 40,000 reusable coffee cups and raised Â£12,000 for local charities with the money saved on buying disposable cups - roughly 10 pence for every cup. This video can not be played Boston Tea Party says it has lost Â£250,000 in sales from the move.

Pret A Mangeroffers a 50p discount on hot beverages if people bring their own reusable cup. A spokesperson said: ""We doubled our discount for customers who bring in their own reusable cup to 50p in January 2018 and, since then, usage has increased almost 20-fold. ""We now serve over 150,000 drinks in reusable cups every week, and since the discount was doubled, Pret customers have saved over six million paper cups.""

Superdry chiefs quit after founder returnsEight fashion chain bosses resign after founder Julian Dunkerton is voted back on the board.Business,"Julian Dunkerton co-founded Superdry in 2003 Superdry executives, including the chairman and chief executive, have resigned after founder Julian Dunkerton won his bid to be reinstated to the board of the company he founded. In a narrow victory on Tuesday, Mr Dunkerton won the support of 51.15% of shareholders who voted. After an emergency board meeting eight directors resigned en masse. Mr Dunkerton, who left the chain a year ago, has been appointed interim chief executive. He has blamed management for flagging sales and profits and has promised to revive the firm's performance. Superdry's board had threatened to resign if Mr Dunkerton won the vote. The chain's chairman, Peter Bamford, chief executive Euan Sutherland, chief financial officer Ed Barker, and remuneration committee chair Penny Hughes, resigned from the board ""and will stand down with immediate effect"" the firmsaid in a statement to the markets,external. Dennis Millard, Minnow Powell, Sarah Wood and John Smith have given three months notice and will stand down as directors on 1 July. Two board members remain: company secretary Simon Callander, and non-executive director John Smith. UBS and Investec alsoresigned as Superdry financial advisers on Tuesday,external. Peter Williams has been appointed as board chairman. Mr Bamford had earlier said the board would hold an emergency meeting this afternoon. ""Whilst the board was unanimous in its view that the resolutions should be rejected and 74% of shareholders other than Julian and James have voted against, there was a narrow overall majority in favour and we accept that outcome,"" he added. Mr Dunkerton had said he was ""delighted"" by the outcome of the vote. ""We have a wonderful opportunity to take this brand and this business to the next, exciting phase of its growth and development. ""I can't wait to get started and to work with the directors, the talented staff and our partners to deliver the future of Superdry. The hard work starts now."" The fashion chain had urged investors to reject Mr Dunkerton's return, saying it would be ""extremely damaging"". In a separate motion proposed by Mr Dunkerton, votes ahead of the meeting suggested a majority of shareholders (51.15%) were also in favour of the appointment of Peter Williams, chairman of online retailer Boohoo, as a non-executive director. The vote comes amid a long-running dispute over the clothing brand's strategy. Supercharge Superdry? No thanks, says firm What went wrong at Superdry? Don't come back, Superdry tells founder Mr Dunkerton - who owns 18% of the company - was chief executive until 2014, when former Co-op chief executive Euan Sutherland took over the role. However, Mr Dunkerton remained at the company as creative director until he left a year ago. Former Superdry chief executive Euan Sutherland took the helm in 2014 Since Mr Dunkerton's departure Superdry's shares have plunged by 65%, and he and Mr Sutherland argued over who is responsible for the brand's decline. The management had planned to branch out into childrenswear and was also trying to broaden its range away from the firm's roots of branded hoodies, jackets and T-shirts. In contrast,  Mr Dunkerton had argued the brand should continue to focus on products that made it famous. He said venturing into childrenswear was a mistake, saying a 16-year-old ""quite categorically"" will not want to wear the same brand as their five-year-old brother. ""Next steps will likely see the kidswear launch scrapped and a step up in new product innovation. We sense there will be some upfront costs and disruption before Julian's recovery plan starts to take shape,"" analysts at Peel Hunt said. Two big institutional shareholders - Investec and Schroders, which together control about 10% of the shares - backed Mr Dunkerton's return. But the company's second largest shareholder, Aberdeen Asset Management, sided with Superdry management, and influential investor advisory firms PIRC and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had both recommended that shareholders should reject Mr Dunkerton's re-election. Supercharge Superdry? No thanks, says firm What went wrong at Superdry?

Sturgeon: May 'kicking can' over Brexit,"Nicola Sturgeon has accused Theresa May of ""kicking the can"" after the prime minister said she would ask the EU for a further Brexit deadline extension. Mrs May called for talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to ""break the logjam"" in the Commons over Brexit. Ms Sturgeon said the prime minister was ""kicking the can and delaying making any decision"" on how to compromise. The first minister had earlier proposed cancelling Holyrood's Easter recess if the UK is heading for a no-deal exit. Westminster looks set to sit through its Easter recess as MPs attempt to agree a plan for the UK's exit from the EU, and the Scottish government said it would be ""weird"" if MSPs took time away from Holyrood if a no-deal exit was looming. Theresa May to ask for further Brexit extension Mrs May has been unable to win backing for her proposed Brexit plan, suffering three defeats in the Commons, while MPs have failed to unite around any alternative after a series of ""indicative votes"". The UK's departure from the EU was put back from 29 March to 12 April following a summit of European leaders late in March. If MPs or ministers cannot come up with a plan, which is accepted by the EU, then the UK will leave without a deal. After an all-day meeting of her cabinet on Tuesday, Mrs May said she would ask the EU for a further extension to the deadline to ""break the logjam in parliament"". She said she wanted this delay to be ""as short as possible"" - before 22 May, so the UK does not have to take part in European elections - and that she would seek talks with Mr Corbyn to agree a new approach.

In a post on Twitter, Ms Sturgeon responded: ""This does seem very much like the PM kicking the can and, yet again, delaying making any decision that could break her cabinet. ""What is missing is an answer to the question that many MPs faced up to last night - what is the compromise she is willing to make?"" The SNP leader favours having a second referendum on EU membership, but her MPs have also backed proposals that would keep the UK in the single market and customs union to keep the option of a softer Brexit on the agenda. She said: ""The sensible way forward - and I think one the PM would take if this was a serious attempt to build consensus - is to agree to fight an election, seek a longer delay and allow the option of a public vote on what the Commons says."" The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford added: ""Scotland has been utterly ignored throughout the Brexit process. ""The SNP has shown we are willing to find a compromise position to end the impasse, but out priority remains stopping Brexit in its tracks. ""Time is fast running out and the prime minister must now seek a long extension to Article 50, bring this back to the people through a fresh referendum, and keep the option to revoke Article 50 on the table to avoid a no-deal Brexit."" In her Downing Street statement, Mrs May said: ""This is a difficult time for everyone. Passions are running high on all sides of the argument, but we can and must find the compromises that will deliver what the British people voted for. ""This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands and it requires national unity to deliver the national interest."" Mrs May made a statement at Downing Street offering talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Ms Sturgeon had earlier agreed with her own cabinet that Holyrood's Easter recess should be curtailed if the UK is heading for a no-deal Brexit. MSPs are due to have two weeks away from the parliament from 8 April, clashing with the latest deadline. A spokesman for the first minister said ""MSPs should not be on holiday"" while the UK is ""staring down the barrel of the disaster of no-deal"". The move would have to be confirmed by Holyrood's cross-party business bureau management group of MSPs, but has been backed by the Greens and the Lib Dems. A spokeswoman for the Scottish Parliament said the bureau would consider its position ""before the close of business on Thursday"". It is understood the current proposal is that if the UK is heading for a no-deal exit on 12 April, Holyrood would sit that Thursday and Friday to provide updates and communicate resilience plans. Brexit Secretary Mike Russell said MSPs would need to ""discuss issues involved, hear about work being done on resilience, and to prepare for the terrible situation we'd find ourselves in"". MSPs could return to Holyrood to sit during the upcoming Easter recess Ms Sturgeon's official spokesman said that if the UK was ""staring down the barrel of the disaster of no-deal, then members of the public would find it weird if parliament was in recess and not focused on the issue in front of them"". He added: ""The first minister's view is clearly MSPs should not be on holiday when the biggest, most momentous, potentially most damaging issue to hit Scotland and the UK since the Second World War is about to take place."" The Scottish Greens said it would be ""quite right"" for Holyrood to sit in light of the ""unprecedented crisis"" of no-deal, while the Lib Dems said there would be ""a lot of frightened people out there"" who would ""need reassurances that their representatives are dealing with any issues that arise in a focused and collaborative way"". However a number of MSPs hit out at the idea of recess being a ""holiday"", withseveral stressing,externalthat it was rather ""a chance to catch up on local issues"" and hold constituency surgeries.

Woman staged fall to claim payment,"Two women were seen on CCTV moving a crate of orange juice cartons, with Farida Ashraf later tripping over it A woman who staged a fall over a crate in a Bradford store in order to make a bogus injury claim has been given a suspended prison sentence for fraud. Farida Ashraf, 41, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was seen on CCTV tripping over the crate in 2013 after two accomplices had placed it on the floor. She said she had suffered multiple injuries, but a civil court ruled the claim was ""fundamentally dishonest"". The case against her at Bradford Crown Court was brought by the insurers. It is thought to be the first private prosecution of its kind. The judge suspended her 21-month jail term for two years. Latest news and updates from Yorkshire Ashraf, of Staincliffe Crescent, was seen tripping over orange juice cartons at the Al-Halal premises on Woodhead Road and waited for eight or nine months before submitting an injury claim for about Â£3,000, the court heard. Nicholas Lumley QC, prosecuting, said she had hoped the CCTV would have been erased by then, but a suspicious member of staff had kept hold of the footage. One of the two accomplices, who have never been identified, was seen taking a photograph of the crate on the floor shortly before Ashraf fell. Ashraf claimed to have suffered injuries to her shoulder, shin, calf and hip, but a judge dismissed the claim in 2016 after an inquiry by insurance company Aviva. Aviva pursued a private prosecution, resulting in Ashraf admitting a fraud charge in March, Mr Lumley said. ""It is, we think, the first private prosecution arising out of a public liability insurance claim,"" he said. Sentencing Ashraf, Judge David Hatton QC said: ""You no doubt anticipated that the insurance company of the supermarket would pay up with little or no questions. Happily they did not."" After considering documentation about Ashraf's health difficulties and her caring role for her mother, sister and daughter, the judge suspended the jail term and gave her a six-month curfew order.

Canada 'warming faster than rest of world'The federal government report warns Canada's Arctic is most affected by the changing climate.US & Canada,"Canada's Arctic is warming faster than southern Canada Canada is warming on average at a rate twice as fast as the rest of the world, a new scientific report indicates. The federal government climate report,externalalso warns that changes are already evident in many parts of the country and are projected to intensify. Canada's Arctic has seen the deepest impact and will continue to warm at more than double the global rate. The report suggests that many of the effects already seen are probably irreversible. Canada's annual average temperature has warmed by an estimated 1.7C (3F) since 1948, when nationwide temperatures were first recorded. The largest temperature increases have been seen in the North, the Prairies, and in northern British Columbia. Annual average temperature in northern Canada increased by approximately 2.3C. Drilling climate history in 'Iceberg Alley' Saving the planet: The next move Climate change impacts 'accelerating' ""While both human activities and natural variations in the climate have contributed to the observed warming in Canada, the human factor is dominant,"" the report states. ""It is likely that more than half of the observed warming in Canada is due to the influence of human activities."" The report came as the government imposed carbon taxes on four of Canada's 10 provinces for failing to introduce their own plans for tackling climate change. The effects of global warming on Canada's environment include more extreme weather. Hotter temperatures could mean more heat waves and a higher risk of wildfires and droughts in some parts of the country. Oceans are expected to become more acidic and less oxygenated, which could harm marine life. This video can not be played What is global warming? Parts of Canada's Arctic Ocean are projected to have extensive ice-free periods during summer within a few decades. A rise in sea levels could also increase the risk of coastal flooding and more intense rainfall could cause problems with flooding in urban centres. Canada's rapid warming is due to a number of factors, including a loss of snow and sea ice, which is increasing the absorption of solar radiation and causing larger surface warming than in other regions, according to the report. Despite the bleak projections, the report notes that the amount of warming could be limited if global action is taken by drastically reducing ""carbon emissions to near zero early in the second half of the century and [reducing] emissions of other greenhouse gases substantially"". What is in the Paris climate agreement? Cyclone Idai and the climate connection Canada is one of nearly 200 countries that have signed on to the Paris Agreement - a single global agreement on tackling climate change that seeks to keep temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C. The Canadian government says it will meet the Paris target of cutting emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 despite the fact that a number of official reports indicate the country is unlikely to meet its reduction targets without significant effort. University of Toronto professor Matthew Hoffmann told the BBC that, like the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, this one underscores the warnings about the impact of climate change. ""This is yet another reaffirmation of the urgency of this problem,"" he said. Civil society appeared to be at a ""tipping point"" on the issue with public opinion moving in support of governments taking action. Students in Quebec were among thousands protesting around the world in March Mr Hoffmann points to recent student protests in the UK, Canada and elsewhere pushing for governments to take active steps to tackle the problem. ""People are starting to feel climate change - it's starting to be part of their lived experience,"" he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned the country's provinces two years ago that they needed to come up with plans by 1 April setting out how they would contribute to Canada's reduction targets. The four that the government accuses of failing to do so are Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. The carbon tax will be added to the cost of fuel - 4.4 Canadian cents (3.6 US cents) per litre initially - equivalent to 20 Canadian dollars per tonne of carbon produced, more than doubling by 2022. However, households are expected to be compensated by the federal government in the form of ""climate action incentive"" rebates. The opposition Conservatives have vowed to scrap the tax should they win federal elections in October.

"Grandmother gives birth to own grandchildCecile Eledge of Nebraska tells the BBC it was ""an act of kindness"" to carry her gay son's child.US & Canada","Baby Uma Louise with her parents, Matthew Eledge and Elliot Dougherty and her grandmother, Cecil Eledge A 61-year-old Nebraskan woman has told of her joy after giving birth to her own grandchild, acting as the surrogate for her son and his husband. Cecile Eledge carried the daughter of her son Matthew Eledge and his husband Elliot Dougherty to term, giving birth to baby Uma Louise last week. Mrs Eledge said she made the offer when her son and Mr Dougherty first said they wanted to start a family. ""Of course, they all laughed,"" Mrs Eledge told the BBC. Mrs Eledge, who was 59 at the time, said her suggestion remained a sort of joke among family at first, not a realistic path forward. ""It just seemed like a really beautiful sentiment on her part,"" Mr Dougherty said. ""She's such a selfless woman."" But when Mr Eledge and Mr Dougherty, who live in Omaha close to Mrs Eledge and her husband, began exploring options to have a baby they were told by a fertility doctor that it could be a viable option. Mr Eledge and Mr Dougherty on the day of their daughter's birth Mrs Eledge was brought in for an interview and a series of tests, all of which gave a green light to the surrogacy. ""I'm very health conscious,"" she said. ""There was no reason whatsoever to doubt that I could carry the baby."" With Mr Eledge providing the sperm, Mr Dougherty's sister Lea served as the egg donor. Q&A: Surrogate babies Cecile Eledge and her granddaughter, Uma Mr Dougherty, who works as a hairdresser, said that while straight couples may consider IVF the last resort, for them it was their ""only hope"" for a biological child. ""We always knew we had to be unique and think outside the box with this,"" Mr Eledge, a public school teacher, added. Women over 34 refused IVF treatment Why I chose to go it alone with IVF UK law 'outdated' says surrogate mother Lea Yribe, Mr Dougherty's sister and Uma's egg donor, Mr Dougherty, Ms Eledge and Mr Eledge Mrs Eledge said the pregnancy was smooth throughout, the regular symptoms simply ""elevated a little bit"" compared to her previous pregnancies with her three children. In fact, the most obvious sign of her age came less than a week after Mrs Eledge was implanted with the embryo, when Mr Eledge and Mr Dougherty bought her a home pregnancy test to see if the transfer had been successful. ""We were told not to, but the boys couldn't wait,"" Mrs Eledge said, laughing. She looked at the test and was devastated to see the results were negative. But when Mr Eledge came over later that day to comfort her, he saw something she hadn't: a second pink line on the test, confirming a pregnancy. ""That was really a joyous moment,"" Mrs Eledge said, accompanied by jokes about her failing eyesight. ""She can't see anything, but she'll be able to deliver,"" Mrs Eledge recalls Mr Eledge and Mr Dougherty saying. Parents Elliot Dougherty and Matthew Eledge meet their daughter Uma Mrs Eledge said the response to her pregnancy has been mostly positive, accompanied by a slight ""shock factor,"" particularly for her two other children, Mr Eledge's siblings. ""When everyone got the full picture it was nothing but support,"" she said. But the pregnancy exposed some persistent markers of discrimination against LGBT families in Nebraska. Though gay marriage has been legal in the state since thelandmark Supreme Court decisionin 2015, Nebraska has no state laws banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. Up until 2017, the state maintained adecades-old ban,externalon gay and lesbian foster parents. Mrs Eledge said she fought, unsuccessfully, with her insurance company over health expenses that would have been covered if she was giving birth to her own child. And due to a law designating the person who delivers the baby as mother, Uma's birth certificate lists Mrs Eledge alongside her son, and excludes Mr Dougherty. ""This is just one small, micro example of the things that create road blocks for us,"" Mr Eledge said. Mr Eledge made headlines four years ago when he wasdismissed from his job,externalat Skutt Catholic High School after he informed school administrators that he and Mr Dougherty planned to get married. Baby Uma with parents Elliot Dougherty and Matthew Eledge Mr Eledge's treatment sparked outrage in his community, prompting parents and former and current students to create an online petition calling for an ""end to employment discrimination against Mr Eledge and future faculty"". Thepetition,external, now closed, garnered 102,995 supporters. Typically a private family, Mrs Eledge says they chose to share their story to counter these examples of ""hate"" towards LGBT individuals and families, and convey ""that there's always hope out there"". ""I'm learning not to take it personally,"" said Mr Eledge of the negative responses to him and his family. ""At the end of the day, we have a family, we have friends, we have a huge community that supports us."" The Eledge and Dougherty family on the day of Uma's birth And week after Uma's birth, Mrs Eledge says that she and her granddaughter are doing well. ""This little girl is surrounded by so much support, she's going to grow up in a loving family,"" Mrs Eledge said. ""This was how it was meant to be.""

Though gay marriage has been legal in the state since thelandmark Supreme Court decisionin 2015, Nebraska has no state laws banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. Up until 2017, the state maintained adecades-old ban,externalon gay and lesbian foster parents. Mrs Eledge said she fought, unsuccessfully, with her insurance company over health expenses that would have been covered if she was giving birth to her own child. And due to a law designating the person who delivers the baby as mother, Uma's birth certificate lists Mrs Eledge alongside her son, and excludes Mr Dougherty. ""This is just one small, micro example of the things that create road blocks for us,"" Mr Eledge said. Mr Eledge made headlines four years ago when he wasdismissed from his job,externalat Skutt Catholic High School after he informed school administrators that he and Mr Dougherty planned to get married. Baby Uma with parents Elliot Dougherty and Matthew Eledge Mr Eledge's treatment sparked outrage in his community, prompting parents and former and current students to create an online petition calling for an ""end to employment discrimination against Mr Eledge and future faculty"". Thepetition,external, now closed, garnered 102,995 supporters. Typically a private family, Mrs Eledge says they chose to share their story to counter these examples of ""hate"" towards LGBT individuals and families, and convey ""that there's always hope out there"". ""I'm learning not to take it personally,"" said Mr Eledge of the negative responses to him and his family. ""At the end of the day, we have a family, we have friends, we have a huge community that supports us."" The Eledge and Dougherty family on the day of Uma's birth And week after Uma's birth, Mrs Eledge says that she and her granddaughter are doing well. ""This little girl is surrounded by so much support, she's going to grow up in a loving family,"" Mrs Eledge said. ""This was how it was meant to be.""

"Asda overtakes Sainsbury's in sales rankingAsda is now the UK's second largest supermarket, overtaking its planned merger partner.Business","Asda has overtaken Sainsbury's to become the UK's second-largest supermarket, figures suggest. Asda's sales rose 0.1% in the 12 weeks to 24 March taking its market share to 15.4%,research firm Kantar said.,external In contrast, Sainsbury's sales fell 1.8% over the same period, meaning its market share dropped to 15.3%. The two supermarket groups are currently struggling to persuade the UK competition watchdog to allow their proposed Â£7bn merger to go ahead. Theduo have argued that the tie-upwill save them Â£1.6bn and allow them to pass on Â£1bn in price cuts to savers. They have also agreed to sell between 125 and 150 supermarkets and a number of convenience stores if allowed to merge. Sainsbury's and Asda offer to sell stores Asda sales slow amid 'challenging' trade According to Kantar's figures, Sainsbury's was the worst performer of all the big four supermarkets, which includes Tesco and Morrisons. Sainsbury's sales fall meant its performance lagged behind smaller rivals, such as Iceland and Co-op. Kantar said one reason for Sainsbury's sales slide was that much of its non-food was now sold via catalogue-retailer Argos, which the supermarket group bought in 2016. Argos sales are not included in Kantar's figures. Discounters Aldi and Lidl continued to expand their reach, with both expanding their market share to 8% and 5.6% respectively in the period. ""Thirteen million households visited Aldi at least once in the past 12 weeks - now more than those shopping at Morrisons,"" said Fraser McKevitt, consumer head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Overall, year-on-year supermarket sales over the 12 week period rose 1.4% - the slowest rate of growth since March last year, which was partly due to the late Easter meaning that Mother's Day fell outside the reported period, Kantar said. Despite Easter being later than usual, Kantar said its data showed that shoppers have already spent Â£146m on Easter eggs this year, while 42% of households had bought hot cross buns.

Man knifed near Edmonton stabbings scene,"There have been five stab attacks in the area in the last week A man has been stabbed in the same north London area as four people who were attacked at the weekend. The Met Police said the man, in his 30s, was in a life-threatening condition in hospital. The attack happened at 05:00 BST on Tuesday on Fairfield Road, Edmonton. The victim was found in the same street as the first weekend stabbing. A man in his 30s has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm over the latest attack. Police said the attacks had not been formally linked, but the description of the knifeman was similar. The victim is said to have been walking with a friend when he was attacked. He then made his way to Aberdeen Road, where he was found by police officers. The friend was not injured. Police arrested a man at about 10:00 at Edmonton Green. Employees at furniture store Dogtas saw the arrest taking place. ""A police car pulled up and four or five police officers sprinted over and arrested a man outside the window,"" said one employee. ""Two more police cars turned up as they went through his wallet - they looked like they were checking it was the right guy. ""The man didn't say anything for the whole time."" Over a period of 10 hours at the weekend, a woman and three men were attacked in what police described as a spate of ""cowardly and senseless"" attacks. They were all approached from behind and knifed as they walked alone in Edmonton. They were apparently selected at random, police said. The first victim, a 45-year-old woman, remains in a critical condition after she was attacked in Aberdeen Road at 19:02 GMT on Saturday. Four hours later, a 52-year-old man was stabbed half a mile away in Park Avenue. He has since been discharged from hospital. Vigilance urged after 'random' stabbings Four stabbed in 'random' knife attacks The next victim, a 23-year-old man, is in a critical condition after being attacked near Seven Sisters Tube station at about 04:00 BST on Sunday. The final stabbing happened at 09:42 in Brettenham Road where a 29-year-old man was attacked. He is receiving medical treatment, but his injuries are not life-threatening. One man, who was arrested on Sunday morning on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, has been released under investigation in connection with the attacks. Police have been given until Wednesday morning to question another man who was arrested on suspicion of the same offence on Sunday evening. Police said each victim appeared to be selected at random for being ""alone and vulnerable"" Det Supt Luke Marks said: ""I am aware that events from the weekend have caused a huge amount of worry and concern among the community, and that this incident will cause further alarm. ""While at this stage the incident has not yet been formally linked, the location and manner of this attack will be of concern to the public. ""Our advice continues that the public remain vigilant, and to contact police regarding anyone acting suspiciously."" Extra officers will be on patrol, he added. Mike Kalongi, 28, who lives nearby, said: ""I usually go to the gym at night, but over the last few days I decided not to. ""I'm going shopping. I usually have my headphones on but I want to stay aware and try not to be a victim. ""It's scary. It's really scary."" Ten charts on the rise of knife crime in England and Wales Met 'too stretched to investigate' murder case 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' Connor McCoy, 21, who also lives nearby, said he presumed it was a follow-on from what happened at the weekend. He still feels safe in the area, but said: ""I just hope that the slightly more defenceless people can feel safe living in this street. ""I hope that something happens, something to deal with knife crime.""

'Brits more likely to combine drugs with sex',"People in the UK are more likely to combine drugs with sex than those in the US, Canada, Australia or Europe, according to a survey. It found Brits, younger people and those on higher incomes were more likely to have chemsex. More than 22,000 people took part in the Global Drug Survey's research into substance-linked sex. It found alcohol, cannabis, MDMA and cocaine are the drugs most commonly used. Researchers say understanding people's drug use is important so that messages about the harm they can cause can be targeted to the way people live their lives. ""By engaging with your audience and accepting that drugs provide pleasure as well as harms, you can deliver harm reduction messages in a more trustworthy and nuanced manner,"" said lead author Dr Will Lawn. The report found alcohol was the most popular drug. Around 58% of men and 60% of women who took part in the survey said they'd drank before sex in the past year. But it's not just booze that's being consumed before Brits get intimate. The report states that people from the UK are most likely to have combined drugs such as cocaine, MDMA and mephedrone with sex. It describes the Brit's use of mephedrone - also known as meow meow - with sex as ""particularly striking"". Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

The report said that while people of all genders and sexual orientations had chemsex - gay and bisexual men were ""more likely to have done so"". It also found that ""homosexual men were 1.6 times as likely as heterosexual men to have used drugs with the specific intent of enhancing the sexual experience in the last year"". Dr Lawn, from the University College London, said that while chemsex is often associated with gay men, the study found ""men and women of all sexual orientations engaged in this behaviour"". ""Harm reduction messages relating to substance-linked sex in general should therefore not only be targeted towards gay and bisexual men, as they are relevant to all groups."" Marc Thompson, who leads health improvement at sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust, says combining drugs with sex can increase the chance of catching an STI. ""Drug use can lead to people taking risks during sex they wouldn't ordinarily take which increases the chances of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and why testing regularly is really important,"" he told Newsbeat. ""As this report highlights, drug use and sex is something that is not exclusive to gay and bisexual men but is something that happens across the wider population. ""Therefore it's vital that everyone knows the potential risks this can result in."" 14,050 of the people who responded to the survey were men, 65% of which identified as straight, 8.7% were gay and 6.7% were bisexual. 6,419 were women. 77.4% of these were straight, 15% were bisexual and 8.7% were gay. Some people didn't confirm their gender or sexuality. The people who responded to the survey were ""self-selecting rather than a representative sample"", the research noted. It means the number of people who said they combine drugs with sex will be ""substantially larger than the general population"". ""However, relative differences between groups are expected to be reliable,"" it added. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

Bookmakers pull new games after criticism,"New rules on fixed-odds betting terminals came into force this week Two leading UK bookmakers have pulled new high stakes betting games after a warning from the Gambling Commission. Paddy Power and Betfred faced criticism their roulette-style games undermined new rules on fixed-odds betting. The maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals was this week cut from Â£100 to Â£2, and the regulator warned against any attempts to circumvent the rules. Betfred said it wanted more talks with the commission, while Paddy Power said its game was only a limited trial. The Â£2 cap on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) was recommended by the Gambling Commission in March last year and is backed by the government as part of efforts to reduce gambling-related harm. The Betfred game involved two cyclists on a screen in shops racing on a velodrome track with numbers on it. When the cyclist at the rear catches the one in front, the number they are on is the winning number. The numbers are 1 to 36, mirroring those on a roulette wheel, and other bets can be placed on odd or even numbers, colours, rows and columns. Customers could bet up to Â£500. Paddy Power's game, with a maximum stake of Â£100 - the level before this week's FOBT rule-change -  also involved betting on numbers between 1 and 36. A Paddy Power spokesman said: ""This game was introduced as part of a short trial in a selection of shops. The trial was ceased within 24 hours of commencement and this product will not be launched across our estate."" Ahead of the commission's intervention, both firms drew fire from critics. Shadow culture minister Tom Watson described them as ""FOBTs through the back door"". Tracey Crouch MP, who resigned as sports minister over the delay in cutting FOBT stakes, said any attempt circumvent this week's changes to the maximum stakes ""would be morally irresponsible"". In a statement on Tuesday, Richard Watson, executive director for enforcement at the commission, said: ""We have been absolutely clear with operators about our expectations to act responsibly following the stake cut implementation this week. ""We have told operators to take down new products which undermine the changes, and we will investigate any other products that are not within the spirit and intention of the new rules.'' He said that a third bookmaker that was poised to launch a similar product to those at Paddy Power and Betfred had been warned against doing so. A Betfred spokesman said: ""We removed the virtual cycling game and all associated marketing at 10.30am this morning after discussions with the Gambling Commission.""

Banksy garage art to front new museum,"Owner John Brandler said the new museum will bring thousands of visitors to the town A Banksy artwork which appeared on a garage in Port Talbot will be part of an international street art museum in the town, the work's owner has said. John Brandler, who purchased Season's Greetings for a ""six-figure sum"" in January, will display the work in a new gallery in the centre of the town. He said the facility, which will feature work from around the world, will open later this year. Deputy culture minister Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas confirmed the move. 'I was happier before Banksy came' What happened to other Banksy works? Banksy mural moved to replica 'bridge' Mr Brandler said the museum, called SAM (Street Art Museum), will be just the sixth of its kind in the world and the first in the UK. It will be located at a recently renovated building in Ty'r Orsaf, opposite Port Talbot Parkway railway station. The graffiti artwork appeared on Ian Lewis's garage in December He said: ""It's going to be an international museum of street art. I'm talking to a couple of other artists who are among the same level as Banksy. ""The aim is to get people off the motorway and into the town, spending money."" He estimates 100,000 to 150,000 people will visit the museum every year. The museum will feature Season's Greetings and other works by Banksy, as well as pieces from Swansea-based street artist Pure Evil and French graffiti artist Blek le Rat. Mr Brandler said the work will remain in the town for at least three years and the museum will be free to local people and under-16s, but tourists will pay to see the collection. ""Banksy gave this piece to Port Talbot so people who live here don't have to pay to go to see it,"" he said. ""The idea is that tourists pay and then the money will be split between the museum, council and local charities."" Former steelworker Ian Lewis found the artwork on his garage in December He added the piece would ""not have stood the passage of time"" if it had remained in its original location - on steelworker Ian Lewis's garage in the Taibach area of the town. The move was confirmed in a letter from Lord Elis-Thomas to Bethan Sayed AM on Tuesday, saying the move to the town centre was the ""preferred option"" of the Welsh Government. He estimated it will take about five weeks for the work to be cut out of the garage and taken its new home in the town centre. Neath Port Talbot council said it was pleased to see the Welsh Government taking a lead on the project, adding it would help secure the artwork's future for three years. ""The new proposals have a huge potential to help deliver on the economic regeneration and tourism ambitions of everyone involved,"" the council said in a statement. ""However, no final decisions have yet been made and any progress will be largely dependent on further investment and support from the Welsh Government."" As many as 20,000 people visited the work on Mr Lewis's garage after it was painted in December, before it was bought by Mr Brandler a month later.

Glasgow Airport staff confirm 24-hour strike,"A 24-hour strike has been called at Glasgow Airport from 04:00 on 16 April Staff at Glasgow Airport have announced a 24-hour strike on 16 April. Unite members at the airport were balloted on strike action in a row over pay and pensions and 95% voted for industrial action. The union said almost 500 workers at the airport will take part in the strike between 04:00 on 16 of April and 04:00 the following day. Airport management say they will take steps to prevent any disruption to services. The dispute involves administrative and security staff - and won't affect check in desks, baggage handling or air traffic control. Unite also said its members were set to enforce an overtime ban between mid-April and mid-October. Glasgow Airport said its pay offer was fair and reasonable and that contingency plans were being put in place to avoid any disruption. The vote came after management made an annual pay offer of 1.8% and announced plans to close the final salary pension scheme. Unite claims the pay offer represents a real terms pay cut and the pension plan breaks a 2016 Acas agreement to keep the scheme open to existing members. The pension proposal has been made to staff at Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton airports, which are all part of AGS Airports Limited group. The results of the Aberdeen Airport staff ballot are expected within the next two weeks. Pat McIlvogue, Unite regional industrial officer, said: ""The overwhelming support for industrial action on a very high turnout shows the strength of feeling by hundreds of Unite members at Glasgow Airport. ""The workforce has been treated with disregard, contempt and disrespect. The paltry pay offer on the table is an insult while the boardroom enjoys pre-tax profits of Â£91m. ""If this wasn't bad enough, there is a proposal to close the final salary pension scheme at Glasgow Airport which breaks existing agreements we have with the company."" Unite members at Aberdeen will also be balloted on industrial action He added: ""So, while talks with Acas are scheduled over the coming weeks, I'm not confident at all that Glasgow Airport management has the awareness and sense to bring this dispute to a positive resolution. ""Industrial action is now set for the spring and summer period, and the public should know that Glasgow Airport is exclusively to blame for this situation."" But AGS said to suggest they have broken any agreements with Unite in regards to the company's pension arrangements is simply incorrect. A spokesman for the company said: ""We are extremely disappointed at the decision by the trade unions to take industrial action. We have made a pay offer that is entirely fair and reasonable against a backdrop of declining passenger numbers. ""The consultation on proposals to close our final salary (defined benefit) pension scheme is still ongoing, however, with employer contributions anticipated to rise significantly above the current level of 19.8% it is simply no longer affordable or sustainable. ""We are committed to continuing negotiations with the trade unions and have sought the intervention of the conciliation service Acas in attempt to achieve a sensible and sustainable outcome. In the event of strike action we will implement our contingency plans to avoid any disruption for our airlines and passengers."" Ken McLeod, president of the Scottish Passenger Agents' Association which represents Scotland's travel agents, said this development, plus the uncertainty of Brexit making passengers hesitant to travel, was not good news for the travelling public. He said: ""The added threat of industrial action at two of Scotland's main airports - Glasgow and Aberdeen - doesn't help in any circumstances, because whatever the rights and wrongs leading to this possible strike action, it doesn't do anyone any good.""

Grange Hill 'icon' Zammo to join EastEnders,"The actor who played Sammy ""Zammo"" McGuire in Grange Hill in the 1980s is to return to our screens as a new character in EastEnders. Child star Lee MacDonald, who's now 50, rose to fame more than 30 years ago as the loveable Zammo, a character who later ran into drug problems. MacDonald will appear on the BBC One soap in two episodes this spring. He'll play a bus driver, who takes on Mick Carter - played by Danny Dyer - in a radio competition to win gig tickets. MacDonald, who after subsequent small roles in The Bill and Birds of a Feather, quit acting to run a south London locksmith and key-cutting firm, said: ""I am absolutely chuffed to bits and so excited to be briefly joining the cast of EastEnders. ""I can't say too much yet but watch this space. Top banana!"" Zammo at his lowest drugs ebb In 1986, MacDonald was involved in one of the most memorable scenes in children's TV history. This was after Zammo, who had previously overdosed on heroin in the back room of the amusement arcade where his friend Roland worked, came back to school - apparently clean - but was caught by friends trying to hide drugs in a toilet cistern. The storyline was intended to warn children off substance abuse and as part of the campaign the cast of the show also had a top five UK chart hit with their anti-drugs charity track, Just Say No. MacDonald (l) and Grange Hill cast members meet Nancy Reagan at the White House in 1986 The Grange Hill gang were then swiftly invited to the USA to perform the LaToya Jackson cover at the Yankee Stadium in New York. They were even praised by then US First Lady Nancy Reagan on a trip to the White House. After decades out of the spotlight, MacDonald appeared on the BBC's Celebrity Scissorhands and in a child stars edition of Pointless Celebrities. Lee MacDonald on Pointless Celebrities in 2018 Reacting to the news of his return, TV critic Emma Bullimore tells the BBC that while the name Zammo may mean nothing to younger viewers, the inclusion of an ""absolute '80s icon"" in another of the nation's best-loved shows will be of great interest and excitement to older ones. ""I think it's difficult if you weren't around at that time to think now about how big a kids TV programme could be,"" says Bullimore. ""Now we live in an age of Netflix and all these different channels and so many choices, but when you had only a few channels, ratings for shows used to be so much bigger and the most popular character within a huge show was an real icon and someone that people really cared about and got excited about seeing on TV. ""It's going to be a massive nostalgia trip for that generation to see that actor grown-up and being in another classic show."" MacDonald and co record Just Say No The fictional path from Northam to Walford has been a fairly well-trodden one for actors down the years, but Bullimore believes the length of time between MacDonald's two big roles adds greater significance. ""Grange Hill and Byker Grove were both massive at the time and spawned loads of people that went on to be in big shows,"" she adds. ""So loads of people we were familiar with as kids then became part of shows we watched as adults. Lee MacDonald and Erkan Mustafa on playing Zammo and Roland in Grange Hill. ""It was kind of like Grange Hill was a training ground for EastEnders in a way, but it's a slightly different case with Zammo as there's been a big gap. ""I think he hasn't been doing that much acting - a few bit parts here and there - and certainly sounds like he's excited to be back and it'll be interesting to see if he's going to do any more."" Zammo (right) in Grange Hill She certainly wouldn't rule out further episodes if MacDonald's on-screen comedy music battle with Dyer captures the imagination: ""It's supposed to be for a couple of episodes, although in soap history we've seen many [one-off] episodes lead to more."" As Zammo prepares to go on the buses, let's take a quick look back at a few of the other Grange Hill kids who went on to became regulars in the Queen Vic. Young Tully played Grange Hill schoolgirl Suzanne Ross for three years in the early '80s, before leaving the show to go to college (or so she thought). In 1985, however, at the age of 17, she secured the role of Michelle Fowler in the then brand new soap opera EastEnders, where she would remain until 1995. Her character became pregnant at the age of 16 after having an affair with ""Dirty"" Den Watts. Tully returned to Walford in the director's chair for 12 episodes in the late '90s but she repeatedly turned down offers to reprise her role as Michelle, which was eventually recast with Jenna Russell in 2016. Carty arrived on screens in Grange Hill in 1978, playing the rebellious Tucker Jenkins. He was one of the few characters to get his own spin-off show in the form of Tucker's Luck, which followed him from his unruly school days to the dole queue. In 1990, Carty took over the role of Susan Tully's on-screen brother Mark Fowler in EastEnders.  His casting followed the death of the original actor, David Scarboro. His character was diagnosed with HIV, and died off-screen in 2004. Actor turned R&B singer Gayle first came to public attention in Grange Hill as Fiona Wilson, who was one half of the school's rap duo Fresh 'n' Fly. A few years later, she took on the role of Hattie Tavernier in 'Enders. The Taverniers were the first black family to join the soap at the same time. Hattie worked as Ian Beale's personal assistant in the show, and also suffered a miscarriage after her fiancÃ© Steve abandoned her. Clearly not over Fresh 'n' Fly, Gayle quit the soap in 1993 to pursue a full-time career in music, where she went on to score seven UK top 40 singles. Her highest-placed tune, pop pickers, was 1994'sSweetness,external- which peaked at number four. And finally, who could forget Sean Maguire? He played ""Tegs"" Ratcliffe in Grange Hill from 1988 to 1992. In EastEnders though, he became Aidan Brosnan, a young Irish footballer playing for the fictional Walford FC. Maguire left the show (and the team) to take on the starring role in another BBC drama series, Dangerfield, in 1994. He recently had a recurring role in the long-running ABC series Once upon a Time, taking over the part of Robin Hood from Miranda star and former EastEnders doctor Tom Ellis.

EU 'will not be hostage to Brexit',"Mr Macron, right, told reporters that France and Ireland would be the countries most affected by a no-deal outcome The European Union will not be hostage to a ""political crisis"" in the UK, France's president has said. Emmanuel Macron was speaking in Paris during talks with Irish PM Leo Varadkar. ""We will never abandon Ireland or the Irish people no matter what happens, because this solidarity is the very purpose of the European project,"" said Mr Macron. Mr Varadkar said any Brexit extension needed ""a clear purpose, clear plan"". Their meeting came after MPs twice rejected Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal deal, with the government now ramping up plans for a no-deal scenario. Mr Varadkar said he would also discuss the Republic of Ireland's no-deal plans with Mr Macron. The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) emphasised that the EU should be open to any ""credible proposals"" the UK put forward about in the Brexit process. No-deal Brexit can still be avoided - Barnier MPs fail to back Brexit proposals again Brexit: What could happen next? What does a soft Brexit mean? Mr Macron told reporters that France and Ireland would be the countries most affected by a no-deal outcome. They both said the integrity of the single market would need to be protected, but that the EU would uphold commitments made to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement. Mr Varadkar's visit to France comes ahead of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's trip to Dublin on Thursday. German Chancellor Angel Merkel is due to visit Dublin on Thursday He said the EU would need to seriously consider how to respond to any request from the UK for a longer extension, in order to avoid leaving with no deal on 12 April. Mr Varadkar said that it would come with conditions, requiring the UK to take part in European elections on 23 May. Mairead McGuinness, vice-president of the European Parliament and Fine Gael MEP, said that a no deal does not solve problems for those who would advocate for a hard Brexit. ""There's a view that a no deal would be a forever state of play from those that would argue for it, but frankly it's not,"" she said. ""Immediately afterwards I believe the UK would need to come to the EU and ask to speak and negotiate."" Mr Varadkar is expected to return from Paris on Tuesday evening and hold a meeting of his cabinet. Earlier on Tuesday,Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, said a no-deal Brexit is now more likely but can still be avoided. The DUP still want changes made to the backstop The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) voted against all four options tabled on Monday. The party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said if the Irish border backstop was addressed, the DUP could ""do business"" with the government. Speaking after the indicative votes, Mr Dodds said the only proposition that MPs had ever supported was an amendment - known as the Brady amendment - calling on the government to negotiate changes to the backstop. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The backstop is the insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland, unless and until another solution is found. The DUP and some Brexiteer MPs oppose it because if it took effect, it would keep Northern Ireland only tied to some EU regulatory rules, and would keep the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU. On Monday night, independent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Hermon, backed two of the options. She voted for another referendum and to revoke article 50, but against a customs union or single market arrangement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will visit Dublin on Thursday, as pressure mounts over Parliament's failure to ratify the withdrawal agreement. The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 12 April, if it cannot propose a way forward to the EU. An extraordinary EU summit is due to take place on 10 April. Mr Varadkar said he would discuss with his French and German counterparts how the European Council should respond to a request for another extension from the UK, to seek a delay to the Brexit process.

The Commons in numbers,"The House of Commons continues to struggle to break the Brexit deadlock. MPs have rejected the UK's withdrawal agreement with the EU three times and have twice voted down all the alternative options put forward. An explanation for this stalemate can be found not only in MPs' deeply-held and divergent views on Europe but also in the fluid political make-up of the House of Commons. The DUP have supported the Conservatives since 2017 but will their agreement survive Brexit? No political party won a majority at the 2017 election, which resulted in a Hung Parliament. After the poll, the Conservatives agreed a parliamentary pact - officially known as a confidence and supply agreement - with the Democratic Unionists. This arrangement gave Theresa May's government an overall majority of six - in other words, the Tories and DUP had six more MPs elected than all the other parties combined. But in reality it had what is called a working majority of 13. That's because Sinn Fein - which currently has seven MPs - historically does not take up its seats. Excluding Commons Speaker John Bercow and his non-voting deputies, Tory Eleanor Laing and Labour's Lindsay Hoyle and Dame Rosie Winterton, Theresa May has typically needed to get the backing of 320 MPs to get a majority in Commons votes. For the first year or so, the government got its legislation through Parliament quite comfortably but as Mrs May has found to her cost, things have become much more problematic in recent months. Anna Soubry (centre) and Sarah Wollaston (right) are among those to have left the Conservatives The government's already slim working majority - the smallest of any new government since the 1970s - has been further whittled down this year. In January, three Conservative members of Parliament - Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry - quit the party to join the Independent Group of MPs. Then on Monday, former minister Nick Boles resigned the Conservative whip over Brexit and said he would be sitting as an Independent Progressive Conservative. Labour has suffered its own casualties - losing more than a dozen MPs As it stands, Theresa May currently has a working majority of six. This will fall to five if Labour wins the Newport West by-election on Thursday. The seat has been vacant since the death of Paul Flynn in February. Labour has held the seat since 1987 and Mr Flynn re-gained it with a majority of 5,658 two years ago. Brexit: What could happen next? MPs reject May's EU withdrawal agreement Brexit: What could happen next? No deal now more likely - Barnier The Conservatives are still the largest party by far in the House of Commons, with 312 MPs. Their direct numerical lead over Labour, the second largest party, has actually grown since 2017. After the last election, it stood at 55 seats. Now it is 68. That's because Labour, which currently has 243 MPs, has suffered a slew of defections of their own. Eight of their MPs left to join the Independent Group while another five - Ivan Lewis, John Woodcock, Jared O'Mara, Frank Field and Ian Austin - have quit the party for a variety of reasons and are now sitting as independents. Fiona Onasanya was expelled after being jailed for perverting the course of justice while Kelvin Hopkins and Chris Williamson are currently suspended pending internal inquiries into their conduct. With the DUP opposed to her agreement and Tory MPs increasingly prepared to defy the whip, Theresa May has no real majority to speak of for her Brexit policy. As well as the three defeats on the withdrawal agreement, the government has been left red-faced on numerous other occasions, even losing control of the House during the indicative votes process. When it has won key votes, it has often only done so by the skin of its teeth. The government is opposed by a broad coalition of Labour, SNP, Lib Dem, Plaid Cymru and Green MPs who are pushing for a different kind of exit, or who want to remain in the EU. While some of the newly-independent MPs, including ex-Liberal Democrat Stephen Lloyd, have sided with Mrs May over Brexit, most have not while the Independent Group has voted as a bloc against the PM. Jeremy Corbyn tabled a no-confidence motion in the government in January, shortly after its first defeat on Theresa May's Brexit deal. Every single Conservative MP at the time supported the government, as did the Democratic Unionists, as the government survived by a margin of 325 to 306 votes. But the result could be a lot closer if the Labour leader chooses to repeat the exercise again. Not only do the Conservatives have fewer MPs but leading Tory Brexiteers have warned the PM their support cannot be taken for granted if they think the future of Brexit is under threat. And the DUP have said they will use all means to oppose the withdrawal agreement in its current form.

Asda overtakes Sainsbury's in sales ranking,"Asda has overtaken Sainsbury's to become the UK's second-largest supermarket, figures suggest. Asda's sales rose 0.1% in the 12 weeks to 24 March taking its market share to 15.4%,research firm Kantar said.,external In contrast, Sainsbury's sales fell 1.8% over the same period, meaning its market share dropped to 15.3%. The two supermarket groups are currently struggling to persuade the UK competition watchdog to allow their proposed Â£7bn merger to go ahead. Theduo have argued that the tie-upwill save them Â£1.6bn and allow them to pass on Â£1bn in price cuts to savers. They have also agreed to sell between 125 and 150 supermarkets and a number of convenience stores if allowed to merge. Sainsbury's and Asda offer to sell stores Asda sales slow amid 'challenging' trade According to Kantar's figures, Sainsbury's was the worst performer of all the big four supermarkets, which includes Tesco and Morrisons. Sainsbury's sales fall meant its performance lagged behind smaller rivals, such as Iceland and Co-op. Kantar said one reason for Sainsbury's sales slide was that much of its non-food was now sold via catalogue-retailer Argos, which the supermarket group bought in 2016. Argos sales are not included in Kantar's figures. Discounters Aldi and Lidl continued to expand their reach, with both expanding their market share to 8% and 5.6% respectively in the period. ""Thirteen million households visited Aldi at least once in the past 12 weeks - now more than those shopping at Morrisons,"" said Fraser McKevitt, consumer head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Overall, year-on-year supermarket sales over the 12 week period rose 1.4% - the slowest rate of growth since March last year, which was partly due to the late Easter meaning that Mother's Day fell outside the reported period, Kantar said. Despite Easter being later than usual, Kantar said its data showed that shoppers have already spent Â£146m on Easter eggs this year, while 42% of households had bought hot cross buns.

"Ex-Tory MP hits out at 'cowardly' cabinetNick Boles says no-one around Theresa May has ""earned the right"" to succeed her as prime minister.UK Politics","This video can not be played Nick Boles: Theresa May is 'splitting the country' Former Conservative MP Nick Boles has accused the cabinet of being ""cowardly and selfish"" for failing to challenge Theresa May's approach to Brexit. Mr Boles, who quit the parliamentary party on Monday, said the PM had ""misunderstood and mismanaged"" the whole process of leaving the EU. And he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg no-one in the cabinet ""had earned the right"" to succeed her. The Tory Party ""did not really exist any more"", he also suggested. Mr Boles was part of a cross-party group of MPs co-ordinating efforts to find a compromise in Parliament around a Brexit proposal that would retain access to the single market. After his Common Market 2.0 plan was rejected by MPs for the second time on Monday, he accused his party of ""failing to compromise"". He said he could no longer represent them in the Commons and would sit as an independent. This video can not be played Nick Boles: ""I have failed, chiefly, because my party refuses to compromise"" Mr Boles, the MP for Grantham and Stamford, told the BBC his former party was gripped by a combination of ""cowardice and dogma"". He said the prime minister had been totally preoccupied with the wishes of her party and had never attempted to ""construct or understand what a deal would look like to bring the country together"". Senior ministers had shown a ""collective failure to lead and unite"" and had ""all put their interests first"". ""There are fine people in cabinet but this is the worst cabinet in recorded history,"" he said. ""None has earned the right to lead the country after Brexit."" He suggested Brexit would be the equivalent of a ""meteor strike"" on the British political system and none of the major parties would be immune from the repercussions. But he also admitted that MPs who wanted closer economic links with the EU had failed to coalesce early enough around an alternative to the PM's deal and had ""missed the boat"". The MP quit his local constituency party last month amid a campaign by some party members to deselect him as their candidate for the next election.

Bookmakers pull new games after criticismPaddy Power and Betfred were accused of trying to circumvent new rules on fixed-odds betting terminals.,"New rules on fixed-odds betting terminals came into force this week Two leading UK bookmakers have pulled new high stakes betting games after a warning from the Gambling Commission. Paddy Power and Betfred faced criticism their roulette-style games undermined new rules on fixed-odds betting. The maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals was this week cut from Â£100 to Â£2, and the regulator warned against any attempts to circumvent the rules. Betfred said it wanted more talks with the commission, while Paddy Power said its game was only a limited trial. The Â£2 cap on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) was recommended by the Gambling Commission in March last year and is backed by the government as part of efforts to reduce gambling-related harm. The Betfred game involved two cyclists on a screen in shops racing on a velodrome track with numbers on it. When the cyclist at the rear catches the one in front, the number they are on is the winning number. The numbers are 1 to 36, mirroring those on a roulette wheel, and other bets can be placed on odd or even numbers, colours, rows and columns. Customers could bet up to Â£500. Paddy Power's game, with a maximum stake of Â£100 - the level before this week's FOBT rule-change -  also involved betting on numbers between 1 and 36. A Paddy Power spokesman said: ""This game was introduced as part of a short trial in a selection of shops. The trial was ceased within 24 hours of commencement and this product will not be launched across our estate."" Ahead of the commission's intervention, both firms drew fire from critics. Shadow culture minister Tom Watson described them as ""FOBTs through the back door"". Tracey Crouch MP, who resigned as sports minister over the delay in cutting FOBT stakes, said any attempt circumvent this week's changes to the maximum stakes ""would be morally irresponsible"". In a statement on Tuesday, Richard Watson, executive director for enforcement at the commission, said: ""We have been absolutely clear with operators about our expectations to act responsibly following the stake cut implementation this week. ""We have told operators to take down new products which undermine the changes, and we will investigate any other products that are not within the spirit and intention of the new rules.'' He said that a third bookmaker that was poised to launch a similar product to those at Paddy Power and Betfred had been warned against doing so. A Betfred spokesman said: ""We removed the virtual cycling game and all associated marketing at 10.30am this morning after discussions with the Gambling Commission.""

Man knifed near Edmonton stabbings sceneA man was found stabbed on a street where one of four people was knifed in London at the weekend.London,"There have been five stab attacks in the area in the last week A man has been stabbed in the same north London area as four people who were attacked at the weekend. The Met Police said the man, in his 30s, was in a life-threatening condition in hospital. The attack happened at 05:00 BST on Tuesday on Fairfield Road, Edmonton. The victim was found in the same street as the first weekend stabbing. A man in his 30s has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm over the latest attack. Police said the attacks had not been formally linked, but the description of the knifeman was similar. The victim is said to have been walking with a friend when he was attacked. He then made his way to Aberdeen Road, where he was found by police officers. The friend was not injured. Police arrested a man at about 10:00 at Edmonton Green. Employees at furniture store Dogtas saw the arrest taking place. ""A police car pulled up and four or five police officers sprinted over and arrested a man outside the window,"" said one employee. ""Two more police cars turned up as they went through his wallet - they looked like they were checking it was the right guy. ""The man didn't say anything for the whole time."" Over a period of 10 hours at the weekend, a woman and three men were attacked in what police described as a spate of ""cowardly and senseless"" attacks. They were all approached from behind and knifed as they walked alone in Edmonton. They were apparently selected at random, police said. The first victim, a 45-year-old woman, remains in a critical condition after she was attacked in Aberdeen Road at 19:02 GMT on Saturday. Four hours later, a 52-year-old man was stabbed half a mile away in Park Avenue. He has since been discharged from hospital. Vigilance urged after 'random' stabbings Four stabbed in 'random' knife attacks The next victim, a 23-year-old man, is in a critical condition after being attacked near Seven Sisters Tube station at about 04:00 BST on Sunday. The final stabbing happened at 09:42 in Brettenham Road where a 29-year-old man was attacked. He is receiving medical treatment, but his injuries are not life-threatening. One man, who was arrested on Sunday morning on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, has been released under investigation in connection with the attacks. Police have been given until Wednesday morning to question another man who was arrested on suspicion of the same offence on Sunday evening. Police said each victim appeared to be selected at random for being ""alone and vulnerable"" Det Supt Luke Marks said: ""I am aware that events from the weekend have caused a huge amount of worry and concern among the community, and that this incident will cause further alarm. ""While at this stage the incident has not yet been formally linked, the location and manner of this attack will be of concern to the public. ""Our advice continues that the public remain vigilant, and to contact police regarding anyone acting suspiciously."" Extra officers will be on patrol, he added. Mike Kalongi, 28, who lives nearby, said: ""I usually go to the gym at night, but over the last few days I decided not to. ""I'm going shopping.

Canada 'warming faster than rest of world',"Canada's Arctic is warming faster than southern Canada Canada is warming on average at a rate twice as fast as the rest of the world, a new scientific report indicates. The federal government climate report,externalalso warns that changes are already evident in many parts of the country and are projected to intensify. Canada's Arctic has seen the deepest impact and will continue to warm at more than double the global rate. The report suggests that many of the effects already seen are probably irreversible. Canada's annual average temperature has warmed by an estimated 1.7C (3F) since 1948, when nationwide temperatures were first recorded. The largest temperature increases have been seen in the North, the Prairies, and in northern British Columbia. Annual average temperature in northern Canada increased by approximately 2.3C. Drilling climate history in 'Iceberg Alley' Saving the planet: The next move Climate change impacts 'accelerating' ""While both human activities and natural variations in the climate have contributed to the observed warming in Canada, the human factor is dominant,"" the report states. ""It is likely that more than half of the observed warming in Canada is due to the influence of human activities."" The report came as the government imposed carbon taxes on four of Canada's 10 provinces for failing to introduce their own plans for tackling climate change. The effects of global warming on Canada's environment include more extreme weather. Hotter temperatures could mean more heat waves and a higher risk of wildfires and droughts in some parts of the country. Oceans are expected to become more acidic and less oxygenated, which could harm marine life. This video can not be played What is global warming? Parts of Canada's Arctic Ocean are projected to have extensive ice-free periods during summer within a few decades. A rise in sea levels could also increase the risk of coastal flooding and more intense rainfall could cause problems with flooding in urban centres. Canada's rapid warming is due to a number of factors, including a loss of snow and sea ice, which is increasing the absorption of solar radiation and causing larger surface warming than in other regions, according to the report. Despite the bleak projections, the report notes that the amount of warming could be limited if global action is taken by drastically reducing ""carbon emissions to near zero early in the second half of the century and [reducing] emissions of other greenhouse gases substantially"". What is in the Paris climate agreement? Cyclone Idai and the climate connection Canada is one of nearly 200 countries that have signed on to the Paris Agreement - a single global agreement on tackling climate change that seeks to keep temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C. The Canadian government says it will meet the Paris target of cutting emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 despite the fact that a number of official reports indicate the country is unlikely to meet its reduction targets without significant effort. University of Toronto professor Matthew Hoffmann told the BBC that, like the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, this one underscores the warnings about the impact of climate change. ""This is yet another reaffirmation of the urgency of this problem,"" he said. Civil society appeared to be at a ""tipping point"" on the issue with public opinion moving in support of governments taking action. Students in Quebec were among thousands protesting around the world in March Mr Hoffmann points to recent student protests in the UK, Canada and elsewhere pushing for governments to take active steps to tackle the problem. ""People are starting to feel climate change - it's starting to be part of their lived experience,"" he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned the country's provinces two years ago that they needed to come up with plans by 1 April setting out how they would contribute to Canada's reduction targets. The four that the government accuses of failing to do so are Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. The carbon tax will be added to the cost of fuel - 4.4 Canadian cents (3.6 US cents) per litre initially - equivalent to 20 Canadian dollars per tonne of carbon produced, more than doubling by 2022. However, households are expected to be compensated by the federal government in the form of ""climate action incentive"" rebates. The opposition Conservatives have vowed to scrap the tax should they win federal elections in October.

YouTube restricts Tommy Robinson channel,"Social media platforms have steadily restricted how Mr Robinson can use them YouTube has placed more restrictions around the video channel of English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson. Clips uploaded by Mr Robinson have been removed from search results and he is blocked from streaming live events via the site. Messages warning that his videos may not be appropriate for all viewers will also play before clips. YouTube had already, in January, decided tosuspend adverts on Mr Robinson's channel. It had imposed the further restrictions after talking to external experts and academic researchers about the types of videos shown on the channel,reported Buzzfeed.,external ""We are applying a tougher treatment to Tommy Robinson's channel in keeping with our policies on borderline content,"" it told the news site. Buzzfeed said the steps taken by YouTube would make Mr Robinson's videos ""undiscoverable"" unless followers sought them out specifically. The latest action comes after politicians called on YouTube to follow other social media companies in limiting the exposure Mr Robinson enjoyed on their platforms. Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has also had pages on Facebook and Instagram removed. Last year, he was banned from Twitter and Paypal ceased processing payments on his behalf.

MPs push to prevent no-deal Brexit in law,"This video can not be played Yvette Cooper: ""We're in a very dangerous situation"" A cross-party group of MPs has put forward a bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit in 10 days' time. If passed into law, the bill would require the PM to ask for an extension of Article 50 - which mandates the UK's exit from the EU - beyond the current 12 April deadline. Labour MP Yvette Cooper presented the bill - which supporters hope they can pass through the Commons in one day. The prime minister is expected to make a statement shortly. It comes after the cabinet, which remains split over Brexit, met for eight hours in No 10. The BBC's John Pienaar said Theresa May's ministers considered plans to ""ramp up"" no-deal Brexit preparations and a snap general election was also discussed. What could happen next? How did my MP vote on Brexit options? Ms Cooper's bill would make it UK law for the PM to ask for an extension to prevent a no-deal, but it would be up to the EU to grant it - or not. In March,MPs voted against leaving the EU without a deal, but it was not legally binding. Meanwhile, the EU's chief negotiator has said a no-deal Brexit is now more likely but can still be avoided. Michel Barnier said a long extension to the UK's 12 April exit date had ""significant risks for the EU"" and a ""strong justification would be needed"". France's President Emmanuel Macron and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar are meeting in Paris to discuss the impact of Brexit. This video can not be played Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the EU should be open to any ""credible proposals"" the UK put forward President Macron told reporters that the EU ""cannot be hostage to the political crisis in the UK"", and the government must come forward with ""credible"" reasons for an extension. He said these could include an election, second referendum, or alternative proposals for the future relationship, such as a customs union. Mr Varadkar said the UK was ""consumed by Brexit"", but the EU should not be. He said the EU ""needs to be open"" about any proposals the UK brings, including a longer extension, and they will do what they can to ""assist"". But he added: ""We gave the UK some time, some space and some opportunity to come up with a way forward... [but] as things stand, they will leave on 12 April without a deal."" Brexit deadlock: The Commons in numbers EU 'will not be hostage to Brexit crisis' What does a soft Brexit mean? Ex-Tory MP hits out at 'cowardly' cabinet Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who supports Ms Cooper's bill, said: ""This is a last-ditch attempt to prevent our country being exposed to the risks inherent in a no-deal exit. ""We realise this is difficult. But it is definitely worth trying."" Ms Cooper said the UK was ""in a very dangerous situation"" and MPs ""have a responsibility to make sure we don't end up with a catastrophic no deal"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One, she added: ""We have been attempting to squeeze into just a couple of days a process that really should have been happening for the last two years - a process of trying to build a consensus around the best way forward. ""It is what the prime minister should be doing. It is the prime minister's responsibility to ensure we don't leave the country less safe."" Normally the government chooses which bills to present to Parliament in order for them to become law. But - much to the government's disapproval - MPs voted to allow backbenchers to take charge of business in the Commons on Wednesday. This gives backbenchers the opportunity to table their own bills, such as this one from Yvette Cooper. A copy of the bill shows that they want to push it through the commons in one day. As the backbenchers will be in charge, they will also be able to vote to set aside more time on another day, if they need to complete the process or hold further indicative votes. However, the bill would also have to be agreed by the House of Lords and receive Royal Assent before it became law - which if the Commons agrees it on Wednesday, could happen as soon as Thursday. Brexiteer Tory Sir Bill Cash said trying to go through these stages in one day made it a ""reprehensible procedure"". But Speaker John Bercow said that, while it was ""an unusual state of affairs"", it was ""not as unprecedented as he supposes"" - citing recent bills on Northern Ireland that have been passed at the same speed. In the latest round of indicative votes on Monday,MPs voted on four alternativesto the PM's withdrawal deal, but none gained a majority. MPs rejected a customs union with the EU by three votes. A motion for another referendum got the most votes in favour, but still lost. The votes were not legally binding, but they had been billed as the moment when Parliament might finally compromise. The Independent MP Chris Leslie tweeted that MPs would be seeking more time for indicative votes to take place on Monday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb said he is considering resigning the whip after his party refused to back proposals for a customs union and Common Market 2.0 on Monday.

EU 'will not be hostage to Brexit crisis',"Mr Macron, right, told reporters that France and Ireland would be the countries most affected by a no-deal outcome The European Union will not be hostage to a ""political crisis"" in the UK, France's president has said. Emmanuel Macron was speaking in Paris during talks with Irish PM Leo Varadkar. ""We will never abandon Ireland or the Irish people no matter what happens, because this solidarity is the very purpose of the European project,"" said Mr Macron. Mr Varadkar said any Brexit extension needed ""a clear purpose, clear plan"". Their meeting came after MPs twice rejected Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal deal, with the government now ramping up plans for a no-deal scenario. Mr Varadkar said he would also discuss the Republic of Ireland's no-deal plans with Mr Macron. The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) emphasised that the EU should be open to any ""credible proposals"" the UK put forward about in the Brexit process. No-deal Brexit can still be avoided - Barnier MPs fail to back Brexit proposals again Brexit: What could happen next? What does a soft Brexit mean? Mr Macron told reporters that France and Ireland would be the countries most affected by a no-deal outcome. They both said the integrity of the single market would need to be protected, but that the EU would uphold commitments made to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement. Mr Varadkar's visit to France comes ahead of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's trip to Dublin on Thursday. German Chancellor Angel Merkel is due to visit Dublin on Thursday He said the EU would need to seriously consider how to respond to any request from the UK for a longer extension, in order to avoid leaving with no deal on 12 April. Mr Varadkar said that it would come with conditions, requiring the UK to take part in European elections on 23 May. Mairead McGuinness, vice-president of the European Parliament and Fine Gael MEP, said that a no deal does not solve problems for those who would advocate for a hard Brexit. ""There's a view that a no deal would be a forever state of play from those that would argue for it, but frankly it's not,"" she said. ""Immediately afterwards I believe the UK would need to come to the EU and ask to speak and negotiate."" Mr Varadkar is expected to return from Paris on Tuesday evening and hold a meeting of his cabinet. Earlier on Tuesday,Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, said a no-deal Brexit is now more likely but can still be avoided. The DUP still want changes made to the backstop The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) voted against all four options tabled on Monday. The party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said if the Irish border backstop was addressed, the DUP could ""do business"" with the government. Speaking after the indicative votes, Mr Dodds said the only proposition that MPs had ever supported was an amendment - known as the Brady amendment - calling on the government to negotiate changes to the backstop. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The backstop is the insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland, unless and until another solution is found. The DUP and some Brexiteer MPs oppose it because if it took effect, it would keep Northern Ireland only tied to some EU regulatory rules, and would keep the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU. On Monday night, independent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Hermon, backed two of the options. She voted for another referendum and to revoke article 50, but against a customs union or single market arrangement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will visit Dublin on Thursday, as pressure mounts over Parliament's failure to ratify the withdrawal agreement. The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 12 April, if it cannot propose a way forward to the EU. An extraordinary EU summit is due to take place on 10 April. Mr Varadkar said he would discuss with his French and German counterparts how the European Council should respond to a request for another extension from the UK, to seek a delay to the Brexit process.

Brexit deadlock: The Commons in numbers,"The House of Commons continues to struggle to break the Brexit deadlock. MPs have rejected the UK's withdrawal agreement with the EU three times and have twice voted down all the alternative options put forward. An explanation for this stalemate can be found not only in MPs' deeply-held and divergent views on Europe but also in the fluid political make-up of the House of Commons. The DUP have supported the Conservatives since 2017 but will their agreement survive Brexit? No political party won a majority at the 2017 election, which resulted in a Hung Parliament. After the poll, the Conservatives agreed a parliamentary pact - officially known as a confidence and supply agreement - with the Democratic Unionists. This arrangement gave Theresa May's government an overall majority of six - in other words, the Tories and DUP had six more MPs elected than all the other parties combined. But in reality it had what is called a working majority of 13. That's because Sinn Fein - which currently has seven MPs - historically does not take up its seats. Excluding Commons Speaker John Bercow and his non-voting deputies, Tory Eleanor Laing and Labour's Lindsay Hoyle and Dame Rosie Winterton, Theresa May has typically needed to get the backing of 320 MPs to get a majority in Commons votes. For the first year or so, the government got its legislation through Parliament quite comfortably but as Mrs May has found to her cost, things have become much more problematic in recent months. Anna Soubry (centre) and Sarah Wollaston (right) are among those to have left the Conservatives The government's already slim working majority - the smallest of any new government since the 1970s - has been further whittled down this year. In January, three Conservative members of Parliament - Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry - quit the party to join the Independent Group of MPs. Then on Monday, former minister Nick Boles resigned the Conservative whip over Brexit and said he would be sitting as an Independent Progressive Conservative. Labour has suffered its own casualties - losing more than a dozen MPs As it stands, Theresa May currently has a working majority of six. This will fall to five if Labour wins the Newport West by-election on Thursday. The seat has been vacant since the death of Paul Flynn in February. Labour has held the seat since 1987 and Mr Flynn re-gained it with a majority of 5,658 two years ago. Brexit: What could happen next? MPs reject May's EU withdrawal agreement Brexit: What could happen next? No deal now more likely - Barnier The Conservatives are still the largest party by far in the House of Commons, with 312 MPs. Their direct numerical lead over Labour, the second largest party, has actually grown since 2017. After the last election, it stood at 55 seats. Now it is 68. That's because Labour, which currently has 243 MPs, has suffered a slew of defections of their own. Eight of their MPs left to join the Independent Group while another five - Ivan Lewis, John Woodcock, Jared O'Mara, Frank Field and Ian Austin - have quit the party for a variety of reasons and are now sitting as independents. Fiona Onasanya was expelled after being jailed for perverting the course of justice while Kelvin Hopkins and Chris Williamson are currently suspended pending internal inquiries into their conduct. With the DUP opposed to her agreement and Tory MPs increasingly prepared to defy the whip, Theresa May has no real majority to speak of for her Brexit policy. As well as the three defeats on the withdrawal agreement, the government has been left red-faced on numerous other occasions, even losing control of the House during the indicative votes process. When it has won key votes, it has often only done so by the skin of its teeth. The government is opposed by a broad coalition of Labour, SNP, Lib Dem, Plaid Cymru and Green MPs who are pushing for a different kind of exit, or who want to remain in the EU. While some of the newly-independent MPs, including ex-Liberal Democrat Stephen Lloyd, have sided with Mrs May over Brexit, most have not while the Independent Group has voted as a bloc against the PM. Jeremy Corbyn tabled a no-confidence motion in the government in January, shortly after its first defeat on Theresa May's Brexit deal. Every single Conservative MP at the time supported the government, as did the Democratic Unionists, as the government survived by a margin of 325 to 306 votes. But the result could be a lot closer if the Labour leader chooses to repeat the exercise again. Not only do the Conservatives have fewer MPs but leading Tory Brexiteers have warned the PM their support cannot be taken for granted if they think the future of Brexit is under threat. And the DUP have said they will use all means to oppose the withdrawal agreement in its current form.

Serial killer's ashes scattered at sea,"The ashes of Angus Sinclair, one of Scotland's most notorious murderers, have been scattered at sea. Hedied last month, aged 73, at HMP Glenochil in Alloa, Clackmannanshire. It is understood that he had suffered from a series of strokes. His body was cremated outside normal service hours, with no ceremony, flowers or music. The cremation took place at Falkirk Crematorium last Wednesday morning before the facility opened. The ashes were later returned to Clackmannanshire Council, which said they were ""disposed of at sea"". Angus Sinclair: Scotland's worst serial killer? A lifetime of abuse, rape and murder How DNA caught World's End killer The cremation was arranged by the local authority through the National Assistance Act, as is their responsibility when no suitable arrangements have been made for a dead person. The information about Sinclair's remains werepublished on the Clackmannanshire Council website,external, along with details of other funerals that took place under the same legislation. The document states that Angus Robertson Sinclair was cremated at a cost of Â£1,150.00. Angus Sinclair is thought to have killed six women within seven months in 1977 Sinclair was convicted of four killings, including the 1977 World's End murders, but was suspected of killing four more women in Glasgow the same year. He had been in prison since 1982 after being convicted of a series of rapes and indecent attacks on children. Kevin Scott, the brother of one of the murder victims, described the serial killer as a ""monster"". Speaking to BBC Scotland after Sinclair's death, Mr Scott said: ""He was a monster. To treat innocent people the way he did was just evil. You would need to be a beast to commit those crimes. ""I would have wanted him to live longer to serve more of the 37 year sentence, as opposed to getting the easy way out. ""I do feel for the families of the other victims that he may have had.

Superdry chiefs quit as battle intensifies,"Julian Dunkerton co-founded Superdry in 2003 Superdry executives, including the chairman and chief executive, have resigned after founder Julian Dunkerton won his bid to be reinstated to the board of the company he founded. In a narrow victory on Tuesday, Mr Dunkerton won the support of 51.15% of shareholders who voted. After an emergency board meeting eight directors resigned en masse. Mr Dunkerton, who left the chain a year ago, has been appointed interim chief executive. He has blamed management for flagging sales and profits and has promised to revive the firm's performance. Superdry's board had threatened to resign if Mr Dunkerton won the vote. The chain's chairman, Peter Bamford, chief executive Euan Sutherland, chief financial officer Ed Barker, and remuneration committee chair Penny Hughes, resigned from the board ""and will stand down with immediate effect"" the firmsaid in a statement to the markets,external. Dennis Millard, Minnow Powell, Sarah Wood and John Smith have given three months notice and will stand down as directors on 1 July. Two board members remain: company secretary Simon Callander, and non-executive director John Smith. UBS and Investec alsoresigned as Superdry financial advisers on Tuesday,external. Peter Williams has been appointed as board chairman. Mr Bamford had earlier said the board would hold an emergency meeting this afternoon. ""Whilst the board was unanimous in its view that the resolutions should be rejected and 74% of shareholders other than Julian and James have voted against, there was a narrow overall majority in favour and we accept that outcome,"" he added. Mr Dunkerton had said he was ""delighted"" by the outcome of the vote. ""We have a wonderful opportunity to take this brand and this business to the next, exciting phase of its growth and development. ""I can't wait to get started and to work with the directors, the talented staff and our partners to deliver the future of Superdry. The hard work starts now."" The fashion chain had urged investors to reject Mr Dunkerton's return, saying it would be ""extremely damaging"". In a separate motion proposed by Mr Dunkerton, votes ahead of the meeting suggested a majority of shareholders (51.15%) were also in favour of the appointment of Peter Williams, chairman of online retailer Boohoo, as a non-executive director. The vote comes amid a long-running dispute over the clothing brand's strategy. Supercharge Superdry? No thanks, says firm What went wrong at Superdry? Don't come back, Superdry tells founder Mr Dunkerton - who owns 18% of the company - was chief executive until 2014, when former Co-op chief executive Euan Sutherland took over the role. However, Mr Dunkerton remained at the company as creative director until he left a year ago. Former Superdry chief executive Euan Sutherland took the helm in 2014 Since Mr Dunkerton's departure Superdry's shares have plunged by 65%, and he and Mr Sutherland argued over who is responsible for the brand's decline. The management had planned to branch out into childrenswear and was also trying to broaden its range away from the firm's roots of branded hoodies, jackets and T-shirts. In contrast,  Mr Dunkerton had argued the brand should continue to focus on products that made it famous. He said venturing into childrenswear was a mistake, saying a 16-year-old ""quite categorically"" will not want to wear the same brand as their five-year-old brother. ""Next steps will likely see the kidswear launch scrapped and a step up in new product innovation. We sense there will be some upfront costs and disruption before Julian's recovery plan starts to take shape,"" analysts at Peel Hunt said. Two big institutional shareholders - Investec and Schroders, which together control about 10% of the shares - backed Mr Dunkerton's return. But the company's second largest shareholder, Aberdeen Asset Management, sided with Superdry management, and influential investor advisory firms PIRC and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had both recommended that shareholders should reject Mr Dunkerton's re-election.

Former Superdry chief executive Euan Sutherland took the helm in 2014 Since Mr Dunkerton's departure Superdry's shares have plunged by 65%, and he and Mr Sutherland argued over who is responsible for the brand's decline. The management had planned to branch out into childrenswear and was also trying to broaden its range away from the firm's roots of branded hoodies, jackets and T-shirts. In contrast,  Mr Dunkerton had argued the brand should continue to focus on products that made it famous. He said venturing into childrenswear was a mistake, saying a 16-year-old ""quite categorically"" will not want to wear the same brand as their five-year-old brother. ""Next steps will likely see the kidswear launch scrapped and a step up in new product innovation. We sense there will be some upfront costs and disruption before Julian's recovery plan starts to take shape,"" analysts at Peel Hunt said. Two big institutional shareholders - Investec and Schroders, which together control about 10% of the shares - backed Mr Dunkerton's return. But the company's second largest shareholder, Aberdeen Asset Management, sided with Superdry management, and influential investor advisory firms PIRC and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had both recommended that shareholders should reject Mr Dunkerton's re-election.

Ryanair 'one of Europe's top polluters',"Ryanair has become the only airline to be included in a list of Europe's top 10 polluters,according to data from the EU's Transport & Environment group.,external It is the first time a company that does not run a coal-fired power plant has come near the top of the ranking. Seven plants in Germany and one in both Poland and Bulgaria were on the list. The data said Ryanair's carbon dioxide emissions rose by 6.9% last year, but the firm said it was ""Europe's greenest and cleanest airline"". In a statement, the carrier added that ""passengers travelling on Ryanair have the lowest CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled than any other airline"". Last year, the airline launched a new environmental policy, in which it said it would offer its customers the chance to offset the carbon cost of their flights. The nine carbon emitters above Ryanair in the list are all power plants fired by lignite, which is a form of soft brown coal. The annual rankings are not a list of companies across Europe and how much CO2 they produce. Instead, they focus on 11,000 power stations and manufacturing plants in the 28 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, as well as aviation activities in these countries. The EU says those activities have been chosen because they can be measured and checked with a high level of accuracy. Emissions have to be registered with EU authorities by the 31 March. Which airline is best for carbon emissions? Ryanair trolling of British Airways' mistake backfires Climate change: UK CO2 emissions fall again Michael O'Leary: Ryanair's outspoken boss Since 2012 the European Union has attempted to control aviation emissionsthrough its Emissions Trading System (ETS),,externalwhich started in 2005. The ETS works on the cap and trade principle. Under its scheme, a cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that installations covered by the system can emit. Over time, the cap is reduced so that total emissions fall. Within the cap, companies can buy or receive emission allowances which they can trade with one another as required. They are also allowed to buy limited amounts of international credits from emission-saving projects around the world, with the limit ensuring that the credits have a value. The power plant dominates the skyline in the German town of Niederaussem Companies must give up enough emission allowances each year to cover all their emissions, otherwise they face heavy fines. The airline industry is also introducing its own initiatives. As a first step, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation requires airlines to monitor and report their emissions from this year. The full scheme will start in 2021. The European Union says that without any action, CO2 emissions from aviation are set to grow by up to 300% by 2050. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, told the BBC: ""When the aviation industry talk about the necessity of expansion, always remember that a lot of their slots are reserved for short hops which can often be done just as easily by train.""

Convictions against Max Clifford upheld,"Max Clifford had been serving an eight-year jail sentence for sex offences before his death A conviction for sex offences against celebrity publicist Max Clifford has been upheld by the Court of Appeal. Clifford died in 2017 while serving an eight-year jail term for indecent assaults on four young women and girls. He had always maintained his innocence - and his daughter had continued to try to clear his name after his death. But, ruling on Tuesday, Lady Justice Rafferty said nothing the judges heard ""came anywhere near imperilling the safety of this conviction"". Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, was jailed in May 2014 after being convicted of a string of indecent assaults carried out between 1977 and 1984. He branded his accusers ""fantasists"", but was convicted at London's Southwark Crown Court. Clifford's daughter, Louise, tried to clear her father's name Before he died after suffering heart failure at the age of 74, Clifford won the right for his fight to overturn his conviction to be heard at the Court of Appeal. His daughter Louise continued the challenge after his death but, after scrutinising the case against him in March, the Court of Appeal comprehensively rejected it on all grounds. When sentencing Clifford after his 2014 trial, Judge Anthony Leonard said his personality and position in the public eye were the reasons his crimes were not revealed earlier.

Coffee cup ban sees sales fall Â£250k,"Boston Tea Party has 21 branches around England An independent coffee chain said it has seen sales fall by Â£250,000 since it banned single use cups last summer. Boston Tea Party (BTP) has called for major national and international brands to follow suit. Owner Sam Roberts said it had factored the loss in takings into its plans and that too many operators were ""putting their profits before the planet"". Rebecca Burgess, chief executive of plastic pollution campaign group City to Sea, praised BTP's ""bravery"". The chain, which has 22 branches around England and is based in Bristol,started the banin June 2018. This video can not be played Sam Roberts explains the move to ban one-use cups despite it losing them money Customers must bring a reusable cup, drink in or pay a deposit on a cup they can return to any branch. Boston Tea Party usually sells Â£1m in takeaway coffees per year but it is down 25%. Mr Roberts says thankfully the business is supported by a strong food offer and most customers are supportive of its stance on single use cups. But he agrees a smaller coffee shop would struggle to finance a ban. Boston Tea Party says it has stopped 125,000 cups going to landfill since last June when it brought in the ban He said: ""We have lost around 25% of our takeaway coffee sales but we modelled that into our costs as passing trade who don't want to get involved in the cup loan scheme. ""We felt this was a financial loss we had to take and we want this to be a call to action to other companies. ""Those using a 25p off a reusable cup scheme - we know first-hand this has a very low penetration and when we launched that scheme ourselves, only 5% of customers took it up. ""There's too many operators not dealing with the problem and putting their profits before the planet. ""At the moment bigger businesses are deploying a smoke and mirrors strategy and not resolving problems while seeming like they are doing something about it. ""We are 100% committed and there's no going back."" Mr Roberts said the firm had stopped 125,000 cups going to landfill, sold 40,000 reusable coffee cups and raised Â£12,000 for local charities with the money saved on buying disposable cups - roughly 10 pence for every cup. This video can not be played Boston Tea Party says it has lost Â£250,000 in sales from the move. Costa Coffeehas promised to recycle as many cups as it puts into the market by 2020 and also offers customers a 25p discount on hot beverages if they bring their own reusable cup. Pret A Mangeroffers a 50p discount on hot beverages if people bring their own reusable cup. A spokesperson said: ""We doubled our discount for customers who bring in their own reusable cup to 50p in January 2018 and, since then, usage has increased almost 20-fold. ""We now serve over 150,000 drinks in reusable cups every week, and since the discount was doubled, Pret customers have saved over six million paper cups."" Starbucksoffers customers a 25p discount on hot beverages if they bring their own reusable cup. Starbucks has announced its London cafes will trial a redesigned cup that will be both recyclable and compostable. A spokesman said: ""Our British stores are the first globally to have trialled a 5p charge on takeaway cups."" He said reusable cup uptake had risen from 1.8% to more than 5% in the past 18 months. Along with McDonald's it has invested Â£10m in firms hoping to design a sustainable alternative to the disposable cup. CaffÃ¨ Nerosays that, along with its competitors, it is ""working to increase the number of [coffee cup] recycling points"" in the UK. It also encourages the use of reusable cups by offering 2 stamps per coffee on its loyalty card. CaffÃ¨ Nero, Starbucks, Greggs, McDonald's UK and Pret A Manger are also involved in a cup recycling scheme that funds the collection of takeaway cups for recycling.

BonmarchÃÂ© deal puts jobs and shops at risk,"Jobs and shops at struggling fashion chain BonmarchÃ© are under threat after UK billionaire Philip Day tabled a takeover bid. The deal values the Yorkshire-based chain, which began in 1982 and now has 312 shops specialising in clothing for the over-50s, at around Â£5.7m. Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group owner Mr Day warned he expected a ""material reduction"" in headcount at the chain. BonmarchÃ© employs 1,900 full-time equivalent people,its website says.,external The struggling retailerwarned last month that trading had deteriorated, adding that it expected to lose Â£5-Â£6m this year. Using his Dubai-based investment vehicle Spectre, Mr Day has bought a 52.4% stake in the retailer. As he now owns more than half of the company's shares, this has triggered a mandatory takeover bid. However, the offer of just 11.445p a share is well below Monday's closing price of 18p.

Soldier 'saw paratroopers kill civilians',"The inquest is examining the deaths in west Belfast in August 1971 A former British soldier has told the Ballymurphy inquest he watched paratroopers shooting and killing civilians. The inquest is examining the deaths of 10 people in west Belfast in August 1971. Witness C4 was a 24-year-old man in 1971 and a serving member of the Royal Corps of Signals. He explained that although he came from Gloucestershire he had married a woman from Ballymurphy. Ballymurphy shootings: Who were the victims? He was in the area on leave at the time of the shootings. On occasion he said he had acted as a go-between for the Army and the local community. C4 told the court he was present during the incident where Fr Hugh Mullan and Francis Quinn were shot and killed on waste ground near Springfield Park. The shootings occurred amid disturbances sparked by the introduction of internment without trial in Northern Ireland He said he and others had been pinned down whilst trying to help women and children, including his own sister-in-law, from a mixed area, escape across the waste ground. C4 said he saw two soldiers wearing red berets on the roof of Springmartin Flats, which were unfinished at the time. He had been practising on a Army shooting range just the week before, he said, and was well aware of the noises made by various weapons. C4 said the soldiers were firing SLRs (self-loading rifles). He had earlier watched as soldiers and a Ferret scout car had moved into the area. He said he watched Fr Mullan being shot and said the priest screamed for some time. Ten people were killed in the shootings Later, after the priest was hit a second time, C4 said he listened to him pray for a while in both English and Latin, before he died. During the shooting C4 said he could see the two soldiers and watched the muzzle flashes from their weapons. The off-duty soldier was nicked in the leg by one bullet as well, he said. He reported hearing handguns fired earlier from Springmartin which he thought came from loyalist paramilitaries. Later in the evening C4 said there was firing from two Lee Enfield rifles at a factory on a different side of the waste ground. He also said that an Army major asked him not to testify at the inquest in 1972. Later on Tuesday, a previous television interview C4 had given was played to the court. In it he described lying in the waste ground under fire. Soldiers from the Parachute Regiment were based at Henry Taggart Army base ""I looked up,"" he said. ""I saw them. I could see they were paras by the berets they were wearing."" In the interview, he said the soldiers later created ""ghost gunmen"" to justify having opened fire. ""I was quite, not shocked, disgusted, by the fact that the soldiers did lie,"" he said. C4 later said that at the 1972 inquest into Father Mullan's death he'd been called a traitor by an officer of the Parachute Regiment and had been threatened. Of his own military career, he said: ""I served with honour. To me, part of that was the truth."" Later C4 was questioned at length by a barrister for the Ministry of Defence. The former soldier told him: ""Don't think this is easy for me, it's not. My loyalties are being torn apart.""

The neo-Nazi paedophile who plotted to kill,"A jury has been unable to decide whether Jack Renshaw, a neo-Nazi who admitted a terrorist plot to kill an MP, remained a member of a banned terrorist group.  At the end of his fourth and final trial of the past two years, the full story of those cases can now be told. They drank there regularly. Normally on a Saturday. Often during the week, too. Numbers varied - from only a couple of drinkers to as many as 10. This is the Friar Penketh in Warrington, a busy Wetherspoons in the town centre. Friar Penketh, Warrington The conversation of the drinking party was not that of ordinary lads out socialising - football or work - but focused on far darker subjects, such as their hatred of Jewish and non-white people, their veneration of Nazism and Adolf Hitler, and their fascination with terrorism. On Saturday 1 July 2017, several members and former members of the banned neo-Nazi organisation National Action arrived in the late afternoon. They were joined in the early evening by a youthful-looking man whose wide, hostile eyes are in contrast to his slender, timid frame. Almost immediately, the then 22-year-old began complaining about an ongoing police investigation into him for stirring up racial hatred in speeches. There was sympathy for Jack Renshaw among his fellow drinkers. Jack Renshaw - (still from a British National Party video) As the evening wore on, he revealed an imminent plan - that if he was charged by police, he would make a political statement by killing his local MP Rosie Cooper. He had already bought a gladius machete - a Roman short sword - to carry out the murder. Hostages would be taken, he elaborated, and he would lure a female detective who was investigating him to the scene by demanding to speak to her. He would then kill her as well. After that, he would commit ""suicide by cop"" by advancing on armed police wearing a fake suicide vest, he told the group. The attack would be an act of ""white jihad"" - a slogan used by National Action - and he planned to make a martyrdom-style video setting this out. None of those around the table challenged Renshaw, and two of them even suggested alternative targets, namely the then Home Secretary Amber Rudd and a synagogue. What none of them knew was that one of their number was secretly passing information to the anti-racism charity Hope not Hate. Robbie Mullen, once a committed neo-Nazi, had grown disillusioned and wanted out. ""I didn't want to be involved in killing anyone, or a group I was involved with killing people. I just didn't want anyone to get killed or hurt,"" he says. As Mullen left the pub that night, Renshaw gave him a hug and said they would probably not see one another again. Alarmed by what was unfolding, Mullen immediately contacted Hope not Hate ""Jack is going to kill an MP soon,"" he told them. Jack Renshaw's case starkly illustrates the dangers of radicalisation. He was born in Lancashire and became involved in politics in his teens - first with the English Defence League and then the British National Party (BNP), after meeting its then leader Nick Griffin at an event. When he finished school, he started a degree in economics and politics at Manchester Metropolitan University, but was asked to leave because of his far-right activism. Jack Renshaw - (still from a BNP video) Renshaw spent years in the BNP, appearing on its posters, in videos, and as a speaker at conferences. He stood for Blackpool Council and worked at the European Parliament in Brussels. He also involved himself in campaigning against the sexual grooming of children. Once asked to describe his journey, Renshaw said: ""I started off basically as a bit of a civic nationalist with, let's say, slightly covert racist thoughts, and now I'm an outright racist national socialist."" National Action would become his political home. The youthful British group, which was founded in 2013, was openly racist and neo-Nazi. The new parents and the neo-Nazi terror threatthe story of National Action and the threat posed by its members. It would be banned in December 2016 after an official assessment concluded it was unlawfully glorifying terrorism. National Action had even used an official Twitter account to celebrate the murder of Jo Cox MP by a white supremacist. Robbie Mullen, then a warehouse worker living in Runcorn, Cheshire, had joined the group after becoming absorbed by extremist politics. He had researched other organisations, but was drawn in by the brash, confident National Action, whose members dressed in all-black at demonstrations and used social media to promote their activities. Robbie Mullen Mullen, now 25, told the BBC he was first attracted by the ""way they looked"" and because ""they were all around my age, whereas the usual far right were old men drinking in a pub."" Mullen, like Renshaw who was a National Action spokesperson, became a prominent figure in the group, helping to organise activities in north west England. Renshaw seemed to revel in the cruelty of his chosen ideology. His social media pages became a vile stream of hatred and malicious conspiracy theories, with Jewish people a frequent target of abuse. But it was two anti-Semitic speeches he made on behalf of National Action that would prove his undoing. During a demonstration on Blackpool seafront in March 2016, Renshaw said Jewish people were ""parasites"" and that Britain had taken the wrong side in World War Two, instead of fighting with the Nazis who were implementing the ""final solution"". At a speech in Yorkshire a month earlier, he had said Adolf Hitler was ""right in many senses"", but wrong when he ""showed mercy to people who did not deserve mercy"". Renshaw said that Jewish people should be ""eradicated"". Jack Renshaw at a National Action rally - (NA propaganda material) He was arrested at his mother's house in Blackpool in January 2017 and held on suspicion of stirring up racial hatred. His mobile phones and other items were seized. However, his speeches were not the only matters under investigation. Renshaw, a campaigner against child sexual exploitation, was secretly a paedophile who had been grooming boys for sex. For nearly a year he had been using a fake Facebook profile to sexually groom two boys, who were aged between 13 and 15 at the time. Despite not meeting the children, he offered them money for sex and requested intimate photographs. Police were alerted after a relative saw messages on one of the boy's phones. Detectives established the Facebook messages had been sent from the Blackpool address occupied by Jack Renshaw. When first arrested in January, he had only been interviewed in relation to the speeches, before being released on bail while inquiries continued. One of the investigating officers - Det Con Victoria Henderson - was tasked with keeping in touch with the suspect and she also became involved in the sexual offences inquiry. In May that year, Renshaw was re-arrested and questioned about the grooming. He must have realised his deception was at an end. DC Henderson later said Renshaw had been ""shocked and upset"" and ""gone visibly white and was very teary"". He denied grooming the boys, despite evidence of the offending having been found on his own phones. The suspect, who had a history of making homophobic statements, told DC Henderson he was still a virgin, did not believe in sex outside marriage, and that his taste in pornography was ""quite traditional"" and ""quite conservative"". While admitting to having searched online for gay pornography ""out of interest"", he denied being homosexual and said same-sex relationships were ""unnatural"". Within two days of being released on bail, Renshaw searched for DC Henderson on Facebook. She had become a target. Unknown to police, Renshaw had already begun planning an attack on his local MP Rosie Cooper, which would be a political killing. He now resolved to also murder DC Henderson, which would be an act of personal revenge. Earlier that month he had researched the West Lancashire MP and Googled: ""How long to die after jugular cut"". Rosie Cooper - MP for West Lancashire On 7 June, he ordered a machete online - described by its manufacturer as offering ""19 inches of unprecedented piercing and slashing power"" - and paid for next-day delivery. After receiving it, he shared an image of the weapon with associates using the encrypted Telegram messaging app. But Renshaw's plans were foiled because of Robbie Mullen. By this time, Mullen was secretly communicating with Hope not Hate. After establishing contact in spring 2017, Mullen said that National Action members had not disbanded, despite the group having been banned. He said they were continuing to meet, train together in a private gym, and communicate via encrypted messaging applications. This video can not be played Jack Renshaw admitted plotting to kill an MP but denied membership of National Action The public trappings of the group - demonstrations, the website, the name - had gone, but he claimed the core of the group remained. When it was banned, Mullen later told the BBC, National Action's longstanding fascination with terrorism became central to its purpose, and the group began planning for imminent racial warfare. After Renshaw laid out his violent plans in the pub on 1 July 2017, Mullen spoke to Matthew Collins, his contact and Hope not Hate's research director. Collins, who was on holiday at the time, recalls the moment he was told that Renshaw ""was going to kill an MP imminently, immediately"". Boxing training - (National Action propaganda video) He remembers asking Mullen: ""'How immediately?' and he said,  'It's going to happen soon'. And this horrific, unimaginable story unfolded."" The next day Hope not Hate got a message to Rosie Cooper warning her of the danger. She informed the police and suddenly found herself at the centre of a counter terrorism investigation - only a year after the murder of her colleague Jo Cox. While this was happening, Renshaw was being interviewed in Lancashire - again by DC Henderson - about the grooming offences. He was then separately charged with stirring up racial hatred in the two speeches. He was released on bail, and that night posted a series of messages on Facebook indicative of his mindset. ""I'm spending my time with familyâ¦ It will all be over soon."" In another, he wrote: ""I'll laugh last but it may not be for the longest."" Counter terrorism detectives hurriedly tried to locate Renshaw, but he was not at his bail address. While searching his uncle's house, they discovered the machete that Renshaw had bought hidden in an airing cupboard. Police photos of Renshaw's machete found in an airing cupboard He was eventually found and arrested on suspicion of making threats to kill. The next day, he appeared before a court for the stirring up racial hatred offences and the prosecution successfully opposed bail. Renshaw was off the streets. Robbie Mullen, on the other hand, continued associating with the same people. None of them knew he was the source of intelligence about the proposed attack. There were concerns that Mullen, himself, could face prosecution for membership of National Action. Robbie Mullen today Immunity had to be granted, and the police had to assess whether his evidence could be used in a prosecution. In autumn 2017, six people who had been drinking in the Friar Penketh on the night Renshaw revealed his plot were arrested and eventually charged. Two of them, including the group leader Christopher Lythgoe, were convicted of membership of National Action. One man was acquitted of the same charge. Two juries were unable to decide whether the other men - Renshaw included - had stayed in the group after it was banned. Mullen, having refused witness protection, was issued with a ""threat to life"" notice by the authorities. Hope not Hate rushed him away late at night and took him to a safe place - he has been unable to return to his home or job since then. Renshaw eventually faced four trials over the past 14 months. In January 2018, at Preston Crown Court, he was convicted of two counts of stirring up racial hatred in speeches and later sentenced to three years in prison In June, at the same court, he was convicted of four counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and jailed for an additional 18 months. The case can only be reported now his final trial has concluded. In the dock in Preston he appeared sheepish as videos of police interviews with his two young victims, conducted by DC Henderson, were shown to the court. One boy described how Renshaw - using a fake Facebook profile under an assumed name - called him a ""hottie"" and ""jailbait"". ""He was getting too weird, saying he wanted to do weird sexual things to me,"" the victim said. ""Deffo getting cuddled you,"" Renshaw had informed him. Jack Renshaw - (photo from Renshaw's social media) Renshaw asked the child for explicit photos and tried to entice him into sex by offering money, drugs and pizza: ""One night. 10 grand. Me and you."" ""I was scared for my life,"" the child told DC Henderson. The second boy said Renshaw bombarded him with messages daily. Around Christmas time, he sent the child an image of some presents and said he could have them in exchange for intimate pictures. Renshaw even sent the boy graphic photos of himself. When the child called Renshaw a ""dirty paedophile"" he replied by saying ""that turned him on"", the victim recalled. Renshaw, in the witness box, said his only explanation for how evidence of his sexual interest in children - including very explicit search terms - came to be on four separate mobile phones to which only he had access, that were seized by police over a period of several months, was ""real time synchronised access"" by Hope not Hate. Hacking, to put it another way. Hacking so complex it was beyond the capabilities of advanced states. The fake Facebook profile had been accessed during bursts of online activity that Renshaw admitted were his own, including sometimes within seconds of social media accounts in his own name being used. No expert evidence was advanced to support the defence thesis and the prosecution technical experts - who agreed it was impossible for any hacking to have taken place - were not asked by Renshaw's barrister about the theory, because the defendant only put it forward so late in the legal process. The prosecution described his story as a ""complete fantasy."" When asked if he had any qualifications in expert phone analysis, Renshaw admitted he did not but insisted: ""I used to be a technician for Dixons retail."" During his third trial - at the Old Bailey in summer 2018 - Renshaw was more forthcoming, appearing unashamed at his murderous plans and hatred of others. On the first morning of the trial, Renshaw suddenly pleaded guilty to preparing to murder Rosie Cooper and making a threat to kill DC Henderson. But he denied membership of National Action and so remained a defendant. When called to give evidence, he said Rosie Cooper was chosen as his target because ""she happened to be my local MP"" and was the ""most logistical representative of the state"". ""It was me wanting to send the state a message. If you beat a dog long enough it bites,"" he told the court. He said the plan was to ""turn up at one of her social events"" and then ""hack"" at her jugular with the machete. Renshaw, a Holocaust denier who told the court he wanted all Jewish people to be killed, stated his neo-Nazi beliefs loftily but defensively, claiming to be impervious to the horrors such ideas have generated while at the same time calling for more. His haughtiness was at odds with his true position: a convicted paedophile and terrorist facing many years in prison. Jurors were unable to decide whether he had remained a member of National Action, nor could the jurors in a retrial. Mullen, who appeared as a witness in both London cases, must now start a new life, but he is unsure of its shape. ""I don't know at the minute,"" he says. ""I live month-to-month - I don't think into the future too much."" But he knows things will never be the same. Mullen nods quietly when asked if he understands that he probably saved lives, including that of an MP. He is still unsure precisely what first triggered his decision to start secretly passing information to Hope not Hate, for which he now works. ""I've been asked this twice in court. I don't really know,"" he says. But he says the violent plans and intentions he was told about meant he had to act. ""I knew that if I could do something to stop it then I had to."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Varadkar and Macron in Brexit talks,"Mr Macron, right, told reporters that France and Ireland would be the countries most affected by a no-deal outcome The European Union will not be hostage to a ""political crisis"" in the UK, France's president has said. Emmanuel Macron was speaking in Paris during talks with Irish PM Leo Varadkar. ""We will never abandon Ireland or the Irish people no matter what happens, because this solidarity is the very purpose of the European project,"" said Mr Macron. Mr Varadkar said any Brexit extension needed ""a clear purpose, clear plan"". Their meeting came after MPs twice rejected Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal deal, with the government now ramping up plans for a no-deal scenario. Mr Varadkar said he would also discuss the Republic of Ireland's no-deal plans with Mr Macron. The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) emphasised that the EU should be open to any ""credible proposals"" the UK put forward about in the Brexit process. No-deal Brexit can still be avoided - Barnier MPs fail to back Brexit proposals again Brexit: What could happen next? What does a soft Brexit mean? Mr Macron told reporters that France and Ireland would be the countries most affected by a no-deal outcome. They both said the integrity of the single market would need to be protected, but that the EU would uphold commitments made to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement. Mr Varadkar's visit to France comes ahead of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's trip to Dublin on Thursday. German Chancellor Angel Merkel is due to visit Dublin on Thursday He said the EU would need to seriously consider how to respond to any request from the UK for a longer extension, in order to avoid leaving with no deal on 12 April. Mr Varadkar said that it would come with conditions, requiring the UK to take part in European elections on 23 May. Mairead McGuinness, vice-president of the European Parliament and Fine Gael MEP, said that a no deal does not solve problems for those who would advocate for a hard Brexit. ""There's a view that a no deal would be a forever state of play from those that would argue for it, but frankly it's not,"" she said. ""Immediately afterwards I believe the UK would need to come to the EU and ask to speak and negotiate."" Mr Varadkar is expected to return from Paris on Tuesday evening and hold a meeting of his cabinet. Earlier on Tuesday,Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, said a no-deal Brexit is now more likely but can still be avoided. The DUP still want changes made to the backstop The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) voted against all four options tabled on Monday. The party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said if the Irish border backstop was addressed, the DUP could ""do business"" with the government. Speaking after the indicative votes, Mr Dodds said the only proposition that MPs had ever supported was an amendment - known as the Brady amendment - calling on the government to negotiate changes to the backstop. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The backstop is the insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland, unless and until another solution is found. The DUP and some Brexiteer MPs oppose it because if it took effect, it would keep Northern Ireland only tied to some EU regulatory rules, and would keep the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU. On Monday night, independent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Hermon, backed two of the options. She voted for another referendum and to revoke article 50, but against a customs union or single market arrangement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will visit Dublin on Thursday, as pressure mounts over Parliament's failure to ratify the withdrawal agreement. The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 12 April, if it cannot propose a way forward to the EU. An extraordinary EU summit is due to take place on 10 April. Mr Varadkar said he would discuss with his French and German counterparts how the European Council should respond to a request for another extension from the UK, to seek a delay to the Brexit process.

Mum's 'miracle' baby after 10 miscarriages,"This video can not be played Jen and Andrew Bickel, of Cardiff, suffered 10 miscarriages before having a baby. Two years ago, the BBC told the story of how Jen Bickel and her husband Andrew had spent a decade trying for a baby, instead enduring 10 miscarriages. Then, just when it seemed all hope was lost, their fortunes changed, as Jen, from Cardiff, explains. There have been so many low points in my journey to becoming a mother, it's tricky to pick out the lowest. Perhaps it was after I had both my fallopian tubes removed, scuppering my chances of ever conceiving naturally. I didn't want to get out of bed. I didn't want to go to work or see people. I felt like I had crashed and burned, and it was only the support of my husband Andrew and wider family that got me through. 'Opening the grief of miscarriage' Mum who lost 20 babies 'It felt like it was my fault' This was in April 2017, a decade after we first began trying. Of course, as newlyweds, we never dreamed that having a baby would prove so testing. Back then, we were both fit and healthy 29-year-olds. It was 2007, and at first, I fell pregnant quite quickly, miscarrying at six weeks before I actually even knew I was pregnant. I was upset but not too devastated; we had time on our sides after all.  But it was 18 months before I fell pregnant again, and this time I miscarried at 11 weeks. Unsurprisingly, Andrew and I were devastated, especially when I was kept in hospital for medical management of the foetus, which involved hours of bleeding and pain. Jen and Andrew, both 40, met at high school A miscarriage is the loss of a foetus before 24 weeks 20% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage Abnormalities in the baby's development are a key factor Smoking, obesity and a woman's age can also play a part But worse, was the effect of this second miscarriage upon our mental health. Many of our friends were starting families, and although we were happy for them, it made our losses all the more acute. Personally, I couldn't help but blame myself. Why was my body failing me? What had I done? In April 2009, I miscarried again after an early scan showed my baby had no heartbeat. Then, in 2010, we decided to embark on IVF, hoping this would solve the problem, particularly as tests showed there was nothing specifically wrong with us. Little did we know how hard this process would be. In the first round, we created 10 embryos, yet none of them resulted in pregnancy. A few months later, we tried again, this time receiving a positive pregnancy test - but again a foetus with no heartbeat. How reiki helped me cope with miscarriage Baby joy for hospital 'heartbreak' woman On this occasion, I came home and waited for the embryo to come away naturally, but it was no less painful or upsetting than being in hospital. By this stage, we were desperate. Unsure of how to proceed, we paid out Â£2,000 for private tests, had acupuncture and bought supplements - yet nothing helped. Still, we could not give up, so we had no option but to steel our nerves and keep trying. In 2014, we had two embryos implanted at a private clinic, but, in the October, while out for my birthday, I felt a terrible pain in my side, which turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy. This was the end of the road of IVF. We had no frozen embryos left, and no more money for treatment. Amazingly, we were then thrown a lifeline when the IVF clinic gave us a free round, after nurses voted us the most deserving couple. The couple found it difficult when their friends started having children We implanted two embryos which failed, but froze a further three. I then suffered two further ectopic pregnancies, resulting in both my fallopian tubes being removed. I was heartbroken, knowing I would never conceive naturally. In total, over the past decade, I had fallen pregnant 10 times - six times naturally and four times through IVF - and we couldn't take anymore. All we had were the frozen embryos - our last hope - and we were keeping everything crossed. It took months before the lining of my womb was considered thick enough to try. But once it was, we implanted one embryo, and after another agonising two-week wait, received a positive pregnancy test. We couldn't get our hopes up and during the scan, I lay on the bed holding Andrew's hand, filled with dread. But there was something different this time - a tiny heartbeat, something we had never seen before. We were ecstatic. Still, though, even when I went through morning sickness and learnt we were having a boy, Andrew found it hard to believe. He was incredibly supportive, but he refused to shop for baby things or decorate the nursery until the very last weeks before my due date. Due to my age - I was 40 - I was induced to make sure that the placenta didn't begin to fail. But, after hours of contractions, doctors realised the baby's heartbeat was dropping as the cord was wrapped around his neck. Everyone knew how high the stakes were - this could not go wrong - so I had a Caesarean, and in the early hours of 9 February, our miracle baby arrived weighing 6lb 8oz. Bobi William Bickel is now six weeks old, and I do not care if he cries all day or wants to feed all night; I have everything I ever wanted. Looking back, we still can't believe how lucky we are or why things finally worked. Was it because my tubes were removed? Was it down to the bit of weight I lost? Baby Bobi arrived six weeks ago Either way, we simply want to share our story as so many other couples are going through similar heartbreak. Struggling to conceive is incredibly hard - physically, mentally and emotionally. Andrew and I were always each other's rock, but we would advise people to seek support. As for us, we still have two embryos in the freezer and I'm sure at some point we will try and implant them. If they work, so be it.  If not, we have our beautiful boy, and after more than a decade of heartbreak, we could not be more grateful.

Vaginal mesh ban can end 'with changes',"The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and to support organs Controversial vaginal mesh implants can be offered again on the NHS in England once certain conditions are met, health watchdog NICE has said. Some women have been left unable to walk, work or have sex after having the implants, which are used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence. Use of vaginal meshwas halted across the UK last yearamid safety concerns. NICE said operations must be performed by specialist surgeons at specialist centres before their reintroduction. All instances - and outcomes - of vaginal mesh operations should also be recorded on a national database ""to help with future decision-making"", it said. The NHS is not compelled to act on the guidelines - which are for England only - and the ""pause"" on vaginal mesh surgery remains in place. But services are expected to take NICE recommendations into account when planning and delivering care. Hernia mesh complications 'affect 100,000' Hundreds suing NHS over vaginal implants Under the new guidelines, each patient would receive a ""decision aid"" - detailing all the latest evidence on available treatments - and mesh implants would be used only after non-surgical options, such as lifestyle changes and pelvic floor training, had failed. NICE said the ""limited evidence"" meant ""the true prevalence of long-term complications following surgery with mesh is unknown"". Owen Smith said he had ""serious concerns"" women would not be made aware of the potential risks But Labour MP Owen Smith, who chairs a cross-party group of MPs on surgical mesh implants, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he was ""deeply disappointed"". ""The updated guidelines appear to disregard mesh-injured women's experiences by stating that there is no long-term evidence of adverse effects,"" he said. ""Thousands of women have faced life-changing injuries following mesh surgery and they must not be ignored."" He said the suspension of vaginal mesh should continue until an independent review - led by Baroness Julia Cumberlege - publishes its findings later this year. Baroness Cumberlege agreed, saying her team has set ""five conditions that would need to be met before the pause could be lifted and the use of mesh could be contemplated"". ""Those conditions have not yet been met and it is clear to us that it will be some considerable time before they are. ""This means that, now and for the foreseeable future, mesh should not be used to treat stress urinary incontinence, either in the NHS or the independent sector. ""The scale and intensity of this tragedy is truly shocking - lives have been ruined."" Studies suggestas many as one in 10,externalpatients can experience complications including chronic pain and difficulties walking. Jackie could no longer work because of the pain caused by her implant Jackie Cheetham says she has tried to kill herself on several occasions because of the complications caused by her mesh implant. ""I have constant pain in my groin and down my leg,"" she says. ""I don't sleep at night. I can't walk far. We've lost our house, as I couldn't work anymore. ""It almost cost me my marriage. ""I have tried to overdose several times. I felt like an unfit mother. I couldn't work and I thought, 'What's the point?'"" Ms Cheetham says when she had the implant - to treat incontinence - she was given a leaflet by her surgeon ""but it definitely didn't say I would be left in lifelong pain"". And despite surgery to remove it, some mesh still remains inside her. Campaign group Sling the Mesh founder Kath Sansom said the NICE guidelines were effectively ""no different from what was published in 2003"", something that NICE disputes. ""They are so weak - they clear the way for the next generation of women to be harmed,"" she said. Kath Sansom said adversely-affected women had been ""ignored"" ""We told our stories and NICE ignored us. ""Our Sling The Mesh survey shows one in 20 women have attempted suicide and more than half have regular suicidal thoughts because of chronic pain, loss of sex life, constant infections and autoimmune disease."" The mesh is made of a polypropolene, a type of plastic An official at England's Department of Health and Social Care said: ""NICE's new guidelines and patient decision aids on managing urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse will help women make more informed choices about their treatment. ""The use of vaginal mesh was paused to ensure that patients receive a high-quality and consistent service. ""Mesh will still be a treatment for some women who understand the risks and following discussions with their consultant."" The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the British Society of Urogynaecology (BSUG) said they welcomed NICE's recommendation ""that the full range of non-surgical options should be offered to women before any surgical procedures"" and ""fully endorse"" NICE's patient decision aids. But they added it was ""important to note"" that a period of ""high-vigilance"" remained regarding the implants' use.

Jury discharged in National Action trial,"This video can not be played Jack Renshaw admitted plotting to kill an MP but denied membership of National Action A man who plotted the murder of an MP will not face a retrial for membership of a banned neo-Nazi group. Jack Renshaw, from Skelmersdale in Lancashire, bought a machete to kill Labour's Rosie Cooper and a police officer against whom he had a grudge. The 23-year-old admitted preparing an act of terrorism but denied membership of National Action. After a seven-week retrial, the Old Bailey jury said it was unable to reach a unanimous or majority verdict. It can now be reported for the first time that Renshaw was last year convicted of grooming two adolescent boys online for sex. The neo-Nazi paedophile who plotted to kill During the first Old Bailey trial last year, he admitted a terrorist plot to murder Ms Cooper with a 19in (48cm) Gladius knife. He also pleaded guilty to making a threat to kill detective Victoria Henderson, who was investigating him for sexual offences. Renshaw's terrorist plot, for which he will be sentenced on 17 May, was foiled after a whistleblower - former National Action member Robbie Mullen - warned the anti-racism charity Hope not Hate, which then informed police. Labour MP Rosie Cooper said she ""was to be murdered to send a message to the state"" Ms Cooper said: ""I was targeted, not as Rosie Cooper the person, but as Rosie Cooper the MP. I was to be murdered to send a message to the state. ""Our way of life, our democracy and our freedoms are being attacked by the likes of Renshaw and extremist groups like National Action."" ""We've got to do so much more to protect our democracy,"" she added. The retrial jury was also unable to decide whether Andrew Clarke, 34, of Prescot, Merseyside, and Michal Trubini, 36, of Warrington, Cheshire, remained members of National Action after it was proscribed in December 2016. The British group, founded in 2013, was banned three years later under anti-terror laws. Jurors, who had deliberated for more than 48 hours, have been discharged. The prosecution said it would not be seeking a third trial. Jack Renshaw denied being a member of National Action Renshaw had set out his murder plot during a meeting in a Warrington pub on 1 July 2017. Jurors heard those present included Renshaw and Clarke. Mr Trubini, a Slovakian national who came to the UK over a decade ago, had been present earlier in the evening. Last summer, a jury was unable to decide whether Renshaw, Clarke and Mr Trubini had remained members of National Action. Hope not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles said he owed a ""great debt of gratitude"" to whistleblower Mr Mullen for his bravery and putting ""his own life in danger"". He said National Action was part of a ""more extreme breed of neo-Nazis that vilified Jews... encouraged violence and... wanted to ignite a race war in Britain"". Renshaw had earlier been convicted at Preston Crown Court of four counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He had groomed two boys - aged between 13 and 15 at time - using a fake Facebook profile. He had claimed Hope Not Hate wanted to discredit him and maliciously hacked his mobile phones to send messages of a sexual nature to the teenagers. But jurors did not believe him and he was jailed for 16 months in June 2018. Renshaw also received a three-year prison sentence two months earlier when he was found guilty by a different jury at the same court of stirring up racial hatred after he called for the genocide of Jewish people.

"YouTube restricts Tommy Robinson channelThe restrictions mean videos will be harder to find and show a warning before they play, YouTube says.Technology","Social media platforms have steadily restricted how Mr Robinson can use them YouTube has placed more restrictions around the video channel of English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson. Clips uploaded by Mr Robinson have been removed from search results and he is blocked from streaming live events via the site. Messages warning that his videos may not be appropriate for all viewers will also play before clips. YouTube had already, in January, decided tosuspend adverts on Mr Robinson's channel. It had imposed the further restrictions after talking to external experts and academic researchers about the types of videos shown on the channel,reported Buzzfeed.,external ""We are applying a tougher treatment to Tommy Robinson's channel in keeping with our policies on borderline content,"" it told the news site. Buzzfeed said the steps taken by YouTube would make Mr Robinson's videos ""undiscoverable"" unless followers sought them out specifically. The latest action comes after politicians called on YouTube to follow other social media companies in limiting the exposure Mr Robinson enjoyed on their platforms. Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has also had pages on Facebook and Instagram removed. Last year, he was banned from Twitter and Paypal ceased processing payments on his behalf.

"1MDB scandal: The playboys, PMs and partygoers","It is one of the world's greatest financial scandals. Billions of dollars from a state fund meant to help the Malaysian people went missing, disappearing into the shadows of the global financial system. According to US and Malaysian prosecutors, the money lined the pockets of a few powerful individuals and was used to buy luxury real estate, a private jet, Van Gogh and Monet artworks - and to finance a Hollywood blockbuster. Outcry over the alleged looting of 1MDB has reverberated around the world, with authorities in at least six countries probing a vast web of financial transactions stretching from Swiss banks to island tax havens to the heart of South East Asia. The scandal even led to the toppling of the political party that governed Malaysia for all of its history as an independent nation. Goldman Sachs, one of Wall Street's most powerful banks, is facing criminal charges in Malaysia - which it says it intends to vigorously defend. Meanwhile a fugitive playboy charged in the US and Malaysia remains on the run - his infamous $250m luxury super yacht now in the hands of authorities. All eyes are now on the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, where former prime minister and ex-chairman of 1MDB's advisory board Najib Razak is on trial in the first of several cases against him. The cast of characters around the 1MDB scandal paints a picture of a truly global saga - from the journalists who doggedly followed the money to the international elite alleged to have profited. At the centre of this story is Malaysia's former prime minister: the once untouchable man who set up a ""bold and daring"" sovereign fund in 2009 to propel his nation's economic development - only to see it bring him and his political dynasty down in disgrace nine years later. To truly understand Najib Razak is to examine his roots. The eldest son of Malaysia's second prime minister, Abdul Razak, and also the nephew to its third, he descends from political aristocracy. When he finally became prime minister in 2009 - as the head of the party which dominated Malaysian politics for half a century - it seemed he was finally taking a pre-ordained role. An Anglophile, Mr Najib completed his secondary school education at the UK's Malvern College, a prestigious private school, before studying industrial economics at the University of Nottingham. That background and his rhetoric about the importance of ""moderate"" Islam made him a natural fit with Western contemporaries including David Cameron and Barack Obama. Once upon a time, Mr Najib and Barack Obama were golfing buddies But there were clouds above him from the very beginning of his premiership. Questions over a French submarine deal made in 2002 when he was defence minister dogged the new PM. It was alleged that some $130m in kickbacks had been paid as part of the $1.2bn deal - which Mr Najib has always denied. Thegrisly murder of a Mongolian modelwho served as an interpreter for the submarine deal raised further questions. A French investigation continues while the new Malaysian government recently re-opened its probe. Mr Najib insists he never met the woman. David Cameron and Najib Razak at 10 Downing Street (Note: Both men are no longer in power) Najib Razak established 1MDB in 2009 as a way to manage resource-rich Malaysia's wealth with strategic investments. Major red flags were raised in 2015 when it missed payments due for some of the $11bn (Â£8.3bn) it owed to banks and bondholders - although investigators and journalists had long been on the case. In July 2016the US Department of Justice filed a civil lawsuit alleging that more than $3.5bn had been plundered.,external(It later upped the figure to more than $4.5bn.) ""A number of corrupt officials,"" said then-US Attorney General Loretta Lynch, ""treated this public trust as a personal bank account"". Malaysia's tainted political aristocrat The lawsuit named alleged perpetrators but left a ""Malaysian Official 1"" unnamed. MO1, later confirmed to be Najib Razak by his own government, was alleged by US prosecutors to have received $681m in stolen funds but to have returned most of it. He was cleared of all wrongdoing by Malaysian authorities while he was in office but after his party's shock defeat at last year's general elections, the tide has dramatically shifted. Several of his apartments were raided and police seized a trove of luxury goods and $28.6m (Â£21.3m) in cash. There are currently 42 charges levelled against him for alleged corruption, money laundering and abuse of power. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and maintained his innocence -including through a soul ballad,externalperformed by him and a choir. The spending habits of Najib Razak's wife have been compared to those of Imelda Marcos and Marie Antoinette. Since her husband lost power, Rosmah Mansor, 67, has been formally charged with money-laundering and tax evasion, to which she has pleaded not guilty. Ms Rosmah's expensive tastes have been widely mocked in Malaysia, where she is harshly criticised for being out of touch with ordinary people who struggle to make ends meet. In 2018, very public police raids on properties linked to her and her husband lit up social media as images of supermarket trolleys packed with more than 500 luxury handbags, hundreds of watches, and 12,000 items of jewellery said to be worth up to $273m confirmed Malaysians' suspicions that their first family had been living wildly extravagant lives. 1MDB: Seized tiaras, cash and Hermes bags 'worth $273m' With Rosmah Mansor's larger than life persona and much noted penchant for Hermes Birkin bags, her court appearances are highly scrutinised. ""She isn't rude but she also isn't particularly friendly or bubbly. In person, she comes across as being imperious,"" says Reuters news agency's Malaysia correspondent Rozanna Latiff. ""On days Rosmah Mansor is called in for questioning, there is a lot of interest in her outfits and bags."" It's a political comeback story like no other: at 93, Mahathir Mohamad, the man who dominated Malaysian politics as prime minister in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, is back in form and leading Malaysia. His return to the political fray was motivated by one clear desire - to unseat Najib Razak, his former protÃ©gÃ©. ""I apologise to everyone, that I am the one who elevated him, the biggest mistake in my life. I want to correct that mistake,"" Mr Mahathir said on the campaign trail in early May 2018 after defecting to the opposition to take on Mr Najib. A Malaysian political drama, worthy of Shakespeare A few days later he shocked the world by defeating his former party, which had run Malaysia for more than half a century. Mr Mahathir's return has resonated well with Malaysians, many of whom champion their new government's efforts in bringing those who allegedly looted 1MDB to justice. But political observers note that the elderly statesman not only paved Mr Najib's path to power but also stood accused of authoritarianism during his own long tenure at the top. A Chinese-Malaysian financier from the bustling island of Penang, Low Taek Jho - more famously known as Jho Low - is portrayed by Malaysian and US investigators as one of the masterminds of the 1MDB scam. Despite never holding a formal position with the fund, he is alleged to have played a crucial role in its activities. And it was his savvy networking and shrewd business sense that allowed him to thrive, say journalists Bradley Hope and Tom Wright in their 2018 best-seller Billion Dollar Whale, which recounts Jho Low's alleged exploits. ""Jho Low is the most interesting person in the 1MDB affair, a mysterious master of ceremonies,"" Hope told the BBC. ""It became clear very early on he was the connecting point between everyone involved in the 1MDB fund - and the only one with a 360-degree view of the multi-billion dollar scheme."" US prosecutors say Mr Low leveraged his powerful political connections to win business for 1MDB through the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes.Billions, they say, were laundered through the US financial system,externaland used to buy some of the world's most expensive real estate, coveted artwork, and finance Hollywood films. Behold: Jho Low's infamous $250m luxury mega-yacht, The Equanimity This was a man known for mixing business with a great deal of pleasure. Lavish parties and high-profile friendships with Arab royalty and A-list celebrities fuelled his quick rise to the top. Britney Spears even popped out of his birthday cake at a 2012 Vegas bash. The reporters speculate in their book that at one point, Jho Low may have had access to more liquid cash than almost anyone else on earth. 1MDB: The United States v The Wolf of Wall Street But the fall of Najib Razak's government proved to be bad news for Mr Low. Criminal charges were filed and he is now wanted in several countries. His current whereabouts are unknown buthe maintains his innocence through statements on his official website,external. His lawyers say he cannot get a fair trial in Malaysia. ""Jho Low is driven but he is also both meticulous and terribly sloppy. He was frantically building an empire with money that wasn't his and in the end, his whole scheme became desperate and unsustainable,"" Hope said. This slick German banker represented one of the world's most powerful financial institutions, Goldman Sachs, at a time that the bank was charging into Asia. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Timothy Leissner's deal-making in South East Asia (Malaysia in particular) netted the bank significant revenues and he rose to become the company's chairman in the region. But the biggest deals would come when he crossed paths with Jho Low - alleged to be the power player behind 1MDB. Goldman had previously rejected Mr Low as a client, after compliance officials raised concerns about the source of his money. But, according to a US indictment, Mr Leissner and another Goldman banker, Roger Ng, used Mr Low's powerful connections to obtain business for Goldman. The bank is alleged to have earned an eye-popping $600m in fees for arranging and underwriting three bond sales to raise $6.5bn for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013. Mr Leissner has pleaded guilty to US charges of conspiring to launder money and violating anti-corruption laws by bribing foreign officials. Goldman's role in the 1MDB scandal in 300 words Goldman bosses charged in Malaysia bond scandal Malaysia has also filed charges against him, Mr Ng and 17 other former and current Goldman bankers. The bank itself has also been charged. Goldman Sachs denies wrongdoing. It has called the Malaysian charges against it and the 17 people ""misdirected"" and vowed to ""vigorously defend them"".It has sought to portray Mr Leissner, who it suspended in 2016, as having gone rogue,externaland has apologised for his behaviour. But the Malaysian government has rejected the apology and called for the bank to cough up $7.5bn in reparations. Mr Ng, who left Goldman in 2014, denies all the charges against him. Money talks but does the power of celebrity speak louder? The 1MDB scandal hasn't just been about powerful politicians and financiers: fugitive businessman Jho Low often partied with Hollywood's A-list. None of them are accused of any wrongdoing whatsoever, but their social connections with Mr Low have been the subject of media reports. ThatLeonardo DiCaprio movie The Oscar-winning actor starred in 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street, co-produced and financed by Riza Aziz, son of Rosmah Mansor and Najib Razak's step-son. The Martin Scorsese film about greed and corruption bagged DiCaprio a prestigious Golden Globe award for Best Actor - and he thanked both Mr Aziz and Mr Low by name in his acceptance speech. US prosecutors said misappropriated 1MDB money was used to finance the film, and the production company Red Granite paid $60m to settle a civil lawsuit with the US government. The company denies any wrongdoing. But Mr Aziz was arrested in Malaysia in July 2019 and faces trial on five charges of money laundering. He is alleged to have received nearly $250m of misappropriated 1MDB funds. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. DiCaprio, meanwhile, has pledged to assist US authorities and has handed over a Picasso painting allegedly gifted to him by Mr Low. Musician friends Kasseem Dean (aka Swizz Beatz) and Alicia Keys The ambitious record producer and his superstar wife were once part of Jho Low's inner circle, often photographed at his notoriously swanky parties. Dean performed at Mr Low's infamous 31st birthday celebrations (the one with Britney in the cake). Music's biggest night and Jho Low was there with Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys - in 2014 The musician is also credited with introducing Mr Low to the moneyed art world, where he is alleged to have bought works including a Van Gogh drawing and two Monet paintings with 1MDB funds. Partying with Paris Hilton Another member of the famed inner circle, the hotel heiress reportedly met Mr Low in 2009. They were often seen together in paparazzi pictures (and selfies), partying it up around the world - from the gambling tables of Vegas to the ski slopes of Whistler and balmy Saint-Tropez. Romancing Miranda Kerr and Elva Hsiao What do an Australian supermodel and a Taiwanese singer and actress have in common? Both women were once linked to Jho Low. After a series of extravagant dates (including sailing around Europe for 10 days) Mr Low showered Miranda Kerr, one of the world's highest-paid supermodels, with out-of-this-world gifts: an acrylic, see-through grand piano (worth up to $1m) and an 11-carat diamond necklace and matching earrings. She has since turned over millions in jewellery to US prosecutors. Mr Low took Taiwanese singer Elva Hsiao on a million-dollar date to Dubai, where they dined on a private beach, according to Billion Dollar Whale. The 1MDB saga would never have come to light without the tenacious work of journalists who pursued the story for years, breaking bombshell after bombshell and forcing the fund's dealings into scrutiny. Clare Rewcastle-Brown, The Sarawak Report More than a decade ago this Malaysian-born, British journalist began investigating Malaysia's political elite from her kitchen counter in London after putting the kids to bed. Her Sarawak Report website was initially focused on shadowy dealings in one Malaysian state. But when one of 1MDB's early deals was made in Sarawak, her attention began to shift to what seemed like ""a highly suspect outfit"". At the end of 2013, she received a tip-off that Najib's step-son had produced The Wolf of Wall Street. ""That's when I started digging,"" she says. ""Just really because I couldn't resist such an obviously significant story."" As she followed the money trail, the scoops began to roll in, captivating Malaysians whose domestic media were mostly unable or unwilling to pursue the story. In early 2015, Rewcastle-Brown received a trove of more than 200,000 documents from Swiss whistleblower Xavier Justo and made a stunning allegation: that $700m had been dropped directly into a bank account belonging to a Jho Low-controlled company as part of a 1MDB deal. A few months later - under the headline ""SENSATIONAL FINDINGS!"" - she published details alleging that nearly $700m had been deposited in the prime minister's bank accounts in 2013. The Malaysian authorities blocked her website and issued a warrant for her arrest. ""I had people all over the world who would contact me with information. Obviously it would be my job to stand it up if I could,"" she said. ""At the height of this there were people being hired to muscle me in London, follow me and photograph me... I had to go to the police."" Tom Wright and Bradley Hope, The Wall Street Journal Their 2018 offering Billion Dollar Whale meticulously detailed Jho Low's alleged exploits and became an instant bestseller in Malaysia. But Tom Wright and Bradley Hope have been investigating the 1MDB money trail for years at the Wall Street Journal. ""News stories don't typically go beyond 2,000 words and it felt like we were cutting out a lot of fascinating details [from the saga],"" said Hope. ""We knew people were having a hard time following the scandal and there was a bigger, more colourful story to do about Jho Low specifically."" Hope said their book crystallised how bad the scandal was for Malaysia. ""There was so much noise and misinformation out there,"" he said. ""To see it all laid out in one place, fact by fact, made it very clear that 1MDB had become one of the world's biggest financial scandals. Billion Dollar Whale shows how it developed chronologically and brought the issue home for many Malaysians."" The book may have also increased global pressure in the search for Jho Low (now wanted in several countries). ""Readers have sent us letters and politicians [Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng] have even used and referenced our book to explain the issues surrounding 1MDB,"" Hope said. ""Billion Dollar Whale is starting to filter through around the world and people who have never heard of 1MDB tell us they were utterly engrossed by it."" The Edge Malaysia If you read nothing but Malaysian newspapers and only watched local TV news reports at the height of the 1MDB scandal in 2015, you'd be fooled into believing all was well in the country. Malaysian journalists and editors learned quickly that reports about the sovereign fund's scandals courted danger and would risk their operating licences. But there were those who persisted and paid the price. The Edge Media Group was one. The Edge's newspapers published investigations into 1MDB's activities and had its newspapers' publishing licences suspended over what was deemed as ""reporting that could affect public order"". ""This is nothing more than a move to shut us down in order to shut us up,"" publisher Ho Kay Tat said at the time. Leading the charge against 1MDB in Malaysia is lawmaker Tony Pua, who raised constant questions while in opposition under Najib Razak's government. His party is now in power but Mr Pua remains unashamedly vocal in his disdain for the former PM. ""Najib Razak is the ultimate culprit. When confusion arises over his statements I will pop in to steer things in the right direction,"" he told the BBC on the sidelines of a visit in Singapore. Also political secretary to Malaysia's finance minister, who is leading 1MDB investigations, Mr Pua said he remains focused on ""fixing damage done to the economy"". ""The financial scandal is in the past and there are no more shenanigans, it's the clean-up process now,"" he said. ""We need to bring about economic growth and closing the 1MDB chapter is a big part of that."" The 'great-grandmother of financial scandals' comes to China The colourful politician, who hails from Johor state,often takes to YouTube,externalto lament the scandal. ""I know the facts and I articulate them,"" he said. ""I get information from documents and informants and piece them together to tell the story of what's actually happening."" But he says Mr Najib's trials are ""just the beginning"" and the judicial process could go on for years. ""The jigsaw is almost complete but there are a few missing pieces. And I believe Najib Razak's trial will reveal some."" Najib Razak is expected to face several trials in Malaysia. If found guilty of the many offences he is charged with, Mr Najib could spend decades in prison. Jho Low remains at large. Graphics by Davies Surya and Arvin Supriyadi in Jakarta. Â© 2025 BBC.

UK gaming market worth record ÃÂ£5.7bn,"The UK gaming market is now worth a record Â£5.7bn - in part thanks to titles like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite. The two online-only games, released in 2018, helped push revenues for gaming software to a record Â£2bn - according to Ukie, the trade body for UK gaming which compiles the figures. Consoles continue to sell well despite no new systems being released in 2018. But virtual reality has had a tougher time - with sales down 20% since 2017. It's due to early adopters of virtual reality awaiting the next generation of VR headsets, says Ukie (short for the Association of Interactive Entertainment). Game pie: Scroll down to see how the biggest slice - software - breaks down A bad year for VR didn't affect the gaming hardware market too much though - it still saw growth of more than 10%. The success of gaming isn't that surprising, given gaming is nowworth more than movies and music combined. A report in January said gaming was worth Â£3.86bn ($4.85bn) - but those figures didn't include mobile and free games. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

No deal now more likely - Barnier,"This video can not be played Barnier: ""No-deal Brexit has become more likely"" A no-deal Brexit is now more likely but can still be avoided, the EU's chief negotiator has said. Michel Barnier said a long extension to the UK's 12 April exit date had ""significant risks for the EU"" and a ""strong justification would be needed"". Meanwhile, the BBC's John Pienaar said Theresa May's cabinet has considered plans to ""ramp up"" preparations for a no-deal Brexit. A snap general election was also discussed in the meeting, he said. A second two-hour regular cabinet meeting will be held later, with the issues likely to be discussed again. It comes afterMPs voted on four alternativesto the PM's withdrawal deal, but none gained a majority. What could happen next? How did my MP vote on Brexit options? What does a soft Brexit mean? How could Brexit be delayed? In the Commons votes on Monday, MPs rejected a customs union with the EU by three votes. A motion for another referendum got the most votes in favour, but still lost. Theso-called indicative voteswere not legally binding, but they had been billed as the moment when Parliament might finally compromise. That did not happen, and one Tory MP - Nick Boles, who was behind one of the proposals - resigned the whip in frustration. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told MPs that if they wanted to secure a further delay from the EU, the government must put forward a ""credible proposition"". One suggestion has been the possibility of a general election - but former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that would be likely to ""infuriate"" voters. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Instead, Mr Johnson said he believed a new leader and ""change in negotiation tactic"" could ""retrofit"" the PM's ""terrible"" agreement with the EU. Speaking on Tuesday morning, Mr Barnier said: ""No deal was never our desire or intended scenario but the EU 27 is now prepared. It becomes day after day more likely."" Mr Barnier told the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee that ""things are somewhat hanging on the decisions of the House of Commons"", and that the deal was negotiated with the UK ""not against the UK"". ""If we are to avoid a no-deal Brexit, there is only one way forward - they have got to vote on a deal. ""There is only one treaty available - this one,"" he said, waving the withdrawal agreement. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the way forward was to address the controversial Irish backstop - a measure to avoid the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. He said the most ""constructive outcome"" would be the Malthouse Compromise - which includes extending the transition period for a year until the end of 2021 and protecting EU citizens' rights, instead of using the backstop. But the Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom said the prime minister's deal was the best option. ""The compromise option, the one that delivers on the EU referendum but at the same time enables us to accommodate the wishes of those who wanted to remain in the EU - that is the best compromise,"" she said. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Labour MP and chairman of the Brexit select committee Hilary Benn told Today that a confirmatory referendum was the best solution. ""A good leader would be taking that decision and put it back to the people,"" he said. ""[The] fear is that the PM is not going to move an inch. That is why we are at a moment of crisis."" Mrs May's plan for the UK's departure has been rejected by MPs three times. Last week, Parliament took control of the process away from the government in order to hold a series of votes designed to find an alternative way forward. Eight options were put to MPs,but none was able to command a majority, and on Monday night, a whittled-down four were rejected too. This video can not be played Nick Boles: ""I have failed, chiefly, because my party refuses to compromise"" Those pushing for a customs union argued that their option was defeated by the narrowest margin - only three votes. It would see the UK remain in the same system of tariffs - taxes - on goods as the rest of the EU,potentially simplifying the issue of the Northern Ireland border,but prevent the UK from striking independent trade deals with other countries. Those in favour of another EU referendum pointed out that the motion calling for that option received the most votes in favour, totalling 280. For months, Parliament has been saying ""Let us have a say, let us find the way forward,"" but in the end they couldn't quite do it. Parliament doesn't know what it wants and we still have lots of different tribes and factions who aren't willing to make peace. That means that by the day, two things are becoming more likely. One, leaving the EU without a deal. And two, a general election, because we're at an impasse. One person who doesn't think that would be a good idea is former foreign secretary and Brexiteer Boris Johnson. He told me going to the polls would ""solve nothing"" and would ""just infuriate people"". He also said that only somebody who ""really believes in Brexit"" should be in charge once Theresa May steps down. I wonder who that could be...

Islanders' fears for lifeline flights,"This video can not be played The flight helps connect islanders with education and medical services Islanders in the Inner Hebrides have told of their concerns about the lifeline air service they rely on. Argyll and Bute Council has had to re-tender its public obligation service (PSO) flights between Oban and the islands of Colonsay, Coll and Tiree. The situation arose in February because the council said the price from the only bidder, Hebridean Air Service, exceeded a new, lower contract ceiling. Islanders fear there will be a gap in provision during the tendering process. Isles' flights to be disrupted for weeks The flights are used by children to get to school on the mainland and by visiting health professionals. Alison Jones uses the service once a week so her son Harris, the only four-year-old on Coll, can be educated with other children the same age as him. Secondary school pupils also use the service to get to and from high school in Oban. Alison and her son Harris are regular users of the service Alison said: ""It's absolutely vital for us. This is the school bus. ""You can do 50 miles in 30 minutes compared to a ferry in almost three hours."" Jill Rae, practice manager at Coll Medical Practice, said the flights were frequently used by medical staff not readily available on the island. She said: ""We have physiotherapists, podiatrists, health workers and midwives who come over and they can do it for the day, but cannot stay overnight. That service, I fear, we would lose."" Jill Rae says the service is vital to visiting health professionals Paula Smalley, of Coll's community council, said she could not remember a time when the community had felt so exposed. The island has already lost its dentist service, no longer has a dedicated nurse and young adults have been leaving the isle. Paula said: ""We are as a community extremely concerned about the future of our island. ""When you have no youngsters there is no future and with this constant erosion of services it's not very encouraging."" Hebridean Air Service bid to continue providing the flights linking islands to Oban on the mainland Argyll and Bute Council said it recognised the importance of the islands air service. A spokeswoman said: ""The contract for the vital air services from Oban to the islands of Tiree, Coll and Colonsay is out to tender and we remain committed to working towards a solution."" Paula Smalley says the community is concerned about the future of Coll In February, a spokesman from Hebridean Air Services said: ""For the avoidance of any doubt Hebridean Air Services tendered for the renewal of this service from 16 May 2019 onwards. ""We were advised that the procurement process was abandoned on the grounds that the bids received exceeded the funds that Argyll and Bute Council has assigned to operate the service. ""We are continuing to have a dialogue with Argyll and Bute Council and sincerely hope that an agreement can be reached which means services are not disrupted.""

UK gaming market worth record Â£5.7bn,"The UK gaming market is now worth a record Â£5.7bn - in part thanks to titles like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite. The two online-only games, released in 2018, helped push revenues for gaming software to a record Â£2bn - according to Ukie, the trade body for UK gaming which compiles the figures. Consoles continue to sell well despite no new systems being released in 2018. But virtual reality has had a tougher time - with sales down 20% since 2017. It's due to early adopters of virtual reality awaiting the next generation of VR headsets, says Ukie (short for the Association of Interactive Entertainment). Game pie: Scroll down to see how the biggest slice - software - breaks down A bad year for VR didn't affect the gaming hardware market too much though - it still saw growth of more than 10%. The success of gaming isn't that surprising, given gaming is nowworth more than movies and music combined. A report in January said gaming was worth Â£3.86bn ($4.85bn) - but those figures didn't include mobile and free games. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Movies like Tomb Raider and Rampage, that were both released in 2018, lifted revenues for game-related films to more than Â£23m - up by 34%. Money made from areas including toys, merchandise and books - a wider category which Ukie calls ""game culture"" - was down. The closure of Toys-R-Us is said to have had a ""significant"" impact on sales. Fortnite might be an online-only game, but you can still get real-life Fortnite toys But the big picture is ""another year of record growth"" for the gaming industry, according to Ukie CEO Dr Jo Twist.

"Vaginal mesh ban can end 'with changes'Some women have been left in permanent pain - unable to walk, work or have sex - after having the implants.Health","The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and to support organs Controversial vaginal mesh implants can be offered again on the NHS in England once certain conditions are met, health watchdog NICE has said. Some women have been left unable to walk, work or have sex after having the implants, which are used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence. Use of vaginal meshwas halted across the UK last yearamid safety concerns. NICE said operations must be performed by specialist surgeons at specialist centres before their reintroduction. All instances - and outcomes - of vaginal mesh operations should also be recorded on a national database ""to help with future decision-making"", it said. The NHS is not compelled to act on the guidelines - which are for England only - and the ""pause"" on vaginal mesh surgery remains in place. But services are expected to take NICE recommendations into account when planning and delivering care. Hernia mesh complications 'affect 100,000' Hundreds suing NHS over vaginal implants Under the new guidelines, each patient would receive a ""decision aid"" - detailing all the latest evidence on available treatments - and mesh implants would be used only after non-surgical options, such as lifestyle changes and pelvic floor training, had failed. NICE said the ""limited evidence"" meant ""the true prevalence of long-term complications following surgery with mesh is unknown"". Owen Smith said he had ""serious concerns"" women would not be made aware of the potential risks But Labour MP Owen Smith, who chairs a cross-party group of MPs on surgical mesh implants, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he was ""deeply disappointed"". ""The updated guidelines appear to disregard mesh-injured women's experiences by stating that there is no long-term evidence of adverse effects,"" he said. ""Thousands of women have faced life-changing injuries following mesh surgery and they must not be ignored."" He said the suspension of vaginal mesh should continue until an independent review - led by Baroness Julia Cumberlege - publishes its findings later this year. Baroness Cumberlege agreed, saying her team has set ""five conditions that would need to be met before the pause could be lifted and the use of mesh could be contemplated"". ""Those conditions have not yet been met and it is clear to us that it will be some considerable time before they are. ""This means that, now and for the foreseeable future, mesh should not be used to treat stress urinary incontinence, either in the NHS or the independent sector. ""The scale and intensity of this tragedy is truly shocking - lives have been ruined."" Studies suggestas many as one in 10,externalpatients can experience complications including chronic pain and difficulties walking. Jackie could no longer work because of the pain caused by her implant Jackie Cheetham says she has tried to kill herself on several occasions because of the complications caused by her mesh implant. ""I have constant pain in my groin and down my leg,"" she says. ""I don't sleep at night. I can't walk far. We've lost our house, as I couldn't work anymore. ""It almost cost me my marriage. ""I have tried to overdose several times. I felt like an unfit mother. I couldn't work and I thought, 'What's the point?'"" Ms Cheetham says when she had the implant - to treat incontinence - she was given a leaflet by her surgeon ""but it definitely didn't say I would be left in lifelong pain"". And despite surgery to remove it, some mesh still remains inside her. Campaign group Sling the Mesh founder Kath Sansom said the NICE guidelines were effectively ""no different from what was published in 2003"", something that NICE disputes. ""They are so weak - they clear the way for the next generation of women to be harmed,"" she said. Kath Sansom said adversely-affected women had been ""ignored"" ""We told our stories and NICE ignored us. ""Our Sling The Mesh survey shows one in 20 women have attempted suicide and more than half have regular suicidal thoughts because of chronic pain, loss of sex life, constant infections and autoimmune disease."" The mesh is made of a polypropolene, a type of plastic An official at England's Department of Health and Social Care said: ""NICE's new guidelines and patient decision aids on managing urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse will help women make more informed choices about their treatment. ""The use of vaginal mesh was paused to ensure that patients receive a high-quality and consistent service. ""Mesh will still be a treatment for some women who understand the risks and following discussions with their consultant."" The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the British Society of Urogynaecology (BSUG) said they welcomed NICE's recommendation ""that the full range of non-surgical options should be offered to women before any surgical procedures"" and ""fully endorse"" NICE's patient decision aids. But they added it was ""important to note"" that a period of ""high-vigilance"" remained regarding the implants' use.

Jury discharged in National Action trialJack Renshaw admitted preparing an act of terrorism but denied membership of National Action.Liverpool,"This video can not be played Jack Renshaw admitted plotting to kill an MP but denied membership of National Action A man who plotted the murder of an MP will not face a retrial for membership of a banned neo-Nazi group. Jack Renshaw, from Skelmersdale in Lancashire, bought a machete to kill Labour's Rosie Cooper and a police officer against whom he had a grudge. The 23-year-old admitted preparing an act of terrorism but denied membership of National Action. After a seven-week retrial, the Old Bailey jury said it was unable to reach a unanimous or majority verdict. It can now be reported for the first time that Renshaw was last year convicted of grooming two adolescent boys online for sex. The neo-Nazi paedophile who plotted to kill During the first Old Bailey trial last year, he admitted a terrorist plot to murder Ms Cooper with a 19in (48cm) Gladius knife. He also pleaded guilty to making a threat to kill detective Victoria Henderson, who was investigating him for sexual offences. Renshaw's terrorist plot, for which he will be sentenced on 17 May, was foiled after a whistleblower - former National Action member Robbie Mullen - warned the anti-racism charity Hope not Hate, which then informed police. Labour MP Rosie Cooper said she ""was to be murdered to send a message to the state"" Ms Cooper said: ""I was targeted, not as Rosie Cooper the person, but as Rosie Cooper the MP. I was to be murdered to send a message to the state. ""Our way of life, our democracy and our freedoms are being attacked by the likes of Renshaw and extremist groups like National Action."" ""We've got to do so much more to protect our democracy,"" she added. The retrial jury was also unable to decide whether Andrew Clarke, 34, of Prescot, Merseyside, and Michal Trubini, 36, of Warrington, Cheshire, remained members of National Action after it was proscribed in December 2016. The British group, founded in 2013, was banned three years later under anti-terror laws. Jurors, who had deliberated for more than 48 hours, have been discharged. The prosecution said it would not be seeking a third trial. Jack Renshaw denied being a member of National Action Renshaw had set out his murder plot during a meeting in a Warrington pub on 1 July 2017. Jurors heard those present included Renshaw and Clarke. Mr Trubini, a Slovakian national who came to the UK over a decade ago, had been present earlier in the evening. Last summer, a jury was unable to decide whether Renshaw, Clarke and Mr Trubini had remained members of National Action. Hope not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles said he owed a ""great debt of gratitude"" to whistleblower Mr Mullen for his bravery and putting ""his own life in danger"". He said National Action was part of a ""more extreme breed of neo-Nazis that vilified Jews... encouraged violence and... wanted to ignite a race war in Britain"". Renshaw had earlier been convicted at Preston Crown Court of four counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He had groomed two boys - aged between 13 and 15 at time - using a fake Facebook profile. He had claimed Hope Not Hate wanted to discredit him and maliciously hacked his mobile phones to send messages of a sexual nature to the teenagers. But jurors did not believe him and he was jailed for 16 months in June 2018. Renshaw also received a three-year prison sentence two months earlier when he was found guilty by a different jury at the same court of stirring up racial hatred after he called for the genocide of Jewish people.

Second woman accuses Biden of misconduct,"Joe Biden, 76, served as Barack Obama's vice-president from 2009-17 A second woman has accused former US Vice-President Joe Biden of inappropriate touching, as the leading Democrat mulls a White House bid. Amy Lappos said Mr Biden had touched her face with both hands and rubbed noses with her a decade ago. The allegation comes after another women, Lucy Flores, said Mr Biden kissed her on the back of her head at a campaign event. Mr Biden has said he did not believe he has ever acted inappropriately. The former Delaware senator, who served as Barack Obama's vice-president in 2009-17, is seen as a possible front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Some leading Democrats have publicly supported Ms Flores, while House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the allegations should not rule out a 2020 run. Ms Lappos, a 43-year-old former aide to a Democratic congressman, said Mr Biden touched her inappropriately at a fundraiser in a private home in Hartford, Connecticut, in 2009. She told the Hartford Courant,externalthe then vice-president entered the kitchen to thank a group of aides, before wrapping both hands around Ms Lappos' face and pulling her in to rub noses with her. Ms Lappos called on Mr Biden not to run for the White House, saying: ""Uninvited affection is not okay. Objectifying women is not okay."" Ms Flores' allegations first appeared on Friday in an article she wrote for The Cut magazine,external. Lucy Flores alleges Mr Biden kissed her on the back of the head ahead of a 2014 campaign event Ms Flores was running as the Democratic candidate for Nevada's lieutenant governor in 2014 when Mr Biden flew in to support her bid. As she prepared to go on stage, Ms Flores say Mr Biden placed two hands on her shoulders from behind, smelled her hair then planted ""a big slow kiss on the back of my head"". Asked about the new allegation, a spokesman for Mr Biden referred reporters to a statement he issued on Sunday. ""In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once - never - did I believe I acted inappropriately,"" it read. ""But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will,"" he added. Mr Biden and President Obama were known for their close friendship, often seen playing golf and attending sports events together. Mr Biden even said that Mr Obama offered him financial help when his son was ill. For his vice president's birthday in 2017,Mr Obama posted a photo of the two of them on Twitter,external, writing that Mr Biden was his ""brother and the best vice president anybody could have"". On Monday a spokesman for Mr Biden also accused ""right wing trolls"" of presenting harmless images of the former vice president interacting with women over the years as evidence of inappropriate touching. By Katty Kay, Presenter, BBC World News in Washington Former Vice-President Joe Biden's reported behaviour is what used to be described as ""touchy feely"". He is known to be physical, with everyone. He is also known as one of the most empathetic politicians around - the guy who calls when you have a problem, and just listens. But now two women say the ""touchy"" behaviour was a problem and the ""feely"" behaviour was inappropriate. This needs context. Physical contact with supporters has been a necessary part of political campaigning for decades. The candidate who tries to run for office and refuses all physical contact with voters would soon be dismissed as cold and aloof. So clearly there's a line politicians have to walk. Physical but not in the wrong way. And I'd posit that most women know exactly which side of the line any physical contact falls on - appropriate or inappropriate. We just know it. And women my generation put up with inappropriate contact for years, assuming it was part of the cost of having a job in a largely male environment. Younger women are less tolerant. Thank God. They have much less tolerance for men behaving badly. In many ways this is a story of generational differences. A number of candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have backed Ms Flores. Senator Elizabeth Warren said Mr Biden ""needs to give an answer"", and Senator Amy Klobuchar said that in politics ""people raise issues and they have to address them"". Asked how the allegations might affect Mr Biden's possible future presidential bid, Ms Pelosi told Politico: ""I don't think it's disqualifying."" But she added: ""He has to understand in the world that we're in now that people's space is important to them, and what's important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it."" This video can not be played Has Mr Biden publicly announced his presidential bid? Support for Mr Biden was voiced by Cynthia Hogan, a former aide to the vice-president, who told the New York Times that he ""treated us with respect and insisted that others do the same"". An ally of Mr Biden told CNN he was not reconsidering a run for the White House following the allegations but stressed he had yet to make a decision. Mr Biden has yet to jump into the race, but plenty have. So who else has a shot at becoming the next president?

'Change the law to spare me a painful death',"This video can not be played 'I want to be able to choose when I die' A woman facing a painful death said she wants the law changed to give the terminally ill assistance to die. Kay Smith, 54, has a lethal mix of untreatable conditions which means she can expect to die from sepsis. She said she does not want her family to watch her suffering as she dies. She is supporting a campaign being launched on Tuesday which is calling for legislation to allow patients to make an informed decision over when they die. The pressure group behind the campaign, Dignity in Dying, defines assisted dying as allowing a terminally ill person to have a choice over the manner and timing of their imminent death. Opponents of the moves say more money should be spent on palliative care In contrast to euthanasia and assisted suicide, assisted dying would only apply to terminally ill people. Similar attempts tochange the law have previously failed to get through the Scottish Parliament- and opponents have argued that the risks are too high. Dignity in Dying said patients should be allowed a prescription which could end their life, and be allowed assistance to take it if necessary, without the risk of any prosecution. It said a poll it commissioned suggested almost 90% of Scots believed dying people should not be forced to suffer at the end of their lives. Kay Smith does not want her family to watch her suffer Ms Smith, a former palliative care nurse who is now a palliative patient herself, has Lupus - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) - as well as a condition that makes her severely allergic to pain medication and antibiotics. She knows that she is likely to contract an infection and die of sepsis that could not be treated because of her fatal reaction to medication. At the campaign launch on Tuesday, she will urge Holyrood to introduce safe and compassionate laws to allow terminally ill, mentally competent adults the choice of an assisted death. Speaking to BBC Scotland ahead of the launch, she said she respects that assisted dying was ""not everybody's choice"", and that ""some people will allow nature to take its course"". Ms Smith, of Kilwinning, Ayrshire, said: ""I could have the choice to have an assisted death and be surrounded by love and go before it got too bad. ""Instead of my body rotting away from my extremities up, and my children and husband having to watch that... sepsis is not a nice death."" Without a change in the law, she says she could face up to 10 ""extremely awful"" days at the end of her life, during which she would endure great pain. She wants to avoid these last days of pain by choosing to end her life just before this. What is assisted dying? How is it different from euthanasia or assisted suicide? Because of her health conditions, doctors may be able to sedate her but would not be able to offer painkillers. She fears the experience of watching their mother die in such circumstances would traumatise her children. ""I don't want to leave that legacy. The last thing I want to do is leave them with a permanent horrible memory of my death"", she said. It is estimated one person every eight days travels from the UK to the Swiss clinic Dignitas to end their life. But many people seeking an assisted death cannot afford the Â£10,000-trip, and some are too ill to make the journey. Ally Thomson, Scottish director of Dignity in Death, said clinics abroad were not the answer: ""Dignitas absolutely outsources this problem, really - the current law is broken when people need to go to Switzerland to have a safe and dignified death. ""Most families want their loved ones to stay around for as long as possible - it's the person themselves who doesn't wish to have a bad death and doesn't want to leave things until the last minute and suffer that pain that can happen at the end of life."" Margo MacDonald campaigned for a change in the law Attempts tochange the law on this issue were made by the late MSP Margo McDonald. The idea was put before Holyrood twice, but her bills failed to receive parliamentary backing. One concern was that vulnerable people could be pressured by relatives, or even clinicians, to take an irrevocable decision. Ms Thomson said: ""We know from international examples... that that simply isn't the case. ""Once our decision-makers look at the evidence, we think they'll be very satisfied on that point."" However, Gordon Macdonald, the chief executive of the Care Not Killing umbrella group which is opposed to assisted suicide, said the last vote on the issue had seen a bill from Green MSP Patrick Harvie defeated by 82 votes to 36. ""Most members realised then that the risks of legalising assisted suicide were too high and would put vulnerable people at risk of harm,"" he said.

"1MDB scandal: The playboys, PMs and partygoersA wealth fund is alleged to have been looted of billions. The extraordinary story can be told through the characters caught up in it.","It is one of the world's greatest financial scandals. Billions of dollars from a state fund meant to help the Malaysian people went missing, disappearing into the shadows of the global financial system. According to US and Malaysian prosecutors, the money lined the pockets of a few powerful individuals and was used to buy luxury real estate, a private jet, Van Gogh and Monet artworks - and to finance a Hollywood blockbuster. Outcry over the alleged looting of 1MDB has reverberated around the world, with authorities in at least six countries probing a vast web of financial transactions stretching from Swiss banks to island tax havens to the heart of South East Asia. The scandal even led to the toppling of the political party that governed Malaysia for all of its history as an independent nation. Goldman Sachs, one of Wall Street's most powerful banks, is facing criminal charges in Malaysia - which it says it intends to vigorously defend. Meanwhile a fugitive playboy charged in the US and Malaysia remains on the run - his infamous $250m luxury super yacht now in the hands of authorities. All eyes are now on the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, where former prime minister and ex-chairman of 1MDB's advisory board Najib Razak is on trial in the first of several cases against him. The cast of characters around the 1MDB scandal paints a picture of a truly global saga - from the journalists who doggedly followed the money to the international elite alleged to have profited. At the centre of this story is Malaysia's former prime minister: the once untouchable man who set up a ""bold and daring"" sovereign fund in 2009 to propel his nation's economic development - only to see it bring him and his political dynasty down in disgrace nine years later. To truly understand Najib Razak is to examine his roots. The eldest son of Malaysia's second prime minister, Abdul Razak, and also the nephew to its third, he descends from political aristocracy. When he finally became prime minister in 2009 - as the head of the party which dominated Malaysian politics for half a century - it seemed he was finally taking a pre-ordained role. An Anglophile, Mr Najib completed his secondary school education at the UK's Malvern College, a prestigious private school, before studying industrial economics at the University of Nottingham. That background and his rhetoric about the importance of ""moderate"" Islam made him a natural fit with Western contemporaries including David Cameron and Barack Obama. Once upon a time, Mr Najib and Barack Obama were golfing buddies But there were clouds above him from the very beginning of his premiership. Questions over a French submarine deal made in 2002 when he was defence minister dogged the new PM. It was alleged that some $130m in kickbacks had been paid as part of the $1.2bn deal - which Mr Najib has always denied. Thegrisly murder of a Mongolian modelwho served as an interpreter for the submarine deal raised further questions. A French investigation continues while the new Malaysian government recently re-opened its probe. Mr Najib insists he never met the woman. David Cameron and Najib Razak at 10 Downing Street (Note: Both men are no longer in power) Najib Razak established 1MDB in 2009 as a way to manage resource-rich Malaysia's wealth with strategic investments. Major red flags were raised in 2015 when it missed payments due for some of the $11bn (Â£8.3bn) it owed to banks and bondholders - although investigators and journalists had long been on the case. In July 2016the US Department of Justice filed a civil lawsuit alleging that more than $3.5bn had been plundered.,external(It later upped the figure to more than $4.5bn.) ""A number of corrupt officials,"" said then-US Attorney General Loretta Lynch, ""treated this public trust as a personal bank account"". Malaysia's tainted political aristocrat The lawsuit named alleged perpetrators but left a ""Malaysian Official 1"" unnamed. MO1, later confirmed to be Najib Razak by his own government, was alleged by US prosecutors to have received $681m in stolen funds but to have returned most of it. He was cleared of all wrongdoing by Malaysian authorities while he was in office but after his party's shock defeat at last year's general elections, the tide has dramatically shifted. Several of his apartments were raided and police seized a trove of luxury goods and $28.6m (Â£21.3m) in cash. There are currently 42 charges levelled against him for alleged corruption, money laundering and abuse of power. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and maintained his innocence -including through a soul ballad,externalperformed by him and a choir. The spending habits of Najib Razak's wife have been compared to those of Imelda Marcos and Marie Antoinette. Since her husband lost power, Rosmah Mansor, 67, has been formally charged with money-laundering and tax evasion, to which she has pleaded not guilty. Ms Rosmah's expensive tastes have been widely mocked in Malaysia, where she is harshly criticised for being out of touch with ordinary people who struggle to make ends meet. In 2018, very public police raids on properties linked to her and her husband lit up social media as images of supermarket trolleys packed with more than 500 luxury handbags, hundreds of watches, and 12,000 items of jewellery said to be worth up to $273m confirmed Malaysians' suspicions that their first family had been living wildly extravagant lives. 1MDB: Seized tiaras, cash and Hermes bags 'worth $273m' With Rosmah Mansor's larger than life persona and much noted penchant for Hermes Birkin bags, her court appearances are highly scrutinised. ""She isn't rude but she also isn't particularly friendly or bubbly. In person, she comes across as being imperious,"" says Reuters news agency's Malaysia correspondent Rozanna Latiff. ""On days Rosmah Mansor is called in for questioning, there is a lot of interest in her outfits and bags."" It's a political comeback story like no other: at 93, Mahathir Mohamad, the man who dominated Malaysian politics as prime minister in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, is back in form and leading Malaysia. His return to the political fray was motivated by one clear desire - to unseat Najib Razak, his former protÃ©gÃ©. ""I apologise to everyone, that I am the one who elevated him, the biggest mistake in my life. I want to correct that mistake,"" Mr Mahathir said on the campaign trail in early May 2018 after defecting to the opposition to take on Mr Najib. A Malaysian political drama, worthy of Shakespeare A few days later he shocked the world by defeating his former party, which had run Malaysia for more than half a century. Mr Mahathir's return has resonated well with Malaysians, many of whom champion their new government's efforts in bringing those who allegedly looted 1MDB to justice. But political observers note that the elderly statesman not only paved Mr Najib's path to power but also stood accused of authoritarianism during his own long tenure at the top. A Chinese-Malaysian financier from the bustling island of Penang, Low Taek Jho - more famously known as Jho Low - is portrayed by Malaysian and US investigators as one of the masterminds of the 1MDB scam. Despite never holding a formal position with the fund, he is alleged to have played a crucial role in its activities. And it was his savvy networking and shrewd business sense that allowed him to thrive, say journalists Bradley Hope and Tom Wright in their 2018 best-seller Billion Dollar Whale, which recounts Jho Low's alleged exploits. ""Jho Low is the most interesting person in the 1MDB affair, a mysterious master of ceremonies,"" Hope told the BBC. ""It became clear very early on he was the connecting point between everyone involved in the 1MDB fund - and the only one with a 360-degree view of the multi-billion dollar scheme."" US prosecutors say Mr Low leveraged his powerful political connections to win business for 1MDB through the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes.Billions, they say, were laundered through the US financial system,externaland used to buy some of the world's most expensive real estate, coveted artwork, and finance Hollywood films. Behold: Jho Low's infamous $250m luxury mega-yacht, The Equanimity This was a man known for mixing business with a great deal of pleasure. Lavish parties and high-profile friendships with Arab royalty and A-list celebrities fuelled his quick rise to the top. Britney Spears even popped out of his birthday cake at a 2012 Vegas bash. The reporters speculate in their book that at one point, Jho Low may have had access to more liquid cash than almost anyone else on earth. 1MDB: The United States v The Wolf of Wall Street But the fall of Najib Razak's government proved to be bad news for Mr Low. Criminal charges were filed and he is now wanted in several countries. His current whereabouts are unknown buthe maintains his innocence through statements on his official website,external. His lawyers say he cannot get a fair trial in Malaysia. ""Jho Low is driven but he is also both meticulous and terribly sloppy. He was frantically building an empire with money that wasn't his and in the end, his whole scheme became desperate and unsustainable,"" Hope said. This slick German banker represented one of the world's most powerful financial institutions, Goldman Sachs, at a time that the bank was charging into Asia. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Timothy Leissner's deal-making in South East Asia (Malaysia in particular) netted the bank significant revenues and he rose to become the company's chairman in the region. But the biggest deals would come when he crossed paths with Jho Low - alleged to be the power player behind 1MDB. Goldman had previously rejected Mr Low as a client, after compliance officials raised concerns about the source of his money. But, according to a US indictment, Mr Leissner and another Goldman banker, Roger Ng, used Mr Low's powerful connections to obtain business for Goldman. The bank is alleged to have earned an eye-popping $600m in fees for arranging and underwriting three bond sales to raise $6.5bn for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013. Mr Leissner has pleaded guilty to US charges of conspiring to launder money and violating anti-corruption laws by bribing foreign officials. Goldman's role in the 1MDB scandal in 300 words Goldman bosses charged in Malaysia bond scandal Malaysia has also filed charges against him, Mr Ng and 17 other former and current Goldman bankers. The bank itself has also been charged. Goldman Sachs denies wrongdoing. It has called the Malaysian charges against it and the 17 people ""misdirected"" and vowed to ""vigorously defend them"".It has sought to portray Mr Leissner, who it suspended in 2016, as having gone rogue,externaland has apologised for his behaviour. But the Malaysian government has rejected the apology and called for the bank to cough up $7.5bn in reparations. Mr Ng, who left Goldman in 2014, denies all the charges against him. Money talks but does the power of celebrity speak louder? The 1MDB scandal hasn't just been about powerful politicians and financiers: fugitive businessman Jho Low often partied with Hollywood's A-list. None of them are accused of any wrongdoing whatsoever, but their social connections with Mr Low have been the subject of media reports. ThatLeonardo DiCaprio movie The Oscar-winning actor starred in 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street, co-produced and financed by Riza Aziz, son of Rosmah Mansor and Najib Razak's step-son. The Martin Scorsese film about greed and corruption bagged DiCaprio a prestigious Golden Globe award for Best Actor - and he thanked both Mr Aziz and Mr Low by name in his acceptance speech. US prosecutors said misappropriated 1MDB money was used to finance the film, and the production company Red Granite paid $60m to settle a civil lawsuit with the US government. The company denies any wrongdoing. But Mr Aziz was arrested in Malaysia in July 2019 and faces trial on five charges of money laundering. He is alleged to have received nearly $250m of misappropriated 1MDB funds. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. DiCaprio, meanwhile, has pledged to assist US authorities and has handed over a Picasso painting allegedly gifted to him by Mr Low. Musician friends Kasseem Dean (aka Swizz Beatz) and Alicia Keys The ambitious record producer and his superstar wife were once part of Jho Low's inner circle, often photographed at his notoriously swanky parties. Dean performed at Mr Low's infamous 31st birthday celebrations (the one with Britney in the cake). Music's biggest night and Jho Low was there with Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys - in 2014 The musician is also credited with introducing Mr Low to the moneyed art world, where he is alleged to have bought works including a Van Gogh drawing and two Monet paintings with 1MDB funds. Partying with Paris Hilton Another member of the famed inner circle, the hotel heiress reportedly met Mr Low in 2009. They were often seen together in paparazzi pictures (and selfies), partying it up around the world - from the gambling tables of Vegas to the ski slopes of Whistler and balmy Saint-Tropez. Romancing Miranda Kerr and Elva Hsiao What do an Australian supermodel and a Taiwanese singer and actress have in common? Both women were once linked to Jho Low. After a series of extravagant dates (including sailing around Europe for 10 days) Mr Low showered Miranda Kerr, one of the world's highest-paid supermodels, with out-of-this-world gifts: an acrylic, see-through grand piano (worth up to $1m) and an 11-carat diamond necklace and matching earrings. She has since turned over millions in jewellery to US prosecutors. Mr Low took Taiwanese singer Elva Hsiao on a million-dollar date to Dubai, where they dined on a private beach, according to Billion Dollar Whale. The 1MDB saga would never have come to light without the tenacious work of journalists who pursued the story for years, breaking bombshell after bombshell and forcing the fund's dealings into scrutiny. Clare Rewcastle-Brown, The Sarawak Report More than a decade ago this Malaysian-born, British journalist began investigating Malaysia's political elite from her kitchen counter in London after putting the kids to bed. Her Sarawak Report website was initially focused on shadowy dealings in one Malaysian state. But when one of 1MDB's early deals was made in Sarawak, her attention began to shift to what seemed like ""a highly suspect outfit"". At the end of 2013, she received a tip-off that Najib's step-son had produced The Wolf of Wall Street. ""That's when I started digging,"" she says. ""Just really because I couldn't resist such an obviously significant story."" As she followed the money trail, the scoops began to roll in, captivating Malaysians whose domestic media were mostly unable or unwilling to pursue the story. In early 2015, Rewcastle-Brown received a trove of more than 200,000 documents from Swiss whistleblower Xavier Justo and made a stunning allegation: that $700m had been dropped directly into a bank account belonging to a Jho Low-controlled company as part of a 1MDB deal. A few months later - under the headline ""SENSATIONAL FINDINGS!"" - she published details alleging that nearly $700m had been deposited in the prime minister's bank accounts in 2013. The Malaysian authorities blocked her website and issued a warrant for her arrest. ""I had people all over the world who would contact me with information. Obviously it would be my job to stand it up if I could,"" she said. ""At the height of this there were people being hired to muscle me in London, follow me and photograph me... I had to go to the police."" Tom Wright and Bradley Hope, The Wall Street Journal Their 2018 offering Billion Dollar Whale meticulously detailed Jho Low's alleged exploits and became an instant bestseller in Malaysia. But Tom Wright and Bradley Hope have been investigating the 1MDB money trail for years at the Wall Street Journal. ""News stories don't typically go beyond 2,000 words and it felt like we were cutting out a lot of fascinating details [from the saga],"" said Hope. ""We knew people were having a hard time following the scandal and there was a bigger, more colourful story to do about Jho Low specifically."" Hope said their book crystallised how bad the scandal was for Malaysia. ""There was so much noise and misinformation out there,"" he said. ""To see it all laid out in one place, fact by fact, made it very clear that 1MDB had become one of the world's biggest financial scandals. Billion Dollar Whale shows how it developed chronologically and brought the issue home for many Malaysians."" The book may have also increased global pressure in the search for Jho Low (now wanted in several countries). ""Readers have sent us letters and politicians [Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng] have even used and referenced our book to explain the issues surrounding 1MDB,"" Hope said. ""Billion Dollar Whale is starting to filter through around the world and people who have never heard of 1MDB tell us they were utterly engrossed by it."" The Edge Malaysia If you read nothing but Malaysian newspapers and only watched local TV news reports at the height of the 1MDB scandal in 2015, you'd be fooled into believing all was well in the country. Malaysian journalists and editors learned quickly that reports about the sovereign fund's scandals courted danger and would risk their operating licences. But there were those who persisted and paid the price. The Edge Media Group was one. The Edge's newspapers published investigations into 1MDB's activities and had its newspapers' publishing licences suspended over what was deemed as ""reporting that could affect public order"". ""This is nothing more than a move to shut us down in order to shut us up,"" publisher Ho Kay Tat said at the time. Leading the charge against 1MDB in Malaysia is lawmaker Tony Pua, who raised constant questions while in opposition under Najib Razak's government. His party is now in power but Mr Pua remains unashamedly vocal in his disdain for the former PM. ""Najib Razak is the ultimate culprit. When confusion arises over his statements I will pop in to steer things in the right direction,"" he told the BBC on the sidelines of a visit in Singapore. Also political secretary to Malaysia's finance minister, who is leading 1MDB investigations, Mr Pua said he remains focused on ""fixing damage done to the economy"". ""The financial scandal is in the past and there are no more shenanigans, it's the clean-up process now,"" he said. ""We need to bring about economic growth and closing the 1MDB chapter is a big part of that."" The 'great-grandmother of financial scandals' comes to China The colourful politician, who hails from Johor state,often takes to YouTube,externalto lament the scandal. ""I know the facts and I articulate them,"" he said. ""I get information from documents and informants and piece them together to tell the story of what's actually happening."" But he says Mr Najib's trials are ""just the beginning"" and the judicial process could go on for years. ""The jigsaw is almost complete but there are a few missing pieces. And I believe Najib Razak's trial will reveal some."" Najib Razak is expected to face several trials in Malaysia. If found guilty of the many offences he is charged with, Mr Najib could spend decades in prison. Jho Low remains at large. Graphics by Davies Surya and Arvin Supriyadi in Jakarta. Â© 2025 BBC.

Taking the temperature of black holes,"Researchers at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh have developed a new formula to quickly calculate the temperature of a black hole. They say it is simple and powerful, and offers fundamental insights into space and time. The formula owes its origin to observations made on the Union Canal near Edinburgh 185 years ago. The idea that black holes have temperatures at all came as something of a surprise to researchers. They have so much mass and exert a gravitational pull so strong that nothing - not even heat or light - was expected to escape. Professor Stephen Hawking predicted black holes would emit thermal radiation However, Professor Stephen Hawking changed that. In 1974, at the age of just 32, he proposed the concept of what is now called Hawking radiation. He predicted black holes would emit thermal radiation and gradually evaporate. This is still at the frontiers of theory, with different schools of thought on the exact process. One major issue is calculating how much radiation a black hole gives out. Accuracy has proved elusive. Complex calculations have produced contradictory answers. At Heriot-Watt, Dr Fabio Biancalana and his colleagues have come up with their new formula to quickly and precisely calculate the Hawking radiation temperature from any kind of black hole. Dr Biancalala says they tested it against all published types of black holes - whether static, rotating, charged or even more exotic - and it always produced the exact Hawking temperature. A coffee mug and a doughnut are the same in topological terms The key is the mathematical discipline of topology. It deals with the properties of space - and not just outer space. Topology treats things according to the fundamental properties they possess, even if they are bent, crushed, folded or otherwise deformed. Tearing, cutting, gluing or poking holes would be cheating. One celebrated example is a coffee mug and a doughnut. In topological terms, they are the same. That's because each is a lump of stuff with a single hole in it. In theory you could even squish the mug into the shape of a doughnut if you fancied (provided you didn't mind how it tasted). ""We discovered that only the topology of black holes matters when it comes to determining Hawking radiation,"" says Dr Biancalana. ""Not the size, not the electric charge, the spacetime in which they are embedded, or how they spin around their axis. ""Black holes can be physically very different, but if they have the same topology they will emit the same amount of Hawking radiation."" In effect the new formula counts the holes of a black hole and the spacetime that surrounds it (yes, even black holes have holes in them). This information is enough to determine the temperature. Dr Biancalana calls it a ""magic formula"". ""For years scientists have been theorising about four dimensions and whether space has more dimensions we are still ignorant of, and now we know only two dimensions really matter in the description of all these astronomical monsters."" Which leads us to the banks of the Union Canal, not too far from the Heriot-Watt campus on the outskirts of Edinburgh. It was there that the Scottish engineer John Scott Russell first described what he called a ""wave of translation"" - a solitary wave that kept its shape while travelling at a constant speed. He hoped his work would lead to a better canal barge. These days - now called solitons - these waves are important in laser physics and fibre optics. The Heriot-Watt team realised that, as solitons and black holes shared identical mathematical properties, Hawking radiation would follow the same rules. Dr Biancalana says it takes us a step closer to understanding how the universe works. ""This must mean something fundamental about space and time,"" he says. ""Now we just need to find out what.""

Corden says 'chubby' actors are shut out,"Corden was speaking on David Tennant Does a Podcast With James Corden has criticised the exclusion of ""chubby"" people in films and on TV, saying they ""never really fall in love... never have sex"". Speaking on David Tennant's podcast, the TV host added that ""certainly no-one ever finds you attractive"" on screen if you are a larger size. He added that those actors are, at best, cast as the ""good"" and funny friend of someone who is attractive. Corden said being excluded from roles spurred him on to write Gavin & Stacey. He said: ""I had no idea if I'd be able to write. It came about because I had done a film with Shane Meadows, I'd done a Mike Leigh film and done Fat Friends on ITV. Corden starred in The History Boys on stage and screen ""And now I was in this play, which was the play to see [The History Boys]. And I was in this play with seven other boys who were at a similar age and a similar place in our careers. ""And pretty much every day, three or four of these boys would come in with this massive film script under their arm."" He was offered ""the hottest script"" along with two other History Boys actors, he explained. ""They both got sent the script [for the lead roles] and I got sent just two pages to play a newsagent at the start of this film. ""I really felt like people were going, 'We think you're quite good. It's just because of what you look like.' Corden attended the Vanity Fair Oscars party earlier this year with his wife, Julia Carey ""If you only watch television or films, if an alien came back and they had to take a reading on planet Earth by just watching films or TV, they would imagine that if you are chubby or fat or big, you never really fall in love, you never have sex. ""Certainly no-one really ever finds you attractive. You will be good friends with people who are attractive and often will be a great sense of comfort to them and perhaps chip in with the odd joke every now and again."" He added: ""It felt like if the world of entertainment was a big banquet table, people are like, 'There isn't a seat for you here.' ""I was like, 'If that's not going to happen then I'm going to try to make something happen for myself'."" Corden went on to write and star in the hit BBC sitcom Gavin & Stacey with Ruth Jones and now hosts The Late Late Show on CBS. He has previously touched on his frustrations on the way Hollywood represents larger people. In aninterview with Rolling Stone magazine,externalin 2016, he said: ""I could never understand when I watched romantic comedies. The notion that for some reason unattractive or heavy people don't fall in love. ""If they do, it's in some odd, kooky, roundabout way - and it's not. It's exactly the same.""

Plans for register of home-educated children,"The government is consulting on plans to launch a new register of children in England who are being educated at home. Under the plan, it would be parents' responsibility to register their child if they were not attending a state school or registered private school. Ministers say a register would help councils intervene when standards were poor or if children were at risk. The education department estimates the number of children being home educated in England has risen to 60,000. The government is also consulting on proposals that would require local authorities to provide support for home-educating families, such as teaching resources or financial contributions towards exam fees. At present, there is no mandatory registration system for families who choose to educate their children at home, although some local authorities run voluntary registration schemes. This means that the number of home-schooled children remains uncertain. Home education compulsory registration? Thousands more children are home schooled Abuse prompts home-school register call This latest call for a register is likely to anger some home-educating parents - but Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the government had a duty to make sure children were safe and receiving a good education. He said it would also help the authorities spot young people who may be: receiving a solely religious education attending an unregistered school not receiving an education at all Mr Hinds said the term ""home education"" had acquired a much broader meaning than it used to have and was now a catch-all phrase to refer to all children not in a registered school. ""So whilst this does include those actually getting a really good education at home, it also includes children who are not getting an education at all or being educated in illegal schools where they are vulnerable to dangerous influences,"" he said. ""The truth is, we just don't know. ""As a government, we have a duty to protect our young people and do our utmost to make sure they are prepared for life in modern Britain. ""That's why this register of children not in school is so important - not to crack down on those dedicated parents doing an admirable job of educating their children in their own homes but to prevent vulnerable young people from vanishing under the radar."" Rhian Joy, from Suffolk, who home educates two of her three children as they have special educational needs, told BBC News she was angered by the idea of having to sign a register. She said her eldest child had had bad experiences in school and being home educated was helping him ""blossom"". Rhian Joy and her family ""Why should I have to sign a register and have someone come into my home and question the education that I am providing for my child when it's the first type of education that's actually succeeded for him, that has not caused severe detrimental effects to his mental health?"" she asked. ""The people that will come, will they have any knowledge on special needs? ""Will they have any knowledge of his background, of what he's gone through, the fact that he has no trust for people at all any more? ""If someone is coming to my home and questioning me about the education I'm providing, who's to say that if I don't agree with what they're suggesting or saying... who then governs that? ""There is no-one to govern that. ""This isn't how it should be - we should be allowed to educate our children, because actually home education is not the easy option, home education is actually a hard option and we have done this, and lots of other parents have done this, and are succeeding and are seeing their children blossom into fantastic human beings and succeeding in life."" But the head of the schools watchdog, Ofsted, Amanda Spielman, said: ""These proposals offer an important opportunity to make sure that all children not attending school are safe and receiving an education that prepares them for adult life. ""Ofsted has long had concerns about the increasing numbers of school-age children not attending a registered school, many of whom may not be receiving a high quality education or being kept safe. Mr Hinds says the government has a duty to protect children ""We are especially concerned about children 'off-rolled' from schools and those in illegal schools. ""The new register will make it easier to detect and tackle these serious problems."" Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield said: ""The number of children who are not being educated in school has rocketed over recent years. ""For some families, educating at home will be a positive choice but many more children are falling out of school and their parents are struggling on their own."" But Cheryl Moy, founder of home educators' support groupEducational Freedom,external, said the vast majority of home educating families were highly responsible. ""The majority of families we've spoken to in the past do not welcome any further intrusion into their lives, they are legally responsible for their children and they take that responsibility seriously,"" she said. Ms Moy said that, far from being hidden away, home educated children were very visible. ""They are highly visible as everyone seems to think they have the right to quiz the parent and the child about their education, from the supermarket checkout person, to the dentist, to the neighbour, to the friend's schooled children,"" she said. And in cases where a child had been harmed, she said home education was not the root cause. ""In cases involving home-educated children, it has transpired that the child was known to doctors and social workers as being at risk and wasn't in fact home educated - they were children missing education."" The consultation - which follows a call for evidence last year to gather views from across the sector - will be open for 12 weeks until Monday 24 June. Home education compulsory registration?

Starbucks to pay staff tuition fees,"Starbucks is offering to pay tuition fees for UK staff wanting to get a degree from a US university. The coffee chain is to provide the cost of university as an employee incentive in the UK, for courses taught online by Arizona State University. A similar scheme in the US has enrolled 18,000 staff - and the UK will begin with an initial 100 places, with the promise to expand if there is demand. A spokeswoman said staff were asked about ""what matters most to them"". ""And many expressed how difficult the financial strains can be to obtain a university degree,"" she added. It will also be seen as a way of attracting and retaining staff, following warnings that coffee outlets could face recruitment problems after Brexit. The Pret A Manger coffee and sandwich chain has said that only one in 50 applicants for its jobs is British, raising concerns about staffing if there are fewer workers available from the EU. Â£7,500 tuition fees plan faces Brexit delay How tuition fees change real-life decisions Starbucks is offering to pay tuition fees for staff while they carry on working for the firm. The incentive is available for employees at all grades, as long they have worked for the firm for three months and do not already have an undergraduate degree. They would study part-time, outside of working hours, from October 2019 and have a choice of about 40 degree subjects, including economics, information technology, political science and accounting. The US version of the scheme was launched in 2014, with more than 2,400 staff now having graduated. Martin Brok, Starbucks' European president, said the firm would ""pick up the bill"" for staff who have missed out on going to university or who ""had to put their studies on hold"". Starbucks has attracted criticism over its tax affairs - but a spokeswoman said the firm paid its taxes in full and when all its companies were included, it paid corporation tax in the UK at an effective rate of 25.3%. Michael Crow, president of the Arizona State University, said the arrangement teaching staff from the coffee chain was a step towards providing ""an education to all who desire to learn"". A review of tuition fees iscurrently considering whether they are too highfor universities in England, with suggestions they could be reduced from the current Â£9,250 per year.

Second woman accuses Biden of misconductThe allegations come as the former US vice-president considers a run for the White House.US & Canada,"Joe Biden, 76, served as Barack Obama's vice-president from 2009-17 A second woman has accused former US Vice-President Joe Biden of inappropriate touching, as the leading Democrat mulls a White House bid. Amy Lappos said Mr Biden had touched her face with both hands and rubbed noses with her a decade ago. The allegation comes after another women, Lucy Flores, said Mr Biden kissed her on the back of her head at a campaign event. Mr Biden has said he did not believe he has ever acted inappropriately. The former Delaware senator, who served as Barack Obama's vice-president in 2009-17, is seen as a possible front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Some leading Democrats have publicly supported Ms Flores, while House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the allegations should not rule out a 2020 run. Ms Lappos, a 43-year-old former aide to a Democratic congressman, said Mr Biden touched her inappropriately at a fundraiser in a private home in Hartford, Connecticut, in 2009. She told the Hartford Courant,externalthe then vice-president entered the kitchen to thank a group of aides, before wrapping both hands around Ms Lappos' face and pulling her in to rub noses with her. Ms Lappos called on Mr Biden not to run for the White House, saying: ""Uninvited affection is not okay. Objectifying women is not okay."" Ms Flores' allegations first appeared on Friday in an article she wrote for The Cut magazine,external. Lucy Flores alleges Mr Biden kissed her on the back of the head ahead of a 2014 campaign event Ms Flores was running as the Democratic candidate for Nevada's lieutenant governor in 2014 when Mr Biden flew in to support her bid. As she prepared to go on stage, Ms Flores say Mr Biden placed two hands on her shoulders from behind, smelled her hair then planted ""a big slow kiss on the back of my head"". Asked about the new allegation, a spokesman for Mr Biden referred reporters to a statement he issued on Sunday. ""In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once - never - did I believe I acted inappropriately,"" it read. ""But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will,"" he added. Mr Biden and President Obama were known for their close friendship, often seen playing golf and attending sports events together. Mr Biden even said that Mr Obama offered him financial help when his son was ill. For his vice president's birthday in 2017,Mr Obama posted a photo of the two of them on Twitter,external, writing that Mr Biden was his ""brother and the best vice president anybody could have"". On Monday a spokesman for Mr Biden also accused ""right wing trolls"" of presenting harmless images of the former vice president interacting with women over the years as evidence of inappropriate touching. By Katty Kay, Presenter, BBC World News in Washington Former Vice-President Joe Biden's reported behaviour is what used to be described as ""touchy feely"". He is known to be physical, with everyone. He is also known as one of the most empathetic politicians around - the guy who calls when you have a problem, and just listens. But now two women say the ""touchy"" behaviour was a problem and the ""feely"" behaviour was inappropriate. This needs context. Physical contact with supporters has been a necessary part of political campaigning for decades. The candidate who tries to run for office and refuses all physical contact with voters would soon be dismissed as cold and aloof. So clearly there's a line politicians have to walk. Physical but not in the wrong way. And I'd posit that most women know exactly which side of the line any physical contact falls on - appropriate or inappropriate. We just know it. And women my generation put up with inappropriate contact for years, assuming it was part of the cost of having a job in a largely male environment. Younger women are less tolerant. Thank God. They have much less tolerance for men behaving badly. In many ways this is a story of generational differences. A number of candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have backed Ms Flores. Senator Elizabeth Warren said Mr Biden ""needs to give an answer"", and Senator Amy Klobuchar said that in politics ""people raise issues and they have to address them"". Asked how the allegations might affect Mr Biden's possible future presidential bid, Ms Pelosi told Politico: ""I don't think it's disqualifying."" But she added: ""He has to understand in the world that we're in now that people's space is important to them, and what's important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it."" This video can not be played Has Mr Biden publicly announced his presidential bid? Support for Mr Biden was voiced by Cynthia Hogan, a former aide to the vice-president, who told the New York Times that he ""treated us with respect and insisted that others do the same"". An ally of Mr Biden told CNN he was not reconsidering a run for the White House following the allegations but stressed he had yet to make a decision. Mr Biden has yet to jump into the race, but plenty have. So who else has a shot at becoming the next president?

"1MDB scandal: The playboys, PMs and partygoersA wealth fund is alleged to have been looted of billions. The extraordinary story can be told through the characters caught up in it.1MDB scandal: The playboys, PMs and partygoersA wealth fund is alleged to have been looted of billions. The extraordinary story can be told through the characters caught up in it.","It is one of the world's greatest financial scandals. Billions of dollars from a state fund meant to help the Malaysian people went missing, disappearing into the shadows of the global financial system. According to US and Malaysian prosecutors, the money lined the pockets of a few powerful individuals and was used to buy luxury real estate, a private jet, Van Gogh and Monet artworks - and to finance a Hollywood blockbuster. Outcry over the alleged looting of 1MDB has reverberated around the world, with authorities in at least six countries probing a vast web of financial transactions stretching from Swiss banks to island tax havens to the heart of South East Asia. The scandal even led to the toppling of the political party that governed Malaysia for all of its history as an independent nation. Goldman Sachs, one of Wall Street's most powerful banks, is facing criminal charges in Malaysia - which it says it intends to vigorously defend. Meanwhile a fugitive playboy charged in the US and Malaysia remains on the run - his infamous $250m luxury super yacht now in the hands of authorities. All eyes are now on the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, where former prime minister and ex-chairman of 1MDB's advisory board Najib Razak is on trial in the first of several cases against him. The cast of characters around the 1MDB scandal paints a picture of a truly global saga - from the journalists who doggedly followed the money to the international elite alleged to have profited. At the centre of this story is Malaysia's former prime minister: the once untouchable man who set up a ""bold and daring"" sovereign fund in 2009 to propel his nation's economic development - only to see it bring him and his political dynasty down in disgrace nine years later. To truly understand Najib Razak is to examine his roots. The eldest son of Malaysia's second prime minister, Abdul Razak, and also the nephew to its third, he descends from political aristocracy. When he finally became prime minister in 2009 - as the head of the party which dominated Malaysian politics for half a century - it seemed he was finally taking a pre-ordained role. An Anglophile, Mr Najib completed his secondary school education at the UK's Malvern College, a prestigious private school, before studying industrial economics at the University of Nottingham. That background and his rhetoric about the importance of ""moderate"" Islam made him a natural fit with Western contemporaries including David Cameron and Barack Obama. Once upon a time, Mr Najib and Barack Obama were golfing buddies But there were clouds above him from the very beginning of his premiership. Questions over a French submarine deal made in 2002 when he was defence minister dogged the new PM. It was alleged that some $130m in kickbacks had been paid as part of the $1.2bn deal - which Mr Najib has always denied. Thegrisly murder of a Mongolian modelwho served as an interpreter for the submarine deal raised further questions. A French investigation continues while the new Malaysian government recently re-opened its probe. Mr Najib insists he never met the woman. David Cameron and Najib Razak at 10 Downing Street (Note: Both men are no longer in power) Najib Razak established 1MDB in 2009 as a way to manage resource-rich Malaysia's wealth with strategic investments. Major red flags were raised in 2015 when it missed payments due for some of the $11bn (Â£8.3bn) it owed to banks and bondholders - although investigators and journalists had long been on the case. In July 2016the US Department of Justice filed a civil lawsuit alleging that more than $3.5bn had been plundered.,external(It later upped the figure to more than $4.5bn.) ""A number of corrupt officials,"" said then-US Attorney General Loretta Lynch, ""treated this public trust as a personal bank account"". Malaysia's tainted political aristocrat The lawsuit named alleged perpetrators but left a ""Malaysian Official 1"" unnamed. MO1, later confirmed to be Najib Razak by his own government, was alleged by US prosecutors to have received $681m in stolen funds but to have returned most of it. He was cleared of all wrongdoing by Malaysian authorities while he was in office but after his party's shock defeat at last year's general elections, the tide has dramatically shifted. Several of his apartments were raided and police seized a trove of luxury goods and $28.6m (Â£21.3m) in cash. There are currently 42 charges levelled against him for alleged corruption, money laundering and abuse of power. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and maintained his innocence -including through a soul ballad,externalperformed by him and a choir. The spending habits of Najib Razak's wife have been compared to those of Imelda Marcos and Marie Antoinette. Since her husband lost power, Rosmah Mansor, 67, has been formally charged with money-laundering and tax evasion, to which she has pleaded not guilty. Ms Rosmah's expensive tastes have been widely mocked in Malaysia, where she is harshly criticised for being out of touch with ordinary people who struggle to make ends meet. In 2018, very public police raids on properties linked to her and her husband lit up social media as images of supermarket trolleys packed with more than 500 luxury handbags, hundreds of watches, and 12,000 items of jewellery said to be worth up to $273m confirmed Malaysians' suspicions that their first family had been living wildly extravagant lives. 1MDB: Seized tiaras, cash and Hermes bags 'worth $273m' With Rosmah Mansor's larger than life persona and much noted penchant for Hermes Birkin bags, her court appearances are highly scrutinised. ""She isn't rude but she also isn't particularly friendly or bubbly. In person, she comes across as being imperious,"" says Reuters news agency's Malaysia correspondent Rozanna Latiff. ""On days Rosmah Mansor is called in for questioning, there is a lot of interest in her outfits and bags."" It's a political comeback story like no other: at 93, Mahathir Mohamad, the man who dominated Malaysian politics as prime minister in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, is back in form and leading Malaysia. His return to the political fray was motivated by one clear desire - to unseat Najib Razak, his former protÃ©gÃ©. ""I apologise to everyone, that I am the one who elevated him, the biggest mistake in my life. I want to correct that mistake,"" Mr Mahathir said on the campaign trail in early May 2018 after defecting to the opposition to take on Mr Najib. A Malaysian political drama, worthy of Shakespeare A few days later he shocked the world by defeating his former party, which had run Malaysia for more than half a century. Mr Mahathir's return has resonated well with Malaysians, many of whom champion their new government's efforts in bringing those who allegedly looted 1MDB to justice. But political observers note that the elderly statesman not only paved Mr Najib's path to power but also stood accused of authoritarianism during his own long tenure at the top. A Chinese-Malaysian financier from the bustling island of Penang, Low Taek Jho - more famously known as Jho Low - is portrayed by Malaysian and US investigators as one of the masterminds of the 1MDB scam. Despite never holding a formal position with the fund, he is alleged to have played a crucial role in its activities. And it was his savvy networking and shrewd business sense that allowed him to thrive, say journalists Bradley Hope and Tom Wright in their 2018 best-seller Billion Dollar Whale, which recounts Jho Low's alleged exploits. ""Jho Low is the most interesting person in the 1MDB affair, a mysterious master of ceremonies,"" Hope told the BBC. ""It became clear very early on he was the connecting point between everyone involved in the 1MDB fund - and the only one with a 360-degree view of the multi-billion dollar scheme."" US prosecutors say Mr Low leveraged his powerful political connections to win business for 1MDB through the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes.Billions, they say, were laundered through the US financial system,externaland used to buy some of the world's most expensive real estate, coveted artwork, and finance Hollywood films. Behold: Jho Low's infamous $250m luxury mega-yacht, The Equanimity This was a man known for mixing business with a great deal of pleasure. Lavish parties and high-profile friendships with Arab royalty and A-list celebrities fuelled his quick rise to the top. Britney Spears even popped out of his birthday cake at a 2012 Vegas bash. The reporters speculate in their book that at one point, Jho Low may have had access to more liquid cash than almost anyone else on earth. 1MDB: The United States v The Wolf of Wall Street But the fall of Najib Razak's government proved to be bad news for Mr Low. Criminal charges were filed and he is now wanted in several countries. His current whereabouts are unknown buthe maintains his innocence through statements on his official website,external. His lawyers say he cannot get a fair trial in Malaysia. ""Jho Low is driven but he is also both meticulous and terribly sloppy. He was frantically building an empire with money that wasn't his and in the end, his whole scheme became desperate and unsustainable,"" Hope said. This slick German banker represented one of the world's most powerful financial institutions, Goldman Sachs, at a time that the bank was charging into Asia. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Timothy Leissner's deal-making in South East Asia (Malaysia in particular) netted the bank significant revenues and he rose to become the company's chairman in the region. But the biggest deals would come when he crossed paths with Jho Low - alleged to be the power player behind 1MDB. Goldman had previously rejected Mr Low as a client, after compliance officials raised concerns about the source of his money. But, according to a US indictment, Mr Leissner and another Goldman banker, Roger Ng, used Mr Low's powerful connections to obtain business for Goldman. The bank is alleged to have earned an eye-popping $600m in fees for arranging and underwriting three bond sales to raise $6.5bn for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013. Mr Leissner has pleaded guilty to US charges of conspiring to launder money and violating anti-corruption laws by bribing foreign officials. Goldman's role in the 1MDB scandal in 300 words Goldman bosses charged in Malaysia bond scandal Malaysia has also filed charges against him, Mr Ng and 17 other former and current Goldman bankers. The bank itself has also been charged. Goldman Sachs denies wrongdoing. It has called the Malaysian charges against it and the 17 people ""misdirected"" and vowed to ""vigorously defend them"".It has sought to portray Mr Leissner, who it suspended in 2016, as having gone rogue,externaland has apologised for his behaviour. But the Malaysian government has rejected the apology and called for the bank to cough up $7.5bn in reparations. Mr Ng, who left Goldman in 2014, denies all the charges against him. Money talks but does the power of celebrity speak louder? The 1MDB scandal hasn't just been about powerful politicians and financiers: fugitive businessman Jho Low often partied with Hollywood's A-list. None of them are accused of any wrongdoing whatsoever, but their social connections with Mr Low have been the subject of media reports. ThatLeonardo DiCaprio movie The Oscar-winning actor starred in 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street, co-produced and financed by Riza Aziz, son of Rosmah Mansor and Najib Razak's step-son. The Martin Scorsese film about greed and corruption bagged DiCaprio a prestigious Golden Globe award for Best Actor - and he thanked both Mr Aziz and Mr Low by name in his acceptance speech. US prosecutors said misappropriated 1MDB money was used to finance the film, and the production company Red Granite paid $60m to settle a civil lawsuit with the US government. The company denies any wrongdoing. But Mr Aziz was arrested in Malaysia in July 2019 and faces trial on five charges of money laundering. He is alleged to have received nearly $250m of misappropriated 1MDB funds. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. DiCaprio, meanwhile, has pledged to assist US authorities and has handed over a Picasso painting allegedly gifted to him by Mr Low. Musician friends Kasseem Dean (aka Swizz Beatz) and Alicia Keys The ambitious record producer and his superstar wife were once part of Jho Low's inner circle, often photographed at his notoriously swanky parties. Dean performed at Mr Low's infamous 31st birthday celebrations (the one with Britney in the cake). Music's biggest night and Jho Low was there with Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys - in 2014 The musician is also credited with introducing Mr Low to the moneyed art world, where he is alleged to have bought works including a Van Gogh drawing and two Monet paintings with 1MDB funds. Partying with Paris Hilton Another member of the famed inner circle, the hotel heiress reportedly met Mr Low in 2009. They were often seen together in paparazzi pictures (and selfies), partying it up around the world - from the gambling tables of Vegas to the ski slopes of Whistler and balmy Saint-Tropez. Romancing Miranda Kerr and Elva Hsiao What do an Australian supermodel and a Taiwanese singer and actress have in common? Both women were once linked to Jho Low. After a series of extravagant dates (including sailing around Europe for 10 days) Mr Low showered Miranda Kerr, one of the world's highest-paid supermodels, with out-of-this-world gifts: an acrylic, see-through grand piano (worth up to $1m) and an 11-carat diamond necklace and matching earrings. She has since turned over millions in jewellery to US prosecutors. Mr Low took Taiwanese singer Elva Hsiao on a million-dollar date to Dubai, where they dined on a private beach, according to Billion Dollar Whale. The 1MDB saga would never have come to light without the tenacious work of journalists who pursued the story for years, breaking bombshell after bombshell and forcing the fund's dealings into scrutiny. Clare Rewcastle-Brown, The Sarawak Report More than a decade ago this Malaysian-born, British journalist began investigating Malaysia's political elite from her kitchen counter in London after putting the kids to bed. Her Sarawak Report website was initially focused on shadowy dealings in one Malaysian state. But when one of 1MDB's early deals was made in Sarawak, her attention began to shift to what seemed like ""a highly suspect outfit"". At the end of 2013, she received a tip-off that Najib's step-son had produced The Wolf of Wall Street. ""That's when I started digging,"" she says. ""Just really because I couldn't resist such an obviously significant story."" As she followed the money trail, the scoops began to roll in, captivating Malaysians whose domestic media were mostly unable or unwilling to pursue the story. In early 2015, Rewcastle-Brown received a trove of more than 200,000 documents from Swiss whistleblower Xavier Justo and made a stunning allegation: that $700m had been dropped directly into a bank account belonging to a Jho Low-controlled company as part of a 1MDB deal. A few months later - under the headline ""SENSATIONAL FINDINGS!"" - she published details alleging that nearly $700m had been deposited in the prime minister's bank accounts in 2013. The Malaysian authorities blocked her website and issued a warrant for her arrest. ""I had people all over the world who would contact me with information. Obviously it would be my job to stand it up if I could,"" she said. ""At the height of this there were people being hired to muscle me in London, follow me and photograph me... I had to go to the police."" Tom Wright and Bradley Hope, The Wall Street Journal Their 2018 offering Billion Dollar Whale meticulously detailed Jho Low's alleged exploits and became an instant bestseller in Malaysia. But Tom Wright and Bradley Hope have been investigating the 1MDB money trail for years at the Wall Street Journal. ""News stories don't typically go beyond 2,000 words and it felt like we were cutting out a lot of fascinating details [from the saga],"" said Hope. ""We knew people were having a hard time following the scandal and there was a bigger, more colourful story to do about Jho Low specifically."" Hope said their book crystallised how bad the scandal was for Malaysia. ""There was so much noise and misinformation out there,"" he said. ""To see it all laid out in one place, fact by fact, made it very clear that 1MDB had become one of the world's biggest financial scandals. Billion Dollar Whale shows how it developed chronologically and brought the issue home for many Malaysians."" The book may have also increased global pressure in the search for Jho Low (now wanted in several countries). ""Readers have sent us letters and politicians [Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng] have even used and referenced our book to explain the issues surrounding 1MDB,"" Hope said. ""Billion Dollar Whale is starting to filter through around the world and people who have never heard of 1MDB tell us they were utterly engrossed by it."" The Edge Malaysia If you read nothing but Malaysian newspapers and only watched local TV news reports at the height of the 1MDB scandal in 2015, you'd be fooled into believing all was well in the country. Malaysian journalists and editors learned quickly that reports about the sovereign fund's scandals courted danger and would risk their operating licences. But there were those who persisted and paid the price. The Edge Media Group was one. The Edge's newspapers published investigations into 1MDB's activities and had its newspapers' publishing licences suspended over what was deemed as ""reporting that could affect public order"". ""This is nothing more than a move to shut us down in order to shut us up,"" publisher Ho Kay Tat said at the time. Leading the charge against 1MDB in Malaysia is lawmaker Tony Pua, who raised constant questions while in opposition under Najib Razak's government. His party is now in power but Mr Pua remains unashamedly vocal in his disdain for the former PM. ""Najib Razak is the ultimate culprit. When confusion arises over his statements I will pop in to steer things in the right direction,"" he told the BBC on the sidelines of a visit in Singapore. Also political secretary to Malaysia's finance minister, who is leading 1MDB investigations, Mr Pua said he remains focused on ""fixing damage done to the economy"". ""The financial scandal is in the past and there are no more shenanigans, it's the clean-up process now,"" he said. ""We need to bring about economic growth and closing the 1MDB chapter is a big part of that."" The 'great-grandmother of financial scandals' comes to China The colourful politician, who hails from Johor state,often takes to YouTube,externalto lament the scandal. ""I know the facts and I articulate them,"" he said. ""I get information from documents and informants and piece them together to tell the story of what's actually happening."" But he says Mr Najib's trials are ""just the beginning"" and the judicial process could go on for years. ""The jigsaw is almost complete but there are a few missing pieces. And I believe Najib Razak's trial will reveal some."" Najib Razak is expected to face several trials in Malaysia. If found guilty of the many offences he is charged with, Mr Najib could spend decades in prison. Jho Low remains at large. Graphics by Davies Surya and Arvin Supriyadi in Jakarta. Â© 2025 BBC.

Another stab attack in Edmonton,"There have been five stab attacks in the area in the last week A man has been stabbed in the same north London area as four people who were attacked at the weekend. The Met Police said the man, in his 30s, was in a life-threatening condition in hospital. The attack happened at 05:00 BST on Tuesday on Fairfield Road, Edmonton. The victim was found in the same street as the first weekend stabbing. A man in his 30s has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm over the latest attack. Police said the attacks had not been formally linked, but the description of the knifeman was similar. The victim is said to have been walking with a friend when he was attacked. He then made his way to Aberdeen Road, where he was found by police officers. The friend was not injured. Police arrested a man at about 10:00 at Edmonton Green. Employees at furniture store Dogtas saw the arrest taking place. ""A police car pulled up and four or five police officers sprinted over and arrested a man outside the window,"" said one employee. ""Two more police cars turned up as they went through his wallet - they looked like they were checking it was the right guy. ""The man didn't say anything for the whole time."" Over a period of 10 hours at the weekend, a woman and three men were attacked in what police described as a spate of ""cowardly and senseless"" attacks. They were all approached from behind and knifed as they walked alone in Edmonton. They were apparently selected at random, police said. The first victim, a 45-year-old woman, remains in a critical condition after she was attacked in Aberdeen Road at 19:02 GMT on Saturday. Four hours later, a 52-year-old man was stabbed half a mile away in Park Avenue. He has since been discharged from hospital. Vigilance urged after 'random' stabbings Four stabbed in 'random' knife attacks The next victim, a 23-year-old man, is in a critical condition after being attacked near Seven Sisters Tube station at about 04:00 BST on Sunday. The final stabbing happened at 09:42 in Brettenham Road where a 29-year-old man was attacked. He is receiving medical treatment, but his injuries are not life-threatening. One man, who was arrested on Sunday morning on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, has been released under investigation in connection with the attacks. Police have been given until Wednesday morning to question another man who was arrested on suspicion of the same offence on Sunday evening. Police said each victim appeared to be selected at random for being ""alone and vulnerable"" Det Supt Luke Marks said: ""I am aware that events from the weekend have caused a huge amount of worry and concern among the community, and that this incident will cause further alarm. ""While at this stage the incident has not yet been formally linked, the location and manner of this attack will be of concern to the public. ""Our advice continues that the public remain vigilant, and to contact police regarding anyone acting suspiciously."" Extra officers will be on patrol, he added. Mike Kalongi, 28, who lives nearby, said: ""I usually go to the gym at night, but over the last few days I decided not to. ""I'm going shopping. I usually have my headphones on but I want to stay aware and try not to be a victim. ""It's scary. It's really scary."" Ten charts on the rise of knife crime in England and Wales Met 'too stretched to investigate' murder case 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' Connor McCoy, 21, who also lives nearby, said he presumed it was a follow-on from what happened at the weekend. He still feels safe in the area, but said: ""I just hope that the slightly more defenceless people can feel safe living in this street.

NHS to offer mums-to-be new blood test,"Pregnant women in England will be able to get a new type of blood test to check for the potentially life-threatening condition pre-eclampsia. NHS England is making PLGF testing more widely available as evidence suggests it speeds up diagnosis which could save lives. Mums-to-be who develop pre-eclampsia have dangerously high blood pressure which can damage vital organs. The PLGF test tells doctors if a woman is at high, medium or low risk. Pre-eclampsia affects tens of thousands of pregnancies each year, but can be managed if spotted early enough. Those at higher risk should be very closely monitored and may have to have their baby delivered early if the condition becomes too severe despite treatment. Sarah Findlay, 45 and from London, spent the last week of her pregnancy in hospital after medics discovered she had worryingly high blood pressure. ""It was a really stressful time. Up until that point my pregnancy had been amazing. Everything had been going really well,"" she said. ""It was during a routine check-up that they noticed my blood pressure was far too high and they admitted me because they were concerned that it might be pre-eclampsia. ""I went from feeling like a mum to a patient. I was really terrified because I did not know if I would be OK and whether I might lose my baby."" Doctors closely monitored Sarah's condition and she went on to have a healthy baby girl, Isla, who is now four. Sarah and Isla She welcomes any test that can help predict and reassure pregnant women about their risk of pre-eclampsia. Trials of the new PLGF (placental growth factor) blood test, which costs about Â£70, show it speeds up diagnosis, meaning life-threatening complications to the mother and baby can be avoided. More than 1,000 women at 11 UK maternity units took part in the trials during their second and third trimesters. Using PLGF alongside regular blood pressure and urine checks cut the average time to diagnosis from four days to around two. Earlier diagnosis was linked with a lower chance of serious complications - 5.3% (24 of 447 women diagnosed with usual checks) versus 3.8% (22 of 573 women diagnosed with usual checks plus PLGF). Lead researcher Prof Lucy Chappell, from King's College London, said: ""This really is going to make a difference to women. The challenge for doctors is spotting which pregnancies are high risk and need closer monitoring. PLGF helps us reach that diagnosis earlier."" Prof Tony Young, from NHS England, said: ""The NHS, with partners in government, will be making this test more widely available across the NHS as part of our plans to ensure as many patients as possible can benefit from world-class health innovations."" The NHS in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland could choose to offer the test too.

Stab attack leaves man dead,"The man was the 23rd person to be stabbed to death this year A man has been stabbed to death in a knife attack in north London. The victim, thought to be in his 20s, was stabbed near the junction of Grafton Road and Vicars Road in Gospel Oak at about 20:30 BST on Monday. Ambulance staff tried to revive him but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Murder detectives said he had not been formally identified, but his family had been informed. Police appealed for witnesses and said no arrests had yet been made. A post-mortem examination has not yet taken place. Claude Mampuila, 54, who said he was the victim's uncle, said the family had ""lost someone special"". He said: ""The family came here from the Congo for protection - there was a war there - and now this has happened in London. ""We were thinking if you come to this country you are protected, but it is not safe at all."" Five men were allegedly seen running away from the scene A neighbour said he put the victim into the recovery position, adding that he saw five boys fleeing the scene. The man, who did not want to be named, said the victim's mother was at the scene following the attack. A woman, who would not give her name but said she was the victim's cousin, told the Press Association the man ""had a good home, a good girlfriend and he had things going for him"". ""He was not the sort of boy to get into trouble. He kept himself to himself,"" she said. The prime minister said ""arresting"" people was not the way out of knife crime dangers Twenty three people have been fatally stabbed in London this year. The killing came on the same day as Prime Minister Theresa May hosted a summit on knife crime. She said the issue was ""deep-seated"" and would require a cross-society effort to tackle it, but police officers, teachers and nurses were critical of plans for them to be accountable for failing to ""spot warning signs"" of violent crime. ""We cannot simply arrest ourselves out of this problem,"" Mrs May said. Floral tributes and candles have been left at the scene Flowers and candles have been placed in tribute to the victim near the scene. A message attached to one bouquet read: ""Long time I haven't seen you but it was always love when I did. Rest easy bro."" Another message said: ""Always in our hearts. Going to miss you my bro.

"BonmarchÃ© deal puts jobs and shops at riskBuyer Philip Day warns of a ""material reduction"" in the 1,900 jobs at the struggling UK fashion chain.Business","Jobs and shops at struggling fashion chain BonmarchÃ© are under threat after UK billionaire Philip Day tabled a takeover bid. The deal values the Yorkshire-based chain, which began in 1982 and now has 312 shops specialising in clothing for the over-50s, at around Â£5.7m. Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group owner Mr Day warned he expected a ""material reduction"" in headcount at the chain. BonmarchÃ© employs 1,900 full-time equivalent people,its website says.,external The struggling retailerwarned last month that trading had deteriorated, adding that it expected to lose Â£5-Â£6m this year. Using his Dubai-based investment vehicle Spectre, Mr Day has bought a 52.4% stake in the retailer. As he now owns more than half of the company's shares, this has triggered a mandatory takeover bid. However, the offer of just 11.445p a share is well below Monday's closing price of 18p. BonmarchÃ© said its directors were ""considering the terms"" of the offer and advised shareholders to take no action. BonmarchÃ© shares down 14% on profit warning UK retail sales up but food spending falls Mr Day said he would do a ""store-by-store profitability assessment"" with the aim of closing underperforming shops unless it was possible to implement ""reduced rents, staff reductions or other cost saving measures"". He added he was ""well positioned to provide advice, guidance and support to secure the long term future of the BonmarchÃ© business, its stores and employees"". If the deal goes ahead, the company would become private and the shares delisted. Philip Day started his career at clothing manufacturers Coats Viyella and Wensum The businessman started his career at clothing manufacturers Coats Viyella and Wensum before eventually taking over Edinburgh Woollen Mill. Through Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Mr Day has bought several clothing chains, including discount chain Peacocks and the upmarket Austin Reed and Jaeger brands. Spectre's statement said: ""The owner of Spectre, Philip Day, has a successful track record within the retail sector, especially in turnaround and distressed situations."" Maureen Hinton, retail research director at GlobalData, said it was ""an excellent result for BonmarchÃ©"". ""Being taken out of constant City reporting and scrutiny will allow the retailer to take a long-term view of the business and benefit from the shared assets of the Edinburgh Woollen Mills group."" She said that while the offer ""must be a relief for management"", the low price being offered was ""not such a relief"" for shareholders given that the shares stood at about 120p last summer. BonmarchÃ© is one of a string of well-known names suffering in a tough High Street environment. Last year, Poundworld, Toys R Us and Maplin all went bust and disappeared altogether. Other household names - Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look - were forced into restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of stores. Music chain HMV recently fell into administration before being bought. The increasing popularity of online shopping, higher business rates, rising labour costs and the fall in the pound following the Brexit vote - which has increased the cost of imported goods - have been blamed for contributing to retailers' woes.

Varadkar and Macron to hold Brexit meeting,"Mr Macron, right, told reporters that France and Ireland would be the countries most affected by a no-deal outcome The European Union will not be hostage to a ""political crisis"" in the UK, France's president has said. Emmanuel Macron was speaking in Paris during talks with Irish PM Leo Varadkar. ""We will never abandon Ireland or the Irish people no matter what happens, because this solidarity is the very purpose of the European project,"" said Mr Macron. Mr Varadkar said any Brexit extension needed ""a clear purpose, clear plan"". Their meeting came after MPs twice rejected Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal deal, with the government now ramping up plans for a no-deal scenario. Mr Varadkar said he would also discuss the Republic of Ireland's no-deal plans with Mr Macron. The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) emphasised that the EU should be open to any ""credible proposals"" the UK put forward about in the Brexit process. No-deal Brexit can still be avoided - Barnier MPs fail to back Brexit proposals again Brexit: What could happen next? What does a soft Brexit mean? Mr Macron told reporters that France and Ireland would be the countries most affected by a no-deal outcome. They both said the integrity of the single market would need to be protected, but that the EU would uphold commitments made to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement. Mr Varadkar's visit to France comes ahead of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's trip to Dublin on Thursday. German Chancellor Angel Merkel is due to visit Dublin on Thursday He said the EU would need to seriously consider how to respond to any request from the UK for a longer extension, in order to avoid leaving with no deal on 12 April. Mr Varadkar said that it would come with conditions, requiring the UK to take part in European elections on 23 May. Mairead McGuinness, vice-president of the European Parliament and Fine Gael MEP, said that a no deal does not solve problems for those who would advocate for a hard Brexit. ""There's a view that a no deal would be a forever state of play from those that would argue for it, but frankly it's not,"" she said. ""Immediately afterwards I believe the UK would need to come to the EU and ask to speak and negotiate."" Mr Varadkar is expected to return from Paris on Tuesday evening and hold a meeting of his cabinet. Earlier on Tuesday,Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, said a no-deal Brexit is now more likely but can still be avoided. The DUP still want changes made to the backstop The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) voted against all four options tabled on Monday. The party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said if the Irish border backstop was addressed, the DUP could ""do business"" with the government. Speaking after the indicative votes, Mr Dodds said the only proposition that MPs had ever supported was an amendment - known as the Brady amendment - calling on the government to negotiate changes to the backstop.

The DUP and some Brexiteer MPs oppose it because if it took effect, it would keep Northern Ireland only tied to some EU regulatory rules, and would keep the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU. On Monday night, independent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Hermon, backed two of the options. She voted for another referendum and to revoke article 50, but against a customs union or single market arrangement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will visit Dublin on Thursday, as pressure mounts over Parliament's failure to ratify the withdrawal agreement. The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 12 April, if it cannot propose a way forward to the EU. An extraordinary EU summit is due to take place on 10 April. Mr Varadkar said he would discuss with his French and German counterparts how the European Council should respond to a request for another extension from the UK, to seek a delay to the Brexit process.

Taking the temperature of black holesExperts says their new formula offers fundamental insights into space and time.,"Researchers at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh have developed a new formula to quickly calculate the temperature of a black hole. They say it is simple and powerful, and offers fundamental insights into space and time. The formula owes its origin to observations made on the Union Canal near Edinburgh 185 years ago. The idea that black holes have temperatures at all came as something of a surprise to researchers. They have so much mass and exert a gravitational pull so strong that nothing - not even heat or light - was expected to escape. Professor Stephen Hawking predicted black holes would emit thermal radiation However, Professor Stephen Hawking changed that. In 1974, at the age of just 32, he proposed the concept of what is now called Hawking radiation. He predicted black holes would emit thermal radiation and gradually evaporate. This is still at the frontiers of theory, with different schools of thought on the exact process. One major issue is calculating how much radiation a black hole gives out. Accuracy has proved elusive. Complex calculations have produced contradictory answers. At Heriot-Watt, Dr Fabio Biancalana and his colleagues have come up with their new formula to quickly and precisely calculate the Hawking radiation temperature from any kind of black hole. Dr Biancalala says they tested it against all published types of black holes - whether static, rotating, charged or even more exotic - and it always produced the exact Hawking temperature. A coffee mug and a doughnut are the same in topological terms The key is the mathematical discipline of topology. It deals with the properties of space - and not just outer space. Topology treats things according to the fundamental properties they possess, even if they are bent, crushed, folded or otherwise deformed. Tearing, cutting, gluing or poking holes would be cheating. One celebrated example is a coffee mug and a doughnut. In topological terms, they are the same. That's because each is a lump of stuff with a single hole in it. In theory you could even squish the mug into the shape of a doughnut if you fancied (provided you didn't mind how it tasted). ""We discovered that only the topology of black holes matters when it comes to determining Hawking radiation,"" says Dr Biancalana. ""Not the size, not the electric charge, the spacetime in which they are embedded, or how they spin around their axis. ""Black holes can be physically very different, but if they have the same topology they will emit the same amount of Hawking radiation."" In effect the new formula counts the holes of a black hole and the spacetime that surrounds it (yes, even black holes have holes in them). This information is enough to determine the temperature. Dr Biancalana calls it a ""magic formula"". ""For years scientists have been theorising about four dimensions and whether space has more dimensions we are still ignorant of, and now we know only two dimensions really matter in the description of all these astronomical monsters."" Which leads us to the banks of the Union Canal, not too far from the Heriot-Watt campus on the outskirts of Edinburgh. It was there that the Scottish engineer John Scott Russell first described what he called a ""wave of translation"" - a solitary wave that kept its shape while travelling at a constant speed. He hoped his work would lead to a better canal barge. These days - now called solitons - these waves are important in laser physics and fibre optics. The Heriot-Watt team realised that, as solitons and black holes shared identical mathematical properties, Hawking radiation would follow the same rules. Dr Biancalana says it takes us a step closer to understanding how the universe works. ""This must mean something fundamental about space and time,"" he says. ""Now we just need to find out what.""

MPs fail to back Brexit proposals again,"This video can not be played The moment the vote results were announced in the Commons MPs have again failed to agree on proposals for the next steps in the Brexit process. The Commons voted on four alternatives to Theresa May's withdrawal deal, but none gained a majority. One Tory MP resigned the whip in frustration. Mrs May will now hold a crucial cabinet meeting to decide what to do and whether to put her deal to MPs again. The UK has until 12 April to either seek a longer extension from the EU or decide to leave without a deal. Theso-called indicative voteson Monday night were not legally binding, so the government would not have been forced to adopt the proposals. But they had been billed as the moment when Parliament might finally compromise. As it happened: Indicative votes round two How did my MP vote on Brexit options? MPs debate stop-Brexit petition What does a soft Brexit mean? Mrs May's plan for the UK's departure has been rejected by MPs three times. As a result of that failure, she was forced to ask the EU to agree to postpone Brexit from the original date of 29 March. Meanwhile, Parliament took control of the process away from the government in order to hold a series of votes designed to find an alternative way forward. Last week,eight options were put to MPs,but none was able to command a majority, and on Monday night, a whittled down four were rejected too. They were: Motion C:Committing the government to negotiating ""a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU"" as part of any Brexit deal. Motion D:Referred to as Common Market 2.0, this option would mean joining the European Free Trade Association and European Economic Area. Motion E:Calling for a confirmatory referendum, giving the public a vote to approve any Brexit deal passed by Parliament before it can be implemented. Motion G:Aiming to prevent the UK leaving without a deal, including a vote on whether to revoke Article 50 - stopping Brexit altogether - if the EU does not agree to an extension. Those pushing for a customs union argued that their option was defeated by the narrowest margin, only three votes. It would see the UK remain in the same system of tariffs - taxes - on goods as the rest of the EU -potentially simplifying the issue of the Northern Ireland border,but preventing the UK from striking independent trade deals with other countries. Those in favour of another EU referendum pointed out that the motion calling for that option received the most votes in favour, totalling 280. Following the failure of his own motion, Common Market 2.0, Conservative former minister Nick Boles resigned from the party. The MP for Grantham and Stamford said he could ""no longer sit for this party"", adding: ""I have done everything I can to find a compromise."" As he left the Commons, MPs were heard shouting, ""don't go Nick"", while some MPs from other parties applauded him. He later tweeted,externalthat he would remain an MP and sit in the Commons as ""an Independent Progressive Conservative"". This video can not be played Nick Boles: ""I have failed, chiefly, because my party refuses to compromise"" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the ""only option"" left now was to find a way forward that allows the UK to leave the EU with a deal - and the only deal available was the prime minister's. If that could be done this week, he added, the UK could avoid having to take part in elections to the European Parliament in May. Health Secretary Matt Hancock agreed it was time for Mrs May's deal to be passed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that while it was ""disappointing"" that none of the proposals secured a majority, he said he wanted to remind the Commons that Mrs May's deal had been ""overwhelmingly rejected"". He urged MPs to hold a third round of indicative votes on Wednesday in the hope that a majority could yet be found for a way forward. For months, Parliament has been saying ""Let us have a say, let us find the way forward,"" but in the end they couldn't quite do it. Parliament doesn't know what it wants and we still have lots of different tribes and factions who aren't willing to make peace. That means that by the day, two things are becoming more likely. One, leaving the EU without a deal. And two, a general election, because we're at an impasse. One person who doesn't think that would be a good idea is former foreign secretary and Brexiteer Boris Johnson. He told me going to the polls would ""solve nothing"" and would ""just infuriate people"". He also said that only somebody who ""really believes in Brexit"" should be in charge once Theresa May steps down. I wonder who that could be... Hear more from Laura and the gang in Brexitcast. Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb told BBC Look East he was ""ashamed to be a member of this Parliament"" and hit out at MPs in his own party - five of whom voted against a customs union and four of whom voted against Common Market 2.0. He said the Commons was ""playing with fire and will unleash dark forces unless we learn to compromise"". But prominent Brexiteer Steve Baker said he was ""glad the House of Commons has concluded nothing"". He said the prime minister must now go back to the EU and persuade them to rewrite the withdrawal deal - something they have so far refused to do - otherwise the choice was between no deal or no Brexit. Senior figures in the EU, though, showed their frustration at the latest moves in Westminster. European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadttweeted,externalthat by voting down all the options, a ""hard Brexit becomes nearly inevitable"". BBC Europe editor Kayta Adler said the mood in Brussels was one of disbelief - that the UK still does not seem to know what it wants. She said EU leaders were also questioning the logic of arguing over things like a customs union or Common Market option at this stage, because right now, the UK has only three options as they see it - no deal, no Brexit or Theresa May's deal - and anything else is a matter for future talks once the UK has actually left.

Cabinet talks after MPs reject Brexit options,"This video can not be played Barnier: ""No-deal Brexit has become more likely"" A no-deal Brexit is now more likely but can still be avoided, the EU's chief negotiator has said. Michel Barnier said a long extension to the UK's 12 April exit date had ""significant risks for the EU"" and a ""strong justification would be needed"". Meanwhile, the BBC's John Pienaar said Theresa May's cabinet has considered plans to ""ramp up"" preparations for a no-deal Brexit. A snap general election was also discussed in the meeting, he said. A second two-hour regular cabinet meeting will be held later, with the issues likely to be discussed again.

That did not happen, and one Tory MP - Nick Boles, who was behind one of the proposals - resigned the whip in frustration. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told MPs that if they wanted to secure a further delay from the EU, the government must put forward a ""credible proposition"". One suggestion has been the possibility of a general election - but former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that would be likely to ""infuriate"" voters. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Instead, Mr Johnson said he believed a new leader and ""change in negotiation tactic"" could ""retrofit"" the PM's ""terrible"" agreement with the EU. Speaking on Tuesday morning, Mr Barnier said: ""No deal was never our desire or intended scenario but the EU 27 is now prepared. It becomes day after day more likely."" Mr Barnier told the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee that ""things are somewhat hanging on the decisions of the House of Commons"", and that the deal was negotiated with the UK ""not against the UK"". ""If we are to avoid a no-deal Brexit, there is only one way forward - they have got to vote on a deal. ""There is only one treaty available - this one,"" he said, waving the withdrawal agreement. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the way forward was to address the controversial Irish backstop - a measure to avoid the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. He said the most ""constructive outcome"" would be the Malthouse Compromise - which includes extending the transition period for a year until the end of 2021 and protecting EU citizens' rights, instead of using the backstop. But the Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom said the prime minister's deal was the best option. ""The compromise option, the one that delivers on the EU referendum but at the same time enables us to accommodate the wishes of those who wanted to remain in the EU - that is the best compromise,"" she said.

UK audit giants 'should be broken up',"The UK's Big Four accountancy firms should be separated into audit and non-audit businesses, says an influential committee of MPs. Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC conduct 97% of big companies' audits while also providing them with other services. They are under review by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which has proposed an internal split between the two functions. But now MPs are calling for a full structural break-up of the firms. The CMA's review, released on 2 April, follows high-profile company collapses such as construction firm Carillion, which was audited by KPMG. It comes on the same day that the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) announced it had opened an investigation into KPMG's audit of Carillion. In December last year,the CMA put forward three main recommendations: A split between audit and advisory businesses, with separate management and accounts More accountability for those appointing auditors, with the aim of strengthening their independence A ""joint audit"" system, with a Big Four and a non-Big Four firm working together on an audit In a report, the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee endorsed the CMA's proposals, but said a full break-up of the Big Four would ""prove more effective in tackling conflicts of interest"". Rachel Reeves, who chairs the committee, said: ""For the big firms, audits seem too often to be the route to milking the cash-cow of consultancy business. ""The client relationship, and the conflicts of interest which abound, undermine the professional scepticism needed to deliver reliable, high-quality audits."" Ms Reeves said vested interests should not be allowed to get in the way of positive change, adding: ""We must not wait for the next corporate collapse."" Among its other recommendations, the committee said there should be a pilot scheme of joint audits for the most complex cases, ""to enable the challenger firms to step up"". It also called for more effort by auditors to tackle fraud at companies. ""In light of the failings at Patisserie Valerie, audits must state how they have investigated potential fraud, including by directors,"" the committee said. Cafe chain Patisserie Valerie fell into administration in January. Its accounts were found to have been overstated by Â£94m, according to its administrators KPMG. The former finance director of the chain, Chris Marsh, is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Michael Izza, chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW),welcomed the report, saying that it made ""many sensible suggestions"" that would help achieve better choice in the market for audits. However, he did not agree with MPs that the Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up. ""We are concerned that some of its ideas for reducing conflicts of interest, such as the break-up of the largest multi-disciplinary firms, might prove counter-productive,"" said Mr Izza. ""This could both drive out incumbents and discourage new entrants and it would be unfortunate if an attempt to guarantee the independence of audit firms ended up undermining the resilience of the audit market."" KPMG said it was co-operating fully with the various inquiries under way into the audit system. The FRC said it decided to open an enquiry into KPMG following matters the firm had self-reported. The enquiry involves an assessment of the governance, controls and culture within KPMG's audit practice, the FRC said. A KPMG spokesperson said the BEIS Committee's report showed that ""trust in audit is in urgent need of repair"", adding: ""We have been open about the need for change and we want to play a leading role in building a strong, sustainable and trusted audit sector for the future."" Deloitte's UK managing partner for audit, Stephen Griggs, said: ""We welcome many of the [BEIS Committee] recommendations, including extending the scope of the audit and better regulation of audit, but we have concerns about a potential structural split. ""This will be detrimental to audit quality and could materially damage the UK's competitive position as a leading capital market.""

Woman facing painful death backs law change,"This video can not be played 'I want to be able to choose when I die' A woman facing a painful death said she wants the law changed to give the terminally ill assistance to die. Kay Smith, 54, has a lethal mix of untreatable conditions which means she can expect to die from sepsis. She said she does not want her family to watch her suffering as she dies. She is supporting a campaign being launched on Tuesday which is calling for legislation to allow patients to make an informed decision over when they die. The pressure group behind the campaign, Dignity in Dying, defines assisted dying as allowing a terminally ill person to have a choice over the manner and timing of their imminent death. Opponents of the moves say more money should be spent on palliative care In contrast to euthanasia and assisted suicide, assisted dying would only apply to terminally ill people. Similar attempts tochange the law have previously failed to get through the Scottish Parliament- and opponents have argued that the risks are too high. Dignity in Dying said patients should be allowed a prescription which could end their life, and be allowed assistance to take it if necessary, without the risk of any prosecution. It said a poll it commissioned suggested almost 90% of Scots believed dying people should not be forced to suffer at the end of their lives. Kay Smith does not want her family to watch her suffer Ms Smith, a former palliative care nurse who is now a palliative patient herself, has Lupus - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) - as well as a condition that makes her severely allergic to pain medication and antibiotics. She knows that she is likely to contract an infection and die of sepsis that could not be treated because of her fatal reaction to medication. At the campaign launch on Tuesday, she will urge Holyrood to introduce safe and compassionate laws to allow terminally ill, mentally competent adults the choice of an assisted death. Speaking to BBC Scotland ahead of the launch, she said she respects that assisted dying was ""not everybody's choice"", and that ""some people will allow nature to take its course"". Ms Smith, of Kilwinning, Ayrshire, said: ""I could have the choice to have an assisted death and be surrounded by love and go before it got too bad. ""Instead of my body rotting away from my extremities up, and my children and husband having to watch that... sepsis is not a nice death."" Without a change in the law, she says she could face up to 10 ""extremely awful"" days at the end of her life, during which she would endure great pain. She wants to avoid these last days of pain by choosing to end her life just before this. What is assisted dying? How is it different from euthanasia or assisted suicide? Because of her health conditions, doctors may be able to sedate her but would not be able to offer painkillers. She fears the experience of watching their mother die in such circumstances would traumatise her children. ""I don't want to leave that legacy. The last thing I want to do is leave them with a permanent horrible memory of my death"", she said. It is estimated one person every eight days travels from the UK to the Swiss clinic Dignitas to end their life. But many people seeking an assisted death cannot afford the Â£10,000-trip, and some are too ill to make the journey. Ally Thomson, Scottish director of Dignity in Death, said clinics abroad were not the answer: ""Dignitas absolutely outsources this problem, really - the current law is broken when people need to go to Switzerland to have a safe and dignified death. ""Most families want their loved ones to stay around for as long as possible - it's the person themselves who doesn't wish to have a bad death and doesn't want to leave things until the last minute and suffer that pain that can happen at the end of life."" Margo MacDonald campaigned for a change in the law Attempts tochange the law on this issue were made by the late MSP Margo McDonald. The idea was put before Holyrood twice, but her bills failed to receive parliamentary backing. One concern was that vulnerable people could be pressured by relatives, or even clinicians, to take an irrevocable decision. Ms Thomson said: ""We know from international examples... that that simply isn't the case. ""Once our decision-makers look at the evidence, we think they'll be very satisfied on that point."" However, Gordon Macdonald, the chief executive of the Care Not Killing umbrella group which is opposed to assisted suicide, said the last vote on the issue had seen a bill from Green MSP Patrick Harvie defeated by 82 votes to 36. ""Most members realised then that the risks of legalising assisted suicide were too high and would put vulnerable people at risk of harm,"" he said. He more money should instead be made available for palliative care. What is assisted dying and how could the law change?

"NHS to offer mums-to-be new blood testIt looks for a dangerous condition called pre-eclampsia, which can develop in pregnancy.Health","Pregnant women in England will be able to get a new type of blood test to check for the potentially life-threatening condition pre-eclampsia. NHS England is making PLGF testing more widely available as evidence suggests it speeds up diagnosis which could save lives. Mums-to-be who develop pre-eclampsia have dangerously high blood pressure which can damage vital organs. The PLGF test tells doctors if a woman is at high, medium or low risk. Pre-eclampsia affects tens of thousands of pregnancies each year, but can be managed if spotted early enough. Those at higher risk should be very closely monitored and may have to have their baby delivered early if the condition becomes too severe despite treatment. Sarah Findlay, 45 and from London, spent the last week of her pregnancy in hospital after medics discovered she had worryingly high blood pressure. ""It was a really stressful time. Up until that point my pregnancy had been amazing. Everything had been going really well,"" she said. ""It was during a routine check-up that they noticed my blood pressure was far too high and they admitted me because they were concerned that it might be pre-eclampsia. ""I went from feeling like a mum to a patient. I was really terrified because I did not know if I would be OK and whether I might lose my baby."" Doctors closely monitored Sarah's condition and she went on to have a healthy baby girl, Isla, who is now four. Sarah and Isla She welcomes any test that can help predict and reassure pregnant women about their risk of pre-eclampsia. Trials of the new PLGF (placental growth factor) blood test, which costs about Â£70, show it speeds up diagnosis, meaning life-threatening complications to the mother and baby can be avoided. More than 1,000 women at 11 UK maternity units took part in the trials during their second and third trimesters. Using PLGF alongside regular blood pressure and urine checks cut the average time to diagnosis from four days to around two. Earlier diagnosis was linked with a lower chance of serious complications - 5.3% (24 of 447 women diagnosed with usual checks) versus 3.8% (22 of 573 women diagnosed with usual checks plus PLGF). Lead researcher Prof Lucy Chappell, from King's College London, said: ""This really is going to make a difference to women. The challenge for doctors is spotting which pregnancies are high risk and need closer monitoring. PLGF helps us reach that diagnosis earlier."" Prof Tony Young, from NHS England, said: ""The NHS, with partners in government, will be making this test more widely available across the NHS as part of our plans to ensure as many patients as possible can benefit from world-class health innovations."" The NHS in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland could choose to offer the test too.

Joe Biden denies misconduct allegations,"Joe Biden served as Barack Obama's vice president for eight years Former US Vice-President Joe Biden has denied allegations of misconduct ahead of his widely expected announcement of a presidential run. Lucy Flores, a former Nevada Assembly member, says Mr Biden kissed her on the back of her head at a campaign event. A second woman, Amy Lappos, said Mr Biden had acted inappropriately by touching her face with both hands and rubbing noses with her a decade ago. Mr Biden, 76, served as Barack Obama's vice-president for eight years. The former Delaware senator is seen as a possible frontrunner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination even though he has not announced his candidacy. The allegations first appeared on Friday in an article Ms Flores wrote for The Cut magazine,external. Ms Flores was running as the Democratic candidate for Nevada's lieutenant governor in 2014 when the then-vice president flew in to support her bid. As she prepared to go on stage, Ms Flores say Mr Biden placed two hands on her shoulders from behind. ""I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified,"" she wrote. ""He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn't process what was happening."" Lucy Flores alleges Mr Biden kissed her on the back of the head ahead of a 2014 campaign event She wrote: ""I had never experienced anything so blatantly inappropriate."" On Monday, a second allegation surfaced. Amy Lappos, a former aide to Democratic congressman Jim Hines of Connecticut, said Mr Biden touched her inappropriately at a fundraiser in a private home in Hartford, Connecticut, in October 2009. She told the Hartford Courant,externalthat the then-vice-president entered the kitchen to thank the group of aides, before wrapping both hands around Ms Lappos' face and pulling her in to rub noses with her. Ms Lappos, now 43, said in a statement to US media: ""Uninvited affection is not okay. Objectifying women is not okay. ""Men who invade a woman's personal space, touch women inappropriately, sexually harass women and feed rape culture have no place in a position of power. ""Referring to this type of behaviour as 'simply affection' or 'grandpa-like' or 'friendly' is ridiculously dismissive and part of the problem."" She called on Mr Biden not to run for the White House and to clear the way for one of the many female candidates. Mr Biden's spokesman Bill Russo initially said neither the vice-president nor his staff had any idea that ""Ms Flores had been at any time uncomfortable, nor do they recall what she describes"". But on Sunday Mr Biden issued a statement himself, and promised to ""pay attention"" to Ms Flores - while reiterating he did not remember the incident. ""In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once - never - did I believe I acted inappropriately,"" it read. #MeToo senator denies mishandling complaint Trump accused of 'slut shaming' senator ""But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will,"" he added. Speaking in a CNN interview on Sunday, Ms Flores said Mr Biden's statement was ""certainly better"" than his spokesman's initial response, but called his behaviour ""completely inappropriate"" and something to think about of a person ""who is considering running for president"". On Monday, Biden aides began to push back more aggressively against some of the criticism. In a statement, his spokesman Bill Russo accused ""right wing trolls"" from ""the dark recesses of the internet"" of presenting harmless images of Mr Biden interacting with women as evidence of inappropriate touching. A number of candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have backed Ms Flores. ""I think what this speaks to is the need to fundamentally change the culture of this country,"" Senator Bernie Sanders told Face the Nation on CBS, saying he had no reason not to believe Ms Flores. Who will take on Trump in 2020? Joe Biden's candidacy slip She previously campaigned for Mr Sanders in his 2016 nomination run. Senator Elizabeth Warren said Mr Biden ""needs to give an answer"", and Senator Amy Klobuchar said that in politics ""people raise issues and they have to address them"". Lucy Flores campaigned for Bernie Sanders in 2016 But many supporters have leapt to Mr Biden's defence. Cynthia Hogan, a former aide to the vice-president, told the New York Times that Mr Biden ""treated us with respect and insisted that others do the same"". AndStephanie Carter, the wife of former defence secretary Ashton Carter, defended her ""close friend"" in a blog post,external. A photo of Mr Biden holding her shoulders during her husband's swearing-in ceremony drew questions at the time and afterwards. But in a blog post, Ms Carter wrote that the vice-president ""could sense I was uncharacteristically nervous"" at the event ""and quickly gave me a hug"", she wrote. ""But a still shot taken from a video... came to be the lasting image of that day."" #MeToo senator denies mishandling complaint Trump accused of 'slut shaming' senator Joe Biden in 2020 candidacy slip.

"Woman beat 'bullying' husband to deathPackiam Ramanathan admitted killing her husband with a wooden pole, but was cleared of murder.London","Kanagusabi Ramanathan was found dead at the couple's flat in Burges Road, Newham A 73-year-old woman who beat her disabled husband to death with a wooden pole after suffering years of abuse has been cleared of his murder. Packiam Ramanathan attacked 76-year-old Kanagusabi Ramanathan as he lay in bed at their home in Newham, east London, on 21 September last year. The defendant told the Old Bailey she was ""in a trance"" when she hit him. She was found not guilty of murder, but had admitted manslaughter, citing his bullying during their 35-year marriage. The jury was told the couple had an arranged marriage in 1983 and fled Sri Lanka in the civil war. Mr Ramanathan was found with serious head injuries and multiple wounds to the body and neck after Packiam Ramanathan told her neighbour she had hit her husband. Giving evidence, Ramanathan said she lost control after years of abusive behaviour during which her husband had thrown sticks at her and accused her of having an affair with the fishmonger. Describing the killing, the defendant said: ""I don't know how I did it. For me I still feel like somebody else did it."" Prosecutor Sally O'Neil said the couple had argued about money and Ramanathan had become very angry at finding out her husband had written to Sri Lankan police accusing her brother of fraud and theft. However, Stephen Kamlish QC, defending, said if the 73-year-old had wanted to kill her diabetic husband she could have just given him a bigger dose of insulin. ""The fact it was done in the way it was - with a stick - means there was no planning,"" he said. The jury deliberated for half an hour to find Ramanathan not guilty of murder. She will be sentenced on Friday for manslaughter.

Man 'critical' after mass street brawlTwo other people were seriously injured in the incident following Sunday's Celtic-Rangers game.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Police remain at the scene of the fight A 47-year-old man is in a critical condition in hospital following a large-scale disturbance in Glasgow city centre after Sunday's Celtic-Rangers game. Two other men, aged 29 and 30, were seriously injured in the incident shortly after 17:00. Police cordoned off a number of streets in the Merchant City around Albion Street, Ingram Street and Bell Street. The attack on the 47-year-old man is being treated as attempted murder. It is understood that one line of inquiry is that the incident was connected to the earlier match at Celtic Park. Trouble flared at about 17:00 on Sunday Det Insp Peter Crombie said: ""We are currently going through CCTV and speaking to those who were in the area at the time to try to establish exactly what happened here. ""We are treating the attack on the 47-year-old man as attempted murder, and the attacks on the 29 and 30-year-old men as serious assaults. ""There may have been more people injured in this incident who did not seek medical treatment last night and we would appeal for them to come forward and speak to us."" He added: ""We also know that there were a number of people in the area who may have got caught up in it, or stopped to see what was going on. We would ask these people to check back and see if they have any mobile phone footage or images that can help us. ""If you were driving in the area, you may also have dash cam footage that can help - either prior to the incident taking place or in the aftermath.""
