Oil drilling application approved by government,"Campaigners lined up along a tape to mark out the size of vehicles expected to use the site An application to drill for gas in Surrey has been approved by the government after it had been refused twice by the county council. UK Oil & Gas (UKOG) applied to explore a site south of Dunsfold Road and east of High Loxley Road, in Dunsfold. Waverley Borough Council said it was ""the worst possible outcome"" and the drilling could lead to ""irreversible harm"" to the environment. UKOG said it was looking forward to working with the local community. UKOG chief executive Steve Sanderson said: ""We welcome this decision and its backing for Loxley's gas as a secure, sustainable energy source with a far lower pre-combustion carbon footprint than imports."" The planning application had been opposed by campaigners and the Conservative MP for South West Surrey, Jeremy Hunt. Mr Hunt, who was attending protests against the drilling in January, said: ""It's absolutely extraordinary after COP26 in Glasgow that we are even thinking about drilling for oil and gas in this area."" Surrey County Council had twice refused permission to build two exploratory wells at Dunsfold. An appeal by UKOG was then lodged with the planning inspector and the plans were approved by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Campaigners say access to the site at Pratts Corner is not suitable for the large vehicles needed to drill for gas A Surrey County Council spokesman said: ""Although the County Council has received the decision, officers had not yet had chance to review it in any detail."" Steve Williams, Waverley Borough Council's portfolio holder for environment and sustainability, said: ""This is the worst possible outcome for the people of Waverley, and we are bitterly disappointed at the secretary of state's decision. ""Without doubt, allowing this planning application will lead to irreversible harm to our environment and to local people."" The borough council said it was concerned that ""UKOG does not appear to have the funds to pay for reinstatement of the site so that if oil is not found in commercially viable quantities, the company can simply walk away, effectively transferring liability for clean-up and restoration costs to the local community"".

Gove vows to end 'scourge' of empty second homes,"Residents in areas such as Cornwall have long complained about second-home owners pushing up housing costs. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove has vowed to end the ""scourge"" of unoccupied second homes, as part of government plans to boost housing. Mr Gove said a new bill making it easier to charge higher council tax on empty properties in England would ""bring life back"" to communities. He also said new powers to force landlords to rent out empty shops would regenerate urban areas. But Labour said the legislation would not be enough to help struggling areas. The new powers are in the government's Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill, which started its journey through Parliament on Wednesday. The government has said ""levelling up"" economic imbalances between regions is a priority, but has faced criticism that its plans are vague. What is levelling up and how is it going? Ministers pledge votes on neighbours' extensions Owners could be forced to rent out empty shops The proposals over second homes are among a range of planning powers for England contained in the bill. A separate planning bill containing sweeping plans to replace England's case-by-case application system with new rules based on zones was abandoned earlier this year, after abacklash from Tory backbenchers. The government has said it wants to redirect new housing towards under-developed ""brownfield"" areas in urban areas, and has set higher housing targets for England's 20 largest towns and cities. Among provisions in the levelling up bill: Councils in England will gain extra powers to force landlords of empty shops to rent out their premises They will also get extra powers to make compulsory purchases designed to contribute towards regeneration Neighbours will be allowed to hold ""street votes"" to approve or reject house extensions in their area The new bill will also allow local authorities, from April 2024, to double council tax on owners of second homes that are furnished but unoccupied. They will also be able to charge the higher rate on unfurnished empty properties after just one year instead of the current two. It follows a separate announcement introducing new requirements for owners of holiday lets, who can avoid council tax and pay a reduced rate of business tax instead, to prove their properties are in fact being rented out. Ministers argue the new powers will benefit people in areas, particularly beauty spots, where second-home ownership has driven up the price and availability of local homes to buy and rent. But Liberal Democrat Tim Farron, who represents a constituency in the Lake District, said for many people in rural areas buying or renting a home had become a ""pipe dream"". He said the government needed to go further, by making holiday lets a ""separate category"" in the planning system - which he argued would give local councils ""more control"" over housing in their areas. In Wales, the Labour-run Welsh government plans to allow councils to chargeup to four times the standard levelof council tax on second homes. For Labour, shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said the bill ""contains more aimed at dealing with housing and planning than it does on levelling up,"" and would not ""turn around"" lower economic performance outside London. She added that under-performance reflected ""the brutal reality of a decade of underinvestment"" outside the capital. She called for details on the government's plans for ""street votes"", which said said appeared to have been ""drawn up on the back of an envelope"". She also urged the government to explain further proposals in the bill to replace the system by which property developers negotiate contributions towards local infrastructure and affordable housing. Ministers say their new levy will give councils more certainty about what money will be raised. However, the details have not been announced and are subject to a an ongoing consultation. Ms Nandy said there was ""no clarity in the bill"" about whether the new model would raise more or less money - something MPs were ""entitled to know"" as it progresses through Parliament.

Protester sentenced over BBC reporter pursuit,"Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt reporting from close to where he was abused An anti-lockdown protester has been sentenced after a BBC journalist was chased and called a traitor near Downing Street. Joseph Olswang, 39, was part of a group of people who shouted abuse at Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt on 14 June 2021. Olswang was given a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard he has bipolar disorder and was in the midst of a manic episode at the time. At a previous hearing Olswang, of Richmond-upon-Thames, pleaded guilty to using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment toMr Watt. He was found guilty of the same offence against PC Agnes Matvejeva. He had shouted at the Metropolitan Police officer for 35 minutes and called her a ""Brownshirt Nazi"" and ""evil scum"". Joseph Olswang was also ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work Olswang had been part of a group demonstrating against the government's extension of coronavirus restrictions in England by four weeks. Footage shared on social media showed demonstrators shouting abuse in the face of Mr Watt, who was wearing a BBC lanyard, as he tried to walk down the street behind a line of police officers. In mitigation, Olswang's barrister Eleanor De outlined his health issues, adding that the pandemic had ""created a perfect storm for a mental health crisis"". Police and demonstrators faced each other outside Downing Street District Judge Daniel Sternberg described what happened as ""disgraceful"". He told Olswang: ""You were part of a group of individuals who styled themselves as protesters but were doing very little more than harassing journalists and police officers - who were going about their business - and making their lives very unpleasant indeed."" Olswang was banned from Whitehall and Parliament Square for 18 months and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and undertake 20 days of rehabilitation. He was also told to pay Â£1,748 in compensation and costs. Five others who are accused of the same public order offence are due to stand trial later this month.

Petrol prices see biggest daily jump in 17 years,"The price of petrol saw its biggest daily jump in 17 years on Tuesday with a rise of more than 2p a litre. The RAC motoring group said the average cost of filling a typical family car with petrol was now Â£99.40 and could exceed Â£100 as soon as Thursday. Soaring fuel prices have been driven by the war in Ukraine and moves to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian oil. With food and energy bills also surging, many households are under pressure. The average price of petrol rose to 180.73p per litre on Tuesday, the RAC said. Meanwhile, the average price of diesel rose by almost 1.5p to another record high of 186.57p per litre, making the cost of filling a 55-litre family car Â£102.61. Why filling up your car could soon cost Â£100 Service station defends Â£2 per litre fuel costs In March,the government announced a 5p per litre cut to fuel dutyto help reduce costs for motorists. However, motoring groups have raised concerns retailers are not passing on the cut to customers. On Wednesday the prime minister's official spokesman said the government was ""not confident"" this was happening at all petrol stations. He said the government was ""continuing to look at all possible options"" and ""transparency may have an important role to play"" in ensuring the cut is passed on. It comes after a government source told the BBC a plan to name and shame petrol stations that fail to do so is ""still in the works"". The government says any increases in VAT receipts it gets from rising fuel prices are likely to be largely offset by reduced household spending and VAT on other items. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said if it found sufficient evidence the 5p fuel duty cut had not been passed on to drivers, then it would launch an investigation that could lead to fines for offending retailers. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said the accelerating costs of forecourt fuel was ""unprecedented"", adding it appeared prices were ""still some way from the peak"". But he said while the average price of diesel is heading towards Â£2 a litre, the cost of wholesale petrol had unexpectedly dropped by about 5p a litre on Tuesday, which if sustained, could stem the flow of ""daily record petrol prices"". Retailers base their prices on the wholesale cost of petrol and diesel but there is typically a two-week lag for pump prices to reflect any changes in wholesale prices due to the time it takes for fuel to reach forecourts. Mr Williams said the RAC's fuel watch data showed Asda had hiked its average petrol price by nearly 5p a litre in a single day, which he said was ""unheard of"". In response, Asda said wholesale fuel prices had increased ""at an unprecedented rate"" and ""we will do all we can to minimise the impact of rising wholesale prices on our customers"". Meanwhile, some forecourts are already selling petrol above Â£2 per litre, according to price comparison website PetrolPrices. The highest price was found to be 202.9p at BP sites on the A1 near Sunderland, the M4 near Chippenham in Wiltshire and the M6 near Burton-in-Kendal, Cumbria. The AA motoring group said the 2p litre rise was a ""huge shock"", but said the speculation that petrol prices could rise to Â£2 per litre on average ""just gives the fuel trade licence to pile on extra cost and the misery"". Fuel prices fell at the beginning of the Covid pandemic as many businesses temporarily closed and demand for energy collapsed. But as global economies recovered, prices rose again and have surged further after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Changes in prices at the pump are mainly determined by crude oil prices and the dollar exchange rate, because crude oil is traded in dollars. Russia is one of the world's major oil exporters and it is being targeted by economic and trading sanctions, which has led to potential supply concerns, pushing up oil prices. EU leaders have said they will block most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 to punish Moscow, which has also had an effect on prices. The UK - which gets 8% of its oil needs from Russia - has pledged to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and though it is not as dependent on Russian oil as the EU is, it is impacted when global prices rise. Energy and food prices are also being driven higher by the war in Ukraine. UK consumer prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, with millions hit by an unprecedented Â£700-a-year increase to their energy bills in April. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 9% in April and is expected to continue to rise this year.

Why is petrol so expensive?,"Motorists will have noticed that the price of petrol and diesel has been creeping up in recent weeks. These rising costs may pile further pressure on families whose budgets are already being squeezed. Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year. Recent data from 13 August puts petrol at an average of 149.1p per litre on UK forecourts. In just two weeks, it has shot up by more than 4p and it marks the highest price seen since February. Diesel stands at an average of 150.6p per litre - a level not seen since late May. Although it now costs about Â£82 to fill up a 55-litre family car, prices have fallen back from the record highs seen last summer, which were sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on road fuel prices, said that this recent surge would, however, ""lump pressure back on diesel users, particularly on small businesses"". Fuel prices in the UK move together with changes in the price of crude oil - which it is made from. They are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as crude oil is traded in dollars. A weaker pound would mean that fuel gets more expensive. Oil prices have risen in recent weeks as producers have tried to restrict output. Oil rich nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that form part of a group called Opec+ have cut back production. They are grappling with slow demand as economies around the world struggle with high prices and the adjustment after the Covid pandemic. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices. As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. What is Opec and what is happening to oil prices? Livia Gallarati, an oil markets analyst at Energy Aspects, said that prices could grind higher still because of supplies being dented. She suggested Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, could even move above $90 (Â£71) per barrel. Supplies have also been affected by recent outages at oil refineries across the United States and Asia. Oil prices jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Brent crude hitting more than $120 a barrel in June 2022. Russia used to be one of the world's largest oil exporters, but that wasbefore punishing sanctions were imposed by the West. After peaking in summer last year, oil prices fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in March this year amid concerns over weak demand. Experts have said that motorists shouldn't expect petrol prices to go up much more unless garages and supermarkets decide to take a bigger cut - or margin - per litre sold. The price of diesel, however, might rise in the autumn and winter because large parts of Europe rely on it for their heating. Retailers said in July that they will to workwith the UK's competition watchdog to set up a scheme to allow motorists to compare live fuel prices online. It came after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that weak competition meant that the average annual supermarket margins on fuel had increased by 6p per litre between 2019 and 2022 - equivalent to Â£900m in extra costs for drivers. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that despite the recent announcement, ""there is still far too much regional variation in prices, particularly among the big four supermarkets, which unfairly penalises drivers in some areas."" He urged drivers to shop around where they can in a bid to save cash. In March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also announced that fuel duty - a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel - would be frozen for another year, having been cut by 5p the year before. It will cost the government more than Â£5bn and think tanks such as theInstitute for Government have suggested,externalit might sit awkwardly with its climate-related pledges. Watch your speed:The RAC says 45-50mph is the most efficient speed to drive for fuel efficiency Switch off the air conditioning: Extra energy is needed to power a car's air conditioning system and turning it on can increase your fuel consumption by up to 10%, according to the AA Check your tyre pressure:Underinflated tyres will use up extra petrol.

"Fuel prices surged in bank holiday break, says RAC","The price of petrol surged by nearly 5p a litre in the week that included the bank holiday break, the RAC says, and could soon hit 180p a litre. The motoring body said the average cost of a litre of petrol had hit a ""frightening"" 177.88p by Sunday. Oil prices remain high due to the war in Ukraine and sanctions to reduce Europe's dependence on Russia. In March,the government cut fuel duty by 5p a litre for a year, but the RAC called for more help for motorists. RAC spokesperson Simon Williams, said: ""More radical government intervention is urgently needed, whether that's in the form of a further reduction in fuel duty or a VAT cut."" Over the week from 30 May to 5 June, average diesel prices also rose from 182.58p a litre to 185.01p. ""Sadly, we expect to see the average price of petrol break through the 180p mark this week with diesel moving further towards 190p,"" said Mr Williams. AA fuel price spokesman Luke Bosdet said: ""Shock and awe is the only way to describe what has been happening at the pump during the half-term break."" He added: ""The forces behind the surge have been oil jumping back above $120 a barrel for the first time since late March, combined with petrol commodity prices being boosted by summer motoring demand."" How much will the fuel duty cut on petrol save you? Why are prices rising so quickly? Many UK households are struggling with the rising cost of living and the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation reached 9% in the year to April. The rise in the price of petrol and diesel was a major contributor to the increase in inflation. As well as the war in Ukraine, Brent crude prices remain elevated after major oil producer Saudi Arabia said on Monday that it would increase its selling price from July.

Teacher dead and pupils hurt as car hits Berlin crowd,"The car crashed into a store A teacher was killed and 14 schoolchildren were injured after a car hit a crowd on a busy street in the German capital, Berlin. The group was on a school trip to Berlin from the state of Hesse. A second teacher was seriously hurt. Police say the driver, a 29-year-old man, was arrested at the scene. Berlin Interior Affairs Minister Iris Spranger said evidence suggested the driver was a ""mentally ill person running amok"". The incident occurred shortly before 10:30 (08:30 GMT) in the heart of western Berlin, on one of its busiest shopping streets. The woman who died has been identified as a schoolteacher who was on a trip with a class of teenagers from the central state of Hesse. Berlin police say she died on the spot. ""There are seriously injured people among the more than a dozen injured,"" police spokesperson Thilo Cablitz said. Bad Arolsen Mayor Marko Lambion said a bus was on its way to pick up the children from Berlin. ""We're doing everything we can to bring them home,"" he said at the press conference. The driver has dual German and Armenian citizenship and lives in Berlin. Earlier reports that he had left a note in his car were denied by officials. Witnesses described seeing a silver Renault Clio veering into a crowd of people on the pavement near Berlin's busy KurfÃ¼rstendamm shopping avenue, before driving back on to the road and crashing into a shop window. A witness who would only be named as F Kacan said the driver had abandoned the car and had taken off running but ""we were able to stop him"", AFP news agency reports. The actor John Barrowman tweeted that he had been nearby when the incident took place and in a video posted from the scene said the car had repeatedly mounted the footpath before crashing into the storefront.

Zelensky ties fate of east Ukraine to city battle,"Smoke over Severodonetsk this week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that fighting for the city of Severodonetsk may decide the outcome of the war in the east of the country. ""In many respects, the fate of the Donbas is being decided there,"" he said as combat raged in the industrial belt with Russian and separatist forces. He said his troops were inflicting major losses on enemy forces. But Ukrainian forces have been pushed back to the outskirts, according to the region's top Ukrainian official. Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region (which makes up the Donbas along with the neighbouring Donetsk region), said special forces had pulled back after Russia ""started levelling the area with shelling and air strikes"". ""Our [forces] now again control only the outskirts of the city,"" he told local media. ""But the fighting is still going on, our [forces] are defending Severodonetsk."" ""It is impossible to say the Russians completely control the city,"" he added. Some 15,000 civilians remained in Severodonetsk and the nearby city of Lysychansk, the governor said. Civilians in Lysychansk sheltered from shelling this week Russia said on Wednesdaythat Ukraine was suffering ""significant losses in manpower, weapons and military equipment"" in the Donbas. Daily round-up: Warnings over grain blockage and fuel 'gold rush' The focus of the war switched to the east at the end of March after Russian forces pulled back from the region around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Large parts of the Donbas have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since earlier fighting in 2014-15. In another development, UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that the consequences for the world of Russia's invasion were worsening, with 1.6 billion people affected. ""The war's impact on food security, energy and finance is systemic, severe and speeding up,"" he said. In an interview for BBC News, World Trade Organization Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned thatthe food crisis could last for years without intervention. African countries could be hit especially hard by wheat and fertilizer shortages, she said. Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports, unable to be exported because of the war. Global banking experts believeRussia's economy will shrink 15% by the end of the year- and a further 3% in 2023 - because of Western sanctions, a mass exodus of companies and a collapse in exports. The figures could be even worse if Europe fully weans itself off Russian energy, the Institute of International Finance warned.

Ice cream man puts lolly sales on ice over costs,"Mark Biggs may have to stop selling ice lollies from his van because he cannot afford the electricity to run the freezer An ice cream man is considering axing ice lollies because of the cost of freezing them. Mark Biggs, from Merthyr Tydfil, runs Biggzy's Ice Cream and said there have been weeks he has not paid himself a wage. Rising prices for electricity, diesel and wholesale food mean he is considering quitting the job he loves. The UK government said it is ""supporting British businesses to navigate the months ahead"". The Federation of Small Businesses said 11% of small firms plan to close, sell or downsize over the coming year, according to their research. Cost of living crisis: What support is there? Households face being Â£600 worse off this year Costs drive young people back to their parents Mr Biggs used to be a mechanic and said his decision to ""change oily rags for rags covered in ice cream"" made him happy. ""I love this job, it's the best job I've had,"" he said. ""All I want to do is make people happy. I'm happy when I'm serving."" Mr Biggs said it's ""upsetting"" to think his dream job could come to an end He said wanted this to be a ""lifetime"" job, but can't see that happening with the way prices are rising. ""It's upsetting when you think about it, it could be over."" Three days-worth of diesel for the van is costing him Â£120 and the fridges are charged from his home electricity supply. He said he may have to remove ice lollies from the van, due to the cost of electricity of the additional fridge. He is also paying suppliers more for ice cream mix and snacks. ""Everything costs way too much at the minute, I can't put my prices up because people moan if I put my prices up,"" he said. He added that he takes home on average around Â£150 a week, but sometimes has no wage at all. After the disruption of the pandemic, many working in leisure, hospitality and tourism are hoping for a good summer, but businesses face many difficulties. This week, the RAC saidit costs Â£98 to fill the average carwith petrol and Â£101.86 with diesel. The British Retail Consortium saidshoppers are spending less than they werea year ago. Hopkin Smith, of Taff Valley Activity Centre near Pontypridd, said corporate clients and local family day trips aren't as frequent as they used to be. Mr Smith says his business is in a Catch-22 situation with rising costs but customers unable to pay higher prices ""What is worrying me is that the cost of fuel is going to go up again in the autumn, the stag and hens will have plateaued, and with gas and electricity prices going up, the family groups are going to be hit harder again,"" said Mr Smith. ""So while we're able to get through the summer, (by) the autumn, winter and next year I don't know where we'll be going. ""We're in a sort of Catch-22, reluctance from customers to spend while our costs are escalating all the time."" With foreign travel restricted, last year was a busy summer for Lydia Watts at Under The Oak glamping in Bedwas, near Caerphilly. However, Ms Watts is expecting this season to be ""challenging"". Lydia Watts runs Under The Oak glamping in Bedwas, near Caerphilly ""It does seem that people are more wary about booking that big holiday, spending hundreds, getting away because the cost of fuel's gone up, their household bills have gone up and there does seem to be an air of uncertainty,"" said Ms Watts. ""People are maybe booking a little later, booking shorter stays, cutting back a little bit."" Sam Foulkes runs Wrexham's Rock The Park festival and said the cost of living is causing sales to drop. ""People cannot afford to go to events and festivals. ""They are worried about being able to have hot running water, a roof over their head and a light on in the dark,"" he said. Mr Foulkes said the events industry is facing a tough time with ""little or no financial support available."" Sam Foulkes said rising prices, especially diesel, are causing him ""major issues"" Ben Cottam, from The Federation of Small Businesses Wales, said the UK and Welsh governments should offer ""targeted interventions like grant support"", similar to measures taken during the pandemic. ""We have called on UK government to extend the energy support issued via the council tax system to small businesses, as they are currently not protected by the energy price cap unlike domestic customers. ""We have also called on government to install a sick pay rebate, to allow breathing space for the smallest businesses."" Asked if pandemic-style business grants were part of the answer, Welsh government Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said he wanted to support business ""in a way that helps them to move forward with their customer base"". ""So it's both about putting money into the pockets of customers - that's why we've put money into advice services, it's why our Â£380m package of support for households really matters. ""But we've then got to think about how we use the opportunities to support businesses into the future."" He added that would need to involve the UK government and its ""much larger fiscal firepower"" to have a significant impact. A UK government spokesman said: ""We've cut taxes for hundreds of thousands of businesses by increasing the Employment Allowance and slashing fuel duty. ""We continue to support businesses with tax incentives like the Annual Investment Allowance and the super-deduction, the biggest business tax cut in modern British history as well as investing in skills, innovation and infrastructure to boost growth for the long-term.""

Brexit and Covid reduce MDMA purity at festivals,"MDMA is a class A drug, and possession can lead to prosecution and up to seven years in prison MDMA found at music festivals is more contaminated following Brexit and Covid lockdowns, according to new research. Researchers at Cardiff University analysed hundreds of samples of the illegal drug, also called ecstasy, at three UK festivals in 2019 and 2021. About half of the samples (45%) tested in 2021 contained no MDMA, compared to 7% in 2019. Dr Michael Pascoe of Cardiff University said the UK's drugs market was seeing ""unprecedented turbulence"". The report suggested Brexit-related disruption to supply chains, in addition to Covid lockdowns decreasing demand, had caused a shortage of MDMA. ""Without laboratory tests, it's impossible to tell what's really in the drugs people purchase - and the pandemic and Brexit appears to have exacerbated this issue,"" said Dr Pascoe, co-lead author of the study. Drug deaths at highest level since 1993 'Extremely potent' ecstasy tablets warning Drugs plan aims to help 300,000 problem drug users The study, led by drug checking charity The Loop, found that in many cases MDMA was substituted for other substances such as caffeine or alternativesynthetic psychoactive drugs,external. Researchers from Cardiff University and the University of Liverpool found the presence of MDMA in samples sold as ecstasy fell from 93% in 2019 to 55% in 2021. Report co-author Professor Measham said no test can tell whether a substance is ""safe"" to take Prof Fiona Measham, co-author of the study and director of The Loop, said testing facilities were made available to help people make informed decisions. ""We do not encourage or assist drug use and always highlight that no test can tell whether a substance is 'safe' to take,"" she added. One 24-year-old woman from Cardiff, who did not want to be named, said the statistics were ""terrifying"". ""Of course there are risks that come with taking any drugs, but it's something that happens so often, especially at festivals, and it can't just be ignored. ""Labelling it illegal and ignoring the problem will just lead to kids dying, and preventing that with actual advice and testing is a much better way of actually trying to sort out the problem. ""I will definitely be testing any drugs I buy in the future. I think the normalisation of drug testing at festivals is really important, especially now."" The Loop has offered on site drug testing at a number of UK festivals In the supposed MDMA samples analysed from 2021, one in five included caffeine, and another fifth included synthetic cathinones. Both substances were almost completely absent from the 2019 samples. Synthetic cathonines, also known as ""bath salts"", are part of a group of drugs that concern public health officials called new psychoactive substances (NPS). These are drugs which are ""unregulated psychoactive mind-altering substances"", according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. ""This study illustrates how cathinones are mis-sold as MDMA during periods of scarcity in the MDMA market,"" added Dr Pascoe. ""Rapid onsite testing, dissemination of alerts, harm reduction information and associated risk communications through media and social media channels provide vital ways to inform drug-users, practitioners and policy makers to help reduce drug-related harms at festivals and beyond.""

LiveLiveUkraine war's impact on food security severe - UN chief15 minutes ago,"Russia's foreign minister says three men sentenced to death - two Britons and one Moroccan - committed crimes in a breakaway Ukrainian region All three were convicted by a Russian proxy court in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic UK PM Boris Johnson urges ministers to do ""everything in their power"" to secure the release of the two Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner were fighting with the Ukrainian army and their sentencing is an ""egregious breach"" of the Geneva Conventions, the UK says Meanwhile, there's a risk of a major cholera outbreak in the occupied port city of Mariupol, the UK's Ministry of Defence says The exiled deputy mayor says the 100,000 people still in the city are at growing risk of disease Edited by Rob Corp We're pausing our live coverage now. Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities. It raises money for Unicef and this year the charity says some of the money raised will go towards helping those impacted by the war. ""This event is going to help a lot of people in Ukraine,"" he says, ""especially kids, we're going to create a lot of great programmes to improve a lot of things for kids."" Shevchenko with President Zelensky at the Independence Day military parade in Kyiv last August Three residents of Mykolaiv, in the south of the country, queue to collect humanitarian aid at a Red Cross distribution point In the outskirts of Kharkiv, a crater is pictured outside a school following a military strike Meanwhile in Russia, President Vladimir Putin greets Turkmenistan""s President Serdar Berdymukhamedov during a joint press conference following a meeting in Moscow And staff at a former McDonald's in Podolsk, outside Moscow, prepare for reopening this week under a new name. McDonald's pulled out of Russia over the Ukraine war. Its new Russian buyer has not yet revealed the name of the chain, although the logo has been revealed Aiden Aslin, left, Shaun Pinner, right, and Brahim Saaudun, centre, have been sentenced to death Amnesty International says that three foreign soldiers sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court is a situation that ""has no precedent"". Two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun were captured by Russian troops while fighting for Ukraine. All three were convicted by a court which is not internationally recognised in the pro-Russian, so-called Donetsk People's Republic. ""The party which holds full responsibility over these individualsâ circumstances and fate at present, is Russia,"" Denis Krivosheev, from Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, told Reuters. ""This situation has no precedent. This so-called Donetsk Peopleâs Republic has a so-called criminal code in which it has a so-called death penalty, which this time, and this hasnât happened before, they are applying to prisoners of war,"" he said. Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely."" Chris PartridgeBBC News This video can not be played Low-flying Ukrainian jet skims above trees Ukraine
is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied. Brits Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were all sentenced to death Thanks for joining us this afternoon - here's the latest on what's been happening in Ukraine: Russia defends death sentences for captured Britons  UK's defence secretary visits Ukraine  Cholera in Mariupol  How long will the war last?  Stay with us for the latest developments as they unfold. Volodymyr Zelensky Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking to students across the UK in a live broadcast to several universities. The eventhas been organised by the Ukrainian Students Unionand universities taking part include Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Glasgow, LSE, Manchester, Oxford, UCL and City, University of London. Zelensky tells them it's now 107 days since the war began, adding: ""107 days we have been tested for survival"". ""This war is visible and monstrous,"" he says, adding that the Russians ""talk about peaceful goals but... they're killing children and women."" Zelensky speaks about history, and picks out some historical events from the UK cities where the universities are based. ""The [Russian] mission is to delete our
history, our state, our identity, and to deny our existence. And as such to
tell the world that we never existed that we are an artificially created people
like a variety of some kind of plants or animals."" State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The
venue where Volodymyr Zelensky will be speaking to students at Coventry
University usually hosts cinema nights - but this evening it will be the
Ukrainian president's face on the big screen. Only 75 tickets were made available
for the event, and they were snapped up within hours. The first few
students have started arriving and there are a few Ukrainian flags draped on
the front row. Pavel Pimkin The president of the universityâs Ukraine Society is Pavel Pimkin, 20, whose male relatives are still in his home country. He says heâs feeling âhonoured and nervousâ about asking his nationâs president a question later. The address will also be shown at other British universities that have Ukrainian societies.

Zelensky ties fate of east Ukraine to city battleUkraine's president says fighting for Severodonetsk may prove decisive in the battle for the east.,"Smoke over Severodonetsk this week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that fighting for the city of Severodonetsk may decide the outcome of the war in the east of the country. ""In many respects, the fate of the Donbas is being decided there,"" he said as combat raged in the industrial belt with Russian and separatist forces. He said his troops were inflicting major losses on enemy forces. But Ukrainian forces have been pushed back to the outskirts, according to the region's top Ukrainian official. Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region (which makes up the Donbas along with the neighbouring Donetsk region), said special forces had pulled back after Russia ""started levelling the area with shelling and air strikes"". ""Our [forces] now again control only the outskirts of the city,"" he told local media. ""But the fighting is still going on, our [forces] are defending Severodonetsk."" ""It is impossible to say the Russians completely control the city,"" he added. Some 15,000 civilians remained in Severodonetsk and the nearby city of Lysychansk, the governor said. Civilians in Lysychansk sheltered from shelling this week Russia said on Wednesdaythat Ukraine was suffering ""significant losses in manpower, weapons and military equipment"" in the Donbas. Daily round-up: Warnings over grain blockage and fuel 'gold rush' The focus of the war switched to the east at the end of March after Russian forces pulled back from the region around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Large parts of the Donbas have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since earlier fighting in 2014-15. In another development, UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that the consequences for the world of Russia's invasion were worsening, with 1.6 billion people affected. ""The war's impact on food security, energy and finance is systemic, severe and speeding up,"" he said. In an interview for BBC News, World Trade Organization Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned thatthe food crisis could last for years without intervention. African countries could be hit especially hard by wheat and fertilizer shortages, she said. Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports, unable to be exported because of the war. Global banking experts believeRussia's economy will shrink 15% by the end of the year- and a further 3% in 2023 - because of Western sanctions, a mass exodus of companies and a collapse in exports. The figures could be even worse if Europe fully weans itself off Russian energy, the Institute of International Finance warned. Russia invaded on 24 February, saying it was seeking to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine - a claim that has been widely discredited. Since the war began,at least 4,253 civilians have been killed and 5,141 injured,externalaccording to the UN, along with thousands of combatants on both sides, whilemore than 14 million people have fled their homes.

Warning UK to see slowest growth of developed nations,"The UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year and will stagnate next year, a think tank says. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expects the UK economy to grow by 3.6% this year, followed by 0% growth next year. It means the UK will go from the second-fastest growing economy in the G7 group of industrial nations to the slowest growing in 2023. The G7 members are the UK, US, Canada, Germany, Japan, France and Italy. The OECD is a group of countries which aims to assist economic development, raise living standards and promote growth in world trade. Laurence Boone, the Paris-based think tank's chief economist, said the UK was being hit hard by a combination of factors, including higher interest rates, higher taxes, reduced trade and more expensive energy and food. Inflation is expected to keep rising and peak at over 10% at the end of this year before gradually declining to 4.7% by the end of 2023. World Bank warns of recession risk due to Ukraine war Why are prices rising so quickly? Cost of living crisis prompts 'big state' response However, the report does not take into account the chancellor's emergency measures announced on 26th May. Those measures, which includeda Â£400 energy bill discount for every household in the UK, are worth around Â£15bn. A Treasury spokesperson said many people would be concerned by the forecasts. ""While we can't insulate the UK from global pressures entirely, our economy is in a strong position to deal with these challenges. We have a plan for growth, and we are supporting people with the cost of living,"" they added. Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the OECD report ""lays bare the extreme challenges facing the UK economy"". ""That economic growth in the UK will grind to a halt next year, with only Russia performing worse than us in the G20, is a shameful indictment of the chaos and incoherence of this Conservative government,"" she said. ""Labour would create a more secure economy by spending wisely, taxing fairly, and getting the economy firing on all cylinders."" Because we've spent so much time dwelling on the tightest squeeze on living standards in decades that's predicted to happen this year, it's worth going against the trend for a change. Buried in the small print of the OECD forecast that says our economy will stagnate is a consolation. Inflation in the UK, it predicts, will halve. Before you get too excited, please note that I haven't said when that will happen. Not this year, when the OECD expects (like the Bank of England) that it will get into double figures before the year is out. But next year, when it's forecast to drop to a relatively benign level of 4.7% by the end of 2023. That of course does not mean that the cost of living will be getting more affordable, just that it will be getting less affordable less quickly. By that time the soaring cost of energy to consumers, the think tank expects, will either be rising less quickly or falling. However, it will be months or years beyond that before living standards recover to their 2021 level. The cuts to UK economic growth come alongside a global slowdown which is due largely to the war in Ukraine. Global growth has been downgraded from 4.5% to 3% this year, the OECD said in its latest economic outlook. Only Argentina and Australia saw their growth projections upgraded. ""The world is set to pay a hefty price for Russia's war against Ukraine. A humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, leaving thousands dead, forcing millions of refugees to flee their homes and threatening an economic recovery that was underway after two years of the pandemic,"" the organisation said. ""As Russia and Ukraine are large commodity exporters,the war has sent energy and food prices soaring, making life much harder for many people across the world."" The OECD warned that Russia's attack on Ukraine will lead to higher inflation and lower growth for at least the next year. But the organisation stressed that prolonged hardship could be avoided by concerted action from governments and central banks.

Teacher dead and pupils hurt as car hits Berlin crowdPolice say it is unclear whether the incident was an accident or a deliberate attack.Europe,"The car crashed into a store A teacher was killed and 14 schoolchildren were injured after a car hit a crowd on a busy street in the German capital, Berlin. The group was on a school trip to Berlin from the state of Hesse. A second teacher was seriously hurt. Police say the driver, a 29-year-old man, was arrested at the scene. Berlin Interior Affairs Minister Iris Spranger said evidence suggested the driver was a ""mentally ill person running amok"". The incident occurred shortly before 10:30 (08:30 GMT) in the heart of western Berlin, on one of its busiest shopping streets. The woman who died has been identified as a schoolteacher who was on a trip with a class of teenagers from the central state of Hesse. Berlin police say she died on the spot. ""There are seriously injured people among the more than a dozen injured,"" police spokesperson Thilo Cablitz said. Bad Arolsen Mayor Marko Lambion said a bus was on its way to pick up the children from Berlin. ""We're doing everything we can to bring them home,"" he said at the press conference. The driver has dual German and Armenian citizenship and lives in Berlin. Earlier reports that he had left a note in his car were denied by officials. Witnesses described seeing a silver Renault Clio veering into a crowd of people on the pavement near Berlin's busy KurfÃ¼rstendamm shopping avenue, before driving back on to the road and crashing into a shop window. A witness who would only be named as F Kacan said the driver had abandoned the car and had taken off running but ""we were able to stop him"", AFP news agency reports. The actor John Barrowman tweeted that he had been nearby when the incident took place and in a video posted from the scene said the car had repeatedly mounted the footpath before crashing into the storefront.

Ice cream man puts lolly sales on ice over costsMark Biggs of Biggzy's Ice Cream says some weeks he does not make any money due to rising billsWales,"Mark Biggs may have to stop selling ice lollies from his van because he cannot afford the electricity to run the freezer An ice cream man is considering axing ice lollies because of the cost of freezing them. Mark Biggs, from Merthyr Tydfil, runs Biggzy's Ice Cream and said there have been weeks he has not paid himself a wage. Rising prices for electricity, diesel and wholesale food mean he is considering quitting the job he loves. The UK government said it is ""supporting British businesses to navigate the months ahead"". The Federation of Small Businesses said 11% of small firms plan to close, sell or downsize over the coming year, according to their research. Cost of living crisis: What support is there? Households face being Â£600 worse off this year Costs drive young people back to their parents Mr Biggs used to be a mechanic and said his decision to ""change oily rags for rags covered in ice cream"" made him happy. ""I love this job, it's the best job I've had,"" he said. ""All I want to do is make people happy. I'm happy when I'm serving."" Mr Biggs said it's ""upsetting"" to think his dream job could come to an end He said wanted this to be a ""lifetime"" job, but can't see that happening with the way prices are rising. ""It's upsetting when you think about it, it could be over."" Three days-worth of diesel for the van is costing him Â£120 and the fridges are charged from his home electricity supply. He said he may have to remove ice lollies from the van, due to the cost of electricity of the additional fridge. He is also paying suppliers more for ice cream mix and snacks. ""Everything costs way too much at the minute, I can't put my prices up because people moan if I put my prices up,"" he said. He added that he takes home on average around Â£150 a week, but sometimes has no wage at all. After the disruption of the pandemic, many working in leisure, hospitality and tourism are hoping for a good summer, but businesses face many difficulties. This week, the RAC saidit costs Â£98 to fill the average carwith petrol and Â£101.86 with diesel. The British Retail Consortium saidshoppers are spending less than they werea year ago. Hopkin Smith, of Taff Valley Activity Centre near Pontypridd, said corporate clients and local family day trips aren't as frequent as they used to be. Mr Smith says his business is in a Catch-22 situation with rising costs but customers unable to pay higher prices ""What is worrying me is that the cost of fuel is going to go up again in the autumn, the stag and hens will have plateaued, and with gas and electricity prices going up, the family groups are going to be hit harder again,"" said Mr Smith. ""So while we're able to get through the summer, (by) the autumn, winter and next year I don't know where we'll be going. ""We're in a sort of Catch-22, reluctance from customers to spend while our costs are escalating all the time."" With foreign travel restricted, last year was a busy summer for Lydia Watts at Under The Oak glamping in Bedwas, near Caerphilly. However, Ms Watts is expecting this season to be ""challenging"". Lydia Watts runs Under The Oak glamping in Bedwas, near Caerphilly ""It does seem that people are more wary about booking that big holiday, spending hundreds, getting away because the cost of fuel's gone up, their household bills have gone up and there does seem to be an air of uncertainty,"" said Ms Watts. ""People are maybe booking a little later, booking shorter stays, cutting back a little bit."" Sam Foulkes runs Wrexham's Rock The Park festival and said the cost of living is causing sales to drop. ""People cannot afford to go to events and festivals. ""They are worried about being able to have hot running water, a roof over their head and a light on in the dark,"" he said. Mr Foulkes said the events industry is facing a tough time with ""little or no financial support available."" Sam Foulkes said rising prices, especially diesel, are causing him ""major issues"" Ben Cottam, from The Federation of Small Businesses Wales, said the UK and Welsh governments should offer ""targeted interventions like grant support"", similar to measures taken during the pandemic. ""We have called on UK government to extend the energy support issued via the council tax system to small businesses, as they are currently not protected by the energy price cap unlike domestic customers. ""We have also called on government to install a sick pay rebate, to allow breathing space for the smallest businesses."" Asked if pandemic-style business grants were part of the answer, Welsh government Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said he wanted to support business ""in a way that helps them to move forward with their customer base"". ""So it's both about putting money into the pockets of customers - that's why we've put money into advice services, it's why our Â£380m package of support for households really matters. ""But we've then got to think about how we use the opportunities to support businesses into the future."" He added that would need to involve the UK government and its ""much larger fiscal firepower"" to have a significant impact. A UK government spokesman said: ""We've cut taxes for hundreds of thousands of businesses by increasing the Employment Allowance and slashing fuel duty. ""We continue to support businesses with tax incentives like the Annual Investment Allowance and the super-deduction, the biggest business tax cut in modern British history as well as investing in skills, innovation and infrastructure to boost growth for the long-term.""

Army on standby to fill Commonwealth Games jobs,"The Games will take place at venues across the West Midlands Five thousand short-term jobs still need to be filled ahead of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, with the Army on standby to help out. There are 50 days before the start of the event, which runs from 28 July to 8 August across the city and wider West Midlands. Chief Executive Ian Reid said they had spoken to the military to take steps if necessary. Leaflets have been put through doors as part of a recruitment drive. Organisers say they want to give people opportunities to get skills that will help in finding work after the Games. Jobs in security, catering and cleaning still need to be filled. The games start in 50 days as shown by the countdown clock in Centenary Square The volunteer outfits, designed by students from across Birmingham, were unveiled recently Mr Reid said: ""Up to 5,000 roles are still to be put in place. We're seeing a huge uptick of the back off the marketing campaign but there is still a lot of recruitment to be done over the next few weeks."" Speaking from the Sandwell Aquatics Centre earlier, he said they had a plan A and B in place, the latter being bringing in the Army, and they were monitoring the situation closely. In 2012, up to 13,500military personnel helped to provide security at the London Olympic Games. So far the preparations for the Games have gone smoothly. The major venues - the Alexander stadium in Birmingham and the Sandwell Aquatic centre - are finished but, like many large employers at the moment, they are facing recruitment problems. Chief Executive of the Organising Committee Ian Reid said lessons had been learned from London 2012, when the Army had to help at venues because of shortages of security staff. Mr Reid said that unlike London they were working with a number of different security providers, instead of a single organisation, to spread the risk. Chief executive Ian Reid, visiting Sandwell Aquatic Centre, said the situation is being monitored closely Richard Smith, from the Department of Work and Pensions, who was at a jobs fair at Villa Park, said people were still needed to fill roles in security, hospitality, stewardship and cleaning, which, he added, were also needed in the ""wider economy"" beyond this summer's  international sports event. Thomas Phipps, assistant branch manager at Verve People Birmingham, which is aiding recruitment, said the operation was ""huge"" for his agency. ""The demand is going to be there because thousands of people are going to be coming into Birmingham to watch the [Games]."" Posts range from three weeks to three months and people can fill in an expression of interest form online. Tom Overton said he wanted to help local people increase their skills Tom Overton, resourcing team leader for the summer jobs campaign at Birmingham 2022, said he wanted to use the opportunities to ""upskill"" local people who may not have formal qualifications but wanted to get into work.

Cinema pulls film about Muhammad's daughter,"Cineworld has cancelled all UK screenings of a film about the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, after it prompted protests outside some cinemas. The cinema chain said it made the decision ""to ensure the safety of our staff and customers"". More than 120,000 people have signed a petition for The Lady of Heaven film to be pulled from UK cinemas. The Bolton Council of Mosques called the film ""blasphemous"" and ""underpinned with a sectarian ideology"". But the film's producer, Malik Shlibak, said ""no one should dictate for the British public what they can and cannot watch or discuss"", describing the protesters as ""fringe groups"". The film, which was released in UK cinemas on 3 June, claims to tell the story of Lady Fatima, the daughter of Prophet Muhammad. It has been criticised by some groups for depicting the Prophet Muhammad - which is seen as an insult in Islam - and for its portrayal of prominent revered figures in early Sunni Islam. It was pulled from the Cineworld chain after reported protests in Bolton, Birmingham and Sheffield. In Bolton, more than 100 people protested outside the cinema,Bolton News,externalreported. In an email to Cineworld - reported by Bolton News - Bolton Council of Mosques chairman Asif Patel said the film was ""underpinned with a sectarian ideology"" and ""misrepresents orthodox historical narratives and disrespects the most esteemed individuals of Islamic history"". The Muslim news site 5Pillars also shared a picture on Twitter of what it said showed 200 Muslims protesting against the film outside a Birmingham branch of Cineworld on Sunday. Video footage circulating online appears to show a manager of a Cineworld cinema in Sheffield informing protesters that a screening of the film had been cancelled,the Guardian,externalreported.

Mr Shlibak criticised the decision by Cineworld to pull the film, saying it was ""cowering"" to the protesters' demands. He told the BBC: ""Now they see any time they're upset or mildly offended they'll do the same."" Mr Shlibak added that there were millions of Muslims in the UK, and the protesters did not represent all of their views. ""We need to be very careful not to cower down to that and do the exact opposite, which is say to the people that we are tolerant, we accept different views and positions and we're happy to disagree, even passionately, but there should be no censorship involved."" But he also said the protests would fail at shutting down the film, adding that a ""large, large population across the UK have just heard about the film for the first time, so that's brilliant for us"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid also criticised the decision to pull the film. Speaking to TalkTV on Wednesday,external, the health secretary said: ""You might not like what someone's got to say, but they have a right to say it."" Mr Javid pointed out that there are no blasphemy laws in the UK and warned that would be ""an incredibly dangerous road to go down"". ""What we have in this country is freedom of speech and expression and that is a fundamental value,"" he added. Unlike some incidents in the past, opposition to the film is not primarily about the way the Prophet Mohammed is depicted - though there is a CGI portrayal of him in it. Criticism mainly centres around the way the Shia Muslim film-maker and cleric Yasser Al-Habib has portrayed prominent revered figures in early Sunni Islam, implying that there are comparisons between their actions with those of the Islamic State group in Iraq. Leaders of the protests have said while they want the film banned, their demonstrations were peaceful, but cinemas clearly felt their behaviour was intimidating enough to warrant screenings to be pulled. Outrage since that happened - including from some Muslims who had wanted to see the film - has been because a relatively small number of people have managed to exert their will in a way that that appears to normalise censorship on the grounds of blasphemy. The Muslim Council of Britain, the UK's largest Muslim umbrella organisation, has described the film as ""divisive"". In a statement on Sunday, the organisation said it ""supports those scholars and leaders who are advocating for greater unity and for the common good"". ""There are some - including many of this film's supporters or those engaging in sectarianism in their response - whose primary goal is to fuel hatred,"" the statement added. Screenings of the film were still scheduled for Wednesday at a number of Vue cinemas in London and south-east England. Screenings went ahead at this Vue cinema in west London, despite protests outside In a statement, a spokesperson said: ""Vue takes seriously the responsibilities that come with providing a platform for a wide variety of content and believes in showcasing films of interest to diverse communities across the UK. ""Vue will only show a film once the BBFC (the independent British Board of Film Classification) has assessed and rated a film. The Lady of Heaven has been BBFC accredited and is on show in a number of our cinemas."" The company would not confirm whether any screenings had been cancelled, but added: ""Decisions about how long a film remains on show are taken on a site-by-site basis and based on a variety of commercial and operational factors."" A spokesperson for Cineworld said: ""Due to recent incidents related to screenings of The Lady of Heaven, we have made the decision to cancel upcoming screenings of the film nationwide to ensure the safety of our staff and customers.""

UK wonât copy EU's plan for common charger,"A USB Type-C charger (right) beside Apple's proprietary Lightning cable The UK government says it is not ""currently considering"" copying European Union plans for a common charging cable. The EU has provisionally agreed all new portable electronic devices must, by autumn 2024, use a USB Type-C charger, a move it says will benefit consumers. Critics say it will stifle innovation. Under the current post-Brexit arrangements, the regulation would apply to Northern Ireland, according to EU and UK officials. According to thea December 2021 parliamentary report,external, the ""new requirements may also apply to devices sold in Northern Ireland under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit agreement, potentially triggering divergence of product standards with the rest of the UK"". The treaty works by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, while the rest of the UK is outside it. A row between the UK and EU about how to reform the Northern Ireland protocol remains unresolved. A UK government spokesperson said ""we are not currently considering replicating this requirement"". Apple products such as iPhones and iPads will have to conform to the new regulation, as will, eventually laptop computers. Existing devices will be exempt. The agreement will be brought before the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers after their summer recesses, where it can be formally approved and then published. Apple told the BBC it had no new comment to make. It argued against the proposal, when it was first introduced, in September 2021,with a representative telling BBC News:""Strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world"". Apple is the biggest manufacturer to use a custom charging port that is exclusive to some of its products - its iPhone series uses an Apple-made Lightning connector. The new rule will cover a range of ""small and medium-sized portable electronics"", according the EU, including: mobile phones tablets headphones and headsets handheld videogame consoles portable speakers Any of these charged using a wired cable will have to have a USB Type-C port, regardless of who makes the devices. Laptops will also have to abide by the ruling but manufacturers will have 40 months after it comes into effect to make changes. The agreement also includes a plan to let customers choose whether or not they want a charging cable with their new electronics. ""This law is a part of a broader EU effort to make products in the EU more sustainable, to reduce electronic waste, and make consumers' lives easier,""the EU said in its announcement,external. It would save consumers ""up to â¬250m [Â£213m] a year on unnecessary charger purchases"" and cut 11,000 tonnes of waste per year, the EU added.

Protester sentenced over BBC reporter pursuitNewsnight political editor Nicholas Watt was targeted during an anti-lockdown protest last summer.,"Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt reporting from close to where he was abused An anti-lockdown protester has been sentenced after a BBC journalist was chased and called a traitor near Downing Street. Joseph Olswang, 39, was part of a group of people who shouted abuse at Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt on 14 June 2021. Olswang was given a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard he has bipolar disorder and was in the midst of a manic episode at the time. At a previous hearing Olswang, of Richmond-upon-Thames, pleaded guilty to using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment toMr Watt. He was found guilty of the same offence against PC Agnes Matvejeva. He had shouted at the Metropolitan Police officer for 35 minutes and called her a ""Brownshirt Nazi"" and ""evil scum"". Joseph Olswang was also ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work Olswang had been part of a group demonstrating against the government's extension of coronavirus restrictions in England by four weeks. Footage shared on social media showed demonstrators shouting abuse in the face of Mr Watt, who was wearing a BBC lanyard, as he tried to walk down the street behind a line of police officers. In mitigation, Olswang's barrister Eleanor De outlined his health issues, adding that the pandemic had ""created a perfect storm for a mental health crisis"". Police and demonstrators faced each other outside Downing Street District Judge Daniel Sternberg described what happened as ""disgraceful"". He told Olswang: ""You were part of a group of individuals who styled themselves as protesters but were doing very little more than harassing journalists and police officers - who were going about their business - and making their lives very unpleasant indeed."" Olswang was banned from Whitehall and Parliament Square for 18 months and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and undertake 20 days of rehabilitation. He was also told to pay Â£1,748 in compensation and costs. Five others who are accused of the same public order offence are due to stand trial later this month.

One dead and others hurt as car hits Berlin crowd,"The car crashed into a store A teacher was killed and 14 schoolchildren were injured after a car hit a crowd on a busy street in the German capital, Berlin. The group was on a school trip to Berlin from the state of Hesse. A second teacher was seriously hurt. Police say the driver, a 29-year-old man, was arrested at the scene. Berlin Interior Affairs Minister Iris Spranger said evidence suggested the driver was a ""mentally ill person running amok"". The incident occurred shortly before 10:30 (08:30 GMT) in the heart of western Berlin, on one of its busiest shopping streets. The woman who died has been identified as a schoolteacher who was on a trip with a class of teenagers from the central state of Hesse. Berlin police say she died on the spot. ""There are seriously injured people among the more than a dozen injured,"" police spokesperson Thilo Cablitz said. Bad Arolsen Mayor Marko Lambion said a bus was on its way to pick up the children from Berlin. ""We're doing everything we can to bring them home,"" he said at the press conference. The driver has dual German and Armenian citizenship and lives in Berlin. Earlier reports that he had left a note in his car were denied by officials.

Army on standby to fill Commonwealth Games jobsFive thousand short-term jobs still need to be filled ahead of the games in Birmingham.Birmingham & Black Country,"The Games will take place at venues across the West Midlands Five thousand short-term jobs still need to be filled ahead of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, with the Army on standby to help out. There are 50 days before the start of the event, which runs from 28 July to 8 August across the city and wider West Midlands. Chief Executive Ian Reid said they had spoken to the military to take steps if necessary. Leaflets have been put through doors as part of a recruitment drive. Organisers say they want to give people opportunities to get skills that will help in finding work after the Games. Jobs in security, catering and cleaning still need to be filled. The games start in 50 days as shown by the countdown clock in Centenary Square The volunteer outfits, designed by students from across Birmingham, were unveiled recently Mr Reid said: ""Up to 5,000 roles are still to be put in place. We're seeing a huge uptick of the back off the marketing campaign but there is still a lot of recruitment to be done over the next few weeks."" Speaking from the Sandwell Aquatics Centre earlier, he said they had a plan A and B in place, the latter being bringing in the Army, and they were monitoring the situation closely. In 2012, up to 13,500military personnel helped to provide security at the London Olympic Games. So far the preparations for the Games have gone smoothly. The major venues - the Alexander stadium in Birmingham and the Sandwell Aquatic centre - are finished but, like many large employers at the moment, they are facing recruitment problems. Chief Executive of the Organising Committee Ian Reid said lessons had been learned from London 2012, when the Army had to help at venues because of shortages of security staff. Mr Reid said that unlike London they were working with a number of different security providers, instead of a single organisation, to spread the risk. Chief executive Ian Reid, visiting Sandwell Aquatic Centre, said the situation is being monitored closely Richard Smith, from the Department of Work and Pensions, who was at a jobs fair at Villa Park, said people were still needed to fill roles in security, hospitality, stewardship and cleaning, which, he added, were also needed in the ""wider economy"" beyond this summer's  international sports event. Thomas Phipps, assistant branch manager at Verve People Birmingham, which is aiding recruitment, said the operation was ""huge"" for his agency. ""The demand is going to be there because thousands of people are going to be coming into Birmingham to watch the [Games]."" Posts range from three weeks to three months and people can fill in an expression of interest form online. Tom Overton said he wanted to help local people increase their skills Tom Overton, resourcing team leader for the summer jobs campaign at Birmingham 2022, said he wanted to use the opportunities to ""upskill"" local people who may not have formal qualifications but wanted to get into work.

Under-fire Johnson vows to get on with the job,"This video can not be played Labour MP Angela Eagle tells the PM he is ""loathed"" even within his own party Boris Johnson has said he is determined to ""get on"" with his job, in his first Commons appearance since surviving a confidence vote in his leadership. Amid testy exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Labour MP Dame Angela Eagle told Mr Johnson he was loathed and should resign. But the prime minister said his political career had ""barely begun"". Four in 10 Tory MPs declared a lack of confidence in Mr Johnson's leadership in Monday's vote. The worse-than-expected result followed several months of difficulties for the prime minister, who has received ongoing criticism over parties that took place in Downing Street during lockdown. PM under pressure to cut tax after confidence vote What is Boris Johnson's track record as PM? How safe is Boris Johnson's job now? Following the vote, the prime minister promised to ""draw a line"" under his recent difficulties and announce a widespread programme of reforms to help deal with crime, the NHS and the rapidly rising cost of living. His ministers have stood by him, but in the first departure from government since the vote, Baroness Helena Morrissey left her job at the Foreign Office on Wednesday. In an interview with LBC radio, Baroness Morrissey said some Tory MPs considered the prime minister ""a liability"" and she had not seen ""any contrition"" from him after the confidence vote. The BBC understands Foreign Secretary Liz Truss found Baroness Morrissey's comments ""outrageous"" and the peer ""jumped before she was pushed"". Meanwhile, at a noisy Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson reiterated his commitment to remain in power. Asking the first question, Dame Angela said: ""This week's events have demonstrated just how loathed this prime minister is, and that's only in his own party. ""As his administration is too distracted by its internal divisions to deal with the challenges we face, can the prime minister explain if 148 of his own backbenchers don't trust him why on earth should the country?"" Mr Johnson replied: ""I can assure her in a long political career so far - barely begun - I've of course picked up political opponents all over and that is because this government has done some very big and very remarkable things which they didn't necessarily approve of. ""And what I want her to know is that absolutely nothing and no-one, least of all her, is going to stop us with getting on delivering for the British people."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer focused his questions on the government's record on the NHS, while the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called Mr Johnson, who was fined in April for attending an illegal Downing Street gathering during lockdown, a ""dead man walking"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson clash on the government's handling of the NHS He accused the prime minister of ""failing to recognise that these parties were against the law, it's that signal that the rules don't apply to him the way that they do for everyone else"". ""That's not the behaviour of someone who can remain in office, its someone that quite simply needs to be removed from office,"" Mr Blackford added. The prime minister's victory in the confidence vote means that, under Conservative Party rules, he cannot face another such test of his leadership for another year. But Mr Johnson is coming under pressure from some of his own MPs to cut taxes in an effort to boost the economy and help ease the burden on households caused by the rapidly rising cost of living. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, Health Secretary Sajid Javid and trade minister Penny Mordaunt all said they would like this to happen. But the prime minister's spokesperson played down the immediate prospect of this happening, saying it was important to be ""responsible"" at a time when finances were in ""very difficult position following the global pandemic"". They added that plans for further tax cuts would be set out ""as soon as it is fiscally responsible to do so"". There were no unfriendly questions from Tory MPs about his future to the PM in the chamber, but in a column in the Times newspaper, Conservative former cabinet minister David Davis accused Mr Johnson of ""letting things slide"" and warned him to ""get his act together"" quickly or leave office.

Barrowman told the BBC the car had careened through tables of people sitting outside having breakfast, before smashing into the storefront. ""It was just horrific"", he said. ""I saw somebody being resuscitated, I saw somebody being literally thrown onto a stretcher and put into an ambulance."" Some 130 emergency workers went to the scene and a body lay in the middle of the road, covered in blankets. It happened opposite Breitscheidplatz, where 12 people were killed in a terrorist attack in 2016 when a truck was deliberately driven into a crowd of people at a Christmas market. Berlin Mayor Franziska Giffey said it was too early to know if the area had been chosen deliberately, but she said: ""It's a situation where you think, for God's sake, not again!"" After the Christmas market attack in 2016, the militant group Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the killings which had been carried out by an unsuccessful asylum seeker. He was later shot dead by police in Italy.

A&E patients warned of 13-hour wait,"This video can not be played Princess Alexandra Hospital A&E nurse filmed issuing doctor wait warning Patients being told they may have to wait for up to 13 hours to be seen in an emergency department is ""not what anyone wants to see"", Sajid Javid said. The health secretary was reacting to footage showing anurse addressing patients at Princess Alexandra Hospital, in Harlow, Essex, on Monday. Patients were told the wait time was seven-and-a-half hours, with warnings some may not be seen for much longer. The hospital said there was ""extremely high demand"" on the department. The footage was posted on Twitter and Mr Javid listened to the clip onBBC Breakfast. ""Because of the impact of Covid... we know already from our NHS estimates, we think some 11 to 13 million people stayed away from the NHS because of the pandemic,"" he said. ""Many of those people are coming forward, many of those to A&E, and we're seeing very high levels of demand. ""That is a real challenge for the NHS across the system."" This video can not be played A&E waits not what anyone wants to see - Sajid Javid Tony Durcan, the Royal College of Nursing's senior officer for Essex, said the union's members were ""nursing under unsustainable pressure"". ""The government is risking lives by failing to take urgent action,"" he said. ""Nursing staff are being driven out of a job they once loved. They are tired, fed up, demoralised, and they feel undervalued for the complex and skilled work that they perform day in, day out."" Mr Javid said the government was investing ""record amounts"" in the NHS, including funding for ambulance trusts, the 111 on-call and online information service, and accident and emergency facilities across the country. ""So I think the NHS is doing everything it possibly can be doing,"" he said. ""The waiting times are improving, but it's not what anyone wants to see, those kind of waits."" NHS leadership changes after review finds bullying New hospital may not be built until 2028 Hospital to spend Â£1m on maternity staff Conservative MP for Harlow, Robert Halfon, who was due to meet the health secretary, said: ""The first thing I have to say is that the staff there are second to none - everyone tries to provide Harlow residents with a service that's wonderful. ""There are a number of issues here. First of all, even before Covid, we had amongst the highest accident and emergency use in England per head. ""We also have problems with the space in the hospital, which is why we are getting a new hospital. ""Nevertheless it's upsetting to see the video online."" He said there were also ""very complex issues"", including people struggling to get GP appointments and the backlog caused by the Covid pandemic. Princess Alexandra Hospital patients were told on Monday some may not be seen for 13 hours In November the Care Quality Commission published a report that rated the Princess Alexandra Hospital as ""requires improvement"" overall, with thehospital's emergency department rated ""inadequate"". The CQC report said inspectors had to intervene after seeing two deteriorating patients waiting in a corridor. Stephanie Lawton, chief operating officer at the NHS Trust, said it had seen a ""significant increase in attendances in our emergency department"". ""Our teams are working hard to assess and treat patients as quickly and effectively as possible to reduce delays, prioritising those in most clinical need,"" she said. She urged members of the public to ease pressures by using the NHS 111 service for healthcare advice in non-urgent cases. It's unusual to see videos like this with NHS staff being so candid about the pressures. But what's being described here is far from unique. Â Over recent months, a quarter of patients have been waiting more than four hours to be seen in A&E in England. The situation is even worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Â And even when they are seen, those who need to be admitted on to a ward for further treatment can face many hours in bays and corridors before a bed can be found. Â Waits have been worsening for the best part of a decade - and Covid has exacerbated the situation.Â People stayed away from the NHS during the first part of the pandemic and it means those seeking help now are more sick and have more complex conditions.Â The NHS is also struggling to free up beds to get new patients in. That's because of a lack of care in the community for those patients who are medically fit to leave hospital but need support in place to return home. Some are kept in for weeks before they can be discharged.Â On top of this, the NHS is short of staff. One in 12 posts is unfilled. The problems are creating bottlenecks throughout the system.Â DuringPrime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the prime minister a ""failure to fix wanting and inadequate NHS buildings"" was ""putting patients at risk"". ""He [Boris Johnson] scrapped zero tolerance of 12-hour waits at A&E. 24 Hours in A&E used to be a TV programme, now it's policy,"" he added. Mr Johnson dismissed Sir Keir's comments and said his government were ""building 48 new hospitals thanks to the biggest capital investment programme in the NHS"".

UK wonât copy EU common charger,"A USB Type-C charger (right) beside Apple's proprietary Lightning cable The UK government says it is not ""currently considering"" copying European Union plans for a common charging cable. The EU has provisionally agreed all new portable electronic devices must, by autumn 2024, use a USB Type-C charger, a move it says will benefit consumers. Critics say it will stifle innovation. Under the current post-Brexit arrangements, the regulation would apply to Northern Ireland, according to EU and UK officials. According to thea December 2021 parliamentary report,external, the ""new requirements may also apply to devices sold in Northern Ireland under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit agreement, potentially triggering divergence of product standards with the rest of the UK"". The treaty works by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, while the rest of the UK is outside it. A row between the UK and EU about how to reform the Northern Ireland protocol remains unresolved. A UK government spokesperson said ""we are not currently considering replicating this requirement"". Apple products such as iPhones and iPads will have to conform to the new regulation, as will, eventually laptop computers. Existing devices will be exempt. The agreement will be brought before the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers after their summer recesses, where it can be formally approved and then published. Apple told the BBC it had no new comment to make. It argued against the proposal, when it was first introduced, in September 2021,with a representative telling BBC News:""Strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world"". Apple is the biggest manufacturer to use a custom charging port that is exclusive to some of its products - its iPhone series uses an Apple-made Lightning connector. The new rule will cover a range of ""small and medium-sized portable electronics"", according the EU, including: mobile phones tablets headphones and headsets handheld videogame consoles portable speakers Any of these charged using a wired cable will have to have a USB Type-C port, regardless of who makes the devices. Laptops will also have to abide by the ruling but manufacturers will have 40 months after it comes into effect to make changes. The agreement also includes a plan to let customers choose whether or not they want a charging cable with their new electronics. ""This law is a part of a broader EU effort to make products in the EU more sustainable, to reduce electronic waste, and make consumers' lives easier,""the EU said in its announcement,external. It would save consumers ""up to â¬250m [Â£213m] a year on unnecessary charger purchases"" and cut 11,000 tonnes of waste per year, the EU added.

"Army plan as 5,000 Commonwealth Games jobs to fill","The Games will take place at venues across the West Midlands Five thousand short-term jobs still need to be filled ahead of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, with the Army on standby to help out. There are 50 days before the start of the event, which runs from 28 July to 8 August across the city and wider West Midlands. Chief Executive Ian Reid said they had spoken to the military to take steps if necessary. Leaflets have been put through doors as part of a recruitment drive. Organisers say they want to give people opportunities to get skills that will help in finding work after the Games. Jobs in security, catering and cleaning still need to be filled. The games start in 50 days as shown by the countdown clock in Centenary Square The volunteer outfits, designed by students from across Birmingham, were unveiled recently Mr Reid said: ""Up to 5,000 roles are still to be put in place. We're seeing a huge uptick of the back off the marketing campaign but there is still a lot of recruitment to be done over the next few weeks."" Speaking from the Sandwell Aquatics Centre earlier, he said they had a plan A and B in place, the latter being bringing in the Army, and they were monitoring the situation closely. In 2012, up to 13,500military personnel helped to provide security at the London Olympic Games. So far the preparations for the Games have gone smoothly. The major venues - the Alexander stadium in Birmingham and the Sandwell Aquatic centre - are finished but, like many large employers at the moment, they are facing recruitment problems. Chief Executive of the Organising Committee Ian Reid said lessons had been learned from London 2012, when the Army had to help at venues because of shortages of security staff. Mr Reid said that unlike London they were working with a number of different security providers, instead of a single organisation, to spread the risk. Chief executive Ian Reid, visiting Sandwell Aquatic Centre, said the situation is being monitored closely Richard Smith, from the Department of Work and Pensions, who was at a jobs fair at Villa Park, said people were still needed to fill roles in security, hospitality, stewardship and cleaning, which, he added, were also needed in the ""wider economy"" beyond this summer's  international sports event. Thomas Phipps, assistant branch manager at Verve People Birmingham, which is aiding recruitment, said the operation was ""huge"" for his agency. ""The demand is going to be there because thousands of people are going to be coming into Birmingham to watch the [Games]."" Posts range from three weeks to three months and people can fill in an expression of interest form online. Tom Overton said he wanted to help local people increase their skills Tom Overton, resourcing team leader for the summer jobs campaign at Birmingham 2022, said he wanted to use the opportunities to ""upskill"" local people who may not have formal qualifications but wanted to get into work.

"Housing market shows signs of cooling, says Halifax","The housing market is showing signs of cooling, Halifax has said, as households face a squeeze on their finances. The mortgage lender said that while house prices continued to climb in May, with prices up 10.5% in 12 months, this was slowest rate of growth since the start of the year. The rise meant the average price of a house hit another record of Â£289,099. Halifax said that house prices have now climbed for eleven consecutive months. ""Despite the very real cost of living pressures some people are experiencing, the imbalance between supply and demand for properties remains the primary reason driving the continued climb in house prices,"" said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax. ""However, the housing market has begun to show signs of cooling. Mortgage activity has started to come down and, coupled with the inflationary pressures currently exerted on household budgets, it's likely activity will start to slow,"" he added. House prices facing sharp slowdown, says Halifax UK house prices rose fastest for 17 years in 2021 Why are prices rising so quickly? ""So, there is perhaps one green shoot for prospective purchasers; with overall buying demand down compared to last year, we may be past the peak sellers' market."" Estate agents said the survey from Halifax confirms what they are seeing on the ground. ""The cost of living crisis and successive interest rate rises are finally having an impact on the housing market,"" said Jeremy Leaf, a North London estate agency owner and a former Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) residential chairman. ""Prices are still rising but not as rapidly as they were just a few months ago and activity is cooling."" However, Mr Leaf said a major correction seemed ""unlikely"" while housing stock remained low, particularly for in-demand properties such as three- and four-bedroom family homes. According to Halifax, house prices increased by 1% month-on-month in May. It added that they had shot up by some 74% over the last 10 years. The strongest inflation in that period has been in London (84.2%), followed by the East of England (84%) and the East Midlands (82.1%). Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said the latest figures were ""cold comfort"" to people trying to get onto the property ladder. ""Cooling, definitely but the housing market is unlikely to come off the boil, at least for the foreseeable future especially as it's becoming harder and more expensive to find places to rent."" She added that the ""age old problem"" of demand outstripping supply wouldn't go away without a period of ""unprecedented housebuilding"". ""And with money so tight at the moment, anyone who might have been thinking of hoisting the for-sale sign will probably hold off until inflation returns to something resembling normal,"" she added. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 9% in April,a 40-year-high, . The Bank of England has warned inflation might reach 10% within months, as the prices of fuel and food put pressure on household budgets.

"Under-fire Johnson vows to get on with the jobAmid rowdy Commons scenes, Labour MP Dame Angela Eagle says the prime minister is a loathed figure.UK Politics","This video can not be played Labour MP Angela Eagle tells the PM he is ""loathed"" even within his own party Boris Johnson has said he is determined to ""get on"" with his job, in his first Commons appearance since surviving a confidence vote in his leadership. Amid testy exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Labour MP Dame Angela Eagle told Mr Johnson he was loathed and should resign. But the prime minister said his political career had ""barely begun"". Four in 10 Tory MPs declared a lack of confidence in Mr Johnson's leadership in Monday's vote. The worse-than-expected result followed several months of difficulties for the prime minister, who has received ongoing criticism over parties that took place in Downing Street during lockdown. PM under pressure to cut tax after confidence vote What is Boris Johnson's track record as PM? How safe is Boris Johnson's job now? Following the vote, the prime minister promised to ""draw a line"" under his recent difficulties and announce a widespread programme of reforms to help deal with crime, the NHS and the rapidly rising cost of living. His ministers have stood by him, but in the first departure from government since the vote, Baroness Helena Morrissey left her job at the Foreign Office on Wednesday. In an interview with LBC radio, Baroness Morrissey said some Tory MPs considered the prime minister ""a liability"" and she had not seen ""any contrition"" from him after the confidence vote. The BBC understands Foreign Secretary Liz Truss found Baroness Morrissey's comments ""outrageous"" and the peer ""jumped before she was pushed"". Meanwhile, at a noisy Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson reiterated his commitment to remain in power. Asking the first question, Dame Angela said: ""This week's events have demonstrated just how loathed this prime minister is, and that's only in his own party. ""As his administration is too distracted by its internal divisions to deal with the challenges we face, can the prime minister explain if 148 of his own backbenchers don't trust him why on earth should the country?"" Mr Johnson replied: ""I can assure her in a long political career so far - barely begun - I've of course picked up political opponents all over and that is because this government has done some very big and very remarkable things which they didn't necessarily approve of. ""And what I want her to know is that absolutely nothing and no-one, least of all her, is going to stop us with getting on delivering for the British people."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer focused his questions on the government's record on the NHS, while the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called Mr Johnson, who was fined in April for attending an illegal Downing Street gathering during lockdown, a ""dead man walking"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson clash on the government's handling of the NHS He accused the prime minister of ""failing to recognise that these parties were against the law, it's that signal that the rules don't apply to him the way that they do for everyone else"". ""That's not the behaviour of someone who can remain in office, its someone that quite simply needs to be removed from office,"" Mr Blackford added. The prime minister's victory in the confidence vote means that, under Conservative Party rules, he cannot face another such test of his leadership for another year. But Mr Johnson is coming under pressure from some of his own MPs to cut taxes in an effort to boost the economy and help ease the burden on households caused by the rapidly rising cost of living. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, Health Secretary Sajid Javid and trade minister Penny Mordaunt all said they would like this to happen. But the prime minister's spokesperson played down the immediate prospect of this happening, saying it was important to be ""responsible"" at a time when finances were in ""very difficult position following the global pandemic"". They added that plans for further tax cuts would be set out ""as soon as it is fiscally responsible to do so"". There were no unfriendly questions from Tory MPs about his future to the PM in the chamber, but in a column in the Times newspaper, Conservative former cabinet minister David Davis accused Mr Johnson of ""letting things slide"" and warned him to ""get his act together"" quickly or leave office.

'Giant gene' bond forged between US and Mid Ulster,"This video can not be played American woman discovers Irish giant gene ancestry When Colleen Snyder researched her family history during the Covid-19 pandemic, she did not expect to discover a connection to the legend of Irish giants. Colleen, from Virginia in the United States, suffers from a rare genetic condition called acromegaly or gigantism. The gene caused Charles Byrne, born in 1761 near Cookstown and known as the ""Irish giant"", to grow more than 7ft 6in (2.3m) tall. Medical researchershave previously identified Mid Ulster as a ""hotspot""where one in 150 people have the genetic mutation, compared to one in 1,000 in Belfast and one in 2,000 in the rest of the UK. Colleen first developed symptoms when she was eight, but the condition was not diagnosed until she was 20. Doctors in the USA told her it was rare to develop acromegaly at such a young age. ""They would say we don't know anybody who had it so early so I knew that that was very, very unusual,"" Colleen explained. ""Through the years I kept trying to find somebody that had the same condition, get more information about it and I couldn't."" That was until she began to research her family history during the lockdown. ""I've always known that I've had Irish heritage and my given name is Mary Colleen which is quite an American-Irish name,"" she said. Her great-great grandfather John McGurk emigrated with his three siblings in 1861. She thought the McGurks came from County Cork, where most ships departed for the transatlantic crossing to a new life in America. When she looked at her family tree she realised her ancestral home was in fact Clonoe, near Coalisland in County Tyrone, the centre of the giant gene ""hotspot"". Brendan Holland (centre) and Colleen Snyder (second from right) meeting with a group including Prof Marta Korbonits and Prof Michael Besser Colleen contacted Marta Korbonits, professor of endocrinology at Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, who discovered the genetic link for the Irish giant gene. She sent the results of a DNA test to Professor Korbonits, who confirmed she had the same mutation. Living carriers of the gene share a common ancestor who lived about 2,500 years ago. What is the 'giant gene'? A gene called AIP can result in a non-cancerous tumour in the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland just below the brain. It can lead to too much growth hormone being produced and released Only 20% of carriers of the defective gene will develop symptoms. These include people growing abnormally tall, hormonal problems and infertility. In many cases it is disfiguring but it can also be life-threatening. The condition, called acromegaly or gigantism, can be successfully treated with brain surgery and medication. Prof Korbonits put Colleen in touch with Brendan Holland from Dungannon, County Tyrone, who is 6ft 9in (2.1m) and a distant relative of Charles Byrne. Within minutes, Brendan and Colleen were talking on the phone, a moment Colleen described as ""very emotional"". ""I had been looking for 45 years for someone,"" said Colleen, ""and here's this Irish accent on the phone"". ""And all of a sudden I was talking to someone who can understand what it was like to have a pituitary tumour that causes you to have the excess growth and have all the kinds of physical problems that I had."" Colleen Snyder and her sister Cherie have been looking for the McGurk family graves at St Michaelâs parish cemetery in Clonoe near Coalisland For Brendan, speaking to Colleen was confirmation of his belief that the gene had been carried overseas by the many thousands of people who emigrated from County Tyrone. ""[Colleen] is actually a product of that immigration in 1861,"" said Brendan, ""and it just reinforced my conviction that this has to be more common than perhaps we realise."" ""It was more than just finding somebody with the same condition, it was making a connection with someone who is fascinated by the whole story, has a shared interest in the history of it,"" he added. Colleen recently made the trip to County Tyrone to meet Brendan in person and to visit the townland which the McGurks left for America more than 160 years ago. Scientists testing for 'giant gene' After more than a year of zoom calls on a computer, Colleen said the visit had revealed a ""rich world"" of giant folklore. Colleen also accompanied Brendan to London to meet Prof Korbonits and others who are involved in treating and researching the condition. For Brendan and Colleen, their shared experience is part of a mission to educate people about the importance of knowing if you have the gene so that they can be tested and treated to avoid the devastating effects which they experienced of having a tumour. ""For me, to find out that I'm the first person in the United States that they found with this, that's pretty cool, I feel great,"" said Colleen. ""It's wonderful, but wait a minute there's got to be other people."" They now plan to co-write a book to raise awareness amongst the Irish diaspora.

Disability summit challenges for change,"Former United States Senator Tom Harkin and organiser SeÃ¡n Fitzsimons An organiser of a major conference aimed at getting more disabled people into work has said employers in Northern Ireland need to ""understand the depth of talent"" in the community. SeÃ¡n Fitzsimons, who has muscular dystrophy, is one of the people behind the two-day Harkin Summit in Belfast. The conference hopes to close the disability employment gap in Northern Ireland and internationally. ""It's about challenging for change,"" Mr Fitzsimons said. Speaking to BBC News NI's Evening Extra programme, he said: ""I am very, very proud to be from the disabled community. ""I see all around me talented people that want to get into jobs, that are in jobs and want to advance, and people who are unfortunately experiencing difficulties in holding on to their jobs"". Mr Fitzsimons is a lifelong disability campaigner and currently works in the civil service. He said people with disabilities often faced barriers when looking for work and while in employment. ""There might be attitudinal barriers in relation to cultural ideas as to what disabled people are capable of and what they're not capable of,"" he said. ""There might be attitudes within the workplace where it is perceived because people have reasonable adjustment that they're doing less or that they're being treated more favourably"". He said the conference, which is now in its second day at the International Convention Centre at the Waterfront Hall, is about ""building the community and policy around employment"".

Over the two days, the event will bring together leaders and activists from across the world, as well as Northern Ireland. The first day, on Tuesday, saw 630 in attendance from 30 countries. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said creating employment for people with a disability was a ""crucial issue"". ""Hosting this summit, bringing together local and international leaders to build awareness, share best practice and challenge for change will ultimately help more people with disabilities and health conditions secure employment and meet their career aspirations,"" she said. The minister said ""initiatives will flow from the conference"", which is sponsored by the Department for Communities. These include 300 employment opportunities for young disabled people and 100 mentoring sessions between individuals and senior international leaders. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey spoke at the summit on Tuesday The international summit was started by retired United States Senator Tom Harkin after seeing the issues experienced by his brother Frank, who is deaf. He said: ""We have a lot to overcome and the best thing is to bring it out in the open and talk to people with disabilities, find out what they want and have an open dialogue and conversation. ""There's a lot of energy in the disability community that has been growing for a long time. ""An energy to do things different, to make sure their voices are heard and acted on"".

"Housing market shows signs of cooling, says HalifaxThe mortgage lender says buying demand has come down compared to last year.","The housing market is showing signs of cooling, Halifax has said, as households face a squeeze on their finances. The mortgage lender said that while house prices continued to climb in May, with prices up 10.5% in 12 months, this was slowest rate of growth since the start of the year. The rise meant the average price of a house hit another record of Â£289,099. Halifax said that house prices have now climbed for eleven consecutive months. ""Despite the very real cost of living pressures some people are experiencing, the imbalance between supply and demand for properties remains the primary reason driving the continued climb in house prices,"" said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax. ""However, the housing market has begun to show signs of cooling. Mortgage activity has started to come down and, coupled with the inflationary pressures currently exerted on household budgets, it's likely activity will start to slow,"" he added. House prices facing sharp slowdown, says Halifax UK house prices rose fastest for 17 years in 2021 Why are prices rising so quickly? ""So, there is perhaps one green shoot for prospective purchasers; with overall buying demand down compared to last year, we may be past the peak sellers' market."" Estate agents said the survey from Halifax confirms what they are seeing on the ground. ""The cost of living crisis and successive interest rate rises are finally having an impact on the housing market,"" said Jeremy Leaf, a North London estate agency owner and a former Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) residential chairman. ""Prices are still rising but not as rapidly as they were just a few months ago and activity is cooling."" However, Mr Leaf said a major correction seemed ""unlikely"" while housing stock remained low, particularly for in-demand properties such as three- and four-bedroom family homes. According to Halifax, house prices increased by 1% month-on-month in May. It added that they had shot up by some 74% over the last 10 years. The strongest inflation in that period has been in London (84.2%), followed by the East of England (84%) and the East Midlands (82.1%). Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said the latest figures were ""cold comfort"" to people trying to get onto the property ladder. ""Cooling, definitely but the housing market is unlikely to come off the boil, at least for the foreseeable future especially as it's becoming harder and more expensive to find places to rent."" She added that the ""age old problem"" of demand outstripping supply wouldn't go away without a period of ""unprecedented housebuilding"". ""And with money so tight at the moment, anyone who might have been thinking of hoisting the for-sale sign will probably hold off until inflation returns to something resembling normal,"" she added. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 9% in April,a 40-year-high, . The Bank of England has warned inflation might reach 10% within months, as the prices of fuel and food put pressure on household budgets.

"A&E patients warned of 13-hour waitThe health secretary says the video of a nurse speaking to patients is ""not what anyone wants to see"".","This video can not be played Princess Alexandra Hospital A&E nurse filmed issuing doctor wait warning Patients being told they may have to wait for up to 13 hours to be seen in an emergency department is ""not what anyone wants to see"", Sajid Javid said. The health secretary was reacting to footage showing anurse addressing patients at Princess Alexandra Hospital, in Harlow, Essex, on Monday. Patients were told the wait time was seven-and-a-half hours, with warnings some may not be seen for much longer. The hospital said there was ""extremely high demand"" on the department. The footage was posted on Twitter and Mr Javid listened to the clip onBBC Breakfast. ""Because of the impact of Covid... we know already from our NHS estimates, we think some 11 to 13 million people stayed away from the NHS because of the pandemic,"" he said. ""Many of those people are coming forward, many of those to A&E, and we're seeing very high levels of demand. ""That is a real challenge for the NHS across the system."" This video can not be played A&E waits not what anyone wants to see - Sajid Javid Tony Durcan, the Royal College of Nursing's senior officer for Essex, said the union's members were ""nursing under unsustainable pressure"". ""The government is risking lives by failing to take urgent action,"" he said. ""Nursing staff are being driven out of a job they once loved. They are tired, fed up, demoralised, and they feel undervalued for the complex and skilled work that they perform day in, day out."" Mr Javid said the government was investing ""record amounts"" in the NHS, including funding for ambulance trusts, the 111 on-call and online information service, and accident and emergency facilities across the country. ""So I think the NHS is doing everything it possibly can be doing,"" he said. ""The waiting times are improving, but it's not what anyone wants to see, those kind of waits."" NHS leadership changes after review finds bullying New hospital may not be built until 2028 Hospital to spend Â£1m on maternity staff Conservative MP for Harlow, Robert Halfon, who was due to meet the health secretary, said: ""The first thing I have to say is that the staff there are second to none - everyone tries to provide Harlow residents with a service that's wonderful. ""There are a number of issues here. First of all, even before Covid, we had amongst the highest accident and emergency use in England per head. ""We also have problems with the space in the hospital, which is why we are getting a new hospital. ""Nevertheless it's upsetting to see the video online."" He said there were also ""very complex issues"", including people struggling to get GP appointments and the backlog caused by the Covid pandemic. Princess Alexandra Hospital patients were told on Monday some may not be seen for 13 hours In November the Care Quality Commission published a report that rated the Princess Alexandra Hospital as ""requires improvement"" overall, with thehospital's emergency department rated ""inadequate"". The CQC report said inspectors had to intervene after seeing two deteriorating patients waiting in a corridor. Stephanie Lawton, chief operating officer at the NHS Trust, said it had seen a ""significant increase in attendances in our emergency department"". ""Our teams are working hard to assess and treat patients as quickly and effectively as possible to reduce delays, prioritising those in most clinical need,"" she said. She urged members of the public to ease pressures by using the NHS 111 service for healthcare advice in non-urgent cases. It's unusual to see videos like this with NHS staff being so candid about the pressures. But what's being described here is far from unique. Â Over recent months, a quarter of patients have been waiting more than four hours to be seen in A&E in England. The situation is even worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Â And even when they are seen, those who need to be admitted on to a ward for further treatment can face many hours in bays and corridors before a bed can be found. Â Waits have been worsening for the best part of a decade - and Covid has exacerbated the situation.Â People stayed away from the NHS during the first part of the pandemic and it means those seeking help now are more sick and have more complex conditions.Â The NHS is also struggling to free up beds to get new patients in. That's because of a lack of care in the community for those patients who are medically fit to leave hospital but need support in place to return home. Some are kept in for weeks before they can be discharged.Â On top of this, the NHS is short of staff. One in 12 posts is unfilled. The problems are creating bottlenecks throughout the system.Â DuringPrime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the prime minister a ""failure to fix wanting and inadequate NHS buildings"" was ""putting patients at risk"". ""He [Boris Johnson] scrapped zero tolerance of 12-hour waits at A&E. 24 Hours in A&E used to be a TV programme, now it's policy,"" he added. Mr Johnson dismissed Sir Keir's comments and said his government were ""building 48 new hospitals thanks to the biggest capital investment programme in the NHS"".

Unions branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikes,"Unions have been branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikes which threaten major disruption to passengers. The RMT Union said it will shut down the country's railway network on 21, 23 and 25 June after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. Downing Street warned the plans would inflict pain on passengers and cause disruption and said it was determined to make railways more efficient. But RMT hit back saying the government itself was being selfish. Both train operators and the union have said they want more talks to avoid the strikes. If industrial action goes ahead, more than 40,000 staff from Network Rail and 13 train operators are expected to take part in what is dubbed the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"". On the first day of the planned strike on 21 June, London Underground RMT workers plan to walk out in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses. On Wednesday, Unite members who work at Transport for London and London Underground announced they will join their RMT member colleagues in walking out on 21 June. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Strike dubbed the biggest in modern history The strikes fall during music and sporting events including the Glastonbury Festival and an England cricket Test match against New Zealand, and are expected to affect thousands of passengers. The action will leave around a fifth of mainline rail services running on the strike days, but due to each walk out being 24 hours long, disruption is expected to spill over to non-strike days leading to a week of disruption. According to the Department for Transport, the average salary rail worker salary is Â£44,000. This is more than the median pay of other public sector workers, such as nurses (Â£31,000), teachers (Â£37,000), and care workers (Â£17,000). However, RMT said the salary figure was ""unrepresentative"" as it included higher-earning train drivers, who did not take part in the ballot as most are part of a different union. The union claims its members earn Â£33,000 a year on average. The Prime Minister described the planned strike as ""reckless and wanton"" and demanded condemnation of the strike from the Labour Party in Prime Minister's Questions. A No 10 source said the move was ""thoroughly irresponsible"" and warned it would inflict ""pain and economic disruption on their fellow citizens in really tough times"". However, Mick Lynch, secretary general of the RMT union, hit back at the government saying they were ""experts at being selfish and irresponsible"". He told the BBC his members needed a pay deal, job security and ""decent terms and conditions"". ""The government have the key to unlock that,"" he added. Mr Lynch claimed Network Rail had told union reps they were planning to cut 3,000 maintenance jobs out of 11,000, which he said would pose safety risks. But Network Rail insisted no proposals were on the table, talks were under way about modernising maintenance and how compulsory redundancies could be avoided. It rejected claims it would do anything to compromise safety. Graham Purdy, from Cramlington in Northumberland is one of many learning that his plans will be affected if the June strikes go ahead. He and his wife have tickets to see the Eagles at Murrayfield, Edinburgh, on 22 June and to a Barry Manilow concert the following day in Glasgow. The 63-year-old, whose travel plans involve his first overnight stay since the pandemic, said he was against the strike and now faced having to drive and book car parking he may not have to use, but pay for. ""It's annoying and frustrating,"" he said. ""I've worked all my life in the construction industry; If you don't like what they are paying, you get another job, don't withdraw your services."" Alastair Webster says he sides with the rail workers However, Alastair Webster, from Birmingham, said he supported the stance of the rail workers, despite his plans to go on holiday being ""massively"" disrupted by the proposed action. ""There has been under-investment and mismanagement, millions wasted on HS2. People want the railways nationalised,"" he said. ""I'd always side with the people on the coal face. Even if its massively disruptive I support the strikers. With the cost of living crisis and everything else the government needs to constructively engage with them."" Steve Montgomery, of the Rail Delivery Group, said the industry body was ""extremely disappointed"" with the prospect of strike action. ""It's really important we ask RMT to get back round the table,"" he said. He said that the industry had received Â£16bn in subsidies over the pandemic, but that level of funding could not continue. ""We have to look how we can reform,"" he said. Rail firms ""are looking at all options"" to modernise, including job losses, he said. The industry group said rail industry revenue is currently at 82% of 2019 levels, which is the same as a Â£38m shortfall on pre-Covid revenue levels every week. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Covid ""changed travel habits"" - with 25% fewer ticket sales and the taxpayer stepping in to keep the railways running at a cost equivalent to Â£600 per household. People working for 13 train operating companies, whicheach run services in different parts,externalof the country, will take part in the strike. These are: Chiltern Railways Cross Country Trains Greater Anglia LNER East Midlands Railway c2c Great Western Railway Northern Trains South Eastern Railway South Western Railway TransPennine Express Avanti West Coast West Midlands Trains In addition, workers at Network Rail, which maintains the railways throughout Britain, also voted to strike. So the impact of the action would be felt across England, Scotland, and Wales. Read more on how the strikes will affect you here However, Mr Lynch said railway firms ""can easily afford a pay rise for our members, it'll just mean they have to cut back on their profits"". ""They are ripping off the passenger, they are ripping off the taxpayer. The government needs to fund the railway properly, and we need the companies to give up some of their profits to give our members a pay rise,"" he added. But the Rail Delivery Group spokesman said the RMT was ""using inflated figures"" on profits to ""disguise the real issue"". Mr Lynch said the union doesn't want disruption for thousands of commuters, but had been talking to rail firms for two years trying to get pay deals. ""We've got another two weeks before this action starts. There's plenty of time to get proposals forward,"" he added. Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell and the BBC's UGC team.

Why filling up your car could soon cost Â£100,"Motorists will have noticed that the price of petrol and diesel has been creeping up in recent weeks. These rising costs may pile further pressure on families whose budgets are already being squeezed. Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year. Recent data from 13 August puts petrol at an average of 149.1p per litre on UK forecourts. In just two weeks, it has shot up by more than 4p and it marks the highest price seen since February. Diesel stands at an average of 150.6p per litre - a level not seen since late May. Although it now costs about Â£82 to fill up a 55-litre family car, prices have fallen back from the record highs seen last summer, which were sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on road fuel prices, said that this recent surge would, however, ""lump pressure back on diesel users, particularly on small businesses"". Fuel prices in the UK move together with changes in the price of crude oil - which it is made from. They are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as crude oil is traded in dollars. A weaker pound would mean that fuel gets more expensive. Oil prices have risen in recent weeks as producers have tried to restrict output. Oil rich nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that form part of a group called Opec+ have cut back production. They are grappling with slow demand as economies around the world struggle with high prices and the adjustment after the Covid pandemic. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices. As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. What is Opec and what is happening to oil prices? Livia Gallarati, an oil markets analyst at Energy Aspects, said that prices could grind higher still because of supplies being dented. She suggested Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, could even move above $90 (Â£71) per barrel. Supplies have also been affected by recent outages at oil refineries across the United States and Asia. Oil prices jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Brent crude hitting more than $120 a barrel in June 2022. Russia used to be one of the world's largest oil exporters, but that wasbefore punishing sanctions were imposed by the West. After peaking in summer last year, oil prices fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in March this year amid concerns over weak demand. Experts have said that motorists shouldn't expect petrol prices to go up much more unless garages and supermarkets decide to take a bigger cut - or margin - per litre sold. The price of diesel, however, might rise in the autumn and winter because large parts of Europe rely on it for their heating. Retailers said in July that they will to workwith the UK's competition watchdog to set up a scheme to allow motorists to compare live fuel prices online. It came after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that weak competition meant that the average annual supermarket margins on fuel had increased by 6p per litre between 2019 and 2022 - equivalent to Â£900m in extra costs for drivers. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that despite the recent announcement, ""there is still far too much regional variation in prices, particularly among the big four supermarkets, which unfairly penalises drivers in some areas."" He urged drivers to shop around where they can in a bid to save cash. In March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also announced that fuel duty - a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel - would be frozen for another year, having been cut by 5p the year before. It will cost the government more than Â£5bn and think tanks such as theInstitute for Government have suggested,externalit might sit awkwardly with its climate-related pledges.

"Under-fire Johnson vows to get on with the jobAmid rowdy Commons scenes, Labour MP Dame Angela Eagle says the prime minister is a loathed figure.","This video can not be played Labour MP Angela Eagle tells the PM he is ""loathed"" even within his own party Boris Johnson has said he is determined to ""get on"" with his job, in his first Commons appearance since surviving a confidence vote in his leadership. Amid testy exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Labour MP Dame Angela Eagle told Mr Johnson he was loathed and should resign. But the prime minister said his political career had ""barely begun"". Four in 10 Tory MPs declared a lack of confidence in Mr Johnson's leadership in Monday's vote. The worse-than-expected result followed several months of difficulties for the prime minister, who has received ongoing criticism over parties that took place in Downing Street during lockdown. PM under pressure to cut tax after confidence vote What is Boris Johnson's track record as PM? How safe is Boris Johnson's job now? Following the vote, the prime minister promised to ""draw a line"" under his recent difficulties and announce a widespread programme of reforms to help deal with crime, the NHS and the rapidly rising cost of living. His ministers have stood by him, but in the first departure from government since the vote, Baroness Helena Morrissey left her job at the Foreign Office on Wednesday. In an interview with LBC radio, Baroness Morrissey said some Tory MPs considered the prime minister ""a liability"" and she had not seen ""any contrition"" from him after the confidence vote. The BBC understands Foreign Secretary Liz Truss found Baroness Morrissey's comments ""outrageous"" and the peer ""jumped before she was pushed"". Meanwhile, at a noisy Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson reiterated his commitment to remain in power. Asking the first question, Dame Angela said: ""This week's events have demonstrated just how loathed this prime minister is, and that's only in his own party. ""As his administration is too distracted by its internal divisions to deal with the challenges we face, can the prime minister explain if 148 of his own backbenchers don't trust him why on earth should the country?"" Mr Johnson replied: ""I can assure her in a long political career so far - barely begun - I've of course picked up political opponents all over and that is because this government has done some very big and very remarkable things which they didn't necessarily approve of. ""And what I want her to know is that absolutely nothing and no-one, least of all her, is going to stop us with getting on delivering for the British people."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer focused his questions on the government's record on the NHS, while the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called Mr Johnson, who was fined in April for attending an illegal Downing Street gathering during lockdown, a ""dead man walking"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson clash on the government's handling of the NHS He accused the prime minister of ""failing to recognise that these parties were against the law, it's that signal that the rules don't apply to him the way that they do for everyone else"". ""That's not the behaviour of someone who can remain in office, its someone that quite simply needs to be removed from office,"" Mr Blackford added. The prime minister's victory in the confidence vote means that, under Conservative Party rules, he cannot face another such test of his leadership for another year. But Mr Johnson is coming under pressure from some of his own MPs to cut taxes in an effort to boost the economy and help ease the burden on households caused by the rapidly rising cost of living. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, Health Secretary Sajid Javid and trade minister Penny Mordaunt all said they would like this to happen. But the prime minister's spokesperson played down the immediate prospect of this happening, saying it was important to be ""responsible"" at a time when finances were in ""very difficult position following the global pandemic"". They added that plans for further tax cuts would be set out ""as soon as it is fiscally responsible to do so"". There were no unfriendly questions from Tory MPs about his future to the PM in the chamber, but in a column in the Times newspaper, Conservative former cabinet minister David Davis accused Mr Johnson of ""letting things slide"" and warned him to ""get his act together"" quickly or leave office.

"Petrol prices see biggest daily jump in 17 yearsThe average cost of filling a typical family car could exceed Â£100 as soon as Thursday, the RAC warns.BusinessComments","The price of petrol saw its biggest daily jump in 17 years on Tuesday with a rise of more than 2p a litre. The RAC motoring group said the average cost of filling a typical family car with petrol was now Â£99.40 and could exceed Â£100 as soon as Thursday. Soaring fuel prices have been driven by the war in Ukraine and moves to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian oil. With food and energy bills also surging, many households are under pressure. The average price of petrol rose to 180.73p per litre on Tuesday, the RAC said. Meanwhile, the average price of diesel rose by almost 1.5p to another record high of 186.57p per litre, making the cost of filling a 55-litre family car Â£102.61. Why filling up your car could soon cost Â£100 Service station defends Â£2 per litre fuel costs In March,the government announced a 5p per litre cut to fuel dutyto help reduce costs for motorists. However, motoring groups have raised concerns retailers are not passing on the cut to customers. On Wednesday the prime minister's official spokesman said the government was ""not confident"" this was happening at all petrol stations. He said the government was ""continuing to look at all possible options"" and ""transparency may have an important role to play"" in ensuring the cut is passed on. It comes after a government source told the BBC a plan to name and shame petrol stations that fail to do so is ""still in the works"". The government says any increases in VAT receipts it gets from rising fuel prices are likely to be largely offset by reduced household spending and VAT on other items. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said if it found sufficient evidence the 5p fuel duty cut had not been passed on to drivers, then it would launch an investigation that could lead to fines for offending retailers. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said the accelerating costs of forecourt fuel was ""unprecedented"", adding it appeared prices were ""still some way from the peak"". But he said while the average price of diesel is heading towards Â£2 a litre, the cost of wholesale petrol had unexpectedly dropped by about 5p a litre on Tuesday, which if sustained, could stem the flow of ""daily record petrol prices"". Retailers base their prices on the wholesale cost of petrol and diesel but there is typically a two-week lag for pump prices to reflect any changes in wholesale prices due to the time it takes for fuel to reach forecourts. Mr Williams said the RAC's fuel watch data showed Asda had hiked its average petrol price by nearly 5p a litre in a single day, which he said was ""unheard of"". In response, Asda said wholesale fuel prices had increased ""at an unprecedented rate"" and ""we will do all we can to minimise the impact of rising wholesale prices on our customers"". Meanwhile, some forecourts are already selling petrol above Â£2 per litre, according to price comparison website PetrolPrices. The highest price was found to be 202.9p at BP sites on the A1 near Sunderland, the M4 near Chippenham in Wiltshire and the M6 near Burton-in-Kendal, Cumbria. The AA motoring group said the 2p litre rise was a ""huge shock"", but said the speculation that petrol prices could rise to Â£2 per litre on average ""just gives the fuel trade licence to pile on extra cost and the misery"". Fuel prices fell at the beginning of the Covid pandemic as many businesses temporarily closed and demand for energy collapsed. But as global economies recovered, prices rose again and have surged further after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Changes in prices at the pump are mainly determined by crude oil prices and the dollar exchange rate, because crude oil is traded in dollars. Russia is one of the world's major oil exporters and it is being targeted by economic and trading sanctions, which has led to potential supply concerns, pushing up oil prices. EU leaders have said they will block most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 to punish Moscow, which has also had an effect on prices. The UK - which gets 8% of its oil needs from Russia - has pledged to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and though it is not as dependent on Russian oil as the EU is, it is impacted when global prices rise. Energy and food prices are also being driven higher by the war in Ukraine. UK consumer prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, with millions hit by an unprecedented Â£700-a-year increase to their energy bills in April. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 9% in April and is expected to continue to rise this year.

One dead and others hurt as car ploughs into Berlin crowdPolice say it is unclear whether the incident was an accident or a deliberate attack.Europe,"The car crashed into a store A teacher was killed and 14 schoolchildren were injured after a car hit a crowd on a busy street in the German capital, Berlin. The group was on a school trip to Berlin from the state of Hesse. A second teacher was seriously hurt. Police say the driver, a 29-year-old man, was arrested at the scene. Berlin Interior Affairs Minister Iris Spranger said evidence suggested the driver was a ""mentally ill person running amok"". The incident occurred shortly before 10:30 (08:30 GMT) in the heart of western Berlin, on one of its busiest shopping streets. The woman who died has been identified as a schoolteacher who was on a trip with a class of teenagers from the central state of Hesse. Berlin police say she died on the spot. ""There are seriously injured people among the more than a dozen injured,"" police spokesperson Thilo Cablitz said. Bad Arolsen Mayor Marko Lambion said a bus was on its way to pick up the children from Berlin. ""We're doing everything we can to bring them home,"" he said at the press conference. The driver has dual German and Armenian citizenship and lives in Berlin. Earlier reports that he had left a note in his car were denied by officials. Witnesses described seeing a silver Renault Clio veering into a crowd of people on the pavement near Berlin's busy KurfÃ¼rstendamm shopping avenue, before driving back on to the road and crashing into a shop window. A witness who would only be named as F Kacan said the driver had abandoned the car and had taken off running but ""we were able to stop him"", AFP news agency reports. The actor John Barrowman tweeted that he had been nearby when the incident took place and in a video posted from the scene said the car had repeatedly mounted the footpath before crashing into the storefront.

Barrowman told the BBC the car had careened through tables of people sitting outside having breakfast, before smashing into the storefront. ""It was just horrific"", he said. ""I saw somebody being resuscitated, I saw somebody being literally thrown onto a stretcher and put into an ambulance."" Some 130 emergency workers went to the scene and a body lay in the middle of the road, covered in blankets. It happened opposite Breitscheidplatz, where 12 people were killed in a terrorist attack in 2016 when a truck was deliberately driven into a crowd of people at a Christmas market. Berlin Mayor Franziska Giffey said it was too early to know if the area had been chosen deliberately, but she said: ""It's a situation where you think, for God's sake, not again!"" After the Christmas market attack in 2016, the militant group Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the killings which had been carried out by an unsuccessful asylum seeker. He was later shot dead by police in Italy.

UK economy forecast to have zero growth next year,"The UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year and will stagnate next year, a think tank says. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expects the UK economy to grow by 3.6% this year, followed by 0% growth next year. It means the UK will go from the second-fastest growing economy in the G7 group of industrial nations to the slowest growing in 2023. The G7 members are the UK, US, Canada, Germany, Japan, France and Italy. The OECD is a group of countries which aims to assist economic development, raise living standards and promote growth in world trade. Laurence Boone, the Paris-based think tank's chief economist, said the UK was being hit hard by a combination of factors, including higher interest rates, higher taxes, reduced trade and more expensive energy and food. Inflation is expected to keep rising and peak at over 10% at the end of this year before gradually declining to 4.7% by the end of 2023. World Bank warns of recession risk due to Ukraine war Why are prices rising so quickly? Cost of living crisis prompts 'big state' response However, the report does not take into account the chancellor's emergency measures announced on 26th May. Those measures, which includeda Â£400 energy bill discount for every household in the UK, are worth around Â£15bn. A Treasury spokesperson said many people would be concerned by the forecasts. ""While we can't insulate the UK from global pressures entirely, our economy is in a strong position to deal with these challenges. We have a plan for growth, and we are supporting people with the cost of living,"" they added. Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the OECD report ""lays bare the extreme challenges facing the UK economy"". ""That economic growth in the UK will grind to a halt next year, with only Russia performing worse than us in the G20, is a shameful indictment of the chaos and incoherence of this Conservative government,"" she said. ""Labour would create a more secure economy by spending wisely, taxing fairly, and getting the economy firing on all cylinders."" Because we've spent so much time dwelling on the tightest squeeze on living standards in decades that's predicted to happen this year, it's worth going against the trend for a change. Buried in the small print of the OECD forecast that says our economy will stagnate is a consolation. Inflation in the UK, it predicts, will halve. Before you get too excited, please note that I haven't said when that will happen. Not this year, when the OECD expects (like the Bank of England) that it will get into double figures before the year is out. But next year, when it's forecast to drop to a relatively benign level of 4.7% by the end of 2023. That of course does not mean that the cost of living will be getting more affordable, just that it will be getting less affordable less quickly. By that time the soaring cost of energy to consumers, the think tank expects, will either be rising less quickly or falling. However, it will be months or years beyond that before living standards recover to their 2021 level. The cuts to UK economic growth come alongside a global slowdown which is due largely to the war in Ukraine. Global growth has been downgraded from 4.5% to 3% this year, the OECD said in its latest economic outlook. Only Argentina and Australia saw their growth projections upgraded. ""The world is set to pay a hefty price for Russia's war against Ukraine. A humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, leaving thousands dead, forcing millions of refugees to flee their homes and threatening an economic recovery that was underway after two years of the pandemic,"" the organisation said. ""As Russia and Ukraine are large commodity exporters,the war has sent energy and food prices soaring, making life much harder for many people across the world."" The OECD warned that Russia's attack on Ukraine will lead to higher inflation and lower growth for at least the next year. But the organisation stressed that prolonged hardship could be avoided by concerted action from governments and central banks.

NHS leadership changes after review finds bullying,"Health and social care leadership in England will be overhauled after a review found evidence of bullying and blame cultures, Sajid Javid has said. Following a series of damaging scandals at NHS trusts, the government said the report found ""institutional inadequacy"" in how managers are trained and valued. The health secretary said the findings - to be published in full later - were ""stark"". He earlier likened the NHS to the defunct Blockbuster video rental shop. Downing Street said Mr Javid told cabinet colleagues the NHS was a ""Blockbuster healthcare system in the age of Netflix"". ""The NHS is absolutely fantastic, we all rely on it, but much of how it's set up is a still very much 1948, we need to be thinking about 2048 and how we get from here to the needs of the British population when it comes to health in 2048,"" Mr Javid later explained to MPs. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting responded: ""I think it's slightly absurd that 12 years into a government we have government ministers who talk in the biggest generalities without plans to deliver anything."" Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast the Covid pandemic had ""thrown up much greater challenges"" for the NHS and ""produced a moment for us as a country to really grasp modernisation"" further. He was also asked for his reaction tofootage of a nurse warning of waits of more than seven-and-a-half hours to see a doctor at an accident and emergency department in Essex. The health secretary said between 11m and 13m people stayed away from the NHS during the pandemic, but with many people now returning to services, demand was at ""very high"" levels. He insisted the government had taken action, including investing ""record amounts"" in ambulance trusts, increasing call handlers for the 111 service, and Â£450m for emergency care services. This video can not be played Princess Alexandra Hospital A&E nurse filmed issuing doctor wait warning Ahead of the full publication of the review into health management, the Department of Health and Social Care said in a press release that, while it highlighted instances of inspirational leadership, overall the report found ""a lack of consistency and co-ordination"". It also said the report ""identified a lack of equal opportunity for managers to access training and colleagues to progress in their careers, with those who have existing networks or contacts more likely to access these opportunities"". Patients at risk due to NHS staff crisis, say nurses Bullying claims see staff shake-up Why the NHS is struggling like never before The review was headed by General Sir Gordon Messenger, a former vice chief of the defence staff who led the Royal Marines in the invasion of Iraq, and Dame Linda Pollard, chair of an NHS trust. Mr Javid said: ""The findings in this report are stark, it shows examples of great leadership but also where we need to urgently improve."" He fully supported the review's recommendations, which the government said include: action to improve equality, diversity and inclusion clear routes to progression and promotion a simplified appraisal system to focus on how people have behaved, not just what they have achieved the development of consistent management standards through accredited training encouraging the best leaders and managers to take on the most difficult roles, so they are seen as ""the best jobs rather than the most feared jobs"" The review's ideas for improving NHS and social care leadership in England seem to have been widely welcomed. Few could disagree with the view that patient care will benefit from a well-led and motivated workforce and that staff should be empowered to develop their careers. But how that will be achieved is another matter. Persuading talented managers to take on the toughest roles in challenged areas won't be straightforward. Changing institutional culture will take a while. The suggestion of discrimination and bullying at some organisations is concerning. And as the King's Fund think tank notes, the report comes at a time of a workforce crisis with chronic staff shortages which have not yet been faced up to by the government. Ministers will have their work cut out to explain how this review will address the underlying problems of a health and care system under great strain. NHS Chief Executive Amanda Pritchard said: ""As this report recognises, leaders across the health service do a fantastic job in often very challenging circumstances. ""The NHS is a learning organisation - we welcome this report and are determined to do all we can to ensure our leaders get the support they need"". Gen Messenger said the recommendations could transform leadership in the sector, adding: ""A well-led, motivated, valued, collaborative, inclusive, resilient workforce is the key to better patient and public health outcomes, and must be a priority."" Meanwhile, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation which represents health and care leaders, said the review had shown the need for more diverse leadership. ""We can't hide from the fact that all too often staff from ethnic minority backgrounds are still not being provided with the support they need to progress to leadership roles,"" he said. The review into health service leadership follows a series of damaging scandals at NHS trusts. In April,a damning report revealed catastrophic failingsat Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust, where at least 201 babies and nine mothers might have survived with better maternity care. Last year, the care watchdog for England said patients' human rightsmay have been breachedthrough ""do not resuscitate"" decisions made during Covid.

Tesco plant-based food advert banned as 'misleading',"Tesco's Plant Chef advert is now banned Tesco's adverts for one of its plant-based food ranges have been banned for being misleading about their environmental benefit. The adverts for the Plant Chef campaign featured a woman biting into a veggie burger, along with the claim it was ""better for the planet"". The UK's advertising watchdog said the supermarket's claims had not been substantiated. Tesco said it was ""disappointed"" by the outcome. The adverts were run last October and November across TV, radio and online, and received 171 complaints from the public, the Advertising Standards Authority said. TheASA said,externalthat Tesco did not have knowledge of the full lifecycle of the burger featured in its advert, and was therefore unable to substantiate its claim that the plant-based patty was better for the planet than ones made from meat. Tesco had said that the adverts did not make ""absolute environmental claims"", as they did not say that the product was ""wholly sustainable"". Tesco claimed its plant-based burger is 'better for the planet' The retailer said the focus of the adverts was to highlight price reductions for its Plant Chef vegan food range. The ASA said that it was generally accepted that by switching to a more plant-based diet, consumers could cut their overall environmental impact. But it added that some plant-based products contained a combination of ingredients and had ""complex production processes"" which could ""theoretically result in their having a similar, or greater, negative environmental impact than basic plant ingredients, or a meat-based alternative"". As such, the ASA said the adverts could no longer run in their current form. Tesco said in a statement: ""We're committed to making it easy and affordable for customers to incorporate plant-based meat alternatives into their diets and recipes."" The ASA said last year it was cracking down on misleading environmental claims made by firms, to ensure ads are ""socially responsible."" It comes as many corporations are accused by environmentalists of ""greenwashing"", which sees them exaggerate the environmental benefits of their products.

Antarctic sea floor mapped in greatest ever detail,"Scientists have made the most precise map yet of the mountains, canyons and plains that make up the floor of Antarctica's encircling Southern Ocean. Covering 48 million sq km (18.5 million sq miles), this chart for the first time details a new deepest point - a depression lying 7,432m (24,383ft) down called the Factorian Deep. Knowledge of the shape of the ocean's bottom is essential to safe navigation, marine conservation, and understanding Earth's climate and geological history. But we still have much to learn. Vast tracts of terrain have never been properly surveyed. The International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) has taken five years to compile and updates the first attempt at a comprehensive map, which was published in 2013. The IBCSO project and others like it around the world are gradually filling in the gaps in our scant knowledge of the bottom of the world's oceans. Ships and boats are being encouraged to routinely turn on their sonar devices to get depth (bathymetric) measurements; and governments, corporations, and institutions are being urged not to hide away data and put as much as possible into the public domain. This is paying dividends. The new map covers all the Southern Ocean floor poleward of 50 degrees South. If you divide its 48 million sq km into 500m grid squares, 23% of these cells now have at least one modern depth measurement. That's a big improvement on nine years ago. The tracks of surveying ships. Low-resolution satellite measurements must fill in the rest Back then, IBCSO began only at 60 degrees South, and less than 17% of its grid boxes had a modern measurement. ""You have to realise just what the change from 60 degrees to 50 degrees means; we've more than doubled the area of the chart,"" said Dr Boris Dorschel from Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute. ""So, we've increased the area coverage, but we've also increased the data density, because, in parallel, we've kept on acquiring new data and knocking on doors to free up existing data,"" he told BBC News. Much of the information in the chart comes from the ice-strengthened ships that support scientific endeavours in Antarctica, including from the UK's former polar ship, the RRS James Clark Ross. (In future, this British contribution will come from its successor, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, affectionately known as Boaty McBoatface.) As these vessels shuttle back and forth between the White Continent and the likes of Chile, South Africa and Tasmania - their echosounders make a habit of surveying the submerged terrain below. And this activity is increasingly coordinated, with research organisations from different nations working together to try to offset slightly the routes taken by their icebreakers. The UK's new polar ship, theRRS Sir David Attenborough, is equipped to map millions of sq km of ocean bottom over its career. The above image shows the ship's hull in dry dock. The yellow rectangle in the centre is a cover made of a synthetic material over the 8m-long array of transmitting transducers for the deep-water multibeam echosounding system. Better seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons. They are essential for safe navigation, obviously, but also for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that marine wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot. In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water. This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a pivotal role in moving heat around the planet. ""We can also study how the Antarctic Ice Sheet has changed over thousands of years just by looking at the seafloor,"" explained Dr Rob Larter from the British Antarctic Survey. Immense crater hole created in Tonga volcano Oceans' extreme depths measured in precise detail Shackleton's lost ship found after 107 years ""There's a record of where the ice flowed and where its grounded zones (places in contact with the seafloor) extended. This is beautifully preserved in the shape of the seafloor."" The new map was made possible by financing fromJapan's Nippon Foundation and the support from Seabed2030,external, the international effort to properly chart Earth's ocean floor by the end of the decade. At the moment, our knowledge of four-fifths of the planet's underwater terrain comes only from low-resolution satellite measurements that have inferred the presence of tall seamounts and deep valleys from the gravitational influence these features have on the sea surface. Water piles up over the mass of a large submarine mountain and dips slightly where there is a trench. One key finding in the years between the first and second versions of IBCSO is the recognition of the Southern Ocean's deepest point. It's a depression called Factorian Deep at the far southern end of the South Sandwich Trench.It lies 7,432m down. It was measured and visited by the Texan adventurer Victor Vescovo in his submarine Limiting Factor in 2019. The remote and often inhospitable nature of the Southern Ocean means substantial sections of it are unlikely to get mapped unless there is dedicated undertaking. There's high hope that an emerging class of robotic vessels could be given this task in the years ahead.

Pharmacists speak out at rise in abuse and attacks,"Pharmacist Chand Kausar says she was petrified when she was threatened with a knife Pharmacists say physical and verbal abuse against them has become unacceptably common and many now feel unsafe when at work. Police forces say they are being called out to handle pharmacy-based crimes. A union for UK pharmacists says more needs to be done to enforce the NHS's zero tolerance policy on worker abuse. The Pharmacists' Defence Association (PDA) says there have been reports of a stabbing and physical attacks in pharmacies around the UK. Pharmacist Conor McAreavey was stabbed in the hand with a knife at his pharmacy in Belfast in March. He told the BBChe was ""very lucky"" not to have suffered tendon damage. Glasgow pharmacist Chand Kausar was threatened with a knife by an agitated patient, who - after demanding non-prescribed medication - produced a six-inch knife and cornered her against a wall. ""I just froze,"" explains Ms Kausar. ""My hands were above my head and I could hear all the noise around me, but I actually felt very calm. In my head all was quiet. I remember thinking it was like a movie scene. I'd never seen a knife like that, and I never imagined I'd have one held to my throat."" The police were alerted quickly and arrested her attacker, saving Ms Kausar from any physical injuries, but she is still haunted by the mental scars. ""I struggle now when a patient raises their voice to me. I have a little internal panic attack and then have to make sure I control it."" Ms Kausar says she used to face an abusive patient once a month before the pandemic. Now she says she rarely gets through two shifts without facing one. ThePDA launched an online survey,externalin April 2022 and nearly 550 community pharmacists, mostly staff working in England, have responded so far. Some 468 of them - 85% - say they, or someone they work with, experienced verbal or racial abuse in the previous month while at work. CCTV images of staff being threatened in a pharmacy One respondent said: ""I feel terrified going to work every single day, and yet management are ignoring the issue."" Another said: ""I now carry a rape alarm and a dye spray because of threats."" Others said they were considering leaving the profession. A recentPharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee survey,externalof about 1,000 team members, carried out in January 2022, revealed low job satisfaction scores. According to some pharmacists, the majority of violent or abusive incidents are triggered by: addiction services failing to provide support for recovering addicts overwhelmed GP surgeries being unable to give a patient an appointment supply chain issues leaving a pharmacy without stocks of prescribed drugs Earlier this year, a lack of lateral flow testing kits resulted in a spike of aggression from patients. Staff shortages continue to add more pressure, and increase waiting times and frustration, in community pharmacies. In recent weeks, a shortage of Hormone Replacement Therapy has been an added pressure. Alison Jones, from the PDA, said: ""Staff shortages are already bad.. and they are only going to get worse. ""More patients are accessing the pharmacy than ever before and there is only a finite amount of staffing and hours. We are now in a situation where more and more pharmacists are considering whether they want to work in community pharmacy because of the working conditions and violence."" Supt Patrick Holdaway, head of the National Business Crime Centre, said: ""Police forces around the country are aware of this new spike in pharmacy crime. ""We also know that the numbers we currently have are only a fraction of the actual crime taking place in pharmacies. Pharmacists feel a duty to their patients and so don't want to report them, but we would say please report these crimes to help the police map hotspot areas and offer the correct support."" Supt Holdaway recommends pharmacies install more safety measures - including panic buttons, CCTV, bodycams. But as to who pays for these measures, that will fall on the pharmacy owners. As part of theGP Winter Access Fund,,externaldoctors' surgeries can access a Â£5m fund for security enhancements. However, this fund is not accessible to community pharmacies. NHS England says community pharmacy can access health and wellbeing offers, such as coaching services and conflict resolution training. When asked if community pharmacies would receive further support after the rise in violence, a Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson told the BBC: ""This kind of behaviour is inexcusable and will not be tolerated. ""The NHS has set up a violence reduction programme to protect its workforce, and we have doubled the maximum prison sentence for common assault against NHS workers. ""We work closely with the pharmaceutical industry and the NHS to minimise disruption caused by medicine shortages on the rare occasions they arise."" As for Ms Kausar, her sympathies still lie with the patients: ""These are desperate people driven to desperate acts. They just need help,"" she said.

Captured Mariupol steelworks soldiers sent to Russia â report,"Russia's foreign minister says three men sentenced to death - two Britons and one Moroccan - committed crimes in a breakaway Ukrainian region All three were convicted by a Russian proxy court in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic UK PM Boris Johnson urges ministers to do ""everything in their power"" to secure the release of the two Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner were fighting with the Ukrainian army and their sentencing is an ""egregious breach"" of the Geneva Conventions, the UK says Meanwhile, there's a risk of a major cholera outbreak in the occupied port city of Mariupol, the UK's Ministry of Defence says The exiled deputy mayor says the 100,000 people still in the city are at growing risk of disease Edited by Rob Corp We're pausing our live coverage now. Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities. It raises money for Unicef and this year the charity says some of the money raised will go towards helping those impacted by the war. ""This event is going to help a lot of people in Ukraine,"" he says, ""especially kids, we're going to create a lot of great programmes to improve a lot of things for kids."" Shevchenko with President Zelensky at the Independence Day military parade in Kyiv last August Three residents of Mykolaiv, in the south of the country, queue to collect humanitarian aid at a Red Cross distribution point In the outskirts of Kharkiv, a crater is pictured outside a school following a military strike Meanwhile in Russia, President Vladimir Putin greets Turkmenistan""s President Serdar Berdymukhamedov during a joint press conference following a meeting in Moscow And staff at a former McDonald's in Podolsk, outside Moscow, prepare for reopening this week under a new name. McDonald's pulled out of Russia over the Ukraine war. Its new Russian buyer has not yet revealed the name of the chain, although the logo has been revealed Aiden Aslin, left, Shaun Pinner, right, and Brahim Saaudun, centre, have been sentenced to death Amnesty International says that three foreign soldiers sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court is a situation that ""has no precedent"". Two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun were captured by Russian troops while fighting for Ukraine. All three were convicted by a court which is not internationally recognised in the pro-Russian, so-called Donetsk People's Republic. ""The party which holds full responsibility over these individualsâ circumstances and fate at present, is Russia,"" Denis Krivosheev, from Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, told Reuters. ""This situation has no precedent. This so-called Donetsk Peopleâs Republic has a so-called criminal code in which it has a so-called death penalty, which this time, and this hasnât happened before, they are applying to prisoners of war,"" he said. Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely."" Chris PartridgeBBC News This video can not be played Low-flying Ukrainian jet skims above trees Ukraine
is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied. Brits Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were all sentenced to death Thanks for joining us this afternoon - here's the latest on what's been happening in Ukraine: Russia defends death sentences for captured Britons  UK's defence secretary visits Ukraine  Cholera in Mariupol  How long will the war last?  Stay with us for the latest developments as they unfold. Volodymyr Zelensky Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking to students across the UK in a live broadcast to several universities. The eventhas been organised by the Ukrainian Students Unionand universities taking part include Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Glasgow, LSE, Manchester, Oxford, UCL and City, University of London. Zelensky tells them it's now 107 days since the war began, adding: ""107 days we have been tested for survival"". ""This war is visible and monstrous,"" he says, adding that the Russians ""talk about peaceful goals but... they're killing children and women."" Zelensky speaks about history, and picks out some historical events from the UK cities where the universities are based. ""The [Russian] mission is to delete our
history, our state, our identity, and to deny our existence. And as such to
tell the world that we never existed that we are an artificially created people
like a variety of some kind of plants or animals."" State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The
venue where Volodymyr Zelensky will be speaking to students at Coventry
University usually hosts cinema nights - but this evening it will be the
Ukrainian president's face on the big screen. Only 75 tickets were made available
for the event, and they were snapped up within hours. The first few
students have started arriving and there are a few Ukrainian flags draped on
the front row. Pavel Pimkin The president of the universityâs Ukraine Society is Pavel Pimkin, 20, whose male relatives are still in his home country. He says heâs feeling âhonoured and nervousâ about asking his nationâs president a question later. The address will also be shown at other British universities that have Ukrainian societies.

"Unions branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikesThe RMT hit back at the comments saying No 10 were ""experts at being selfish and irresponsible"".","Unions have been branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikes which threaten major disruption to passengers. The RMT Union said it will shut down the country's railway network on 21, 23 and 25 June after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. Downing Street warned the plans would inflict pain on passengers and cause disruption and said it was determined to make railways more efficient. But RMT hit back saying the government itself was being selfish. Both train operators and the union have said they want more talks to avoid the strikes. If industrial action goes ahead, more than 40,000 staff from Network Rail and 13 train operators are expected to take part in what is dubbed the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"". On the first day of the planned strike on 21 June, London Underground RMT workers plan to walk out in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses. On Wednesday, Unite members who work at Transport for London and London Underground announced they will join their RMT member colleagues in walking out on 21 June. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Strike dubbed the biggest in modern history The strikes fall during music and sporting events including the Glastonbury Festival and an England cricket Test match against New Zealand, and are expected to affect thousands of passengers. The action will leave around a fifth of mainline rail services running on the strike days, but due to each walk out being 24 hours long, disruption is expected to spill over to non-strike days leading to a week of disruption. According to the Department for Transport, the average salary rail worker salary is Â£44,000. This is more than the median pay of other public sector workers, such as nurses (Â£31,000), teachers (Â£37,000), and care workers (Â£17,000). However, RMT said the salary figure was ""unrepresentative"" as it included higher-earning train drivers, who did not take part in the ballot as most are part of a different union. The union claims its members earn Â£33,000 a year on average. The Prime Minister described the planned strike as ""reckless and wanton"" and demanded condemnation of the strike from the Labour Party in Prime Minister's Questions. A No 10 source said the move was ""thoroughly irresponsible"" and warned it would inflict ""pain and economic disruption on their fellow citizens in really tough times"". However, Mick Lynch, secretary general of the RMT union, hit back at the government saying they were ""experts at being selfish and irresponsible"". He told the BBC his members needed a pay deal, job security and ""decent terms and conditions"". ""The government have the key to unlock that,"" he added. Mr Lynch claimed Network Rail had told union reps they were planning to cut 3,000 maintenance jobs out of 11,000, which he said would pose safety risks. But Network Rail insisted no proposals were on the table, talks were under way about modernising maintenance and how compulsory redundancies could be avoided. It rejected claims it would do anything to compromise safety. Graham Purdy, from Cramlington in Northumberland is one of many learning that his plans will be affected if the June strikes go ahead. He and his wife have tickets to see the Eagles at Murrayfield, Edinburgh, on 22 June and to a Barry Manilow concert the following day in Glasgow. The 63-year-old, whose travel plans involve his first overnight stay since the pandemic, said he was against the strike and now faced having to drive and book car parking he may not have to use, but pay for. ""It's annoying and frustrating,"" he said. ""I've worked all my life in the construction industry; If you don't like what they are paying, you get another job, don't withdraw your services."" Alastair Webster says he sides with the rail workers However, Alastair Webster, from Birmingham, said he supported the stance of the rail workers, despite his plans to go on holiday being ""massively"" disrupted by the proposed action. ""There has been under-investment and mismanagement, millions wasted on HS2. People want the railways nationalised,"" he said. ""I'd always side with the people on the coal face. Even if its massively disruptive I support the strikers. With the cost of living crisis and everything else the government needs to constructively engage with them."" Steve Montgomery, of the Rail Delivery Group, said the industry body was ""extremely disappointed"" with the prospect of strike action. ""It's really important we ask RMT to get back round the table,"" he said. He said that the industry had received Â£16bn in subsidies over the pandemic, but that level of funding could not continue. ""We have to look how we can reform,"" he said. Rail firms ""are looking at all options"" to modernise, including job losses, he said. The industry group said rail industry revenue is currently at 82% of 2019 levels, which is the same as a Â£38m shortfall on pre-Covid revenue levels every week. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Covid ""changed travel habits"" - with 25% fewer ticket sales and the taxpayer stepping in to keep the railways running at a cost equivalent to Â£600 per household. People working for 13 train operating companies, whicheach run services in different parts,externalof the country, will take part in the strike. These are: Chiltern Railways Cross Country Trains Greater Anglia LNER East Midlands Railway c2c Great Western Railway Northern Trains South Eastern Railway South Western Railway TransPennine Express Avanti West Coast West Midlands Trains In addition, workers at Network Rail, which maintains the railways throughout Britain, also voted to strike. So the impact of the action would be felt across England, Scotland, and Wales.

""They are ripping off the passenger, they are ripping off the taxpayer. The government needs to fund the railway properly, and we need the companies to give up some of their profits to give our members a pay rise,"" he added. But the Rail Delivery Group spokesman said the RMT was ""using inflated figures"" on profits to ""disguise the real issue"". Mr Lynch said the union doesn't want disruption for thousands of commuters, but had been talking to rail firms for two years trying to get pay deals. ""We've got another two weeks before this action starts. There's plenty of time to get proposals forward,"" he added. Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell and the BBC's UGC team.

"Unions branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikesThe RMT hit back at the comments saying No 10 were ""experts at being selfish and irresponsible"".Business","Unions have been branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikes which threaten major disruption to passengers. The RMT Union said it will shut down the country's railway network on 21, 23 and 25 June after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. Downing Street warned the plans would inflict pain on passengers and cause disruption and said it was determined to make railways more efficient. But RMT hit back saying the government itself was being selfish. Both train operators and the union have said they want more talks to avoid the strikes. If industrial action goes ahead, more than 40,000 staff from Network Rail and 13 train operators are expected to take part in what is dubbed the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"".

One dead and others hurt as car drives into Berlin crowdPolice say it is unclear whether the incident was an accident or a deliberate attack.Europe,"The car crashed into a store A teacher was killed and 14 schoolchildren were injured after a car hit a crowd on a busy street in the German capital, Berlin. The group was on a school trip to Berlin from the state of Hesse. A second teacher was seriously hurt. Police say the driver, a 29-year-old man, was arrested at the scene. Berlin Interior Affairs Minister Iris Spranger said evidence suggested the driver was a ""mentally ill person running amok"". The incident occurred shortly before 10:30 (08:30 GMT) in the heart of western Berlin, on one of its busiest shopping streets. The woman who died has been identified as a schoolteacher who was on a trip with a class of teenagers from the central state of Hesse. Berlin police say she died on the spot. ""There are seriously injured people among the more than a dozen injured,"" police spokesperson Thilo Cablitz said. Bad Arolsen Mayor Marko Lambion said a bus was on its way to pick up the children from Berlin. ""We're doing everything we can to bring them home,"" he said at the press conference. The driver has dual German and Armenian citizenship and lives in Berlin. Earlier reports that he had left a note in his car were denied by officials. Witnesses described seeing a silver Renault Clio veering into a crowd of people on the pavement near Berlin's busy KurfÃ¼rstendamm shopping avenue, before driving back on to the road and crashing into a shop window. A witness who would only be named as F Kacan said the driver had abandoned the car and had taken off running but ""we were able to stop him"", AFP news agency reports. The actor John Barrowman tweeted that he had been nearby when the incident took place and in a video posted from the scene said the car had repeatedly mounted the footpath before crashing into the storefront.

PM under pressure to cut tax after confidence vote,"Boris Johnson is coming under pressure from his MPs to cut taxes after surviving a vote of confidence. The prime minister's supporters believe the move would help rebuild unity in the Conservative Party and help people cope with the rising cost of living. But ex-cabinet minister David Davis accused Mr Johnson of ""letting things slide"" and warned him to ""get his act together"" quickly or leave office. A No 10 source said the PM wanted to bring in tax cuts ""in the longer term"". They added that moving too fast in this direction could push up public borrowing and debt. Time to draw a line under Partygate, says PM Could Boris Johnson be challenged again? How safe is Boris Johnson's job now? Mr Johnson is facing MPs in the House of Commons in Prime Minister's Questions for the first time since four in 10 of his own MPs backed ousting him in a confidence vote on Monday. The result followed months of criticism over parties that took place in Downing Street during lockdown, with the prime minister himself being fined for attending one gathering. It also came amid a rapidly rising cost of living. Mr Johnson has urged his party to ""draw a line"" under questions about his leadership, but some Conservative MPs are still publicly calling on him to quit. The prime minister, whose government has recently raised National Insurance to help deal with NHS backlogs and social care funding, is now facing pressure to announce policies that would appeal to MPs from across his party. He is said to have hinted at reductions to the tax burden - currently at its highest level since the 1940s - when he met them before Monday's vote. And at Tuesday's cabinet meeting, he said: ""We will have the scope, by delivering tax cuts, I think, to deliver considerable growth in employment and economic progress."" But the BBC has been told that no specific measures were discussed and, on Wednesday, a No 10 source said the prime minister wanted to cut tax ""in the longer term"", but cost-of-living support and dealing with the cost of Covid measures took ""priority at this stage"". Taxpayers will get some relief next month when a National Insurance threshold rise comes into effect, bringing theamount people can earn before they start paying it up to Â£12,570. But NI payments went up at the beginning of April, meaning anyone currently earning more than Â£9,880 a year has to pay 1.25p more in the pound. And businesses are also due to pay more tax, with the rate of corporation tax, on company profits,due to rise from 19% to 25% for larger firms, starting in 2023. The autumn Budget is expected to bring some tax cuts for companies, in an effort to encourage investment. On Tuesday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC he wanted to see tax cuts ""as soon as is possible"" - and he was joined by his cabinet colleague, Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who said on Wednesday: ""I would like to see us do more on tax cuts."" Former Brexit minister Lord Frost, who resigned last year, said: ""All tax rises that we brought in, and the corporation tax ones that are due to come in soon, ought to be reversed"". And Trade minister Penny Mordaunt told theGuardian,external: ""To increase revenues and growth for the nation, [the government must] cut taxes."" But Mr Davis, who has previously called for Mr Johnson to quit, used a Times newspaper column to criticise the prime minister's leadership style, arguing he had ""been light on detail from day one"". ""What I hope Johnson will now avoid is a set of populist policies that are drafted in the hope of shoring up our immediate popularity,"" he added. ""This may work in the very short term, but if the policy is not thought through carefully enough, it will end up with dreadful headlines as it goes wrong."" The Conservative Party faces tricky by-elections in the seats of Wakefield in Yorkshire and Tiverton and Honiton in Devon at the end of this month. On Tuesday, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Johnson did not have ""any sense of honour"" and should resign. Campaigning in Tiverton and Honiton on Wednesday, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: ""This is a government in crisis, too divided and weak to offer the help people need to cope with the cost-of-living emergency."" Mr Kwarteng admitted the two mid-term by-elections would be ""challenging"", but added that such contests ""generally are"" for parties in government. ""People have written off Boris Johnson for 20 years. I've read his political obituary dozens of times,"" he said. ""But I think ultimately he is a winner"". The prime minister is also to be the subject of an inquiry by the Commons privileges committee into whether he misled Parliament over lockdown rule-breaking in Downing Street.

Cinema pulls film about Prophet Muhammad's daughter,"Cineworld has cancelled all UK screenings of a film about the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, after it prompted protests outside some cinemas. The cinema chain said it made the decision ""to ensure the safety of our staff and customers"". More than 120,000 people have signed a petition for The Lady of Heaven film to be pulled from UK cinemas. The Bolton Council of Mosques called the film ""blasphemous"" and ""underpinned with a sectarian ideology"". But the film's producer, Malik Shlibak, said ""no one should dictate for the British public what they can and cannot watch or discuss"", describing the protesters as ""fringe groups"". The film, which was released in UK cinemas on 3 June, claims to tell the story of Lady Fatima, the daughter of Prophet Muhammad. It has been criticised by some groups for depicting the Prophet Muhammad - which is seen as an insult in Islam - and for its portrayal of prominent revered figures in early Sunni Islam. It was pulled from the Cineworld chain after reported protests in Bolton, Birmingham and Sheffield. In Bolton, more than 100 people protested outside the cinema,Bolton News,externalreported. In an email to Cineworld - reported by Bolton News - Bolton Council of Mosques chairman Asif Patel said the film was ""underpinned with a sectarian ideology"" and ""misrepresents orthodox historical narratives and disrespects the most esteemed individuals of Islamic history"". The Muslim news site 5Pillars also shared a picture on Twitter of what it said showed 200 Muslims protesting against the film outside a Birmingham branch of Cineworld on Sunday. Video footage circulating online appears to show a manager of a Cineworld cinema in Sheffield informing protesters that a screening of the film had been cancelled,the Guardian,externalreported.

Mr Shlibak criticised the decision by Cineworld to pull the film, saying it was ""cowering"" to the protesters' demands. He told the BBC: ""Now they see any time they're upset or mildly offended they'll do the same."" Mr Shlibak added that there were millions of Muslims in the UK, and the protesters did not represent all of their views. ""We need to be very careful not to cower down to that and do the exact opposite, which is say to the people that we are tolerant, we accept different views and positions and we're happy to disagree, even passionately, but there should be no censorship involved."" But he also said the protests would fail at shutting down the film, adding that a ""large, large population across the UK have just heard about the film for the first time, so that's brilliant for us"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid also criticised the decision to pull the film. Speaking to TalkTV on Wednesday,external, the health secretary said: ""You might not like what someone's got to say, but they have a right to say it."" Mr Javid pointed out that there are no blasphemy laws in the UK and warned that would be ""an incredibly dangerous road to go down"". ""What we have in this country is freedom of speech and expression and that is a fundamental value,"" he added. Unlike some incidents in the past, opposition to the film is not primarily about the way the Prophet Mohammed is depicted - though there is a CGI portrayal of him in it. Criticism mainly centres around the way the Shia Muslim film-maker and cleric Yasser Al-Habib has portrayed prominent revered figures in early Sunni Islam, implying that there are comparisons between their actions with those of the Islamic State group in Iraq.

Cinema pulls film about Prophet Muhammad's daughterThe Lady of Heaven film has been criticised by some Muslim groups as blasphemous.Business,"Cineworld has cancelled all UK screenings of a film about the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, after it prompted protests outside some cinemas. The cinema chain said it made the decision ""to ensure the safety of our staff and customers"". More than 120,000 people have signed a petition for The Lady of Heaven film to be pulled from UK cinemas. The Bolton Council of Mosques called the film ""blasphemous"" and ""underpinned with a sectarian ideology"". But the film's producer, Malik Shlibak, said ""no one should dictate for the British public what they can and cannot watch or discuss"", describing the protesters as ""fringe groups"". The film, which was released in UK cinemas on 3 June, claims to tell the story of Lady Fatima, the daughter of Prophet Muhammad. It has been criticised by some groups for depicting the Prophet Muhammad - which is seen as an insult in Islam - and for its portrayal of prominent revered figures in early Sunni Islam. It was pulled from the Cineworld chain after reported protests in Bolton, Birmingham and Sheffield. In Bolton, more than 100 people protested outside the cinema,Bolton News,externalreported. In an email to Cineworld - reported by Bolton News - Bolton Council of Mosques chairman Asif Patel said the film was ""underpinned with a sectarian ideology"" and ""misrepresents orthodox historical narratives and disrespects the most esteemed individuals of Islamic history"". The Muslim news site 5Pillars also shared a picture on Twitter of what it said showed 200 Muslims protesting against the film outside a Birmingham branch of Cineworld on Sunday. Video footage circulating online appears to show a manager of a Cineworld cinema in Sheffield informing protesters that a screening of the film had been cancelled,the Guardian,externalreported.

Mr Shlibak criticised the decision by Cineworld to pull the film, saying it was ""cowering"" to the protesters' demands. He told the BBC: ""Now they see any time they're upset or mildly offended they'll do the same."" Mr Shlibak added that there were millions of Muslims in the UK, and the protesters did not represent all of their views. ""We need to be very careful not to cower down to that and do the exact opposite, which is say to the people that we are tolerant, we accept different views and positions and we're happy to disagree, even passionately, but there should be no censorship involved."" But he also said the protests would fail at shutting down the film, adding that a ""large, large population across the UK have just heard about the film for the first time, so that's brilliant for us"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid also criticised the decision to pull the film. Speaking to TalkTV on Wednesday,external, the health secretary said: ""You might not like what someone's got to say, but they have a right to say it."" Mr Javid pointed out that there are no blasphemy laws in the UK and warned that would be ""an incredibly dangerous road to go down"". ""What we have in this country is freedom of speech and expression and that is a fundamental value,"" he added.

"PM under pressure to cut tax after confidence voteBut a No 10 source says tax cuts are planned only in ""the longer term"", with other issues taking priority.","Boris Johnson is coming under pressure from his MPs to cut taxes after surviving a vote of confidence. The prime minister's supporters believe the move would help rebuild unity in the Conservative Party and help people cope with the rising cost of living. But ex-cabinet minister David Davis accused Mr Johnson of ""letting things slide"" and warned him to ""get his act together"" quickly or leave office. A No 10 source said the PM wanted to bring in tax cuts ""in the longer term"". They added that moving too fast in this direction could push up public borrowing and debt. Time to draw a line under Partygate, says PM Could Boris Johnson be challenged again? How safe is Boris Johnson's job now? Mr Johnson is facing MPs in the House of Commons in Prime Minister's Questions for the first time since four in 10 of his own MPs backed ousting him in a confidence vote on Monday. The result followed months of criticism over parties that took place in Downing Street during lockdown, with the prime minister himself being fined for attending one gathering. It also came amid a rapidly rising cost of living. Mr Johnson has urged his party to ""draw a line"" under questions about his leadership, but some Conservative MPs are still publicly calling on him to quit. The prime minister, whose government has recently raised National Insurance to help deal with NHS backlogs and social care funding, is now facing pressure to announce policies that would appeal to MPs from across his party. He is said to have hinted at reductions to the tax burden - currently at its highest level since the 1940s - when he met them before Monday's vote. And at Tuesday's cabinet meeting, he said: ""We will have the scope, by delivering tax cuts, I think, to deliver considerable growth in employment and economic progress."" But the BBC has been told that no specific measures were discussed and, on Wednesday, a No 10 source said the prime minister wanted to cut tax ""in the longer term"", but cost-of-living support and dealing with the cost of Covid measures took ""priority at this stage"". Taxpayers will get some relief next month when a National Insurance threshold rise comes into effect, bringing theamount people can earn before they start paying it up to Â£12,570. But NI payments went up at the beginning of April, meaning anyone currently earning more than Â£9,880 a year has to pay 1.25p more in the pound. And businesses are also due to pay more tax, with the rate of corporation tax, on company profits,due to rise from 19% to 25% for larger firms, starting in 2023. The autumn Budget is expected to bring some tax cuts for companies, in an effort to encourage investment. On Tuesday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC he wanted to see tax cuts ""as soon as is possible"" - and he was joined by his cabinet colleague, Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who said on Wednesday: ""I would like to see us do more on tax cuts."" Former Brexit minister Lord Frost, who resigned last year, said: ""All tax rises that we brought in, and the corporation tax ones that are due to come in soon, ought to be reversed"". And Trade minister Penny Mordaunt told theGuardian,external: ""To increase revenues and growth for the nation, [the government must] cut taxes."" But Mr Davis, who has previously called for Mr Johnson to quit, used a Times newspaper column to criticise the prime minister's leadership style, arguing he had ""been light on detail from day one"". ""What I hope Johnson will now avoid is a set of populist policies that are drafted in the hope of shoring up our immediate popularity,"" he added. ""This may work in the very short term, but if the policy is not thought through carefully enough, it will end up with dreadful headlines as it goes wrong."" The Conservative Party faces tricky by-elections in the seats of Wakefield in Yorkshire and Tiverton and Honiton in Devon at the end of this month. On Tuesday, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Johnson did not have ""any sense of honour"" and should resign. Campaigning in Tiverton and Honiton on Wednesday, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: ""This is a government in crisis, too divided and weak to offer the help people need to cope with the cost-of-living emergency."" Mr Kwarteng admitted the two mid-term by-elections would be ""challenging"", but added that such contests ""generally are"" for parties in government. ""People have written off Boris Johnson for 20 years. I've read his political obituary dozens of times,"" he said. ""But I think ultimately he is a winner"". The prime minister is also to be the subject of an inquiry by the Commons privileges committee into whether he misled Parliament over lockdown rule-breaking in Downing Street.

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities. It raises money for Unicef and this year the charity says some of the money raised will go towards helping those impacted by the war. ""This event is going to help a lot of people in Ukraine,"" he says, ""especially kids, we're going to create a lot of great programmes to improve a lot of things for kids."" Shevchenko with President Zelensky at the Independence Day military parade in Kyiv last August Three residents of Mykolaiv, in the south of the country, queue to collect humanitarian aid at a Red Cross distribution point In the outskirts of Kharkiv, a crater is pictured outside a school following a military strike Meanwhile in Russia, President Vladimir Putin greets Turkmenistan""s President Serdar Berdymukhamedov during a joint press conference following a meeting in Moscow And staff at a former McDonald's in Podolsk, outside Moscow, prepare for reopening this week under a new name. McDonald's pulled out of Russia over the Ukraine war. Its new Russian buyer has not yet revealed the name of the chain, although the logo has been revealed Aiden Aslin, left, Shaun Pinner, right, and Brahim Saaudun, centre, have been sentenced to death Amnesty International says that three foreign soldiers sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court is a situation that ""has no precedent"". Two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun were captured by Russian troops while fighting for Ukraine. All three were convicted by a court which is not internationally recognised in the pro-Russian, so-called Donetsk People's Republic. ""The party which holds full responsibility over these individualsâ circumstances and fate at present, is Russia,"" Denis Krivosheev, from Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, told Reuters. ""This situation has no precedent. This so-called Donetsk Peopleâs Republic has a so-called criminal code in which it has a so-called death penalty, which this time, and this hasnât happened before, they are applying to prisoners of war,"" he said. Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely."" Chris PartridgeBBC News This video can not be played Low-flying Ukrainian jet skims above trees Ukraine
is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied. Brits Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were all sentenced to death Thanks for joining us this afternoon - here's the latest on what's been happening in Ukraine: Russia defends death sentences for captured Britons  UK's defence secretary visits Ukraine  Cholera in Mariupol  How long will the war last?  Stay with us for the latest developments as they unfold. Volodymyr Zelensky Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking to students across the UK in a live broadcast to several universities. The eventhas been organised by the Ukrainian Students Unionand universities taking part include Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Glasgow, LSE, Manchester, Oxford, UCL and City, University of London. Zelensky tells them it's now 107 days since the war began, adding: ""107 days we have been tested for survival"". ""This war is visible and monstrous,"" he says, adding that the Russians ""talk about peaceful goals but... they're killing children and women."" Zelensky speaks about history, and picks out some historical events from the UK cities where the universities are based. ""The [Russian] mission is to delete our
history, our state, our identity, and to deny our existence. And as such to
tell the world that we never existed that we are an artificially created people
like a variety of some kind of plants or animals."" State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The
venue where Volodymyr Zelensky will be speaking to students at Coventry
University usually hosts cinema nights - but this evening it will be the
Ukrainian president's face on the big screen. Only 75 tickets were made available
for the event, and they were snapped up within hours. The first few
students have started arriving and there are a few Ukrainian flags draped on
the front row. Pavel Pimkin The president of the universityâs Ukraine Society is Pavel Pimkin, 20, whose male relatives are still in his home country. He says heâs feeling âhonoured and nervousâ about asking his nationâs president a question later. The address will also be shown at other British universities that have Ukrainian societies.

Falklands War: The bombing of the Sir Galahad,"This video can not be played One Falklands veteran recalls the ship still burning 10 days after the attack Mike Hermanis was a 19-year-old Army recruit whose maximum expectation when he joined the Welsh Guards was that he might get posted to Northern Ireland. He had not expected to see ""serious action"". But then the Falklands conflict broke out in April 1982 and like thousands of other young men, he found himself sailing 8,000 miles away to the British-held South Atlantic islands, following an invasion by Argentine forces. ""This was the going to be the first thing since WWII for the Welsh Guards. It was absolutely massive. You were nervous, but the excitement was unbelievable,"" he remembered. Along with a large number of his regiment, 8 June 1982 saw him waiting for hours onboard the support ship RFA Sir Galahad, after being transported by sea from another part of the island to Bluff Cove. Of the 48 soldiers who died on the Sir Galahad, 32 were from the Welsh Guards. Eight others died on the Sir Tristram But as they prepared to finally disembark at Fitzroy,the Sir Galahad was bombed, with the resulting fireball that engulfed the ship becoming one of the defining images of the war. It cost the lives of 32 Welsh Guards, eleven other soldiers and five civilian crew. One of the most seriously injured soldiers,Simon Weston CBE, became a nationally recognisable figure after documenting his recovery from severe burns and for his decades of charity work. A second support ship, the Sir Tristram, was also hit, with two of its Hong Kong Chinese crewmen dying in the blast. Mike's escape from death or serious injury was partly down to his refusal to sleep ""in the guts of the ship"" the night before, owning to his claustrophobia. His platoon sergeant - ""Big Mo, lovely bloke"" - let him sleep instead on the tank deck, where he spent the night playing cards with friends, Carl Smith and Steve Jones. ""Nobody is really getting a lot of sleep, 'cause it was alien to us. We worked on land, and we were on water,"" he said. Mike Hermanis (r) escaped without physical injuries from the bombing of the Sir Galahad They were told numerous times to prepare to disembark, and putting their gear on and taking it off a number of times as orders changed. They did not realise the cove, which was believed to have been vacated by enemy forces, was under observation, or how exposed their position was. When the attack alarm sounded, there was barely time to react, Mike recalled. They had been about to get off the boat - ""packed like sardines"" - when the bombs hit. Mike, from Newport, said he heard a ""bang, and then whoosh"". ""I must have been picked up and thrown about 10 or 15 foot,"" he said. ""It was a weird sensation. I always remember, someone told me once, if you're ever in an explosion, breathe out, so you don't burn your lungs, and I remember flying though the air. ""It seemed to take forever. It was in slow motion, and you could see every detail around you [as I was] exhaling, I come down, and I thought right, go to sleep now. Then smoke, chaos, and panic struck in."" A friend picked him up off the floor, checked he was ok and told him to get out. Horrors and heroism on the Falklands front line How creativity helped Falklands veterans heal Soldier reveals unseen Falklands images ""I went outside and took a couple of gulps of fresh air, had a look around. Carl Smith is there with a big scab across his head, where he'd smacked his head. ""Where's Steve Jones? [I] went back in. He's under the bloody ship's door. It's about three inches thick, a big heavy thing. It took five of us to lift the door off of him and get him out. He's breathing but he's sparked out,"" he explained. Survivors coming ashore from the bombed Sir Galahad, helped by people including Tony Davies He and the others knew they had to try to get Steve to safety but no helicopters had arrived yet and confusion had spread on board. ""We didn't know if we were going to get strafed, or if we were going to get another bomb on us,"" he recalled. ""You had smoke coming out, There was tonnes and tonnes of white [phosphorous], ammunition going off and boom, bash, smack, wallop going every couple of seconds."" The group wrapped Steve in a tarpaulin, attached ropes around his body and started lowering him over the side to a landing platform known as a Mexefloat. ""We're lowering him and he starts bloody corkscrewing. It was a fair drop down, it was about 40 feet down. We'll turn it, we'll reverse him, pull it back. ""But it continued to corkscrew out, and he's just about to plop, the Mexe came in and the boys caught him. That was the horror of my life that was,"" he said. The sensations he experienced on the Sir Galahad stayed with him. ""The smoke and the smell - burning flesh and Cordite, that's all I could describe it as. For years afterwards, if I ever see the Galahad go up on telly, I could smell it,"" he said. Andy Jones was with Mike as they got off the Sir Galahad, and together saved another soldier One of Mike's companions in the evacuation was his friend Andy ""Curly"" Jones, with whom he helped save another soldier from drowning after the young man bounced off an inflatable lifeboat pod and fell into the sea. Andy, originally from Carmarthen but now living in Libanus, Powys, had avoided being badly hurt or worse because the force of the blast as he ran onto the tank deck had thrown him under a pile of other men. After getting out, he was trapped in an internal corridor, with water rising at one end. ""The thought was, which way do you want to die? That seriously was your decision. Were you going to shoot yourself, because of the water on the floor? ""I'm not a Navy person, I don't know, was the ship going down? Are you going to get blown up? Are you going to drown or do you take that?"" he asked. ""And then you were thinking, how will my parents know how I died? That seriously was in my mind. My parents won't know the manner of my death."" The Welsh Guards suffered the most losses in the Falklands war Bangor-based Maldwyn Jones, who had joined the Welsh Guards in 1975, was a medic onboard the Galahad when the bombs struck. He remembers ""hanging around and waiting"" to disembark, saying: ""It was okay for us because it was quite an overcast day, low clouds, misty, so nobody could see us. ""But as the day got brighter, the mist cleared... and you can see the mountains, Harriet, Two Sisters, Mount William and if we could see them - we knew the Argentinians were in the high ground - they could see us."" A red air warning came and ""next thing the ship lit up, pure brilliant white"". People came crying out from the back of the ship to the front and Maldwyn could smell burning flesh and heat emanating from bodies as they passed him by. Maldwyn Jones was a medic on board the Galahad He posted men in different parts of the ship and started calling out to tell people to follow the sound of his voice. The last person he found was a young soldier whose leg had been blown off by the blast. With the help of another soldier he got him to a higher deck where he was evacuated by helicopter. But as he explained: ""I was one of two medics. There was not a lot I could do, because the first aid kit was still in the heart of the ship. I couldn't go down to get it, it was too dangerous. ""The only thing I had was 10 extra vials of morphine. All I could do then was just give people who were burnt, morphine. So you had to triage and decide on the severity of the burns."" He was one of the last off the ship and once on land took part in the rollcall, where the reality of the scale of the losses started to sink in. Tony Davies (right) saw the Galahad bombed from the shore ""But we didn't actually know 'til, I think, it was 48 hours later, who's actually missing presumed dead, and that's when it hit us - 32 Welsh Guardsmen were missing presumed dead,"" he said. ""To this day, they're still in our hearts really. We vowed never to forget them."" Sir Galahad: Disaster for British at Bluff Cove Soldier recalls fireball that engulfed bombed ship Onshore watching in horror as the ships burned was regimental Sgt Maj Tony Davies, who knew many of his Welsh Guard comrades were on the Sir Galahad. He said: ""There were guys being lifted off the bow by helicopter winch, because it was the stern of the Galahad where all the damage had taken place. ""The hole was still blazing. There were still explosions, bombs were going off. ""We could see lots of people, lots of our guys on the bow of the ship being lowered down into the life rafts."" Stephen Newbury lost his life on the Galahad Members of the Parachute Regiment, 2 Para, were assisting with the evacuation. ""They were sort of taking wounded guys [who] were badly burned, you know, who'd had some first aid Flamazine bags, off the lifeboats and putting them on the shore and sort of looking after them. ""So it took us actually about three days before we knew exactly what was what, who was missing, who was wounded and who we had ashore. So it was quite a difficult time for us I would say."" Back in the UK, news of the attacks was filtering back to the Welsh Guards' base in Pirbright, Surrey, where Karen Edwards was working in the NAAFI army supplies centre. Karen came from a Cardiff military family through and through. Her father had been in the Welsh Guards, and her brother Stephen Newbury had followed in his footsteps, a path that led to his presence on the Sir Galahad that fateful, fatal day. Karen Edwards was working on the Welsh Guards' base when she heard of her brother's death Karen remembers the impact in the army base as the scale of the losses became known. ""Everything started being very, very subdued,"" she said. ""It was horrible atmosphere once people started knowing........ It was devastating. ""I mean, people were just walking around like as if they were, not zombies, but you know, I don't think it sunk in."" Grieving for her brother, she also had to watch as many new-made young widows had to pack up and leave the base, their connection to army life abruptly broken. Dawn Newbury's father ""died of a broken heart"" after her brother Steve was killed Her sister Dawn Newbury was at work back in Cardiff when her parents came to find her. ""They said, you know, you need to come home. They didn't tell me till we got home. When they told me we were just all devastated, absolutely devastated. It's unbelievable,"" she said. The sisters say their only brother's death in the Falklands broke their father's heart. He died aged 56 just a few years after Steve. ""My father just was the old school Welsh Guards. Don't say a lot, it's kept to themselves,"" explained Karen. ""He never really said a lot about it. I don't think he ever really discussed it when it was over. But it killed my father. Definitely."" The day changed the survivors' lives forever and has left some with scars that are no less painful for being invisible. As Mike Hermanis says: ""Not a single day of the last 40 years has gone by, when I have not thought about it. Not one day when I don't think about those boys."" In total, 56 men died aboard Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram and 150 were injured. But there were also mental scars. ""I've been diagnosed with PTSD,"" said Andy Jones. ""I've learned to live with it. ..... I'm happy to feel that pain from mental health illness. ""I'm happy that I suffer because to me it's my penance. It's my punishment really for coming home, and not staying there.""

"NHS leadership changes after review finds bullyingHealth Secretary Sajid Javid says the findings are ""stark"" ahead of the report's publication later.Health","Health and social care leadership in England will be overhauled after a review found evidence of bullying and blame cultures, Sajid Javid has said. Following a series of damaging scandals at NHS trusts, the government said the report found ""institutional inadequacy"" in how managers are trained and valued. The health secretary said the findings - to be published in full later - were ""stark"". He earlier likened the NHS to the defunct Blockbuster video rental shop. Downing Street said Mr Javid told cabinet colleagues the NHS was a ""Blockbuster healthcare system in the age of Netflix"". ""The NHS is absolutely fantastic, we all rely on it, but much of how it's set up is a still very much 1948, we need to be thinking about 2048 and how we get from here to the needs of the British population when it comes to health in 2048,"" Mr Javid later explained to MPs. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting responded: ""I think it's slightly absurd that 12 years into a government we have government ministers who talk in the biggest generalities without plans to deliver anything."" Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast the Covid pandemic had ""thrown up much greater challenges"" for the NHS and ""produced a moment for us as a country to really grasp modernisation"" further. He was also asked for his reaction tofootage of a nurse warning of waits of more than seven-and-a-half hours to see a doctor at an accident and emergency department in Essex. The health secretary said between 11m and 13m people stayed away from the NHS during the pandemic, but with many people now returning to services, demand was at ""very high"" levels. He insisted the government had taken action, including investing ""record amounts"" in ambulance trusts, increasing call handlers for the 111 service, and Â£450m for emergency care services. This video can not be played Princess Alexandra Hospital A&E nurse filmed issuing doctor wait warning Ahead of the full publication of the review into health management, the Department of Health and Social Care said in a press release that, while it highlighted instances of inspirational leadership, overall the report found ""a lack of consistency and co-ordination"". It also said the report ""identified a lack of equal opportunity for managers to access training and colleagues to progress in their careers, with those who have existing networks or contacts more likely to access these opportunities"". Patients at risk due to NHS staff crisis, say nurses Bullying claims see staff shake-up Why the NHS is struggling like never before The review was headed by General Sir Gordon Messenger, a former vice chief of the defence staff who led the Royal Marines in the invasion of Iraq, and Dame Linda Pollard, chair of an NHS trust. Mr Javid said: ""The findings in this report are stark, it shows examples of great leadership but also where we need to urgently improve."" He fully supported the review's recommendations, which the government said include: action to improve equality, diversity and inclusion clear routes to progression and promotion a simplified appraisal system to focus on how people have behaved, not just what they have achieved the development of consistent management standards through accredited training encouraging the best leaders and managers to take on the most difficult roles, so they are seen as ""the best jobs rather than the most feared jobs"" The review's ideas for improving NHS and social care leadership in England seem to have been widely welcomed. Few could disagree with the view that patient care will benefit from a well-led and motivated workforce and that staff should be empowered to develop their careers. But how that will be achieved is another matter. Persuading talented managers to take on the toughest roles in challenged areas won't be straightforward. Changing institutional culture will take a while. The suggestion of discrimination and bullying at some organisations is concerning. And as the King's Fund think tank notes, the report comes at a time of a workforce crisis with chronic staff shortages which have not yet been faced up to by the government. Ministers will have their work cut out to explain how this review will address the underlying problems of a health and care system under great strain. NHS Chief Executive Amanda Pritchard said: ""As this report recognises, leaders across the health service do a fantastic job in often very challenging circumstances. ""The NHS is a learning organisation - we welcome this report and are determined to do all we can to ensure our leaders get the support they need"". Gen Messenger said the recommendations could transform leadership in the sector, adding: ""A well-led, motivated, valued, collaborative, inclusive, resilient workforce is the key to better patient and public health outcomes, and must be a priority."" Meanwhile, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation which represents health and care leaders, said the review had shown the need for more diverse leadership. ""We can't hide from the fact that all too often staff from ethnic minority backgrounds are still not being provided with the support they need to progress to leadership roles,"" he said. The review into health service leadership follows a series of damaging scandals at NHS trusts. In April,a damning report revealed catastrophic failingsat Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust, where at least 201 babies and nine mothers might have survived with better maternity care. Last year, the care watchdog for England said patients' human rightsmay have been breachedthrough ""do not resuscitate"" decisions made during Covid.

Cineworld cancels 'blasphemous' film after protests,"Cineworld has cancelled all UK screenings of a film about the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, after it prompted protests outside some cinemas. The cinema chain said it made the decision ""to ensure the safety of our staff and customers"". More than 120,000 people have signed a petition for The Lady of Heaven film to be pulled from UK cinemas. The Bolton Council of Mosques called the film ""blasphemous"" and ""underpinned with a sectarian ideology"". But the film's producer, Malik Shlibak, said ""no one should dictate for the British public what they can and cannot watch or discuss"", describing the protesters as ""fringe groups"". The film, which was released in UK cinemas on 3 June, claims to tell the story of Lady Fatima, the daughter of Prophet Muhammad. It has been criticised by some groups for depicting the Prophet Muhammad - which is seen as an insult in Islam - and for its portrayal of prominent revered figures in early Sunni Islam. It was pulled from the Cineworld chain after reported protests in Bolton, Birmingham and Sheffield. In Bolton, more than 100 people protested outside the cinema,Bolton News,externalreported. In an email to Cineworld - reported by Bolton News - Bolton Council of Mosques chairman Asif Patel said the film was ""underpinned with a sectarian ideology"" and ""misrepresents orthodox historical narratives and disrespects the most esteemed individuals of Islamic history"". The Muslim news site 5Pillars also shared a picture on Twitter of what it said showed 200 Muslims protesting against the film outside a Birmingham branch of Cineworld on Sunday. Video footage circulating online appears to show a manager of a Cineworld cinema in Sheffield informing protesters that a screening of the film had been cancelled,the Guardian,externalreported.

Mr Shlibak criticised the decision by Cineworld to pull the film, saying it was ""cowering"" to the protesters' demands. He told the BBC: ""Now they see any time they're upset or mildly offended they'll do the same."" Mr Shlibak added that there were millions of Muslims in the UK, and the protesters did not represent all of their views. ""We need to be very careful not to cower down to that and do the exact opposite, which is say to the people that we are tolerant, we accept different views and positions and we're happy to disagree, even passionately, but there should be no censorship involved."" But he also said the protests would fail at shutting down the film, adding that a ""large, large population across the UK have just heard about the film for the first time, so that's brilliant for us"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid also criticised the decision to pull the film. Speaking to TalkTV on Wednesday,external, the health secretary said: ""You might not like what someone's got to say, but they have a right to say it."" Mr Javid pointed out that there are no blasphemy laws in the UK and warned that would be ""an incredibly dangerous road to go down"". ""What we have in this country is freedom of speech and expression and that is a fundamental value,"" he added. Unlike some incidents in the past, opposition to the film is not primarily about the way the Prophet Mohammed is depicted - though there is a CGI portrayal of him in it. Criticism mainly centres around the way the Shia Muslim film-maker and cleric Yasser Al-Habib has portrayed prominent revered figures in early Sunni Islam, implying that there are comparisons between their actions with those of the Islamic State group in Iraq. Leaders of the protests have said while they want the film banned, their demonstrations were peaceful, but cinemas clearly felt their behaviour was intimidating enough to warrant screenings to be pulled. Outrage since that happened - including from some Muslims who had wanted to see the film - has been because a relatively small number of people have managed to exert their will in a way that that appears to normalise censorship on the grounds of blasphemy. The Muslim Council of Britain, the UK's largest Muslim umbrella organisation, has described the film as ""divisive"". In a statement on Sunday, the organisation said it ""supports those scholars and leaders who are advocating for greater unity and for the common good"". ""There are some - including many of this film's supporters or those engaging in sectarianism in their response - whose primary goal is to fuel hatred,"" the statement added. Screenings of the film were still scheduled for Wednesday at a number of Vue cinemas in London and south-east England. Screenings went ahead at this Vue cinema in west London, despite protests outside In a statement, a spokesperson said: ""Vue takes seriously the responsibilities that come with providing a platform for a wide variety of content and believes in showcasing films of interest to diverse communities across the UK. ""Vue will only show a film once the BBFC (the independent British Board of Film Classification) has assessed and rated a film. The Lady of Heaven has been BBFC accredited and is on show in a number of our cinemas."" The company would not confirm whether any screenings had been cancelled, but added: ""Decisions about how long a film remains on show are taken on a site-by-site basis and based on a variety of commercial and operational factors."" A spokesperson for Cineworld said: ""Due to recent incidents related to screenings of The Lady of Heaven, we have made the decision to cancel upcoming screenings of the film nationwide to ensure the safety of our staff and customers.""

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities.

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities.

"PM under pressure to cut tax after confidence voteBut a No 10 source says tax cuts are planned only in ""the longer term"", with other issues taking priority.UK Politics","Boris Johnson is coming under pressure from his MPs to cut taxes after surviving a vote of confidence. The prime minister's supporters believe the move would help rebuild unity in the Conservative Party and help people cope with the rising cost of living. But ex-cabinet minister David Davis accused Mr Johnson of ""letting things slide"" and warned him to ""get his act together"" quickly or leave office. A No 10 source said the PM wanted to bring in tax cuts ""in the longer term"". They added that moving too fast in this direction could push up public borrowing and debt. Time to draw a line under Partygate, says PM Could Boris Johnson be challenged again? How safe is Boris Johnson's job now? Mr Johnson is facing MPs in the House of Commons in Prime Minister's Questions for the first time since four in 10 of his own MPs backed ousting him in a confidence vote on Monday. The result followed months of criticism over parties that took place in Downing Street during lockdown, with the prime minister himself being fined for attending one gathering. It also came amid a rapidly rising cost of living. Mr Johnson has urged his party to ""draw a line"" under questions about his leadership, but some Conservative MPs are still publicly calling on him to quit. The prime minister, whose government has recently raised National Insurance to help deal with NHS backlogs and social care funding, is now facing pressure to announce policies that would appeal to MPs from across his party. He is said to have hinted at reductions to the tax burden - currently at its highest level since the 1940s - when he met them before Monday's vote. And at Tuesday's cabinet meeting, he said: ""We will have the scope, by delivering tax cuts, I think, to deliver considerable growth in employment and economic progress."" But the BBC has been told that no specific measures were discussed and, on Wednesday, a No 10 source said the prime minister wanted to cut tax ""in the longer term"", but cost-of-living support and dealing with the cost of Covid measures took ""priority at this stage"". Taxpayers will get some relief next month when a National Insurance threshold rise comes into effect, bringing theamount people can earn before they start paying it up to Â£12,570. But NI payments went up at the beginning of April, meaning anyone currently earning more than Â£9,880 a year has to pay 1.25p more in the pound. And businesses are also due to pay more tax, with the rate of corporation tax, on company profits,due to rise from 19% to 25% for larger firms, starting in 2023. The autumn Budget is expected to bring some tax cuts for companies, in an effort to encourage investment. On Tuesday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC he wanted to see tax cuts ""as soon as is possible"" - and he was joined by his cabinet colleague, Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who said on Wednesday: ""I would like to see us do more on tax cuts."" Former Brexit minister Lord Frost, who resigned last year, said: ""All tax rises that we brought in, and the corporation tax ones that are due to come in soon, ought to be reversed"". And Trade minister Penny Mordaunt told theGuardian,external: ""To increase revenues and growth for the nation, [the government must] cut taxes."" But Mr Davis, who has previously called for Mr Johnson to quit, used a Times newspaper column to criticise the prime minister's leadership style, arguing he had ""been light on detail from day one"". ""What I hope Johnson will now avoid is a set of populist policies that are drafted in the hope of shoring up our immediate popularity,"" he added. ""This may work in the very short term, but if the policy is not thought through carefully enough, it will end up with dreadful headlines as it goes wrong."" The Conservative Party faces tricky by-elections in the seats of Wakefield in Yorkshire and Tiverton and Honiton in Devon at the end of this month. On Tuesday, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Johnson did not have ""any sense of honour"" and should resign. Campaigning in Tiverton and Honiton on Wednesday, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: ""This is a government in crisis, too divided and weak to offer the help people need to cope with the cost-of-living emergency."" Mr Kwarteng admitted the two mid-term by-elections would be ""challenging"", but added that such contests ""generally are"" for parties in government. ""People have written off Boris Johnson for 20 years. I've read his political obituary dozens of times,"" he said. ""But I think ultimately he is a winner"". The prime minister is also to be the subject of an inquiry by the Commons privileges committee into whether he misled Parliament over lockdown rule-breaking in Downing Street.

Antarctic sea floor mapped in greatest ever detailA new map traces the shape of the remote ocean bed surrounding Antarctica.Science & Environment,"Scientists have made the most precise map yet of the mountains, canyons and plains that make up the floor of Antarctica's encircling Southern Ocean. Covering 48 million sq km (18.5 million sq miles), this chart for the first time details a new deepest point - a depression lying 7,432m (24,383ft) down called the Factorian Deep. Knowledge of the shape of the ocean's bottom is essential to safe navigation, marine conservation, and understanding Earth's climate and geological history. But we still have much to learn. Vast tracts of terrain have never been properly surveyed. The International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) has taken five years to compile and updates the first attempt at a comprehensive map, which was published in 2013. The IBCSO project and others like it around the world are gradually filling in the gaps in our scant knowledge of the bottom of the world's oceans. Ships and boats are being encouraged to routinely turn on their sonar devices to get depth (bathymetric) measurements; and governments, corporations, and institutions are being urged not to hide away data and put as much as possible into the public domain. This is paying dividends. The new map covers all the Southern Ocean floor poleward of 50 degrees South. If you divide its 48 million sq km into 500m grid squares, 23% of these cells now have at least one modern depth measurement. That's a big improvement on nine years ago. The tracks of surveying ships. Low-resolution satellite measurements must fill in the rest Back then, IBCSO began only at 60 degrees South, and less than 17% of its grid boxes had a modern measurement. ""You have to realise just what the change from 60 degrees to 50 degrees means; we've more than doubled the area of the chart,"" said Dr Boris Dorschel from Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute. ""So, we've increased the area coverage, but we've also increased the data density, because, in parallel, we've kept on acquiring new data and knocking on doors to free up existing data,"" he told BBC News. Much of the information in the chart comes from the ice-strengthened ships that support scientific endeavours in Antarctica, including from the UK's former polar ship, the RRS James Clark Ross. (In future, this British contribution will come from its successor, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, affectionately known as Boaty McBoatface.) As these vessels shuttle back and forth between the White Continent and the likes of Chile, South Africa and Tasmania - their echosounders make a habit of surveying the submerged terrain below. And this activity is increasingly coordinated, with research organisations from different nations working together to try to offset slightly the routes taken by their icebreakers. The UK's new polar ship, theRRS Sir David Attenborough, is equipped to map millions of sq km of ocean bottom over its career. The above image shows the ship's hull in dry dock. The yellow rectangle in the centre is a cover made of a synthetic material over the 8m-long array of transmitting transducers for the deep-water multibeam echosounding system. Better seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons. They are essential for safe navigation, obviously, but also for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that marine wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot. In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water. This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a pivotal role in moving heat around the planet. ""We can also study how the Antarctic Ice Sheet has changed over thousands of years just by looking at the seafloor,"" explained Dr Rob Larter from the British Antarctic Survey. Immense crater hole created in Tonga volcano Oceans' extreme depths measured in precise detail Shackleton's lost ship found after 107 years ""There's a record of where the ice flowed and where its grounded zones (places in contact with the seafloor) extended. This is beautifully preserved in the shape of the seafloor."" The new map was made possible by financing fromJapan's Nippon Foundation and the support from Seabed2030,external, the international effort to properly chart Earth's ocean floor by the end of the decade. At the moment, our knowledge of four-fifths of the planet's underwater terrain comes only from low-resolution satellite measurements that have inferred the presence of tall seamounts and deep valleys from the gravitational influence these features have on the sea surface. Water piles up over the mass of a large submarine mountain and dips slightly where there is a trench. One key finding in the years between the first and second versions of IBCSO is the recognition of the Southern Ocean's deepest point. It's a depression called Factorian Deep at the far southern end of the South Sandwich Trench.It lies 7,432m down. It was measured and visited by the Texan adventurer Victor Vescovo in his submarine Limiting Factor in 2019. The remote and often inhospitable nature of the Southern Ocean means substantial sections of it are unlikely to get mapped unless there is dedicated undertaking. There's high hope that an emerging class of robotic vessels could be given this task in the years ahead.

Fresh talks urged to avoid rail strike disruption,"Unions have been branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikes which threaten major disruption to passengers. The RMT Union said it will shut down the country's railway network on 21, 23 and 25 June after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. Downing Street warned the plans would inflict pain on passengers and cause disruption and said it was determined to make railways more efficient. But RMT hit back saying the government itself was being selfish. Both train operators and the union have said they want more talks to avoid the strikes. If industrial action goes ahead, more than 40,000 staff from Network Rail and 13 train operators are expected to take part in what is dubbed the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"". On the first day of the planned strike on 21 June, London Underground RMT workers plan to walk out in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses. On Wednesday, Unite members who work at Transport for London and London Underground announced they will join their RMT member colleagues in walking out on 21 June. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Strike dubbed the biggest in modern history The strikes fall during music and sporting events including the Glastonbury Festival and an England cricket Test match against New Zealand, and are expected to affect thousands of passengers. The action will leave around a fifth of mainline rail services running on the strike days, but due to each walk out being 24 hours long, disruption is expected to spill over to non-strike days leading to a week of disruption. According to the Department for Transport, the average salary rail worker salary is Â£44,000. This is more than the median pay of other public sector workers, such as nurses (Â£31,000), teachers (Â£37,000), and care workers (Â£17,000). However, RMT said the salary figure was ""unrepresentative"" as it included higher-earning train drivers, who did not take part in the ballot as most are part of a different union. The union claims its members earn Â£33,000 a year on average. The Prime Minister described the planned strike as ""reckless and wanton"" and demanded condemnation of the strike from the Labour Party in Prime Minister's Questions. A No 10 source said the move was ""thoroughly irresponsible"" and warned it would inflict ""pain and economic disruption on their fellow citizens in really tough times"". However, Mick Lynch, secretary general of the RMT union, hit back at the government saying they were ""experts at being selfish and irresponsible"". He told the BBC his members needed a pay deal, job security and ""decent terms and conditions"". ""The government have the key to unlock that,"" he added. Mr Lynch claimed Network Rail had told union reps they were planning to cut 3,000 maintenance jobs out of 11,000, which he said would pose safety risks. But Network Rail insisted no proposals were on the table, talks were under way about modernising maintenance and how compulsory redundancies could be avoided. It rejected claims it would do anything to compromise safety. Graham Purdy, from Cramlington in Northumberland is one of many learning that his plans will be affected if the June strikes go ahead. He and his wife have tickets to see the Eagles at Murrayfield, Edinburgh, on 22 June and to a Barry Manilow concert the following day in Glasgow. The 63-year-old, whose travel plans involve his first overnight stay since the pandemic, said he was against the strike and now faced having to drive and book car parking he may not have to use, but pay for. ""It's annoying and frustrating,"" he said. ""I've worked all my life in the construction industry; If you don't like what they are paying, you get another job, don't withdraw your services."" Alastair Webster says he sides with the rail workers However, Alastair Webster, from Birmingham, said he supported the stance of the rail workers, despite his plans to go on holiday being ""massively"" disrupted by the proposed action. ""There has been under-investment and mismanagement, millions wasted on HS2. People want the railways nationalised,"" he said. ""I'd always side with the people on the coal face. Even if its massively disruptive I support the strikers. With the cost of living crisis and everything else the government needs to constructively engage with them."" Steve Montgomery, of the Rail Delivery Group, said the industry body was ""extremely disappointed"" with the prospect of strike action. ""It's really important we ask RMT to get back round the table,"" he said. He said that the industry had received Â£16bn in subsidies over the pandemic, but that level of funding could not continue. ""We have to look how we can reform,"" he said. Rail firms ""are looking at all options"" to modernise, including job losses, he said. The industry group said rail industry revenue is currently at 82% of 2019 levels, which is the same as a Â£38m shortfall on pre-Covid revenue levels every week. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Covid ""changed travel habits"" - with 25% fewer ticket sales and the taxpayer stepping in to keep the railways running at a cost equivalent to Â£600 per household. People working for 13 train operating companies, whicheach run services in different parts,externalof the country, will take part in the strike. These are: Chiltern Railways Cross Country Trains Greater Anglia LNER East Midlands Railway c2c Great Western Railway Northern Trains South Eastern Railway South Western Railway TransPennine Express Avanti West Coast West Midlands Trains In addition, workers at Network Rail, which maintains the railways throughout Britain, also voted to strike. So the impact of the action would be felt across England, Scotland, and Wales. Read more on how the strikes will affect you here However, Mr Lynch said railway firms ""can easily afford a pay rise for our members, it'll just mean they have to cut back on their profits"". ""They are ripping off the passenger, they are ripping off the taxpayer. The government needs to fund the railway properly, and we need the companies to give up some of their profits to give our members a pay rise,"" he added. But the Rail Delivery Group spokesman said the RMT was ""using inflated figures"" on profits to ""disguise the real issue"". Mr Lynch said the union doesn't want disruption for thousands of commuters, but had been talking to rail firms for two years trying to get pay deals. ""We've got another two weeks before this action starts. There's plenty of time to get proposals forward,"" he added. Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell and the BBC's UGC team.

Sri Lanka says it needs $5bn for essential goodsThe country's prime minister says the money would be used to pay for basic items like food and food.,"Sri Lanka's prime minister says the country needs at least $5bn (Â£4bn) over the next six months to pay for essential goods as it faces its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years. Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament the money is needed for basic items such as food, fuel and fertiliser. In May, Sri Lanka defaulted on its debts with international lenders for the first time in its history. The country has held bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund. On Tuesday, Mr Wickremesinghe, who is also the country's finance minister, told parliament that more money was required this year to meet Sri Lanka's basic needs. He said the island nation, which has a population of around 22 million, requires $3.3bn for fuel imports, $900m for food, $600m for fertiliser, and $250m for cooking gas. Sri Lanka in first debt default in its history What's behind Sri Lanka's economic crisis? It comes as Sri Lankan lawmakers accepted a $55m loan for fertilisers from India's Exim Bank. The United Nations also plans to make a worldwide appeal for Sri Lanka, and has pledged $48m for food, agriculture and healthcare, Mr Wickremesinghe added. He also warned of a slowdown in government payments to businesses and workers across the country, as funds are redirected to pay for food supplies. ""A lot of people will be without food, so the food programme we are initiating will ensure that all families, even if they have no income, they will have food,"" Mr Wickremesinghe said. ""We can have community kitchens in temples [and] churches to supply the food. The community has to get involved,"" he added. The South Asian nation will also try to renegotiate a $1.5bn financial support deal with China, Mr Wickremesinghe said. This video can not be played PM Ranil Wickramasinghe: ""There won't be a hunger crisis"" Sri Lanka is struggling with its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from the UK in 1948. The country's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, rising energy prices, and populist tax cuts. A shortage of medicines, fuel and other essentials has also helped to push the cost of living to record highs. Sri Lanka's official rate of inflation, the pace at which prices rise, rose by 39.1% year-on-year in May. At the same time, food prices in its largest city Colombo increased by 57.4%. Mr Wickremesinghe is set to unveil an interim budget next month, as he faces the challenge of slashing overall government spending while still providing social welfare payments. Last week, Sri Lanka's agriculture ministercalled on farmers to grow more riceas he said the country's ""food situation is becoming worse"". The government also announced an immediate increase to value added tax (VAT) from 8% to 12%. The move was expected to boost revenue by 65bn Sri Lankan rupees ($181m; Â£144m). It also said corporate tax would rise in October from 24% to 30%. Sri Lanka urges farmers to plant rice amid crisis Sri Lanka in first debt default in its history Why is Sri Lanka in crisis?

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities. It raises money for Unicef and this year the charity says some of the money raised will go towards helping those impacted by the war. ""This event is going to help a lot of people in Ukraine,"" he says, ""especially kids, we're going to create a lot of great programmes to improve a lot of things for kids.""

McDonald's pulled out of Russia over the Ukraine war. Its new Russian buyer has not yet revealed the name of the chain, although the logo has been revealed Aiden Aslin, left, Shaun Pinner, right, and Brahim Saaudun, centre, have been sentenced to death Amnesty International says that three foreign soldiers sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court is a situation that ""has no precedent"". Two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun were captured by Russian troops while fighting for Ukraine. All three were convicted by a court which is not internationally recognised in the pro-Russian, so-called Donetsk People's Republic. ""The party which holds full responsibility over these individualsâ circumstances and fate at present, is Russia,"" Denis Krivosheev, from Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, told Reuters. ""This situation has no precedent. This so-called Donetsk Peopleâs Republic has a so-called criminal code in which it has a so-called death penalty, which this time, and this hasnât happened before, they are applying to prisoners of war,"" he said. Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely."" Chris PartridgeBBC News This video can not be played Low-flying Ukrainian jet skims above trees Ukraine
is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied. Brits Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were all sentenced to death Thanks for joining us this afternoon - here's the latest on what's been happening in Ukraine: Russia defends death sentences for captured Britons  UK's defence secretary visits Ukraine  Cholera in Mariupol  How long will the war last?  Stay with us for the latest developments as they unfold. Volodymyr Zelensky Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking to students across the UK in a live broadcast to several universities. The eventhas been organised by the Ukrainian Students Unionand universities taking part include Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Glasgow, LSE, Manchester, Oxford, UCL and City, University of London. Zelensky tells them it's now 107 days since the war began, adding: ""107 days we have been tested for survival"". ""This war is visible and monstrous,"" he says, adding that the Russians ""talk about peaceful goals but... they're killing children and women."" Zelensky speaks about history, and picks out some historical events from the UK cities where the universities are based. ""The [Russian] mission is to delete our
history, our state, our identity, and to deny our existence. And as such to
tell the world that we never existed that we are an artificially created people
like a variety of some kind of plants or animals."" State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The
venue where Volodymyr Zelensky will be speaking to students at Coventry
University usually hosts cinema nights - but this evening it will be the
Ukrainian president's face on the big screen. Only 75 tickets were made available
for the event, and they were snapped up within hours. The first few
students have started arriving and there are a few Ukrainian flags draped on
the front row. Pavel Pimkin The president of the universityâs Ukraine Society is Pavel Pimkin, 20, whose male relatives are still in his home country. He says heâs feeling âhonoured and nervousâ about asking his nationâs president a question later. The address will also be shown at other British universities that have Ukrainian societies.

Sri Lanka says it needs $5bn for essential goods,"Sri Lanka's prime minister says the country needs at least $5bn (Â£4bn) over the next six months to pay for essential goods as it faces its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years. Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament the money is needed for basic items such as food, fuel and fertiliser. In May, Sri Lanka defaulted on its debts with international lenders for the first time in its history. The country has held bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund. On Tuesday, Mr Wickremesinghe, who is also the country's finance minister, told parliament that more money was required this year to meet Sri Lanka's basic needs. He said the island nation, which has a population of around 22 million, requires $3.3bn for fuel imports, $900m for food, $600m for fertiliser, and $250m for cooking gas.

Uber powers emergency food deliveries in Ukraine,"Uber has built a ""private-label"" version of its delivery platform to help the United Nations deliver food and water supplies to war-torn areas of Ukraine. The tech firm is working with the UN's World Food Programme (WFP). It's difficult for large delivery trucks to access some parts of Ukraine because of structural damage and the threat of attack. Uber's platform enables the WFP to co-ordinate a fleet of smaller vehicles. The WFP is hand-picking its own drivers and vehicles, but some are former Uber drivers who worked in Ukraine before the Russian invasion. Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi said his firm had given the WFP ""their own private-label Uber"". It's a bespoke version of the Uber Direct delivery platform which is available commercially - big name customers include Apple and Tesco. Usually, businesses pay Uber a commission per delivery for the service, but the WFP is not being charged. It can use the software to co-ordinate distribution, and track deliveries and drivers within a 100km range of its warehouses. The scheme is being trialled in the central city of Dnipro. The hope is that it will be rolled out later across four other cities: Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv and Chernivtsi. The WFP is aiming to provide monthly supplies to 3m people in Ukraine by the end of June There are a number of aid organisations working to provide emergency supplies to those in need, including the Red Cross, the International Rescue Committee and Save the Children. Uber's platform was up and running within a few weeks of its first contact with the World Food Programme. ""It's not like you can wait a month to get food to people - people have got to get food immediately,"" said WFP executive director David Beasley. ""You can't go a few weeks without food, and so using Uber's technology, their distribution systems, their dispatch systemsâ¦ it really is a great success story."" Uber has had a turbulent few years. Its ride-sharing service was hit hard during the pandemic as people stayed at home, and the firm has been forced to reform its driver policies, giving them better workers' rights. The move into deliveries has, however, been a success - Mr Khosrowshahi says that when he first became CEO in 2017, Uber's delivery arm was in its infancy, but it is now poised to become the firm's biggest service. In 2021,96% of Uber's delivery orders were for restaurant food,external. It was also the first year in which the 13-year-old firm reported a profit. ""I ultimately think that delivery can be bigger in scope because it's not just about food. It's groceries - and also empowering any local merchant to try to out-Amazon Amazon,"" said Mr Khosrowshahi. ""If Amazon can deliver next day, your local merchant can deliver in the next hour or two hoursâ¦ people want delivery of everything at home as quickly as possible, and we can ride that wave.""

"Time to draw a line under Partygate, says PM","This video can not be played Watch: Time to draw a line and take country forward - PM to Cabinet Boris Johnson has promised to cut taxes and government waste after surviving an attempt by his own MPs to oust him. The prime minister thanked ministers for their support in a confidence vote, which saw 41% of Tory MPs saying they had lost faith in him. He urged them to ""draw a line"" under questions about his leadership and vowed a return to ""fundamental"" Tory economic policies. The number of rebels in Monday night's vote was higher than predicted. And some Conservative MPs are still publicly calling on him to quit over widespread Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street. Tobias Ellwood, a longstanding critic of the PM, said the ""honourable way forward"" would be for him to ""step back"" and accept that the task of uniting the Conservative Party to win the next general election is ""too big"". But he added: ""We have to deal with the reality that those days of an honourable resignation are not there."" Ukraine's president: I'm happy Johnson is still PM Tory MP says he backed PM after funding assurances Could Boris Johnson be challenged again? Senior government figures have come out to defend Mr Johnson, including Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab who said there was ""no credible alternative"" to the prime minister. And backbencher Philip Davies - who voted against Mr Johnson on Monday - said: ""The prime minister won fair and square. My view is that you've got to accept the result. If you lose a vote, you accept it. That's the whole point of democracy."" The PM has also received support from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whotold a Financial Times event,externalhe was ""very happy"" the UK leader had remained in post. The prime minister may want to draw a line under questions over his leadership - but many of his MPs are not willing to do so. Senior MPs have told the BBC that there would be significant pressure on the 1922 committee to change the current rules - which protect the prime minister from another confidence vote for 12 months. Rebels believe if the Conservatives lose the two by-elections being held later this month, in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and Tiverton Honiton, in Devon - that will prompt a new leadership crisis. They also believe the scandal over lockdown parties in Downing Street is far from over, with the Commons privileges committee still to look into whether the PM misled Parliament when he denied parties had been held in downing street and insisted all rules had been followed. That could unearth new evidence - and the conclusions could be highly damaging. Last night's confidence vote result does not resolve the debate on Boris Johnson's future. As one senior backbencher put it, it means the prime minster thinks he can stay on - but the rebels think they are within touching distance of bringing him down. Read Nick's full analysis In the confidence vote, triggered by Partygate, Mr Johnson was backed by 211 Conservative MPs, but 148 voted to remove him. Mr Johnson hailed this as a ""decisive"" victory - and on Tuesday morning told a cabinet meeting his ""fundamental Conservative instinct"" was to allow people to decide how to spend their money. He urged cabinet ministers to find ways to make savings and told them ""delivering tax cuts"" would help deliver ""considerable growth in employment and economic progress"". But Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Johnson did not have ""any sense of honour"" and should resign. Speaking to BBC News, she said Tory MPs who voted to keep the PM in office were ""just not listening to the scale of frustration and anger across the country"". ""There's really got to be some consequences when someone just isn't telling the truth, isn't fit for office, isn't taking the action the country needs"". Mr Johnson won the confidence of 59% of his MPs, however, his critics have noted that his predecessor Theresa May secured the support of 63% when she faced her own confidence vote but was still forced out of office six months later. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described Mr Johnson as a ""lying lawbreaker"" who was ""clinging on by the skin of his teeth"" while SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford likened him to a ""dead man walking"". ""Whether it's by Tory MPs finally acting in a responsible manner or indeed the Privileges Committee taking action against him, he will be gone,"" Mr Blackford said.

World Bank warns of recession risk due to Ukraine war,"Countries around the world are facing recession as the Ukraine war hits economies already rocked by the Covid pandemic, the World Bank has warned. Less developed countries in Europe and east Asia face a ""major recession"", it said. The risk of high inflation and low growth - so-called ""stagflation"" - is also higher, World Bank President David Malpass said. Energy and food bills have been rising around the world. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" Mr Malpass said. He also warned in the World Bank'sGlobal Economic Prospects report,externalfor June that the danger of stagflation was ""considerable"". ""Subdued growth will likely persist throughout the decade because of weak investment in most of the world. With inflation now running at multi-decade highs in many countries and supply expected to grow slowly, there is a risk that inflation will remain higher for longer."" Also on Tuesday, the World Bank approved $1.49bn (Â£1.2bn) of additional funding for Ukraine, which it said ""will be used to pay for wages for government and social workers."" The new financing is part of a more than $4bn support package for the country, which covers areas including healthcare, education and sanitation. More than a hundred days have passed since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but only now is the sobering size of the shock waves hitting nations and households thousands of miles away from that epicentre becoming clear. Developing nations were already struggling to get back on their feet. For every $20 households there typically earned pre-pandemic, they now only get $19. But soaring food and energy costs threaten to throw livelihoods further into reverse, spelling misery and hardship for the most vulnerable. And that's not just true for poorer countries. One survey shows one in six British households have turned to a food bank. That global struggle could be compounded by the higher interest rates being used to ease inflation, just as government support to ease the impact of the pandemic is evaporating. The World Bank is urging immediate action, from debt relief, to urging nations not to put restrictions on food exports. Instead they want policymakers to show they are acting together to safeguard food and energy supplies, reassure volatile markets, and ease price spikes,. Policymakers have already had to tackle an extraordinary battle. But if we down tools now the World Bank suggests we could face an even more prolonged and painful crisis. Hardship today doesn't just mean misery and social unrest, it can blight lives for years. The countries in Europe that are most likely to suffer a sharp drop in economic output in 2022 are Ukraine and Russia, the World Bank forecast. But it warned that the fallout from the war and the Covid pandemic would be wider. ""Even if a global recession is averted, the pain of stagflation could persist for several years - unless major supply increases are set in motion,"" Mr Malpass said. What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? Between 2021 and 2024, global growth is projected to slow by 2.7 percentage points, Mr Malpass said, more than twice the slow down seen between 1976 and 1979, when the world last saw stagflation. The report warned that interest rate increases needed to control inflation at the end of the 1970s were so steep that they touched off a global recession in 1982, and a string of financial crises in emerging market and developing economies. However, in the 1970s the dollar was weaker and oil was relatively more expensive. Speaking to the BBC, Ayhan Kose, director of the World Bank's Prospects Group said ""There is not much governments can easily do"" to tackle rising energy prices. ""They shouldn't introduce export bans, they shouldn't introduce subsidies, they shouldn't introduce price controls,"" Mr Kose said. ""Those type of interventions distort prices and they translate into even higher prices,"" he added.
