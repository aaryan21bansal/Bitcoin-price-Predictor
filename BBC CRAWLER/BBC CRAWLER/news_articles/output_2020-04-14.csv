As it happened: Trump says US will halt funding to WHOThe president accused the global health body of putting political correctness above saving lives.,"President Trump directed his administration to halt US funding to the World Health Organization Trump said US could reopen before 1 May, and in a change of tone accepted governors will make decision Confirmed cases in France passed 100,000, a day after the country extended its lockdown to 11 May Italy saw the smallest daily rise in new infections for more than a month, but its daily death toll remained high Worldwide, nearly 2 million people have been confirmed to have the virus UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said work is under way to get accurate daily data about deaths in UK care homes NHS England medical director says the number of people in hospital with the virus is âplateauingâ Edited by Jude Sheerin Doctors, nurses, surgeons and other NHS and healthcare workers have died with coronavirus. Here are their stories. After that White House briefing from the president, weâre pausing our live page coverage for the time being. If youâve been following our updates, thanks for joining us. To recap, here are some of the dayâs key developments:  Our teams in Asia will be back with you soon, bringing you all the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic from the US and across the world. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington At one level, Trump's move is about the coronavirus. Administration officials have been sharply accusing the WHO of missteps in the handling of the pandemic, saying it was biased towards China. They say the WHO was too ready to support Chinaâs deceptive early claims about the virus and then didnât push hard enough against Beijingâs attempts to cover up its misinformation. In particular President Trump has latched onto the WHOâs criticism of his travel restrictions against China. But at another level, this move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to curtail Chinaâs growing global influence, especially in international organisations. The Wall Street Journal reports that the decision stems from an ongoing discussion on whether to link US aid dollars to the number of Americans working in the groups that receive them. Trump ends the press conference after less than 90 minutes, cutting short one reporter who wanted to ask a second question on behalf of a colleague who could not attend today. ""Who cares,"" says the president with a shrug. No other members of the coronavirus task force, such as Vice-President Mike Pence, Dr Anthony Fauci or Dr Deborah Birx, spoke today. Trump is asked why he previously praised China's ""transparency"" but is today saying their ""so-called transparency"" cost lives. ""Well you know if Iâm so good to China then why am I the only person that closed our border so tightly to China?"" he hits back. ""I don't talk about China's transparency!"" he adds. In fact, on 24 January, whilst negotiating a trade deal, Trump tweeted: ""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency."" Furthermore, other countries have also tightened their borders, and banned non-essential travel, in response to the outbreak. This exchange with the reporter arose because, earlier in this press conference, Trump said he was pulling US funding to the WHO because the agency ""defended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising its so-called transparency"". Airports have been emptied amid the pandemic The US has agreed a roughly $25bn (Â£19.8bn) rescue package for 10 of the country's biggest airlines as travel plunges due to the coronavirus. American Airlines, United, Delta and Southwest are among the recipients. The money is to be provided through a combination of low-cost loans and direct grants. Congress had planned for the aid as part of its roughly $2.2tn emergency relief bill last month, but airlines had hesitated over some of the conditions. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said the airline deal would ""support American workers and help preserve the strategic importance of the airline industry while allowing for appropriate compensation to the taxpayers"". ""We look forward to working with the airlines to finalise the necessary agreements and disburse funds as quickly as possible."" The president says: âWe have to get our sports back. I'm tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old.â The National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, National Hockey League have all either cancelled or delayed their seasons amid the pandemic. A sign at the closed Banc of California stadium in LA tells people to stay home Trump has been feuding with governors over who has the right to end lockdowns. But in a change of tone on Tuesday, he said: ""The governors are responsible, they have to take charge and do a great job."" He said the plans to reopen the country are close to being finalised and could be even earlier than 1 May. ""I will be speaking to all 50 governors very shortly and I will then be authorising each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their state at a time and in a manner as most appropriate."" He added: ""The federal government will be watching them closely. We will hold governors accountable, but will be working with them to make sure it goes really well."" Experts agree it's the state governors who are responsible for policing their states under US law. He said that governors âare going to do a great job of leading."" âAnd if weâre unhappy with a state, weâre going to let them know that weâre unhappy,"" he added. Zoos that should have been crowded in the sunny Easter holidays are now hard up, asking for donations, as the coronavirus lockdown bites. A zoo director in northern Germany has even admitted that some animals might soon have to be fed to others. ""We've listed the animals we'll have to slaughter first,"" NeumÃ¼nster Zoo's Verena Kaspari told Die Welt newspaper. She said killing some animals so that others could live would be a last resort, but even that would not solve the financial problem. Read more on this story here. The panda twins in Berlin Zoo would draw big crowds in normal times ""Many countries said they were going to listen to the WHO and they have problems now the likes of which they cannot believe,"" Trump continues. He adds: ""The world received all sorts of false information about misinformation and mortality."" If the WHO had gone to China to oversee the outbreak, mores lives would have been saved, he claims, adding that ""their reliance on China's disclosures... likely caused a 20-fold increase in cases worldwide and it may be much more than that."" ""So much death has been caused by their mistakes,"" he says. The US president previously praised China's role in containing the virus in this tweet, sent a few days after the two countries signed a trade deal. Allow Twitter content?

Trump also accused the WHO of putting political correctness above saving lives and taking China's claims about the outbreak at face value. Mr Trump has accused the WHO of being biased towards China in recent weeks, and recently attacked the organisation for being too âChina-centricâ in its tackling of the coronavirus pandemic. US financial contributions to the WHO accounted for just under 15% of its funding in 2019. The US decided against using a coronavirus test approved by the WHOin January, in favour of a test being developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - but some of them did not work properly, and led to inconclusive results. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the first African head of the WHO, has beenaccused of being too cozy with China in the past. ""I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to access the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" says Trump. ""The WHO failed in its basic duty and it must be held accountable,"" he adds. The White House coronavirus task force briefing has begun. You canwatch it live here. It comes a day after President Trump pilloried the media, argued with reporters, and played in the briefing room a campaign-style video praising his handling of the pandemic. California governor Gavin Newsom has warned that mass gatherings of hundreds or thousands of people are likely to be banned until at least summer. He made the announcement during a news conference on Tuesday, where he also said that stay-at-home orders could be loosened âa few weeksâ after evidence shows the rate of coronavirus infections and deaths are decreasing. He warned that things would be changing in the state and some measures may stay in place for some time. âYou may have dinner where the waiter is wearing gloves and maybe a face mask, where menus may be disposable, where your temperature is checked as you walk into the restaurant,â he said. Mass gatherings in the state, such as Coachella festival, have already been rescheduled or cancelled. A group of high school pupils in Calgary, Canada, have created a hotline for elderly people stuck under lockdown to hear a young human voice. The free telephone line, 1-877-JOY-4ALL, offers recordings of stories, jokes, letters, poetry, music and words of encouragement. New recordings, including in other languages, are being added every day. ""During these challenging times and ongoing public health measures, we know that it is especially difficult for seniors and folks experiencing isolation,"" their website says.

Franceâs foreign minister has summoned the Chinese ambassador following comments made on the embassy's website about western countriesâ handling of Covid-19. The comments were made by an unnamed diplomat and in part suggested that pensioners had been left to die in nursing homes. Yves Le Drian said he expressed his disapproval to ambassador Lu Shaye on Tuesday. In a statement he said: âCertain publicly voiced opinions by representatives of the Chinese embassy in France are not in line with the quality of the bilateral relation between our two countries.â Angela was 34 weeks pregnant when she was put into a coma A US mother who was pregnant when she tested positive for Covid-19, has delivered her baby daughter while in a medically induced coma. Angela Primachenko, a 27-year-old respiratory therapist from Vancouver, Washington, was on a ventilator when doctors chose to induce labour in order to increase her odds of beating the illness and for the child's own safety. ""I feel like I'm a miracle walking,"" she told NBC News after tests showed that she was now Covid-negative. Primachenko was 33 weeks pregnant when she became ill on 24 March.

Trump also again touted the use of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug which is not yet proven to fight off Covid-19. ""You know if somebody else endorsed that medication it would be great,"" he said, claiming that US media has remained skeptical just because he has supported it. ""But it's OK. The word is out.

Oasis and Warehouse 'to fall into administration',"Women's fashion retailers Oasis and Warehouse are expected to appoint administrators soon, putting about 2,300 jobs at risk. The owner of the High Street brands, Icelandic bank Kaupthing, had been in talks to sell the businesses before the coronavirus crisis. However, the crisis, which has seen many shops temporarily close, has knocked the legs from under the sale. The fashion retailers are expected to appoint Deloitte as administrators. There is expected to be interest from bidders to buy the business, a source said, but with the current economic uncertainty, it is not clear how many jobs ultimately could be saved. As first reported by Sky News,external, after the administration begins, Deloitte is expected to furlough many of the employees who keep their jobs under the government Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. The chains were forced to shut their 90 UK stores because of the coronavirus lockdown. The group also has 437 concessions in department stores including Debenhams and Selfridges. High Street retailers in the UK were facing a tough environment before the crisis, due to rising costs and changes in people's shopping habits. But the temporary closure of many shops due to the coronavirus pandemic has heaped more pressure on retailers. Independent retail expert Clare Bailey said retailers had already been under strain for the last two or three years because of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its effect on consumer confidence. ""[Coronavirus] was the final straw of all the straws that broke the camel's already very broken back,"" she said. What does it mean to declare insolvency? Debenhams to file for administration Cath Kidston set to call in administrators Some retailers such as Primark have opted to cancel orders with their suppliers. Meanwhile fashion chain New Look recently informed its suppliers that payment for stock already sitting in its shops or distribution centre would be delayed ""indefinitely"". Last week department store chain Debenhams, which employs about 22,000 staff, confirmed it had entered administration for the second time in a year. Its 142 UK stores remain closed in line with Government guidance and the firm said it will work to 're-open and trade as many stores as possible' when restrictions end. At the same time floral fashion firm Cath Kidston filed for administration, putting 950 jobs at risk.

US to halt funding to WHO over coronavirus,"This video can not be played Trump said the WHO had ""failed in its basic duty"" US President Donald Trump has said he is going to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) because it has ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response to the coronavirus outbreak. He accused the UN agency of mismanaging and covering up the spread of the virus after it emerged in China, and said it must be held accountable. In response, the UN's chief said it was ""not the time"" to cut funds to the WHO. Mr Trump has been under fire for his own handling of the pandemic. He has sought to deflect persistent criticism that he acted too slowly to stop the virus's spread by pointing to his decision in late January to place restrictions on travel from China. He has accused the WHO of having ""criticised"" that decision and of being biased towards China more generally. Follow live coronavirus updates ""I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" Mr Trump told a news conference at the White House on Tuesday. The WHO has often praised China for its handling of the outbreak The US is the global health body's largest single funder and gave it more than $400m in 2019. A decision on whether the US resumes funding will be made after the review, which Mr Trump said would last 60 to 90 days. The WHO is yet to directly respond but UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said the international community should be uniting ""in solidarity to stop this virus"". ""It is my belief that the World Health Organization must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world's efforts to win the war against Covid-19,"" he said. Germany's foreign minister tweeted that strengthening the ""under-funded"" WHO was one of the best investments that could be made at this time. Founded in 1948 and based in Geneva, Switzerland, it is the UN agency responsible for global public health Has 194 member states, and aims to ""promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable"" Involved in vaccination campaigns, health emergencies and supporting countries in primary care Funded by a combination of members' fees based on wealth and population and voluntary contributions US provided 15% of its 2018-19 budget - with more than $400m China gave about $86m in 2018-19; UK gives most of any country apart from the US The WHO launched an appeal in March for $675m to help fight the coronavirus pandemic and is reported to be planning a fresh appeal for at least $1bn. Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder and philanthropist, said on Twitter: ""Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds.""

The US has by far the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths worldwide- with more than 600,000 cases and 26,000 deaths. Mr Trump accused the WHO of having failed to adequately assess the outbreak when it first emerged in the city of Wuhan. ""Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death,"" he told reporters. ""This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage. Instead, the WHO willingly took China's assurances to face value... and defended the actions of the Chinese government."" Chinese officials initially covered up the outbreak of the virus in Wuhan,and punished whistleblowers who tried to raise the alarm. Beijing later imposed draconian restrictions, including quarantine zones on an unprecedented scale, drawing effusive praise from the WHO and its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. WHO experts were only allowed to visit China and investigate the outbreak on 10 February, by which time the country had more than 40,000 cases. White House reporters pointed out, however, that Mr Trump himself praised China's response to the outbreak and downplayed the danger of the virus at home long after the WHO had declared a ""public health emergency of international concern"".

Democrats accused him of trying to shift blame away from himself in an election year, but many Republicans in Congress praised his decision to cut funding. It is not the first time the WHO's response to the outbreak has come under scrutiny. On 14 January,the organisation tweeted,externalthat preliminary Chinese investigations had found ""no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission"" of the new virus. Mr Trump and others have used the tweet to attack the WHO for simply believing China, despite evidence to the contrary. But about a week after that tweet, on 22 January,the agency released a public statement saying that human-to-human transmission did appear to be taking place in Wuhan.,external At the end of January, on the same day it declared a public health emergency, the WHO said that travel restrictions were not needed to stop the spread of Covid-19 -advice that was eventually ignored by most countries,external, including by the Trump administration the next day. The man leading the fight against the coronavirus In March, the UN agency was also accused of being unduly influenced by China aftera senior official refused to discuss Taiwan's responseto the outbreak. Meanwhile, some health experts also say thatthe WHO's guidance on face masks has led to public confusion,external. Other frequently-made criticisms of the WHO more generally are that it is constrained by politics and a sprawling bureaucracy. It came under particular fire for its response to the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and how long it took to declare a public health emergency,leading the organisation to announce reforms in response,external. At one level, this move is about the coronavirus. Administration officials have been sharply accusing the WHO of missteps in the handling of the pandemic, saying it was biased towards China. They say the WHO was too ready to support China's deceptive early claims about the virus and then didn't push hard enough against Beijing's attempts to cover up its misinformation. In particular President Trump has latched onto the WHO's criticism of his travel restrictions against China. But at another level, the move to defund the WHO is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to curtail China's growing global influence. The argument is that Chinese leadership in international organisations undermines the rules-based, accountable international system needed to prevent and fight a pandemic. But,the Wall Street Journal reports,externalthat the decision also stems from an ongoing discussion on whether to link US aid dollars to the number of Americans working in the groups that receive them.

Twenty suspected phone mast attacks over Easter,"The UK's mobile networks have reported a further 20 cases of phone masts being targeted in suspected arson attacks over the Easter weekend. Trade group Mobile UK said it had been notified of incidents in England, Wales and Scotland. One of the targeted sites provides mobile connectivity to a hospital in Birmingham. The figure represents a lower incidence rate than had been the case the previous weekend. Mobile UK added it had received no reports of staff being targeted over the period. Attacks on 5G masts pre-date the coronavirus pandemic. But there are concerns a surge in the amount of vandalism has been caused by conspiracy theories, which falsely claim the deployment of 5G networks has caused or helped accelerate the spread of Covid-19. ""Theories being spread about 5G are baseless and are not grounded in credible scientific theory,"" said a spokesman for Mobile UK. ""Mobile operators are dedicated to keeping the UK connected, and careless talk could cause untold damage. ""Continuing attacks on mobile infrastructure risk lives and, at this challenging time, the UK's critical sectors must be able to focus all their efforts on fighting this pandemic."" Vodafone said one of the masts attacked was used by patients and staff at a hospital in Birmingham The chief executive of Vodafone UK added that one of the targeted sites serves Birmingham's Nightingale hospital. ""It's heart-rending enough that families cannot be there at the bedside of loved ones who are critically ill,""wrote Nick Jeffrey on LinkedIn,external. ""It's even more upsetting that even the small solace of a phone or video call may now be denied them because of the selfish actions of a few deluded conspiracy theorists. ""Imagine if it were your mum or dad, your gran or grandad in hospital. Imagine not being able to see or hear them one last time. All because you've swallowed a dangerous lie."" The minister for digital infrastructure had earlier described such attacks as being ""irresponsible and idiotic"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mobile UK's announcement came hours after media regulator Ofcom said it was assessing comments made by ITV presenter Eamonn Holmes about 5G technology and coronavirus. On Monday, he had cast doubt on media reports which had explicitly refuted the myth that the two are linked. But this morning, he clarified his position saying: ""There is no connection between the present national health emergency and 5G, and to suggest otherwise would be wrong and indeed it could be dangerous."" Watchdog assesses Eamonn Holmes 5G comments YouTube tightens Covid-19 rules after Icke interview Scientists brand 5G claims 'complete rubbish' There have also been reports of potential cases since the Easter break. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of arson after a phone mast was on fire in Dagenham, Essex. The Met police told the Barking and Dagenham Post,external: ""Some evacuations were carried out as a precaution, but residents have since been allowed to return to their homes. There are no reports of any injuries."" Police in Huddersfield have also said they are trying to determine exactly how a phone mast came to be on fire in the early hours of this morning. The fire destroyed communications equipment used by the emergency services as well as three mobile phone network providers, the local fire service said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Recent attacks on telecoms infrastructure have not been limited to the UK. On Saturday,the newspaper De Telegraaf reported there had been four incidents in the Netherlands,externalover the previous week. It said in one case, arsonists had left an anti-5G slogan painted on the damaged equipment. There have also beenreports of a suspected case in Ireland,external, where two masts caught fire on Sunday. Network provider Eir said the affected infrastructure was not being used for 5G, but was being upgraded to boost 4G coverage for a nearby hospital and the surrounding area. Conspiracy theories linking 5G signals to the coronavirus pandemic continue to spread despite there being no evidence the mobile phone signals pose a health risk. Fact-checking charity Full Facthas linked the claims to two flawed theories,external. There have dozens of reported attacks on telecoms equipment over the past weeks One falsely suggests 5G suppresses the immune system, the other falsely claims the virus is somehow using the network's radio waves to communicate and pick victims, accelerating its spread. While 5G uses different radio frequencies to its predecessors, it's important to recognise that the waveband involved is still ""non-ionising"", meaning it lacks enough energy tobreak apart chemical bonds in the DNA in our cells to cause damage. Earlier this year, scientists at the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protectioncompleted a major study of related research into the topic. While it recommended slightly tighter limits on the transmitting capabilities of handsets themselves to minimise any chance of damage caused by human tissue being heated, its key finding was that there was no evidence that either 5G networks or earlier systems could cause cancer or other kinds of illness. The second theory appears to be based on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who suggested bacteria could generate radio waves. But this remains a controversial idea andwell outside mainstream scientific thought,external. In any case, Covid-19 is a virus rather than a bacteria. There's another major flaw with both these theories. Coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Japan and Iran that have yet to adopt the technology.

High Street retailers in the UK were facing a tough environment before the crisis, due to rising costs and changes in people's shopping habits. But the temporary closure of many shops due to the coronavirus pandemic has heaped more pressure on retailers. Independent retail expert Clare Bailey said retailers had already been under strain for the last two or three years because of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its effect on consumer confidence. ""[Coronavirus] was the final straw of all the straws that broke the camel's already very broken back,"" she said. What does it mean to declare insolvency? Debenhams to file for administration Cath Kidston set to call in administrators Some retailers such as Primark have opted to cancel orders with their suppliers. Meanwhile fashion chain New Look recently informed its suppliers that payment for stock already sitting in its shops or distribution centre would be delayed ""indefinitely"". Last week department store chain Debenhams, which employs about 22,000 staff, confirmed it had entered administration for the second time in a year. Its 142 UK stores remain closed in line with Government guidance and the firm said it will work to 're-open and trade as many stores as possible' when restrictions end. At the same time floral fashion firm Cath Kidston filed for administration, putting 950 jobs at risk.

Next website halts orders hours after reopening,"The Next website has had to stop taking orders after it reopened in a limited way following a three-week break. The retailer said demand exceeded capacity by about 08:30 BST and the site will be closed until Wednesday. The fashion retailer had stopped taking orders on 26 March and closed its High Street stores on 23 March, a day before the UK went into lockdown. But it reopened online on Tuesday after Next said it had strengthened social distancing measures at its warehouses. Initially, the site will only sell necessities such as children's clothes and selected small home items, although that could be extended in time. 'People do not buy a new outfit to stay at home' 'Not smart' memo shows Amazon's union stance Amazon workers strike over virus protection ""The idea is to begin selling in low volumes, so that we only need a small number of colleagues in each warehouse at any one time, helping to ensure rigorous social distancing is complied with,"" the firm said in a statement. ""To achieve these limited volumes, Next will only allow customers to order the number of items that it believes can be picked safely on any given day."" All ""non-essential"" shops have been told to close At that point, it said it would stop taking orders and convert the website to ""browse only"" until the following morning, which is what happened on Tuesday. Explaining Tuesday's surge, a spokesman said the firm had only asked people who wished to return to work to come in. About 3,000 staff have volunteered, but all will need to go through a safety training course meaning most will not be back at work for several weeks. Next usually employs 7,000 people across its eight distribution centres, which include a site at South Elmsall in West Yorkshire. ""As those numbers rise, then the amount of volume that the warehouses can cope with will rise and therefore the website will open for longer each day,"" the spokesman told the BBC. Next, which makes more than half of its sales online, has warned it faces a ""very significant drop in sales"" as a result of the effect of the coronavirus outbreak. Like other fashion retailers, it had been facing waning consumer demand before the crisis, but since all ""non-essential"" High Street shops were forced to shut, those problems have intensified. According to research from Retail Economics and Alvarez & Marsal, sales across the UK's fashion retail sector are thought to have plunged by 70% since the lockdown, forcing retailers including Primark and Next to pause or cancel orders. Most had just taken delivery of their latest spring and summer collections and now face a Â£15bn mountain of stock that cannot be sold, the research said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

However, on Monday it urged US workers who had lost jobs because of the coronavirus slowdown to apply for as many as 75,000 new positions it is offering. Last month, Amazon took on 100,000 extra US staff to fill priority online orders for food and medical equipment for existing customers. But it still has a waiting list for new customers.

"Two vaccine giants join forces to fight coronavirusEven if the vaccine is successful, it won't be ready until the second half of next year.Business","This video can not be played Virus vaccine research 'enormously accelerated' GSK and Sanofi, two of the world's biggest pharmaceutical giants, are joining forces to try and create a vaccine to stop the spread of Covid-19. The bad news is that the vaccine - even if it is successful - will not be ready till the second half of next year. GSK's chief executive Emma Walmsley told the BBC that vaccines usually take a decade to develop and test. A plan to make a vaccine available in just 18 months was a huge acceleration of the normal process, she said. GSK is also involved in a tie-up with the UK's other pharma giant AstraZeneca to help the government hit its target of conducting 100,000 tests by the end of April. Emma Walmsley said she hoped that the UK's two biggest pharmaceutical companies could help provide 30,000 daily tests by the beginning of May. A substantial contribution but leaving some way to go to hit the target. GSK also said it would channel any profits made from its vaccine programme into increased research and development into future virus threats. When asked whether it was appropriate for any company to profit from a global emergency Emma Walmsley promised that the company would not show any net profit from vaccine sales and along with future research investment, GSK would use any profits to subsidise vaccine deliveries to developing countries. Are we getting closer to a coronavirus vaccine or drug? Other groups have promised faster vaccine results. Sarah Gilbert, an Oxford University professor engaged in a separate search for a vaccine, said she was ""80 per cent confident"" her team's development would work by autumn. There are more than 20 vaccines currently in development. Among those under way at the moment are: The first human trial for a vaccine was announced last month by scientists at a lab in the US city of Seattle. They have taken the unusual step of skipping any animal research to test the vaccine's safety or effectiveness. Australian scientists have begun injecting ferrets with two potential vaccines. It is the first comprehensive pre-clinical trial to move to the animal testing stage, and the researchers say they hope to move to the human testing stage by the end of April.

LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area GSK boss Walmsley said she wished other companies and partnerships good luck in developing their own solutions.

'World faces worst decline since 1930s depression',"The global economy will contract by 3% this year as countries around the world shrink at the fastest pace in decades, the International Monetary Fund says. The IMF described the global decline as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. It said the pandemic had plunged the world into a ""crisis like no other"". The Fund added that a prolonged outbreak would test the ability of governments and central banks to control the crisis. Gita Gopinath, the IMF's chief economist, said the crisis could knock $9 trillion (Â£7.2 trillion) off global GDP over the next two years. While the Fund's latest World Economic Outlook praised the ""swift and sizeable"" response in countries like the UK, Germany, Japan and the US, it said no country would escape the downturn. It expects global growth to rebound to 5.8% next year if the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020. Ms Gopinath said today's ""Great Lockdown"" presented a ""grim reality"" for policymakers, who faced ""severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock"". ""A partial recovery is projected for 2021,"" said Ms Gopinath. ""But the level of GDP will remain below the pre-virus trend, with considerable uncertainty about the strength of the rebound. ""Much worse growth outcomes are possible and maybe even likely."" The IMF predicts the UK economy will shrink by 6.5% in 2020, compared with the IMF's January forecast for 1.4% GDP growth. A decline of this magnitude would be bigger than the 4.2% drop in output seen in the wake of the financial crisis. It would also represent the biggest annual fall since 1921, according to reconstructed Bank of England data dating back to the 18th century. However, this is half the annual rate expected by the OBR, which expects GDP to drop by 35% in the three months to June. The UK's furlough scheme, which isdesigned to keep workers in a jobamid the government lockdown, is expected to limit the rise in unemployment to 4.8% in 2020, from 3.8% last year. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged billions of pounds in wage subsidies and loan guarantees to help workers and businesses through the shutdown. TheBank of England has also slashed interest rates to a new lowand freed up billions of pounds for commercial banks to lend. Ms Gopinath said that for the first time since the Great Depression, both advanced and developing economies were expected to fall into recession. The IMF warned that growth in advanced economies would not get back to its pre-virus peak until at least 2022. The US economy is expected to contract by 5.9% this year, representing the biggest annual decline since 1946. Unemployment in the US is also expected to jump to 10.4% this year. A partial recovery is expected in 2021, with expected US growth of 4.7%. The Chinese economy is expected to expand by just 1.2% this year, which would be the slowest growth since 1976. Australia is expected to suffer its first recession since 1991. The IMF warned that there were ""severe risks of a worse outcome"". It said that if the pandemic took longer to control and there was a second wave in 2021, this would knock an additional 8 percentage points off global GDP. The Fund said this scenario could trigger a downward spiral in heavily-indebted economies. It said investors might be unwilling to lend to some of these nations, which would push up borrowing costs. The IMF added: ""This increase in sovereign borrowing costs or simply fear of it materialising, could prevent many countries from providing the income support assumed here."" While longer lockdowns will constrain economic activity, the IMF said quarantines and social distancing measures were vital. It said: ""Upfront containment measures are essential to slow the spread of the virus and allow health care systems to cope and to help pave the way for an earlier and more robust resumption of economic activity. ""Uncertainty and reduced demand for services could be even worse in a scenario of greater spread without social distancing"" The IMF set out four priorities for dealing with the pandemic. It called for more money for health care systems, financial support for workers and businesses, continued central bank support and a clear exit plan for the recovery. It urged the world to work together to find and distribute treatments and a vaccine. The Fund added that many developing nations would need debt relief in the coming months and years.

One in five deaths now linked to coronavirusCoronavirus prompts spike in mortality with data showing weekly deaths have hit a record high.,"More than one in five deaths in England and Wales is linked to coronavirus, figures show. The Office for National Statistics said in the week ending 3 April the virus was cited on 3,475 death certificates. It pushed the total number of deaths in that week to over 16,000 - a record high and 6,000 more than normal at this time of year when deaths tend to fall. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rushi Sunak acknowledged there were ""tough times"" ahead economically. It comes as the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK's tax and spending watchdog, warned the pandemiccould see the economy shrink by a record 35% by June. Mr Sunak told No 10's daily coronavirus briefing that it was ""clear"" the situation could be ""much worse"" without the action taken so far. Live page: Care homes 'not forgotten' Which regions have been worst hit by coronavirus? Families fear for loved ones in care homes But he admitted the government could not ""protect every business or household"" as it was clear coronavirus would have ""serious implications"". And he said the economy would bounce back, adding the ""single most important thing is to protect health of everyone"". The ONS report looked at the impact the numbers of people dying with coronavirus alongside all other deaths. Normally at this time of year deaths drop because there is less flu circulating than there is in winter. But instead it jumped up by to a record level of 16,000, the highest number seen since the ONS started publishing data in 2005, topping the biggest weekly toll during the 2015 flu outbreak. ONS official Nick Stripe said it was clear the coronavirus pandemic had reversed that trend, saying the rising number of deaths was ""hugely significant"". ""This is not normal,"" he added. But what is not clear is what else is contributing to this spike in deaths - the coronavirus cases contributed just over half of the ""extra"" 6,000 deaths. It could be that cases of coronavirus are going undetected or other factors related to the lockdown and outbreak are having an impact, such as people not seeking treatment for other conditions or mental health deaths going up. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in risk at the University of Cambridge, said this needed investigating. But he said he had ""never been as shocked"" as when he saw the scale of the increase in deaths. ""I was upset. It is incredibly vivid. These are people,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The ONS data lags behind the daily death figures reported by the government. This is because it relies on death certificates, which are only often registered some days after the death, whereas the government figures are compiled from confirmed cases of deaths of patients who have tested positive for coronavirus, which can be gathered more quickly. The government figures released on Tuesday revealed there had been another 778 deaths, bringing the total to 12,107 by 17:00 BST on Monday. Another 5,252 people have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases to nearly 94,000 by 09:00 BST on Tuesday. Edna Summerfield, 94, died earlier this month after testing positive for coronavirus. Her family believes she contracted it at her care home in Birmingham before she went into hospital on 7 April. Her daughter-in-law Sylvia Summerfield said she feels people in care homes are being neglected - and called for PPE for care home staff as a matter of urgency. ""How many more elderly have got to die in care homes, infected by staff who don't know they have the virus?"" she said. ""It is a very difficult time for us and I feel like people in care homes are being neglected. ""My mother in law didn't deserve the death she had. All the other residents are vulnerable in that care home now."" The fact the government figures rely on deaths where a patient has tested positive - and in England and Northern Ireland this only covers hospital patients - has led to suggestions there has been an under-reporting of deaths in care homes and other community settings. The ONS data does look at deaths elsewhere and shows that one in 10 coronavirus deaths this year have been in the community - half, just over 200, have been in care homes. But care sector leaders are warning the true toll in care homes is much greater. Age UK says the virus is ""running wild"" in care homes with Care England, the umbrella body for care homes, estimating there have been nearly 1,000 deaths. Elderly being 'airbrushed' out of virus figures If the reports are right it could be that there has been a spike in deaths over the past fortnight or that death certificates are not picking up all the cases. The government confirmed there had been coronavirus outbreaks at more than 2,000 care homes in England - although they did not specify the number of deaths that had occurred. This video can not be played ""The carers knew the little things about mum that were important to her"" says Karin Pointon Industry leaders from Age UK, Marie Curie, Care England, Independent Age and the Alzheimer's Society called for a daily update on the situation. ""The current figures are airbrushing older people out like they don't matter,"" Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said. About 410,000 people live in care homes in the UK, living in 11,300 care homes for older people supplied by 5,500 different providers. Mr Sunak told Tuesday's briefing that care home residents and workers had ""absolutely not been forgotten"". Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle added that health bodies were aiming to have figures on coronavirus-related deaths in care homes published daily. ""In these very dispersed systems we just need to be absolutely clear that the cause of death that is attributed is correct, and that is what takes time on the death certificate to get right,"" she said.

Nurse 'paid ultimate price' for lack of PPE,"This video can not be played Gareth Roberts died in hospital in the early hours of Saturday A nurse who died after contracting coronavirus ""paid the ultimate price"" due to a lack of personal protective equipment, a friend has claimed. Gareth Roberts, 65, worked as a nurse across the Cardiff and Vale health board area for more than 40 years. The husband, father and grandfather died in hospital in Merthyr Tydfil in the early hours of Saturday morning. His friend said he had little to no protection from the virus which the health board said it would investigate. ""He didn't have PPE. In the beginning he said he didn't have anything,"" his childhood friend Janette Leonard said. ""He had a paper mask, plastic gloves and a pinny, that's alright if you are making sandwiches but not when you are going to nurse people with the disease."" Mr Roberts' wife Linda was told to attend his bedside in the early hours of Saturday when it became clear he would pass away Mr Roberts had devoted his life to caring for people, working as a nurse since the 1980s and coming out of retirement in January 2015. Over the last few weeks, as concerns about the virus escalated, he had been working extra shifts to help cover the wards at Llandough Hospital near Penarth. But he became ill himself with Covid-19, and gradually his condition deteriorated.

Jeanette Leonard, a friend of Mr Roberts since childhood, says his sense of humour would ""make you weak"" Mr Roberts loved his job but he was also a husband to Linda, a father to Ceri and Dean and a grandfather to 16-year-old Zac, who he and Linda had brought up after their son Dean passed away 11 years ago. Ms Leonard said his sense of humour was so dry, and ""you couldn't not love him"". ""He'd come out with things and you'd be weak,"" she said. ""Cariad [Welsh for love] was his favourite word. The nursing sister in the ward was saying to me she'll miss him saying 'come on cariad, we can do this together'. ""That's how he was - a proper genuine, lovely guy."" Cardiff and Vale University Health Board (UHB) haspaid tribute to Mr Robertsand said it would investigate the claims over a lack of PPE. Gareth Roberts devoted 40 years of his life to caring for people as a nurse Ruth Walker, the health board's executive nurse director at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: ""We are aware of the concerns raised by some staff in the media regarding the availability and or inaccessibility of PPE. ""As a result of the inferences made we are taking a more detailed look into the availability of PPE at UHL and we regularly check our systems to ensure that we get stock to the right place at the right time. ""As a health board, we have enough PPE equipment available and in stock, providing the right level of PPE is used in the right circumstances to meet the national guidance as well as the high standards we have set ourselves. ""If a colleague has not found this to be the case and they have encountered either a shortage or a perceived shortage we would encourage them to raise it immediately."" The Welsh Government said it was working hard to make sure all front-line NHS and social care staff had the protection and support they needed to undertake their roles ""So far, we've distributed more than 10.4 million items of PPE from our pandemic stocks, over and above our usual supply,"" a spokesman said.

Jeanette Leonard, a friend of Mr Roberts since childhood, says his sense of humour would ""make you weak"" Mr Roberts loved his job but he was also a husband to Linda, a father to Ceri and Dean and a grandfather to 16-year-old Zac, who he and Linda had brought up after their son Dean passed away 11 years ago. Ms Leonard said his sense of humour was so dry, and ""you couldn't not love him"". ""He'd come out with things and you'd be weak,"" she said. ""Cariad [Welsh for love] was his favourite word. The nursing sister in the ward was saying to me she'll miss him saying 'come on cariad, we can do this together'. ""That's how he was - a proper genuine, lovely guy."" Cardiff and Vale University Health Board (UHB) haspaid tribute to Mr Robertsand said it would investigate the claims over a lack of PPE. Gareth Roberts devoted 40 years of his life to caring for people as a nurse Ruth Walker, the health board's executive nurse director at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: ""We are aware of the concerns raised by some staff in the media regarding the availability and or inaccessibility of PPE. ""As a result of the inferences made we are taking a more detailed look into the availability of PPE at UHL and we regularly check our systems to ensure that we get stock to the right place at the right time. ""As a health board, we have enough PPE equipment available and in stock, providing the right level of PPE is used in the right circumstances to meet the national guidance as well as the high standards we have set ourselves. ""If a colleague has not found this to be the case and they have encountered either a shortage or a perceived shortage we would encourage them to raise it immediately."" The Welsh Government said it was working hard to make sure all front-line NHS and social care staff had the protection and support they needed to undertake their roles ""So far, we've distributed more than 10.4 million items of PPE from our pandemic stocks, over and above our usual supply,"" a spokesman said. Ms Leonard has now set up a fundraising page to help Mr Roberts' family with funeral costs, which raised Â£2,700 in less than a day.

One in nine homeowners takes mortgage holidayLenders have agreed that 1.2 million people can delay repayments as jobs are cut and wages reduced.,"Lots of people are finding it difficult to meet the demands of their mortgage One in nine mortgage holders in the UK has taken a so-called ""payment holiday"" as their finances have been hit by the effects of coronavirus. Lenders have agreed that 1.2 million homeowners can delay repayments as jobs are cut and wages reduced. Typically, this defers a mortgage bill of Â£775 a month, with borrowers given the option of delaying up to three months of repayments. More are likely to take up the option, which should not affect credit ratings. Many frustrated mortgage holders have struggled to get through to their lender as phone lines have been so busy, leaving banks - who face their own staffing pressures - to prioritise the most vulnerable. UK Finance, which represents banks and which compiled the figures, said payment holidays were best organised, if possible, by filling in a form provided online by most lenders. Banks and building societies have offered up to three months of mortgage repayment deferrals for those struggling financially. This does not mean these bills are being cancelled, as they will still need to be paid at a later date. For the typical capital and interest repayment mortgage, about Â£775 is being deferred each month. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The number of deferrals in place more than tripled in the two weeks between 25 March and 8 April, growing from 392,130 to 1.24 million. This is an increase of nearly 850,000, or an average of around 61,000 payment holidays being granted by lenders per day. Were they all to take a three-month break, a total of about Â£2.6bn would have been deferred. The total would have risen since then, and is likely to increase further. ""Payment holidays aren't always the right solution for everyone. We would therefore encourage any mortgage customers concerned about their financial situation to check with their lender so they can find out more information on the support available and how to apply,"" said Stephen Jones, UK Finance chief executive. He stressed that people should not simply cancel their direct debit without talking to their lender as this could lead to charges and could affect their chances of borrowing in the future. Robin Fieth, chief executive of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said: ""We know that this is a difficult time for many homeowners with a mortgage, and building society staff have been working hard to offer individuals the right solution."" Some mortgages that track the Bank of England's interest rates have been getting cheaper after policymakerscut the base rate to its lowest-ever levelin response to the coronavirus outbreak. However, most homeowners are on fixed-rate deals and so would have seen no reduction in their current monthly mortgage bill. With incomes having been hit, this has put strain on household finances. Some mortgage lenders, meanwhile, have been pulling out of offering new deals to people who cannot offer a large deposit,as much of the UK mortgage and housing market goes into lockdown itself. That has ruled out first-time borrowers or existing homeowners with little equity in their home looking for a new deal.

Further delays to children's food vouchersThe website issuing the vouchers has been upgraded - but schools still struggle to log on.,"The voucher scheme was set up in response to fears that children on free school meals might go hungry Many families of children eligible for free school meals are having to wait up to a week for supermarket vouchers, despite an upgrade to the website responsible for delivering them. Under a government scheme, families in need in England should receive vouchers worth Â£15 a week per child. The Edenred website that runs the scheme was rebuilt over the weekend, the Department for Education says. But some schools say they are still struggling to log on. On Tuesday, Danny Sohal, business and resources manager at Chiswick School, in west London, said vouchers the school had ordered on 7 April had finally been approved - although not yet emailed to parents. But its 8 April orders had still not been processed. Attempts to log on to the platform were still being met with error messages. And telephone queuing times were over an hour. When his call had finally been answered, Mr Sohal had been told the error messages were being sent to try to limit traffic to the site and allow Edenred to work through the backlog, which, he added, could be up to 16 million vouchers. The Department for Education said the site had been taken down on Thursday for an upgrade to boost capacity in the face of massive demand. But orders made prior to that should be processed on Tuesday. In a statement, the DfE added: ""We know that the free school meal voucher system is delivering for thousands of schools. ""We continue to work closely with our supplier Edenred to resolve any outstanding issues quickly."" To avoid swamping its system Edenred has advised schools to use the same order codes to bulk-buy vouchers, for example, for all children in the same household over several weeks. Free school meal scheme to continue over holidays Food vouchers for free school meals children Last week, ministers announced the scheme would run throughout the Easter holidays. About 1.3 million children in England are entitled to free school meals and, until the scheme was announced, schools had been making their own arrangements. Schools across the UK were closed last month to all pupils except the children of key workers such as doctors, nurses and delivery drivers, some vulnerable children and those with more serious special educational needs.

World's largest postal service turns lifesaver,"India has the largest postal service in the world India has the largest postal service in the world - and now it is stepping in to help deliver lifesaving medicines during a countrywide lockdown aimed at tackling the coronavirus pandemic. The BBC's Ayeshea Perera in Delhi reports. Red postal vans are a familiar sight in India. They make thousands of journeys every day, criss-crossing the country's wide network of post offices in 600,000 villages. The postal service does much more than deliver letters and packages. It is also a bank, a pension fund and a primary savings instrument for millions of Indians. Now it will also be transporting medical equipment and drugs to where they are needed most, at a time when transport has come to a standstill. When India went into total lockdown on 24 March in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus, all businesses - apart from essential services - were ordered to shut and people were told to stay home. Given that the announcement was made barely four hours ahead of the lockdown going into effect, many industries were left in the lurch - including hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and labs at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19. Medical institutes and pharmaceutical companies were caught out by the sudden lockdown ""We were facing a lot of difficulties. We usually rely on courier services to send out products to customers, but none of them were responding, probably because they didn't have curfew passes or delivery people,"" Ashok Kumar Madan, the executive director of the Indian Drug Manufacturer's Association (IDMA), told the BBC. Many of these products, he added, were essential medicines such as for heart conditions or cancer. Then, he got a call from Alok Ojha, the senior superintendent of the postal service in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. How Indiaâs railways are joining the Covid-19 fight Why India cannot afford to lift its lockdown Why next few weeks are critical in India virus war The postal service had already partnered with the IDMA in the western state of Gujarat to deliver medicines and equipment as a priority. Mr Ojha was offering to do the same on a much wider scale. ""We were definitely looking for a solution, and the postal service has unhindered access the country,"" Mr Madan said. That is because India Post is among only a few industries deemed ""essential services"" and allowed to operate normally during the lockdown. A number of institutions have used the postal service since the lockdown began ""We thought we could help with this as we have a supply chain that is intact. Many people I spoke to said this would help as it helps keep drugs in the market and prevents hoarding,"" Mr Ojha told the BBC. As word spread, many people began calling and asking for help. Dr Ujjala Ghoshal, a microbiologist at the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences in the northern city of Lucknow, told the BBC she got in touch with Mr Ojha when a batch of Covid-19 testing kits she urgently needed was stuck in the capital Delhi, 550km (340 miles) away. ""The Institute of Medical Research told us that we would have to send someone to Delhi to collect the kits because the courier company they usually used was not working, but there was no way we could do it because of the lockdown,"" she said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health The postal service, she said, made an exception and actually went to the institute to pick up the kits, instead of having them dropped off at a post office. She received them a day after she made the request. Many other institutions and companies have made similar requests. Mr Ojha says ever since the lockdown began, the postal service has been used to deliver everything from batches of lifesaving drugs to Covid-19 tests, to N95 masks and ventilators, moving medicine and equipment between major cities and states - mostly via the red postal vans. India's red postal vans make tens of thousands of journeys every day For longer or very urgent journeys - such as a consignment of defibrillators that had to be transported from the state of Tamil Nadu in the south to Uttar Pradesh in the north - cargo planes are used. Sometimes, the consignments must be handled with special care - one drug manufacturer who asked for help said his medicines needed cold chain maintenance, which means they need to be frozen while transported. And so far, every request made to the department has been fulfilled. ""We are the best-connected service in India. We are everywhere. And in this case, we knew we could help,"" Mr Ojha says. And with the lockdown set to be extended, he anticipates that the service will play a larger role in the weeks ahead.

How to cope with living alone in isolation,"After years of living with others, Lucia was excited to finally have a place to herself. The photographer had recently moved back to Italy from New York. She enjoyed spending time on long, meandering walks with her camera, and going out for food with friends. But within a couple of months Milan, where she lived, had become the epicentre of Europe's coronavirus outbreak. She and millions of other Italians were ordered into lockdown, told to stay home unless absolutely necessary. The first few weeks were the hardest, as the monotony of days isolated in her apartment took its toll. But now more than a month on, Lucia is adjusting to being alone. She still misses her freedom and physical contact with others, but feels fortunate that she and her loved ones are healthy, when so many across her country have died. ""Sometimes I get worried about the future, about how life will be after this ends,"" she says. ""I wonder if there will ever be a real life outside our homes."" Missing street photography, Lucia has been documenting her own time inside instead Almost 4,000 miles away, the only human faces Aparna sees now belong to security guards. The 26-year-old lives alone in her mother's old apartment in Gurgaon, near Delhi. Twice a day she leaves to walk her dogs, Jules and Yogi, as the guards keep watch over her complex's locked gates. Aparna has only ventured beyond them once. A national lockdown was announced in India on 24 March ""My hands are dry, the surroundings are quiet and the dogs are oblivious,"" Aparna (pictured) says of her situation There are millions more stories like this around the world. As governments scramble to contain the deadly Covid-19 pandemic by restricting public life, many living alone have had to accept that they might not spend time with anyone else for a long time. I know because I'm among them. Weeks into the UK lockdown, my ordinary life in London goes on but it looks and feels different. Trips to the office have become a rarity. I feel lucky to have a cat for company and the ability to go outside for walks when others can't, but it's hard not knowing when I'll next see my close friends or family, who live hundreds of miles away. Wuhan diary: Living alone in a city gone quiet Tips for building better relationships remotely What are social distancing and self-isolation rules? These days the same screens that host our work meetings carry the burden of our social lives too. With the exception of conversations over the telecom or chance encounters with neighbours by the bins, all of my human contact is now online. Daily screen-time gone up during isolation? You're not alone With so many other people across the world living by themselves through this strange experience, I decided to try to find expert advice and others self-isolating alone. That's how I found Lucia, Aparna and Angie: three women continents apart, going through the same. Angie, from Maine, has lived by herself for four years. Getting her own space became an important part of her growth and healing after a divorce. But as the US became gripped by coronavirus and local restrictions hit, the downfalls of her living situation became apparent. A couple of weeks ago, when Angie was laid-off from work, she was left to deal with it alone. ""In normal circumstances, if you were to lose your job, you'd be met with a hug by a family member or invited over by a friend for cheering up,"" she says. Coronavirus: How to protect your mental health Love and dating in lockdown There is plenty of research to suggest our social relationships can be as important to our physical health as our mental one. Research links pervasive loneliness to higher mortality rates and other health complications. This video can not be played How loneliness can affect your physical and mental health Professor Naomi Eisenberger is a social psychologist at UCLA known for her research on how the brain behaves when it experiences social rejection and disconnect. She says our current situation, with billions of people cut-off from their normal lives, is unprecedented. She stresses the importance of people living alone trying to stay connected with those we care about. ""One of the things I've heard from people is that it's interesting that now you start realising who you actually feel close to, because it doesn't matter who lives near you or who is easy to get to,"" she says. Her research group is also looking into whether the virtual communication we are all currently filling our schedules with is enough to feel truly connected. Dr Eisenberger says having a pet, especially one you can touch and hug, can help reduce stress Professor Stephanie Cacioppo, an expert in behavioural neuroscience and psychiatry at the University of Chicago, is also full of practical tips for those living alone. She and her late husband were known for their pioneering research that draws a distinction between being alone and feeling lonely. She says adjusting our mindset and expectations is key to avoiding feelings of loneliness. This means accepting events are beyond our control and knowing that being away from the people and things we love is only temporary. ""Right now you live alone. And right now you have no choice. So you can either scream all day long or make the most of it,"" Dr Cacioppo says. For Angie, this has meant reconnecting with her art. She's started posting daily illustrations - which we have used throughout this feature - as a way to share her emotions and perspective on living alone through the pandemic. Angie says her art is the ""main thing keeping her going"" Her nameless, faceless character is seen living out quiet and relatable personal moments. ""When I start to feel alone, I imagine other people like me, feeling the same emotions or doing the same things in that very moment all around the world,"" she says. ""It helps me feel grounded and connected."" Another practical task to try and stay grounded, Dr Cacioppo suggests, is keeping a journal of your emotions during isolation: making note of the things that make you feel happy or accomplished throughout the day. ""People have done studies showing that self-compassion or a gratitude towards others, but also towards yourself, can really improve the well-being and happiness level,"" she says. These acts of kindness don't need to be time-consuming or expensive, she explains. ""Everyone has their own things that are really good for self-care."" Dr Cacioppo urges anyone living along to ""learn how to become your own best friend"" Both experts I spoke to stressed the importance of building routine into our days in self-isolation, explaining that regular social contact can help regulate us in all kinds of ways, down to our sleeping and eating patterns. Dr Cacioppo advises people to plan life only in the short-term, even one or two days ahead. ""We have all lost control of our reality. We had schedules, we had activities planned,"" she says. ""We could just see the schedule of next week and we knew exactly what we would do and now it's a little bit different."" Trying to set three manageable goals per day, she suggests, can help instil a feeling of accomplishment. ""Then you can go to bed more peaceful because you know that you have a structure and something to do - a purpose - for tomorrow,"" Dr Cacioppo says. This importance of feeling a part of something larger is something that comes up time and time again. In California, another woman has created an online movement achieving just that. On 30 March writer Olivia Gatwood posted a photograph of herself on Instagram captioned: ""Self-portrait of a lady in quarantine."" Soon dozens, then hundreds, of other women around the world sent her their own. Olivia's original black-and-white photograph (top left) has inspired hundreds of other women to take their own Gatwood has now decided to curate an Instagram account featuring these images,Girls of Isolation,external, connecting women across the globe within this strange, shared but disparate reality we now are living. Aparna was one of those who submitted a self-portrait. The lockdown prompted her to pick up her camera for the first time in more than a year and she has been documenting her life under the pandemic since. When asked what advice she would give others, she had a simple message: ""Listen to yourself and be kind to yourself, you can finally take the time to do nothing/everything/anything without guilt or compromise."" ""It's definitely a crazy time when the real world feels more like a film script,"" Aparna says Dr Cacioppo says one positive that may come from the unrelenting tragedy of the outbreak is that, as nations and as people, we could end up feeling more connected than ever before. It's a sentiment Aparna agrees with. ""This situation reminds us how vulnerable we are and more importantly how equally vulnerable,"" she says. ""It's become easier than ever before to relate to other human beings across the world and that's something both essential and beautiful to recognise, even in trying times such as these.""

Twenty suspected phone mast attacks over EasterIndustry body says conspiracy theories linking 5G to the pandemic are baseless and risking lives.TechnologyComments,"The UK's mobile networks have reported a further 20 cases of phone masts being targeted in suspected arson attacks over the Easter weekend. Trade group Mobile UK said it had been notified of incidents in England, Wales and Scotland. One of the targeted sites provides mobile connectivity to a hospital in Birmingham. The figure represents a lower incidence rate than had been the case the previous weekend. Mobile UK added it had received no reports of staff being targeted over the period. Attacks on 5G masts pre-date the coronavirus pandemic. But there are concerns a surge in the amount of vandalism has been caused by conspiracy theories, which falsely claim the deployment of 5G networks has caused or helped accelerate the spread of Covid-19. ""Theories being spread about 5G are baseless and are not grounded in credible scientific theory,"" said a spokesman for Mobile UK. ""Mobile operators are dedicated to keeping the UK connected, and careless talk could cause untold damage. ""Continuing attacks on mobile infrastructure risk lives and, at this challenging time, the UK's critical sectors must be able to focus all their efforts on fighting this pandemic."" Vodafone said one of the masts attacked was used by patients and staff at a hospital in Birmingham The chief executive of Vodafone UK added that one of the targeted sites serves Birmingham's Nightingale hospital. ""It's heart-rending enough that families cannot be there at the bedside of loved ones who are critically ill,""wrote Nick Jeffrey on LinkedIn,external. ""It's even more upsetting that even the small solace of a phone or video call may now be denied them because of the selfish actions of a few deluded conspiracy theorists. ""Imagine if it were your mum or dad, your gran or grandad in hospital. Imagine not being able to see or hear them one last time. All because you've swallowed a dangerous lie."" The minister for digital infrastructure had earlier described such attacks as being ""irresponsible and idiotic"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mobile UK's announcement came hours after media regulator Ofcom said it was assessing comments made by ITV presenter Eamonn Holmes about 5G technology and coronavirus. On Monday, he had cast doubt on media reports which had explicitly refuted the myth that the two are linked. But this morning, he clarified his position saying: ""There is no connection between the present national health emergency and 5G, and to suggest otherwise would be wrong and indeed it could be dangerous."" Watchdog assesses Eamonn Holmes 5G comments YouTube tightens Covid-19 rules after Icke interview Scientists brand 5G claims 'complete rubbish' There have also been reports of potential cases since the Easter break. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of arson after a phone mast was on fire in Dagenham, Essex. The Met police told the Barking and Dagenham Post,external: ""Some evacuations were carried out as a precaution, but residents have since been allowed to return to their homes. There are no reports of any injuries."" Police in Huddersfield have also said they are trying to determine exactly how a phone mast came to be on fire in the early hours of this morning. The fire destroyed communications equipment used by the emergency services as well as three mobile phone network providers, the local fire service said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Recent attacks on telecoms infrastructure have not been limited to the UK. On Saturday,the newspaper De Telegraaf reported there had been four incidents in the Netherlands,externalover the previous week. It said in one case, arsonists had left an anti-5G slogan painted on the damaged equipment. There have also beenreports of a suspected case in Ireland,external, where two masts caught fire on Sunday. Network provider Eir said the affected infrastructure was not being used for 5G, but was being upgraded to boost 4G coverage for a nearby hospital and the surrounding area. Conspiracy theories linking 5G signals to the coronavirus pandemic continue to spread despite there being no evidence the mobile phone signals pose a health risk. Fact-checking charity Full Facthas linked the claims to two flawed theories,external. There have dozens of reported attacks on telecoms equipment over the past weeks One falsely suggests 5G suppresses the immune system, the other falsely claims the virus is somehow using the network's radio waves to communicate and pick victims, accelerating its spread. While 5G uses different radio frequencies to its predecessors, it's important to recognise that the waveband involved is still ""non-ionising"", meaning it lacks enough energy tobreak apart chemical bonds in the DNA in our cells to cause damage. Earlier this year, scientists at the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protectioncompleted a major study of related research into the topic. While it recommended slightly tighter limits on the transmitting capabilities of handsets themselves to minimise any chance of damage caused by human tissue being heated, its key finding was that there was no evidence that either 5G networks or earlier systems could cause cancer or other kinds of illness. The second theory appears to be based on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who suggested bacteria could generate radio waves. But this remains a controversial idea andwell outside mainstream scientific thought,external. In any case, Covid-19 is a virus rather than a bacteria. There's another major flaw with both these theories. Coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Japan and Iran that have yet to adopt the technology.

Elderly being 'airbrushed' out of virus figures,"This video can not be played Baroness Altman says the health system is ""staked against"" care homes Many older people are being ""airbrushed"" out of coronavirus figures in the UK, charities have warned. The official death toll has been criticised for only covering people who die in hospital - but not those in care homes or in their own houses. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told the BBC the daily figure was based on hospital deaths because ""it's accurate and quick"". Meanwhile, scientists will begin a review of the UK lockdown later. The evaluation will be passed to the government - butministers have said it was unlikely restrictions would change. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, which include every community death linked to Covid-19 in England and Wales, showed a total of 406 such deaths registered up to 3 April had occurred outside of hospitals. That would have added an extra 11% to the official UK figures, based solely on deaths in hospitals, that were being reported at that time. Of those extra deaths, 217 took place in care homes, 33 in hospices, 136 in private homes, three in other communal establishments and 17 elsewhere. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has said details about the number of coronavirus-related deaths in care homesremain unclear, but it was reported last week that there were cases of Covid-19in 20 care homes across the nation. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Industry leaders from Age UK, Marie Curie, Care England, Independent Age and the Alzheimer's Society have written to Health Secretary Matt Hancockdemanding a care package to support social care through the pandemic,external. They have also called for a daily update on deaths in the care system. It comes after the government confirmed there had been coronavirus outbreaks at more than 2,000 care homes in England - although they did not specify the number of deaths that had occurred. The figures prompted the charity Age UK to claim coronavirus is ""running wild"" in care homes for elderly people. ""The current figures are airbrushing older people out like they don't matter,"" Caroline Abrahams, the charity's director, said. Meanwhile, Britain's largest care home operator, HC-One, said coronavirus was present in two-thirds - 232 - of the group's care homes. Its director, Sir David Behan, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that coronavirus deaths represented about one-third of all deaths at HC-One's care homes over the last three weeks. HC-One has 329 care homes throughout England, Scotland and Wales. MHA, a charity which operates 131 homes, said there had been 210 coronavirus-related deaths. About 410,000 people,externallive in care homes in the UK, living in 11,300 care homes for older people supplied by 5,500 different providers. Addressing why deaths in care homes are not being included in the government's data, Ms Coffey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the figures published weekly by the ONS is a ""fair"" way of establishing the ""unfortunate picture"" of where deaths are occurring. England's care home regulator, the Care Quality Commission, has said it will begin recording deaths in adult social care from this week - asking care providers to give daily updates on the number of confirmed and suspected cases. Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall said daily figures were essential to dealing with the ""emerging crisis"" in care homes and called for the government to offer social care ""whatever resources it needs"". Nurse 'paid ultimate price' for lack of PPE Coronavirus: 'John was alone for a week' Will face masks become the new norm? Conservative peer and former work and pensions minister Baroness Altmann told Today that ""one or two"" people in care homes had said to her they felt as though older people are being treated ""like lambs to the slaughter"". ""They [care homes] are left without protective equipment, they are left without testing,"" she said. She added that ""the mark of a civilised society"" was ""how it treats it most vulnerable and oldest citizens"". It comes after Ms Abrahams said care homes were ""underprepared"" for the outbreak, adding that the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing was leading to the spread of coronavirus across the care home sector. However, Ms Coffey told the Today programme that the care sector was not being left behind, adding that PPE was being delivered ""to over 26,000 care settings across the country including care homes, home care providers and also hospices"". On Monday, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty told the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing that 92 homes in the UK reported outbreaks in one day. The Department of Health and Social Care later confirmed 2,099 care homes in England have so far had cases of the virus. Care England has estimated there have been nearly 1,000 deaths from coronavirus in care homes, leaving social care as ""the neglected front line"". The Labour Party has called on the government to publish daily figures of deaths in care homes to highlight the ""true scale"" of the spread of the virus, which causes the Covid-19 disease. The issue has regularly been raised by journalists at the daily Downing Street briefing and the government response has been that the number announced each day is based on hospital figures as this can be quickly gathered and analysed - whereas deaths in the wider community take much longer to be collated after death certificates are issued by doctors. The government says it is following the international standard by quoting the hospital figures each day - and that the fuller ONS figures can lag many days behind. The latest care homes to confirm residents have died with symptoms of the virus includea home in Drumchapel, Glasgow, a specialistdementia home in Selston, Nottinghamshire, and a home in County Durham where13 residents have died. The Department of Health's official death number of deaths of people in hospital with coronavirus rose to 11,329 on Monday - up by 717 in a day. The BBC's science editor David Shukman said the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) meeting later in the day will evaluate various ways coronavirus is unfolding in the UK. It will look at hospital admissions, the approach to testing, data on intensive care capacity and deaths, the effectiveness of lockdown tactics, and whether or not the public should be advised to wear face masks outdoors. Meanwhile, the government has defended itself after reports it missed three chances to bulk-buy PPE for healthcare workers treating virus patients. Health workers in 25 EU countries are set to receive deliveries of kit worth Â£1.3bn in the coming days, according to the Guardian. The paper reports the UK missed three opportunities,externalto join the scheme and has not taken part in talks on future purchases. The Department of Health said it would ""consider participating in future EU joint procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time"". ""We will continue to work with European countries and others in order to make sure that we can increase the capacity within the NHS,"" they said.

UK economy 'could shrink by record 35%' by June,"This video can not be played Chancellor: Coronavirus will have ""very significant impact"" on economy A forecast by the UK's tax and spending watchdog suggests the coronavirus crisis will have ""serious implications"" for the UK economy, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned the pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record 35% by June. Mr Sunak stressed that the forecast was only one possible scenario. But he said it was important that the government was ""honest with people about what may be happening"". He said the OBR figures suggest that the scale of what the UK is facing ""will have serious implications for our economy"", in common with other countries. ""These are tough times, and there will be more to come,"" Mr Sunak said. However, he said that while the government could not protect every business and household, ""we came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses."" The OBR also expects the economic impact of the crisis to be temporary, he said. He added that the government is ""not just going to stand by"" and not act to support the economy. ""Our planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities, and households,"" he said. ""Our plan is the right plan."" Mr Sunak added that at the moment ""the single most important thing we can do to protect the economy is to protect the health of our people."" The OBR said a three-month lockdown followed by three months of partial restrictions would trigger an economic decline of 35.1% in the quarter to June alone, following growth of 0.2% in the first three months of this year. Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, said a drop of this magnitude would be the largest ""in living memory"". While the UK economy would contract by 12.8% this year under this scenario, it is expected to get back to its pre-crisis growth trend by the end of 2020. The OBR stressed the actual amount of growth would depend on how long the lockdown lasted, as well as how quickly activity bounced back once restrictions were relaxed. In any case, it expects half of any sharp drop in growth in the second quarter to be reversed in the three months to September as the economy starts to recover. Separately, theInternational Monetary Fund warned the viruswould push the UK into its deepest slump for a century. In its report, the IMF said it expects the UK economy to shrink by 6.5% in 2020, while the global economy will contract by 3%. Sturgeon concerned over England PPE priority claim One in five deaths now linked to coronavirus UK firms at risk of making 'permanent' job cuts Coronavirus-related deaths in UK hospitals have risen to 12,107, an increase of 778 on Monday's total. And more than one in five deaths in England and Wales islinked to coronavirus, figures show. The Office for National Statistics data showed the virus was mentioned on 3,475 death certificates in the week ending 3 April. It helped push the total number of deaths in that week to more than 16,000 - a record high and 6,000 more than expected at this time of year. The OBR's estimates said a three month lockdown would push up the UK's borrowing bill to an estimated Â£273bn this financial year, or 14% of gross domestic product (GDP). This would represent the largest deficit as a share of GDP since World War Two. While borrowing is expected to jump, the OBR said the government's unprecedented financial help for workers and businesses would help to limit any long-term damage. The OBR expects a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise by 2.1 million to 3.4 million by the end of June. Under this scenario, unemployment would hit 10%, from its current 3.9% rate, before easing to around 7.3% at the end of the year. The jobless rate is expected to remain elevated until 2023, when it is expected to drop back to 4%, in line with the OBR's March forecast. These are incredible numbers indicated by the government's official, though independent, forecasters at the OBR. They illustrate what is at stake, and why the government has to get its economic rescue plans spot on. They will feature at the COBR discussions. Indeed some senior public health experts believe that the government needs an economic counterpart to the influential SAGE committee of scientists. But this isn't quite about a direct trade off. That existed clearly on the way in - the economy was shut down to protect public health. On the way out of these measures, the balance is not straightforward. If the lockdown is lifted prematurely, the health system could fall over, workers might just refuse to go to work anyway, and none of that would be positive for the economy. Indeed when it is lifted, the absence of a vaccine means that these trade offs are likely to be considered week by week and sector by sector, for months to come. The OBR expects UK debt to be higher for years to come, with extra borrowing expected to push Britain's debt share to above 100% of GDP this financial year if the lockdown lasts for three months. While this will drop sharply as the UK economy recovers, public debt is expected to remain at 84.9% of GDP in four years time, much higher than the 75.3% forecast in the March Budget. Mr Chote said a longer lockdown could have more serious consequences for the economy. He said: ""The longer the lockdown goes on, the more likely it is that the future potential of the economy is scarred by business failures, by less business investment and by the unemployed finding it harder to get back into the labour market."" However, the OBR stressed that the restrictions were necessary to protect the economy from a more prolonged slowdown. It said extra spending by the Treasury to support the economy would also limit the economic damage. ""The government's policy response will have substantial direct budgetary costs, but the measures should help limit the long-term damage to the economy and public finances - the costs of inaction would certainly have been higher,"" the OBR said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area It added that while the lockdown was the main constraint on economic activity, relaxing these measures too soon would cause greater damage. ""The reason why most of the short-term economic impact comes from these measures is that they are successful in limiting the spread of the disease. ""If the measures were not stringent enough to control the disease, then the economic impact from illness would be that much greater.""

One in five deaths now linked to coronavirus,"More than one in five deaths in England and Wales is linked to coronavirus, figures show. The Office for National Statistics said in the week ending 3 April the virus was cited on 3,475 death certificates. It pushed the total number of deaths in that week to over 16,000 - a record high and 6,000 more than normal at this time of year when deaths tend to fall. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rushi Sunak acknowledged there were ""tough times"" ahead economically. It comes as the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK's tax and spending watchdog, warned the pandemiccould see the economy shrink by a record 35% by June. Mr Sunak told No 10's daily coronavirus briefing that it was ""clear"" the situation could be ""much worse"" without the action taken so far. Live page: Care homes 'not forgotten' Which regions have been worst hit by coronavirus? Families fear for loved ones in care homes But he admitted the government could not ""protect every business or household"" as it was clear coronavirus would have ""serious implications"". And he said the economy would bounce back, adding the ""single most important thing is to protect health of everyone"". The ONS report looked at the impact the numbers of people dying with coronavirus alongside all other deaths. Normally at this time of year deaths drop because there is less flu circulating than there is in winter. But instead it jumped up by to a record level of 16,000, the highest number seen since the ONS started publishing data in 2005, topping the biggest weekly toll during the 2015 flu outbreak. ONS official Nick Stripe said it was clear the coronavirus pandemic had reversed that trend, saying the rising number of deaths was ""hugely significant"". ""This is not normal,"" he added. But what is not clear is what else is contributing to this spike in deaths - the coronavirus cases contributed just over half of the ""extra"" 6,000 deaths. It could be that cases of coronavirus are going undetected or other factors related to the lockdown and outbreak are having an impact, such as people not seeking treatment for other conditions or mental health deaths going up. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in risk at the University of Cambridge, said this needed investigating. But he said he had ""never been as shocked"" as when he saw the scale of the increase in deaths. ""I was upset. It is incredibly vivid. These are people,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The ONS data lags behind the daily death figures reported by the government. This is because it relies on death certificates, which are only often registered some days after the death, whereas the government figures are compiled from confirmed cases of deaths of patients who have tested positive for coronavirus, which can be gathered more quickly. The government figures released on Tuesday revealed there had been another 778 deaths, bringing the total to 12,107 by 17:00 BST on Monday. Another 5,252 people have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases to nearly 94,000 by 09:00 BST on Tuesday. Edna Summerfield, 94, died earlier this month after testing positive for coronavirus. Her family believes she contracted it at her care home in Birmingham before she went into hospital on 7 April. Her daughter-in-law Sylvia Summerfield said she feels people in care homes are being neglected - and called for PPE for care home staff as a matter of urgency. ""How many more elderly have got to die in care homes, infected by staff who don't know they have the virus?"" she said. ""It is a very difficult time for us and I feel like people in care homes are being neglected. ""My mother in law didn't deserve the death she had. All the other residents are vulnerable in that care home now."" The fact the government figures rely on deaths where a patient has tested positive - and in England and Northern Ireland this only covers hospital patients - has led to suggestions there has been an under-reporting of deaths in care homes and other community settings. The ONS data does look at deaths elsewhere and shows that one in 10 coronavirus deaths this year have been in the community - half, just over 200, have been in care homes. But care sector leaders are warning the true toll in care homes is much greater. Age UK says the virus is ""running wild"" in care homes with Care England, the umbrella body for care homes, estimating there have been nearly 1,000 deaths. Elderly being 'airbrushed' out of virus figures If the reports are right it could be that there has been a spike in deaths over the past fortnight or that death certificates are not picking up all the cases. The government confirmed there had been coronavirus outbreaks at more than 2,000 care homes in England - although they did not specify the number of deaths that had occurred. This video can not be played ""The carers knew the little things about mum that were important to her"" says Karin Pointon Industry leaders from Age UK, Marie Curie, Care England, Independent Age and the Alzheimer's Society called for a daily update on the situation. ""The current figures are airbrushing older people out like they don't matter,"" Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said. About 410,000 people live in care homes in the UK, living in 11,300 care homes for older people supplied by 5,500 different providers. Mr Sunak told Tuesday's briefing that care home residents and workers had ""absolutely not been forgotten"". Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle added that health bodies were aiming to have figures on coronavirus-related deaths in care homes published daily. ""In these very dispersed systems we just need to be absolutely clear that the cause of death that is attributed is correct, and that is what takes time on the death certificate to get right,"" she said.

Further delays to children's food vouchers,"The voucher scheme was set up in response to fears that children on free school meals might go hungry Many families of children eligible for free school meals are having to wait up to a week for supermarket vouchers, despite an upgrade to the website responsible for delivering them. Under a government scheme, families in need in England should receive vouchers worth Â£15 a week per child. The Edenred website that runs the scheme was rebuilt over the weekend, the Department for Education says. But some schools say they are still struggling to log on. On Tuesday, Danny Sohal, business and resources manager at Chiswick School, in west London, said vouchers the school had ordered on 7 April had finally been approved - although not yet emailed to parents. But its 8 April orders had still not been processed. Attempts to log on to the platform were still being met with error messages. And telephone queuing times were over an hour. When his call had finally been answered, Mr Sohal had been told the error messages were being sent to try to limit traffic to the site and allow Edenred to work through the backlog, which, he added, could be up to 16 million vouchers. The Department for Education said the site had been taken down on Thursday for an upgrade to boost capacity in the face of massive demand. But orders made prior to that should be processed on Tuesday. In a statement, the DfE added: ""We know that the free school meal voucher system is delivering for thousands of schools. ""We continue to work closely with our supplier Edenred to resolve any outstanding issues quickly."" To avoid swamping its system Edenred has advised schools to use the same order codes to bulk-buy vouchers, for example, for all children in the same household over several weeks. Free school meal scheme to continue over holidays Food vouchers for free school meals children Last week, ministers announced the scheme would run throughout the Easter holidays. About 1.3 million children in England are entitled to free school meals and, until the scheme was announced, schools had been making their own arrangements. Schools across the UK were closed last month to all pupils except the children of key workers such as doctors, nurses and delivery drivers, some vulnerable children and those with more serious special educational needs.

Trump claims 'total' power to lift virus lockdown,"This video can not be played Governor Andrew Cuomo: 'We don't have a king, we have a president' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo accused President Donald Trump of ""spoiling for a fight"", as the US leader lashed out at ""Democrat Governors"". Several states, including New York, have begun cautious talks on reopening, but Mr Trump has claimed he has ""total"" power to lift virus lockdowns. Mr Cuomo refuted the claim on Tuesday as Mr Trump took to Twitter to criticise the governor. The US is the epicentre of the pandemic with 592,743 cases and 25,239 deaths. New York state has the most cases, with almost 190,000 cases and over 10,000 deaths. However, it has seen signs of improvement, with the number of people hospitalised due to coronavirus falling for the first time on Tuesday. On Monday, Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that deciding when to reopen states was ""the decision of the president"", not state governors, although he added that he would make his decision ""in conjunction with governors"". The US Constitution says that states maintain public order and safety. So far, it has been individual state governors who have issued lockdown or shelter-in-place orders. Also on Monday, several US state governors discussed plans to resume economic activity without apparent input from the Trump administration. Ten states - seven on the East Coast, led by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and three on the West Coast, led by California Governor Gavin Newsom, said they would co-ordinate how to reopen businesses after the outbreak is contained. All but one of the states is led by a Democratic governor. Now, a row has erupted over who has the ultimate authority to lift lockdown orders. On Monday night, Mr Trump gave a combative press conference where he feuded with reporters, criticised their coverage of how he handled the outbreak, and said that when it came to reopening the economy, ""the president of the United States calls the shots"". This video can not be played WATCH: Reporter challenges President Trump at briefing ""When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total,"" he said, adding: ""They can't do anything without the approval of the president of the United States."" His position has been contradicted by governors and legal experts. It also contrasts with his earlier position that the responsibility for fighting the outbreak and order lockdowns lies primarily with state governors. The row continued on Tuesday, as Mr Cuomo told CBS Mr Trump did not have total authority to decide when to reopen businesses, because ""we don't have a king, we have a president"". During his daily press briefing, Mr Cuomo criticised Mr Trump, adding he would ""not engage"" in a fight with him, but would have ""no choice"" if the president the threatened the welfare of New Yorkers. He added: ""I put my hand out in total partnership and co-operation with the president."" Meanwhile, Mr Trump took the row to Twitter on Tuesday, criticising Mr Cuomo and issuing an oblique snipe at other governors. ""Tell the Democrat Governors that 'Mutiny On The Bounty"" was one of my all time favourite movies,"" Mr Trump, a Republican, wrote. This video can not be played ""Dear Class of 2020"": Graduating high school seniors' messages to their peers ""A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain."" The tale tells of a ship's revolt in which mutineers meet with unhappy ends, with Mr Trump appearing to compare himself to the captain. The president aimed particular fire at Mr Cuomo, who he said was calling ""daily, even hourly, begging for everything,"" like hospitals, beds, ventilators for his state. New York remains the US state hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, reporting 778 deaths in the past 24 hours. However, Mr Trump struck a less combative tone later on Tuesday, saying he would make a decision on the economy ""in conjunction with governors"" soon. ""We have tremendous support from governors, and what I do is going to be done in conjunction with governors.""

The current White House recommendations for Americans to avoid restaurants and non-essential travel and keep in-person gatherings to no more than 10 people expire on 30 April. However, the US's top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, told AP on Tuesday that the 1 May date might be ""a bit overly optimistic"". Referring to testing and tracing procedures, he said: ""We have to have something in place that is efficient and that we can rely on, and we're not there yet."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Globally, different approaches have been adopted to loosening lockdown restrictions. The Chinese province of Wuhan, where coronavirus was first reported last December, has partially reopened after more than two months of isolation. Spain has allowed around 300,000 nonessential workers to return to their jobs. Italy - the hardest-hit country in Europe - will allow a narrow range of businesses to resume operations this week. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has announced the country's near-lockdown will extend until 11 May. The UK government has said no one should expect any changes to its lockdown restrictions this week. Mr Trump told Monday's briefing he did not intend to fire Anthony Fauci - a day after the president shared a tweet with the hashtag ""#firefauci"". Dr Fauci incurred the ire of the president's supporters after he told CNN that lives could have been saved if the US had shut down earlier during the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Trump invited Dr Fauci - a key member of the White House coronavirus task force - to the stage in the opening minutes of the briefing. The president said that he and Dr Fauci had been on the same page ""from the beginning"" and declared he liked the respected doctor. ""I think he's a wonderful guy,"" Mr Trump said, while adding that not everyone was happy with the health expert. Dr Fauci has contradicted or corrected Mr Trump on scientific matters during the public health crisis. But on Monday, he conceded he had used ""a poor choice of words"" in his CNN interview. While Mr Trump initially played down the threat of coronavirus, he was by no means alone among US public officials in doing so. Dr Fauci himself on 17 February said the danger from coronavirus is ""just minuscule"" compared with the ""real and present danger"" of flu.

"UK economy 'could shrink by record 35%' by JuneOnce restrictions are lifted, growth is expected to recover quickly with no lasting damage.BusinessComments","This video can not be played Chancellor: Coronavirus will have ""very significant impact"" on economy A forecast by the UK's tax and spending watchdog suggests the coronavirus crisis will have ""serious implications"" for the UK economy, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned the pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record 35% by June. Mr Sunak stressed that the forecast was only one possible scenario. But he said it was important that the government was ""honest with people about what may be happening"". He said the OBR figures suggest that the scale of what the UK is facing ""will have serious implications for our economy"", in common with other countries. ""These are tough times, and there will be more to come,"" Mr Sunak said. However, he said that while the government could not protect every business and household, ""we came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses."" The OBR also expects the economic impact of the crisis to be temporary, he said. He added that the government is ""not just going to stand by"" and not act to support the economy. ""Our planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities, and households,"" he said. ""Our plan is the right plan."" Mr Sunak added that at the moment ""the single most important thing we can do to protect the economy is to protect the health of our people."" The OBR said a three-month lockdown followed by three months of partial restrictions would trigger an economic decline of 35.1% in the quarter to June alone, following growth of 0.2% in the first three months of this year. Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, said a drop of this magnitude would be the largest ""in living memory"". While the UK economy would contract by 12.8% this year under this scenario, it is expected to get back to its pre-crisis growth trend by the end of 2020. The OBR stressed the actual amount of growth would depend on how long the lockdown lasted, as well as how quickly activity bounced back once restrictions were relaxed. In any case, it expects half of any sharp drop in growth in the second quarter to be reversed in the three months to September as the economy starts to recover. Separately, theInternational Monetary Fund warned the viruswould push the UK into its deepest slump for a century. In its report, the IMF said it expects the UK economy to shrink by 6.5% in 2020, while the global economy will contract by 3%. Sturgeon concerned over England PPE priority claim One in five deaths now linked to coronavirus UK firms at risk of making 'permanent' job cuts Coronavirus-related deaths in UK hospitals have risen to 12,107, an increase of 778 on Monday's total. And more than one in five deaths in England and Wales islinked to coronavirus, figures show. The Office for National Statistics data showed the virus was mentioned on 3,475 death certificates in the week ending 3 April. It helped push the total number of deaths in that week to more than 16,000 - a record high and 6,000 more than expected at this time of year. The OBR's estimates said a three month lockdown would push up the UK's borrowing bill to an estimated Â£273bn this financial year, or 14% of gross domestic product (GDP). This would represent the largest deficit as a share of GDP since World War Two. While borrowing is expected to jump, the OBR said the government's unprecedented financial help for workers and businesses would help to limit any long-term damage. The OBR expects a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise by 2.1 million to 3.4 million by the end of June. Under this scenario, unemployment would hit 10%, from its current 3.9% rate, before easing to around 7.3% at the end of the year. The jobless rate is expected to remain elevated until 2023, when it is expected to drop back to 4%, in line with the OBR's March forecast. These are incredible numbers indicated by the government's official, though independent, forecasters at the OBR. They illustrate what is at stake, and why the government has to get its economic rescue plans spot on. They will feature at the COBR discussions. Indeed some senior public health experts believe that the government needs an economic counterpart to the influential SAGE committee of scientists. But this isn't quite about a direct trade off. That existed clearly on the way in - the economy was shut down to protect public health. On the way out of these measures, the balance is not straightforward. If the lockdown is lifted prematurely, the health system could fall over, workers might just refuse to go to work anyway, and none of that would be positive for the economy. Indeed when it is lifted, the absence of a vaccine means that these trade offs are likely to be considered week by week and sector by sector, for months to come. The OBR expects UK debt to be higher for years to come, with extra borrowing expected to push Britain's debt share to above 100% of GDP this financial year if the lockdown lasts for three months. While this will drop sharply as the UK economy recovers, public debt is expected to remain at 84.9% of GDP in four years time, much higher than the 75.3% forecast in the March Budget. Mr Chote said a longer lockdown could have more serious consequences for the economy. He said: ""The longer the lockdown goes on, the more likely it is that the future potential of the economy is scarred by business failures, by less business investment and by the unemployed finding it harder to get back into the labour market."" However, the OBR stressed that the restrictions were necessary to protect the economy from a more prolonged slowdown. It said extra spending by the Treasury to support the economy would also limit the economic damage. ""The government's policy response will have substantial direct budgetary costs, but the measures should help limit the long-term damage to the economy and public finances - the costs of inaction would certainly have been higher,"" the OBR said.

LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area It added that while the lockdown was the main constraint on economic activity, relaxing these measures too soon would cause greater damage. ""The reason why most of the short-term economic impact comes from these measures is that they are successful in limiting the spread of the disease. ""If the measures were not stringent enough to control the disease, then the economic impact from illness would be that much greater.""

A list set up by a charity to gift items to East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust staff says it has had to pause requests because of the high response rate. âWe have been truly humbled and overwhelmed by your generosity... if we need to reopen the list at a later date we will be in touch,"" it posted on Facebook. But several NHS staff have suggested it would be better if people donated to other causes. âI'm a healthcare professional and I work for an NHS Ambulance Service,"" one wrote in a tweet shared more than 600 times. ""Whilst I appreciate the kindness and generosity, I don't need free pizza, free coffee or money-off vouchers et cetera. ""Please give to those who have lost their income.â Another, who said they were a paramedic, wrote: âFinancially, I'm sure I'll be fine. ""What makes me uneasy are people who are out of work bringing donations to our station. ""It's lovely but we don't need it.â And a third said: ""As much as I greatly appreciate the gesture, please please please offer a free cup of coffee or pizza to the families who are struggling to feed their children, the homeless on the streets, the older generation or self-employed and to anyone else who is suffering financially from Covid-19 measures and are not covered by government grants or loans.â BBC News asked NHS England and NHS Wales for comment. NHS Swansea Bay Trust responded on the latter's behalf. ""As [visitors] were now unable to visit for the foreseeable future, we could see a real patient dignity situation arising where patients would not have access to clean clothing and a growing lack of toiletries,"" wrote spokeswoman Susan Bailey ""We then launched an appeal for toiletries, underwear and nightwear and it had such a positive response that we have now temporarily paused our appeal. ""We normally keep a small stock of items like this for patients who may be admitted as emergencies or who may not have family members able to visit, but nothing like the scale needed at present.

One in nine homeowners takes mortgage holiday,"Lots of people are finding it difficult to meet the demands of their mortgage One in nine mortgage holders in the UK has taken a so-called ""payment holiday"" as their finances have been hit by the effects of coronavirus. Lenders have agreed that 1.2 million homeowners can delay repayments as jobs are cut and wages reduced. Typically, this defers a mortgage bill of Â£775 a month, with borrowers given the option of delaying up to three months of repayments. More are likely to take up the option, which should not affect credit ratings. Many frustrated mortgage holders have struggled to get through to their lender as phone lines have been so busy, leaving banks - who face their own staffing pressures - to prioritise the most vulnerable. UK Finance, which represents banks and which compiled the figures, said payment holidays were best organised, if possible, by filling in a form provided online by most lenders. Banks and building societies have offered up to three months of mortgage repayment deferrals for those struggling financially. This does not mean these bills are being cancelled, as they will still need to be paid at a later date. For the typical capital and interest repayment mortgage, about Â£775 is being deferred each month. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The number of deferrals in place more than tripled in the two weeks between 25 March and 8 April, growing from 392,130 to 1.24 million. This is an increase of nearly 850,000, or an average of around 61,000 payment holidays being granted by lenders per day. Were they all to take a three-month break, a total of about Â£2.6bn would have been deferred. The total would have risen since then, and is likely to increase further. ""Payment holidays aren't always the right solution for everyone. We would therefore encourage any mortgage customers concerned about their financial situation to check with their lender so they can find out more information on the support available and how to apply,"" said Stephen Jones, UK Finance chief executive. He stressed that people should not simply cancel their direct debit without talking to their lender as this could lead to charges and could affect their chances of borrowing in the future. Robin Fieth, chief executive of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said: ""We know that this is a difficult time for many homeowners with a mortgage, and building society staff have been working hard to offer individuals the right solution."" Some mortgages that track the Bank of England's interest rates have been getting cheaper after policymakerscut the base rate to its lowest-ever levelin response to the coronavirus outbreak. However, most homeowners are on fixed-rate deals and so would have seen no reduction in their current monthly mortgage bill. With incomes having been hit, this has put strain on household finances. Some mortgage lenders, meanwhile, have been pulling out of offering new deals to people who cannot offer a large deposit,as much of the UK mortgage and housing market goes into lockdown itself. That has ruled out first-time borrowers or existing homeowners with little equity in their home looking for a new deal.

"Austria and Italy ease lockdown for some shopsSmall shops are allowed to open up in Austria, but the worst-hit areas of Italy are holding back.","Austrians began venturing out to DIY shops as the lockdown eased on Tuesday Thousands of shops have reopened in Austria, as it seeks to ease restrictions brought in to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Garden centres, DIY stores and small shops can open but with strict rules on social distancing. In Italy, where over 20,000 people have died in the pandemic, a limited number of shops and businesses have been allowed to reopen. But some of the worst-hit regions have decided to hold off. Lombardy and other regions in the north will maintain their measures for longer. After five weeks under lockdown, shops selling books, stationery and clothes for babies and young children can reopen their doors but with strict rules on customer numbers and hygiene. Meanwhile, Denmark has said it intends to ease its lockdown faster than originally planned. The European Commission has urged EU countries to co-ordinate with each other to relax measures gradually. An internal document sent by the Commission to EU governments said that even phased measures would ""unavoidably lead to a corresponding increase in new cases"". Lifting restrictions had to wait for the spread of the virus to be reduced for a significant period, it said, with enough capacity in intensive care units to cope with a second surge in cases and increased testing, along with mass antibody tests. Businesses, shops and schools should lead the way, followed by limited reopening of restaurants, bars and cafes. Italy's regions have adapted the relaxation of rules according to the scale of the outbreak In other developments: Denmark was already opening schools for younger children from Wednesday, but Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen says hospital cases are falling so she will talk to other political parties about a further relaxation of the lockdown measures Spain allowed some businesses to return to work Poland will gradually lift restrictions on its economy from Sunday, probably starting with shops Montenegro's authorities are to prevent church services from taking place over Orthodox Easter at the weekend A French court has ordered Amazon to limit deliveries to essential goods, to enable the company to assess the risk of infection to its workers, after unions said it was not doing enough to protect them. Spain reported its lowest increase in infections since 20 March on Tuesday. There has been a 1.8% increase from Monday to 3,045. The number of deaths has gone up by 567 to 18,056. President Emmanuel Macron extended France's lockdown for another four weeks until 11 May, as he said current restrictions had slowed the virus but not beaten it. The head of Germany's Robert Koch public health institute said that while there had been a slowdown it was too early to talk of a clear trend. The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomed the slowing down of infections in some European countriesbut warned against lifting restrictions too early,so as not to prompt ""a deadly resurgence"". Austria was one of the first European countries to follow neighbouring Italy in imposing strict lockdown measures about a month ago, and the government says it has managed to flatten the curve of new infections. It has so far reported about 14,000 cases and 368 deaths. Last week, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz unveiled plans to lift restrictions gradually. Why you now have to wear a mask in Austrian shops Denmark takes steps to open up again When home gets violent under lockdown in Europe From Tuesday, shops under 400 sq m (4,300 sq ft) in size are allowed to reopen, along with hardware stores and garden centres. But it is also compulsory for people to wear a mask in supermarkets and pharmacies. ""Experience in countries that have handled it well has taught us that we have to move gradually,"" Economy Minister Margarete SchrambÃ¶ck told Austrian TV. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Larger shops, shopping centres and hairdressers are due to reopen from 1 May, while restaurants and hotels could reopen from mid-May if health conditions allow, Austria's chancellor has said. The reopening of bookshops and clothes stores for young children is a glimmer of hope, after Italy saw 20,465 fatalities, second only to the US in the number of deaths officially caused by Covid-19. The daily death toll is now falling and the number of patients in intensive care has dropped for 10 days in a row, to 3,260. But Lombardy, where Italy's outbreak began, still saw another 280 deaths declared on Monday, and officials there have decided to allow children's clothing shops to open, but not bookshops. This video can not be played With face masks in high demand, we look at whether they really can protect people from the virus Also in the north, some of the worst-affected areas of Emilia-Romagna will stay locked down, while in Veneto officials are talking of a ""soft lockdown"". Bookshops and clothing stores can open for two days a week, says Veneto governor Luca Zaia, and a ban on exercising more than 200m away from home has been lifted. But residents will still need to wear a mask and gloves if they go out. In his address on Monday evening, President Macron said the outbreak in France was ""beginning to steady... (and) hope is returning"". The daily number of deaths rose slightly, taking the country's total to just under 15,000. ""The eleventh of May will be the start of a new phase,"" Mr Macron said. ""It will be progressive and the rules can be adapted according to our results."" Lockdown, what lockdown? Sweden's unusual response Italy orders rescued migrants onto quarantine ship He said schools would gradually reopen after the new extension but restaurants would stay closed and there could be no festivals until mid-July. He said the most vulnerable people should remain in isolation even after the rules were eased. Lothar Wieler, the head of Germany's Robert Koch Institute, said on Tuesday that infections were now levelling off, but at a relatively high level. Germany has seen 2,969 deaths, according to RKI figures, although Johns Hopkins University in the US puts the number at almost 3,200. Chancellor Angela Merkel will hold talks on Wednesday with regional leaders on how to exit the country's lockdown. ""We cannot yet conclusively determine whether the number of cases is actually falling,"" Mr Wieler said. The RKI is aiming to bring down the infection rate from 1.2 per person now to below one. A nursing home in RÃ¼mpel in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein has gone into quarantine after 53 residents and 19 staff tested positive for coronavirus. Meanwhile, the number of people who have died with the virus in the Netherlands increased by 86 to 2,823 on Monday. The number of confirmed cases rose by almost 1,000. Cases and deaths also increased in Belgium, which is now among the worst-affected countries in Europe. More than 4,000 people have now died with Covid-19 in the country, officials said.

UK growth 'could drop by record 35%' by June,"This video can not be played Chancellor: Coronavirus will have ""very significant impact"" on economy A forecast by the UK's tax and spending watchdog suggests the coronavirus crisis will have ""serious implications"" for the UK economy, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned the pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record 35% by June. Mr Sunak stressed that the forecast was only one possible scenario. But he said it was important that the government was ""honest with people about what may be happening"". He said the OBR figures suggest that the scale of what the UK is facing ""will have serious implications for our economy"", in common with other countries. ""These are tough times, and there will be more to come,"" Mr Sunak said. However, he said that while the government could not protect every business and household, ""we came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses."" The OBR also expects the economic impact of the crisis to be temporary, he said. He added that the government is ""not just going to stand by"" and not act to support the economy. ""Our planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities, and households,"" he said. ""Our plan is the right plan."" Mr Sunak added that at the moment ""the single most important thing we can do to protect the economy is to protect the health of our people."" The OBR said a three-month lockdown followed by three months of partial restrictions would trigger an economic decline of 35.1% in the quarter to June alone, following growth of 0.2% in the first three months of this year. Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, said a drop of this magnitude would be the largest ""in living memory"". While the UK economy would contract by 12.8% this year under this scenario, it is expected to get back to its pre-crisis growth trend by the end of 2020. The OBR stressed the actual amount of growth would depend on how long the lockdown lasted, as well as how quickly activity bounced back once restrictions were relaxed. In any case, it expects half of any sharp drop in growth in the second quarter to be reversed in the three months to September as the economy starts to recover. Separately, theInternational Monetary Fund warned the viruswould push the UK into its deepest slump for a century. In its report, the IMF said it expects the UK economy to shrink by 6.5% in 2020, while the global economy will contract by 3%. Sturgeon concerned over England PPE priority claim One in five deaths now linked to coronavirus UK firms at risk of making 'permanent' job cuts Coronavirus-related deaths in UK hospitals have risen to 12,107, an increase of 778 on Monday's total. And more than one in five deaths in England and Wales islinked to coronavirus, figures show. The Office for National Statistics data showed the virus was mentioned on 3,475 death certificates in the week ending 3 April. It helped push the total number of deaths in that week to more than 16,000 - a record high and 6,000 more than expected at this time of year. The OBR's estimates said a three month lockdown would push up the UK's borrowing bill to an estimated Â£273bn this financial year, or 14% of gross domestic product (GDP). This would represent the largest deficit as a share of GDP since World War Two. While borrowing is expected to jump, the OBR said the government's unprecedented financial help for workers and businesses would help to limit any long-term damage. The OBR expects a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise by 2.1 million to 3.4 million by the end of June. Under this scenario, unemployment would hit 10%, from its current 3.9% rate, before easing to around 7.3% at the end of the year. The jobless rate is expected to remain elevated until 2023, when it is expected to drop back to 4%, in line with the OBR's March forecast. These are incredible numbers indicated by the government's official, though independent, forecasters at the OBR. They illustrate what is at stake, and why the government has to get its economic rescue plans spot on. They will feature at the COBR discussions. Indeed some senior public health experts believe that the government needs an economic counterpart to the influential SAGE committee of scientists. But this isn't quite about a direct trade off. That existed clearly on the way in - the economy was shut down to protect public health. On the way out of these measures, the balance is not straightforward. If the lockdown is lifted prematurely, the health system could fall over, workers might just refuse to go to work anyway, and none of that would be positive for the economy. Indeed when it is lifted, the absence of a vaccine means that these trade offs are likely to be considered week by week and sector by sector, for months to come. The OBR expects UK debt to be higher for years to come, with extra borrowing expected to push Britain's debt share to above 100% of GDP this financial year if the lockdown lasts for three months. While this will drop sharply as the UK economy recovers, public debt is expected to remain at 84.9% of GDP in four years time, much higher than the 75.3% forecast in the March Budget. Mr Chote said a longer lockdown could have more serious consequences for the economy. He said: ""The longer the lockdown goes on, the more likely it is that the future potential of the economy is scarred by business failures, by less business investment and by the unemployed finding it harder to get back into the labour market."" However, the OBR stressed that the restrictions were necessary to protect the economy from a more prolonged slowdown. It said extra spending by the Treasury to support the economy would also limit the economic damage. ""The government's policy response will have substantial direct budgetary costs, but the measures should help limit the long-term damage to the economy and public finances - the costs of inaction would certainly have been higher,"" the OBR said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area It added that while the lockdown was the main constraint on economic activity, relaxing these measures too soon would cause greater damage. ""The reason why most of the short-term economic impact comes from these measures is that they are successful in limiting the spread of the disease. ""If the measures were not stringent enough to control the disease, then the economic impact from illness would be that much greater.""

Are NHS staff getting the protective gear they need?,"Personal protective equipment (PPE), like masks and gloves, helps stop the spread of coronavirus and saves lives. With a new, more contagious variant of Covid circulating in the UK, doctors and nurses are calling formore kit that provides the highest protection. Anyone in close contact with patients should wear some form of protection. That includes staff in care homes, prisons and the community, as well as in GP surgeries or hospitals. People giving vaccines will also use PPE. The type of PPE required depends on the level of risk. Millions of high-grade NHS masks withdrawn over safety concerns Guidelines say all hospital staff,externalshould wear a face mask, while people visiting hospital or attending outpatient departments should wear a face covering. Face coverings, unlike surgical face masks,are not classed as PPE,externalas they are not usually made to a recognised standard and do not provide a proven level of protection for work. In hospitals, anyone working within 2m (6ft) of a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection. Clinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection. This includes disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors. That would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing. Ambulance staff driving the ambulance (if the cab is closed off from the patient compartment) do not need to wear any PPE. The rest of the crew should wear PPE appropriate to their likely risk of exposure. Pharmacy staff who cannot keep 2m away from possible patients should wear a surgical mask. Some staff in other higher-risk occupations likecleaners,,externalmortuary workers,externalandmembers of the prison service,externalmay need to use PPE and should follow guidelines. The NHS needs billions of items each month. There are about 1.6 million NHS staff in UK hospitals and the community, who need varying amounts of PPE. Ordering is done on a UK-wide level, but different parts of the NHS have different levels of stock. The government says 32 billion items, including masks, visors and gowns, have been bought. Almost three quarters of expected demand for PPE will be met by UK manufacturers, it says. Before coronavirus, in 2019, the NHS and social care sector in England received around 2.4 billion items of PPE. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 8.4 billion items have been delivered to the health and social care system inEngland. That includes body bags, swabs, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent as well as masks, gowns and gloves. Abreakdown of PPE,externaldelivered in the week to 6 November 2020 included: 35.5 million masks 40 million aprons 1.1 million gowns 156 million gloves (supplied and counted individually rather than as pairs) Since March,more than 908 million items of PPE have been delivered,externalin the NHS inScotland. In the week to 30 December, this included: 1.9 million masks 2.3 million aprons 35,000 gowns 5.7 million gloves Since March, nearly630 million items of PPE,externalhave been delivered to the health and social care sectors inWales. In the week to 20 December, this included: 77,000 masks 2.6 million aprons 101,000 gowns 10 million gloves InNorthern Ireland,more than376.5 million items of PPE,externalwere sent between March and the end of January 2021. In the week to 27 November, this included: 1.3 million masks 1.2 million aprons 53,500 gowns 4.6 million gloves Some bits of kit can only be used once per patient. Others can be used for whole sessions, such as during a ward round visit to many patients. All PPE worn during the highest-risk situations - where there will be lots of splatter from infectious droplets - should be single use, unless they can be decontaminated. Aprons, gloves and surgical masks should usually be disposed of after a single use or session. When there are shortages,guidelines say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so,external, even if it is labelled as single use by the manufacturer. The Health and Safety Executive says it recognises ""some compromise"" is needed when there are extreme shortages of kit. For example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused. TheRoyal College of Nursing,externaland theBritish Medical Association,externalsay PPE guidance should take a more precautions to stop airborne spreading. Both say members can refuse to treat patients as a ""last resort"" if there is not adequate PPE. UK anaesthetic and intensive care bodies says doctors should carefully evaluate the risks before deciding whether to provide care.

One in five deaths now linked to coronavirusCoronavirus prompts spike in mortality with data showing weekly deaths have hit record high.HealthComments,"More than one in five deaths in England and Wales is linked to coronavirus, figures show. The Office for National Statistics said in the week ending 3 April the virus was cited on 3,475 death certificates. It pushed the total number of deaths in that week to over 16,000 - a record high and 6,000 more than normal at this time of year when deaths tend to fall. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rushi Sunak acknowledged there were ""tough times"" ahead economically. It comes as the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK's tax and spending watchdog, warned the pandemiccould see the economy shrink by a record 35% by June. Mr Sunak told No 10's daily coronavirus briefing that it was ""clear"" the situation could be ""much worse"" without the action taken so far. Live page: Care homes 'not forgotten' Which regions have been worst hit by coronavirus? Families fear for loved ones in care homes But he admitted the government could not ""protect every business or household"" as it was clear coronavirus would have ""serious implications"". And he said the economy would bounce back, adding the ""single most important thing is to protect health of everyone"". The ONS report looked at the impact the numbers of people dying with coronavirus alongside all other deaths. Normally at this time of year deaths drop because there is less flu circulating than there is in winter. But instead it jumped up by to a record level of 16,000, the highest number seen since the ONS started publishing data in 2005, topping the biggest weekly toll during the 2015 flu outbreak. ONS official Nick Stripe said it was clear the coronavirus pandemic had reversed that trend, saying the rising number of deaths was ""hugely significant"". ""This is not normal,"" he added. But what is not clear is what else is contributing to this spike in deaths - the coronavirus cases contributed just over half of the ""extra"" 6,000 deaths. It could be that cases of coronavirus are going undetected or other factors related to the lockdown and outbreak are having an impact, such as people not seeking treatment for other conditions or mental health deaths going up. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in risk at the University of Cambridge, said this needed investigating. But he said he had ""never been as shocked"" as when he saw the scale of the increase in deaths. ""I was upset. It is incredibly vivid. These are people,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The ONS data lags behind the daily death figures reported by the government. This is because it relies on death certificates, which are only often registered some days after the death, whereas the government figures are compiled from confirmed cases of deaths of patients who have tested positive for coronavirus, which can be gathered more quickly. The government figures released on Tuesday revealed there had been another 778 deaths, bringing the total to 12,107 by 17:00 BST on Monday. Another 5,252 people have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases to nearly 94,000 by 09:00 BST on Tuesday. Edna Summerfield, 94, died earlier this month after testing positive for coronavirus. Her family believes she contracted it at her care home in Birmingham before she went into hospital on 7 April. Her daughter-in-law Sylvia Summerfield said she feels people in care homes are being neglected - and called for PPE for care home staff as a matter of urgency. ""How many more elderly have got to die in care homes, infected by staff who don't know they have the virus?"" she said. ""It is a very difficult time for us and I feel like people in care homes are being neglected. ""My mother in law didn't deserve the death she had. All the other residents are vulnerable in that care home now."" The fact the government figures rely on deaths where a patient has tested positive - and in England and Northern Ireland this only covers hospital patients - has led to suggestions there has been an under-reporting of deaths in care homes and other community settings. The ONS data does look at deaths elsewhere and shows that one in 10 coronavirus deaths this year have been in the community - half, just over 200, have been in care homes. But care sector leaders are warning the true toll in care homes is much greater. Age UK says the virus is ""running wild"" in care homes with Care England, the umbrella body for care homes, estimating there have been nearly 1,000 deaths. Elderly being 'airbrushed' out of virus figures If the reports are right it could be that there has been a spike in deaths over the past fortnight or that death certificates are not picking up all the cases. The government confirmed there had been coronavirus outbreaks at more than 2,000 care homes in England - although they did not specify the number of deaths that had occurred. This video can not be played ""The carers knew the little things about mum that were important to her"" says Karin Pointon Industry leaders from Age UK, Marie Curie, Care England, Independent Age and the Alzheimer's Society called for a daily update on the situation. ""The current figures are airbrushing older people out like they don't matter,"" Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said. About 410,000 people live in care homes in the UK, living in 11,300 care homes for older people supplied by 5,500 different providers. Mr Sunak told Tuesday's briefing that care home residents and workers had ""absolutely not been forgotten"". Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle added that health bodies were aiming to have figures on coronavirus-related deaths in care homes published daily. ""In these very dispersed systems we just need to be absolutely clear that the cause of death that is attributed is correct, and that is what takes time on the death certificate to get right,"" she said.

Austria and Italy ease lockdown for some shops,"Austrians began venturing out to DIY shops as the lockdown eased on Tuesday Thousands of shops have reopened in Austria, as it seeks to ease restrictions brought in to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Garden centres, DIY stores and small shops can open but with strict rules on social distancing. In Italy, where over 20,000 people have died in the pandemic, a limited number of shops and businesses have been allowed to reopen. But some of the worst-hit regions have decided to hold off. Lombardy and other regions in the north will maintain their measures for longer. After five weeks under lockdown, shops selling books, stationery and clothes for babies and young children can reopen their doors but with strict rules on customer numbers and hygiene. Meanwhile, Denmark has said it intends to ease its lockdown faster than originally planned. The European Commission has urged EU countries to co-ordinate with each other to relax measures gradually. An internal document sent by the Commission to EU governments said that even phased measures would ""unavoidably lead to a corresponding increase in new cases"". Lifting restrictions had to wait for the spread of the virus to be reduced for a significant period, it said, with enough capacity in intensive care units to cope with a second surge in cases and increased testing, along with mass antibody tests. Businesses, shops and schools should lead the way, followed by limited reopening of restaurants, bars and cafes. Italy's regions have adapted the relaxation of rules according to the scale of the outbreak In other developments: Denmark was already opening schools for younger children from Wednesday, but Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen says hospital cases are falling so she will talk to other political parties about a further relaxation of the lockdown measures Spain allowed some businesses to return to work Poland will gradually lift restrictions on its economy from Sunday, probably starting with shops Montenegro's authorities are to prevent church services from taking place over Orthodox Easter at the weekend A French court has ordered Amazon to limit deliveries to essential goods, to enable the company to assess the risk of infection to its workers, after unions said it was not doing enough to protect them. Spain reported its lowest increase in infections since 20 March on Tuesday. There has been a 1.8% increase from Monday to 3,045. The number of deaths has gone up by 567 to 18,056. President Emmanuel Macron extended France's lockdown for another four weeks until 11 May, as he said current restrictions had slowed the virus but not beaten it. The head of Germany's Robert Koch public health institute said that while there had been a slowdown it was too early to talk of a clear trend. The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomed the slowing down of infections in some European countriesbut warned against lifting restrictions too early,so as not to prompt ""a deadly resurgence"". Austria was one of the first European countries to follow neighbouring Italy in imposing strict lockdown measures about a month ago, and the government says it has managed to flatten the curve of new infections. It has so far reported about 14,000 cases and 368 deaths. Last week, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz unveiled plans to lift restrictions gradually. Why you now have to wear a mask in Austrian shops Denmark takes steps to open up again When home gets violent under lockdown in Europe From Tuesday, shops under 400 sq m (4,300 sq ft) in size are allowed to reopen, along with hardware stores and garden centres. But it is also compulsory for people to wear a mask in supermarkets and pharmacies. ""Experience in countries that have handled it well has taught us that we have to move gradually,"" Economy Minister Margarete SchrambÃ¶ck told Austrian TV. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Larger shops, shopping centres and hairdressers are due to reopen from 1 May, while restaurants and hotels could reopen from mid-May if health conditions allow, Austria's chancellor has said. The reopening of bookshops and clothes stores for young children is a glimmer of hope, after Italy saw 20,465 fatalities, second only to the US in the number of deaths officially caused by Covid-19. The daily death toll is now falling and the number of patients in intensive care has dropped for 10 days in a row, to 3,260. But Lombardy, where Italy's outbreak began, still saw another 280 deaths declared on Monday, and officials there have decided to allow children's clothing shops to open, but not bookshops. This video can not be played With face masks in high demand, we look at whether they really can protect people from the virus Also in the north, some of the worst-affected areas of Emilia-Romagna will stay locked down, while in Veneto officials are talking of a ""soft lockdown"". Bookshops and clothing stores can open for two days a week, says Veneto governor Luca Zaia, and a ban on exercising more than 200m away from home has been lifted. But residents will still need to wear a mask and gloves if they go out. In his address on Monday evening, President Macron said the outbreak in France was ""beginning to steady... (and) hope is returning"". The daily number of deaths rose slightly, taking the country's total to just under 15,000. ""The eleventh of May will be the start of a new phase,"" Mr Macron said. ""It will be progressive and the rules can be adapted according to our results."" Lockdown, what lockdown? Sweden's unusual response Italy orders rescued migrants onto quarantine ship He said schools would gradually reopen after the new extension but restaurants would stay closed and there could be no festivals until mid-July. He said the most vulnerable people should remain in isolation even after the rules were eased. Lothar Wieler, the head of Germany's Robert Koch Institute, said on Tuesday that infections were now levelling off, but at a relatively high level. Germany has seen 2,969 deaths, according to RKI figures, although Johns Hopkins University in the US puts the number at almost 3,200. Chancellor Angela Merkel will hold talks on Wednesday with regional leaders on how to exit the country's lockdown. ""We cannot yet conclusively determine whether the number of cases is actually falling,"" Mr Wieler said. The RKI is aiming to bring down the infection rate from 1.2 per person now to below one. A nursing home in RÃ¼mpel in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein has gone into quarantine after 53 residents and 19 staff tested positive for coronavirus. Meanwhile, the number of people who have died with the virus in the Netherlands increased by 86 to 2,823 on Monday. The number of confirmed cases rose by almost 1,000. Cases and deaths also increased in Belgium, which is now among the worst-affected countries in Europe. More than 4,000 people have now died with Covid-19 in the country, officials said.

Gyms face legal action over rent,"David Lloyd says its venues have been threatened with legal action by landlords Gym and leisure centre bosses say they face being evicted during the coronavirus crisis over non-payment of rent. Trade body UKActive said urgent action is needed to safeguard exercise venues as unscrupulous landlords use a loophole to threaten eviction. New rules to protect commercial tenants were introduced last month. But they don't prevent landlords from taking steps to force tenants to pay rent withheld because of the lockdown. ""A worrying number have decided to pursue statutory demand notices or winding up orders,"" said Huw Edwards, chief executive of UKActive. ""We need the government to act now to direct...that landlords cannot do this. ""With 2,800 gyms at risk of permanent closure, and 100,000 jobs at stake, time is of the essence."" Section 82 of the government's Coronavirus Act 2020,externalcame into force on 25 March to help protect commercial tenants. It banned the forfeiture of commercial leases until 30 June 2020 - or longer if the government deems necessary - for non-payment of rent. However, the Act does not prevent landlords from taking certain actions, including Commercial Rent Arrears Recovery (CRAR), making a debt claim, issuing a statutory demand, or commencing winding-up proceedings - each of which is lethal to businesses with no income. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""In these exceptional times, we urge landlords to act in a socially responsible way, exercising judgement and discretion with their tenants."" Coronavirus: What's happening to the beer left in pubs? Coronavirus: Six industries crying out for help Coronavirus: A fifth of smaller UK firms 'will run out of cash' UKActive says it has evidence to show a growing number of cases where landlords are planning to instigate legal proceedings against operators. The trade body said it expects the first cases to start this week and warned that pubs, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, and retailers could face similar threats. ""Many of our members are faced with the harsh reality of no revenues for a long period, so must take steps to preserve cash, including not paying their rent for the quarter ahead,"" said Mr Edwards. He said some landlords have engaged in constructive discussions to reduce the pressure on tenants, however, a number have decided to pursue statutory demand notices or winding up orders. David Lloyd Leisure, which owns David Lloyd Clubs, appealed to one landlord to request a waiver of rental payments due on 25 March 2020 until the crisis eases and the government allows its clubs to re-open. PureGym says the economic impacts of the coronavirus outbreak are being placed solely on commercial tenants The request was refused immediately by the landlord and was instead met with the threat of legal action through the issuing of a statutory notice. ""This situation is unfortunately entirely outside of our control,"" said David Lloyd boss Glenn Earlham. ""We want to work together with landlords to ensure we can survive this pandemic and emerge with businesses able to continue to pay rent and other costs in the future."" PureGym has seen similar instances across its facilities. ""The burden of dealing with the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to fall on commercial tenants rather than being shared equitably by landlords as well,"" said Humphrey Cobbold, chief executive of PureGym. ""Time is of the absolute essence, given that proceedings such as statutory demands and winding up orders threaten to force companies into insolvency within days of being issued.""

Elderly being 'airbrushed' out of virus figuresCharities voice concern for care home residents and call for daily updates on virus deaths in the system.UK,"This video can not be played Baroness Altman says the health system is ""staked against"" care homes Many older people are being ""airbrushed"" out of coronavirus figures in the UK, charities have warned. The official death toll has been criticised for only covering people who die in hospital - but not those in care homes or in their own houses. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told the BBC the daily figure was based on hospital deaths because ""it's accurate and quick"". Meanwhile, scientists will begin a review of the UK lockdown later. The evaluation will be passed to the government - butministers have said it was unlikely restrictions would change. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, which include every community death linked to Covid-19 in England and Wales, showed a total of 406 such deaths registered up to 3 April had occurred outside of hospitals. That would have added an extra 11% to the official UK figures, based solely on deaths in hospitals, that were being reported at that time. Of those extra deaths, 217 took place in care homes, 33 in hospices, 136 in private homes, three in other communal establishments and 17 elsewhere. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has said details about the number of coronavirus-related deaths in care homesremain unclear, but it was reported last week that there were cases of Covid-19in 20 care homes across the nation. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Industry leaders from Age UK, Marie Curie, Care England, Independent Age and the Alzheimer's Society have written to Health Secretary Matt Hancockdemanding a care package to support social care through the pandemic,external. They have also called for a daily update on deaths in the care system. It comes after the government confirmed there had been coronavirus outbreaks at more than 2,000 care homes in England - although they did not specify the number of deaths that had occurred. The figures prompted the charity Age UK to claim coronavirus is ""running wild"" in care homes for elderly people. ""The current figures are airbrushing older people out like they don't matter,"" Caroline Abrahams, the charity's director, said. Meanwhile, Britain's largest care home operator, HC-One, said coronavirus was present in two-thirds - 232 - of the group's care homes. Its director, Sir David Behan, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that coronavirus deaths represented about one-third of all deaths at HC-One's care homes over the last three weeks. HC-One has 329 care homes throughout England, Scotland and Wales. MHA, a charity which operates 131 homes, said there had been 210 coronavirus-related deaths. About 410,000 people,externallive in care homes in the UK, living in 11,300 care homes for older people supplied by 5,500 different providers. Addressing why deaths in care homes are not being included in the government's data, Ms Coffey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the figures published weekly by the ONS is a ""fair"" way of establishing the ""unfortunate picture"" of where deaths are occurring. England's care home regulator, the Care Quality Commission, has said it will begin recording deaths in adult social care from this week - asking care providers to give daily updates on the number of confirmed and suspected cases. Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall said daily figures were essential to dealing with the ""emerging crisis"" in care homes and called for the government to offer social care ""whatever resources it needs"". Nurse 'paid ultimate price' for lack of PPE Coronavirus: 'John was alone for a week' Will face masks become the new norm? Conservative peer and former work and pensions minister Baroness Altmann told Today that ""one or two"" people in care homes had said to her they felt as though older people are being treated ""like lambs to the slaughter"". ""They [care homes] are left without protective equipment, they are left without testing,"" she said. She added that ""the mark of a civilised society"" was ""how it treats it most vulnerable and oldest citizens"". It comes after Ms Abrahams said care homes were ""underprepared"" for the outbreak, adding that the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing was leading to the spread of coronavirus across the care home sector. However, Ms Coffey told the Today programme that the care sector was not being left behind, adding that PPE was being delivered ""to over 26,000 care settings across the country including care homes, home care providers and also hospices"". On Monday, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty told the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing that 92 homes in the UK reported outbreaks in one day. The Department of Health and Social Care later confirmed 2,099 care homes in England have so far had cases of the virus. Care England has estimated there have been nearly 1,000 deaths from coronavirus in care homes, leaving social care as ""the neglected front line"". The Labour Party has called on the government to publish daily figures of deaths in care homes to highlight the ""true scale"" of the spread of the virus, which causes the Covid-19 disease. The issue has regularly been raised by journalists at the daily Downing Street briefing and the government response has been that the number announced each day is based on hospital figures as this can be quickly gathered and analysed - whereas deaths in the wider community take much longer to be collated after death certificates are issued by doctors. The government says it is following the international standard by quoting the hospital figures each day - and that the fuller ONS figures can lag many days behind. The latest care homes to confirm residents have died with symptoms of the virus includea home in Drumchapel, Glasgow, a specialistdementia home in Selston, Nottinghamshire, and a home in County Durham where13 residents have died. The Department of Health's official death number of deaths of people in hospital with coronavirus rose to 11,329 on Monday - up by 717 in a day. The BBC's science editor David Shukman said the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) meeting later in the day will evaluate various ways coronavirus is unfolding in the UK. It will look at hospital admissions, the approach to testing, data on intensive care capacity and deaths, the effectiveness of lockdown tactics, and whether or not the public should be advised to wear face masks outdoors. Meanwhile, the government has defended itself after reports it missed three chances to bulk-buy PPE for healthcare workers treating virus patients. Health workers in 25 EU countries are set to receive deliveries of kit worth Â£1.3bn in the coming days, according to the Guardian. The paper reports the UK missed three opportunities,externalto join the scheme and has not taken part in talks on future purchases. The Department of Health said it would ""consider participating in future EU joint procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time"". ""We will continue to work with European countries and others in order to make sure that we can increase the capacity within the NHS,"" they said.

One in five deaths now linked to coronavirusCoronavirus prompts spike in mortality with data showing weekly deaths have hit record high.Health,"More than one in five deaths in England and Wales is linked to coronavirus, figures show. The Office for National Statistics said in the week ending 3 April the virus was cited on 3,475 death certificates. It pushed the total number of deaths in that week to over 16,000 - a record high and 6,000 more than normal at this time of year when deaths tend to fall. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rushi Sunak acknowledged there were ""tough times"" ahead economically. It comes as the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK's tax and spending watchdog, warned the pandemiccould see the economy shrink by a record 35% by June. Mr Sunak told No 10's daily coronavirus briefing that it was ""clear"" the situation could be ""much worse"" without the action taken so far. Live page: Care homes 'not forgotten' Which regions have been worst hit by coronavirus? Families fear for loved ones in care homes But he admitted the government could not ""protect every business or household"" as it was clear coronavirus would have ""serious implications"". And he said the economy would bounce back, adding the ""single most important thing is to protect health of everyone"". The ONS report looked at the impact the numbers of people dying with coronavirus alongside all other deaths. Normally at this time of year deaths drop because there is less flu circulating than there is in winter. But instead it jumped up by to a record level of 16,000, the highest number seen since the ONS started publishing data in 2005, topping the biggest weekly toll during the 2015 flu outbreak. ONS official Nick Stripe said it was clear the coronavirus pandemic had reversed that trend, saying the rising number of deaths was ""hugely significant"". ""This is not normal,"" he added. But what is not clear is what else is contributing to this spike in deaths - the coronavirus cases contributed just over half of the ""extra"" 6,000 deaths. It could be that cases of coronavirus are going undetected or other factors related to the lockdown and outbreak are having an impact, such as people not seeking treatment for other conditions or mental health deaths going up. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in risk at the University of Cambridge, said this needed investigating. But he said he had ""never been as shocked"" as when he saw the scale of the increase in deaths. ""I was upset. It is incredibly vivid. These are people,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The ONS data lags behind the daily death figures reported by the government. This is because it relies on death certificates, which are only often registered some days after the death, whereas the government figures are compiled from confirmed cases of deaths of patients who have tested positive for coronavirus, which can be gathered more quickly. The government figures released on Tuesday revealed there had been another 778 deaths, bringing the total to 12,107 by 17:00 BST on Monday. Another 5,252 people have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases to nearly 94,000 by 09:00 BST on Tuesday. Edna Summerfield, 94, died earlier this month after testing positive for coronavirus. Her family believes she contracted it at her care home in Birmingham before she went into hospital on 7 April. Her daughter-in-law Sylvia Summerfield said she feels people in care homes are being neglected - and called for PPE for care home staff as a matter of urgency. ""How many more elderly have got to die in care homes, infected by staff who don't know they have the virus?"" she said. ""It is a very difficult time for us and I feel like people in care homes are being neglected. ""My mother in law didn't deserve the death she had. All the other residents are vulnerable in that care home now."" The fact the government figures rely on deaths where a patient has tested positive - and in England and Northern Ireland this only covers hospital patients - has led to suggestions there has been an under-reporting of deaths in care homes and other community settings. The ONS data does look at deaths elsewhere and shows that one in 10 coronavirus deaths this year have been in the community - half, just over 200, have been in care homes. But care sector leaders are warning the true toll in care homes is much greater. Age UK says the virus is ""running wild"" in care homes with Care England, the umbrella body for care homes, estimating there have been nearly 1,000 deaths. Elderly being 'airbrushed' out of virus figures If the reports are right it could be that there has been a spike in deaths over the past fortnight or that death certificates are not picking up all the cases. The government confirmed there had been coronavirus outbreaks at more than 2,000 care homes in England - although they did not specify the number of deaths that had occurred. This video can not be played ""The carers knew the little things about mum that were important to her"" says Karin Pointon Industry leaders from Age UK, Marie Curie, Care England, Independent Age and the Alzheimer's Society called for a daily update on the situation.

About 410,000 people live in care homes in the UK, living in 11,300 care homes for older people supplied by 5,500 different providers. Mr Sunak told Tuesday's briefing that care home residents and workers had ""absolutely not been forgotten"". Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle added that health bodies were aiming to have figures on coronavirus-related deaths in care homes published daily.

"Trump claims 'total' power to lift virus lockdown""The president of the United States calls the shots,"" Mr Trump says during a feisty news conference.US & Canada","This video can not be played Governor Andrew Cuomo: 'We don't have a king, we have a president' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo accused President Donald Trump of ""spoiling for a fight"", as the US leader lashed out at ""Democrat Governors"". Several states, including New York, have begun cautious talks on reopening, but Mr Trump has claimed he has ""total"" power to lift virus lockdowns. Mr Cuomo refuted the claim on Tuesday as Mr Trump took to Twitter to criticise the governor. The US is the epicentre of the pandemic with 592,743 cases and 25,239 deaths. New York state has the most cases, with almost 190,000 cases and over 10,000 deaths. However, it has seen signs of improvement, with the number of people hospitalised due to coronavirus falling for the first time on Tuesday. On Monday, Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that deciding when to reopen states was ""the decision of the president"", not state governors, although he added that he would make his decision ""in conjunction with governors"". The US Constitution says that states maintain public order and safety. So far, it has been individual state governors who have issued lockdown or shelter-in-place orders. Also on Monday, several US state governors discussed plans to resume economic activity without apparent input from the Trump administration. Ten states - seven on the East Coast, led by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and three on the West Coast, led by California Governor Gavin Newsom, said they would co-ordinate how to reopen businesses after the outbreak is contained. All but one of the states is led by a Democratic governor. Now, a row has erupted over who has the ultimate authority to lift lockdown orders. On Monday night, Mr Trump gave a combative press conference where he feuded with reporters, criticised their coverage of how he handled the outbreak, and said that when it came to reopening the economy, ""the president of the United States calls the shots"". This video can not be played WATCH: Reporter challenges President Trump at briefing ""When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total,"" he said, adding: ""They can't do anything without the approval of the president of the United States."" His position has been contradicted by governors and legal experts. It also contrasts with his earlier position that the responsibility for fighting the outbreak and order lockdowns lies primarily with state governors. The row continued on Tuesday, as Mr Cuomo told CBS Mr Trump did not have total authority to decide when to reopen businesses, because ""we don't have a king, we have a president"". During his daily press briefing, Mr Cuomo criticised Mr Trump, adding he would ""not engage"" in a fight with him, but would have ""no choice"" if the president the threatened the welfare of New Yorkers. He added: ""I put my hand out in total partnership and co-operation with the president."" Meanwhile, Mr Trump took the row to Twitter on Tuesday, criticising Mr Cuomo and issuing an oblique snipe at other governors. ""Tell the Democrat Governors that 'Mutiny On The Bounty"" was one of my all time favourite movies,"" Mr Trump, a Republican, wrote. This video can not be played ""Dear Class of 2020"": Graduating high school seniors' messages to their peers ""A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain."" The tale tells of a ship's revolt in which mutineers meet with unhappy ends, with Mr Trump appearing to compare himself to the captain. The president aimed particular fire at Mr Cuomo, who he said was calling ""daily, even hourly, begging for everything,"" like hospitals, beds, ventilators for his state. New York remains the US state hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, reporting 778 deaths in the past 24 hours. However, Mr Trump struck a less combative tone later on Tuesday, saying he would make a decision on the economy ""in conjunction with governors"" soon. ""We have tremendous support from governors, and what I do is going to be done in conjunction with governors.""

The current White House recommendations for Americans to avoid restaurants and non-essential travel and keep in-person gatherings to no more than 10 people expire on 30 April. However, the US's top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, told AP on Tuesday that the 1 May date might be ""a bit overly optimistic"". Referring to testing and tracing procedures, he said: ""We have to have something in place that is efficient and that we can rely on, and we're not there yet."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Globally, different approaches have been adopted to loosening lockdown restrictions. The Chinese province of Wuhan, where coronavirus was first reported last December, has partially reopened after more than two months of isolation. Spain has allowed around 300,000 nonessential workers to return to their jobs. Italy - the hardest-hit country in Europe - will allow a narrow range of businesses to resume operations this week. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has announced the country's near-lockdown will extend until 11 May. The UK government has said no one should expect any changes to its lockdown restrictions this week. Mr Trump told Monday's briefing he did not intend to fire Anthony Fauci - a day after the president shared a tweet with the hashtag ""#firefauci"". Dr Fauci incurred the ire of the president's supporters after he told CNN that lives could have been saved if the US had shut down earlier during the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Trump invited Dr Fauci - a key member of the White House coronavirus task force - to the stage in the opening minutes of the briefing. The president said that he and Dr Fauci had been on the same page ""from the beginning"" and declared he liked the respected doctor. ""I think he's a wonderful guy,"" Mr Trump said, while adding that not everyone was happy with the health expert. Dr Fauci has contradicted or corrected Mr Trump on scientific matters during the public health crisis. But on Monday, he conceded he had used ""a poor choice of words"" in his CNN interview. While Mr Trump initially played down the threat of coronavirus, he was by no means alone among US public officials in doing so. Dr Fauci himself on 17 February said the danger from coronavirus is ""just minuscule"" compared with the ""real and present danger"" of flu.

MPs summon China-owned firm over security concerns,"A leading UK-based firm will be summoned on Tuesday by MPs to answer questions over security concerns. There are concerns that the Chinese owner of Imagination Technologies has renewed efforts to transfer ownership of sensitive security software to companies controlled by China. Lawmakers worry the coronavirus crisis is diverting attention from controversial technology transfers. The fear is that networks in the UK, Europe and the US could be compromised. Speaking to the BBC, Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee said he was concerned that technology developed by Imagination Technologies, based in Hertfordshire, could be used to fine tune the design of so-called ""backdoors"" into strategically important digital infrastructure. ""The world has changed and companies - particularly tech companies - are on the frontline,"" said Mr Tugendhat. ""Whoever writes the code, writes the rules for the world, more than any regulation passed by bureaucrats. There's no point in taking back control from Brussels, only to hand it over to Beijing."" Coronavirus: Huawei urges UK not to make 5G U-turn after pandemic US 'considers de-listing' Chinese companies Huawei: The storm over the Chinese telecoms giant Imagination Technologies was acquired by a US-based but Chinese state-owned investment firm called Canyon Bridge in September 2017, which is in turn owned by a Chinese state-owned investment fund called China Reform. Mr Tugendhat said Theresa May's government approved the acquisition on the basis that Canyon Bridge was licensed and regulated by US law. Since then it has moved its headquarters to the Cayman Islands and as such is no longer a US-controlled entity. Several senior executives, including chief executive Ron Black, have stepped down recently citing concerns about the future direction and ownership of the company. Chief product officer Steve Evans and chief technical officer John Rayfield also resigned recently. Mr Evans is understood to have said in his resignation letter: ""I will not be part of a company that is effectively controlled by the Chinese government."" An attempt by China Reform to stage a boardroom coup ten days ago by appointing four of its own directors were aborted, but the call for evidence comes amid renewed concerns that the Chinese owners of Imagination are preparing a fresh attempt to transfer sensitive technology patents to mainland China. Huawei executives were quizzed by MPs about whether China would have the ability to snoop on UK mobile network communications in April 2019 As well as designing graphics and virtual reality software for computer chips, industry experts say that Imagination also produces software which can detect whether any weaknesses in sensitive digital networks - so-called ""backdoors"" are the result of error or intention. The UK has already approved the limited use of Chinese-owned Huawei equipmentin the construction of new superfast 5G networksthat promise to deliver better connectivity for use in autonomous cars, utilities, power stations, the national health service and many others. There is no suggestion that Huawei is directly connected to Imagination, or its ultimate owners - the state-owned China Reform investment fund. The call for evidence comes a day after EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager warned that companies across the EU - many of which have been or are being pushed the brink of bankruptcy by the economic effects of Coronavirus - are vulnerable to takeover from Chinese companies. In the UK, the Treasury is considering plans for the state to take ownership stakes in thousands of businesses, to prevent mass bankruptcies of businesses unable or unwilling to take on extra debt. The situation is delicate as many EU countries are gratefully accepting donations of virus-fighting equipment from China. The country, which appears to be ""first in - first out"", is now emerging from a crisis from which it bore the initial brunt. Neither Imagination Technologies, nor its owner China Reform returned the BBC's request for comment.

Deadly olive tree disease 'could cost billions'A deadly pathogen affecting Europe's olive trees could cost over â¬20 billion.,"The impact of infection with Xylella - the trees on the right have not yet been exposed to the bacterium Researchers say the economic costs of a deadly pathogen affecting olive trees in Europe could run to over â¬20 billion. They've modelled the future worst impacts of theXylella fastidiosapathogen which has killed swathes of trees in Italy. Spread by insects, the bacterium now poses a potential threat to olive plantations in Spain and Greece. The disease could increase the costs of olive oil for consumers. Olive tree killer still threatens EU Revealed: The secret life of the spittlebug Olive killer disease reaches Spain Xylella is considered to be one of the most dangerous pathogens for plants anywhere in the world. At present there is no cure for the infection. It can infect cherry, almond and plum trees as well as olives. It has become closely associated with olives after a strain was discovered in trees in Puglia in Italy in 2013. The organism is transmitted by sap-sucking insects such as spittlebugs. The infection limits the tree's ability to move water and nutrients and over time it withers and dies. Plants infected with the bacterium have to be destroyed to prevent the spread In Italy, the consequences of the spread of the disease have been devastating, with an estimated 60% decline in crop yields since the first discovery in 2013. ""The damage to the olives also causes a depreciation of the value of the land, and to the touristic attractiveness of this region,"" said Dr Maria Saponari, from the CNR Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection in Italy. ""It's had a severe impact on the local economy and jobs connected with agriculture."" As well as in Italy, the Xylella bacterium has now been found in Spain, France and Portugal. Tackling it at present involves removing infected trees and trying to clamp down on the movement of plant material and the insects that spread the disease. But if these measures fail, what will be the financial impact of the infection? Inthis new study,,externalresearchers modelled different scenarios including what would happen if all growing ceased due to tree death. They also compared this worst case with a scenario where replanting with resistant varieties occurred. The team made projections for Italy, Spain and Greece, which between them account for 95% of European olive oil production. Olive trees dry up and ultimately die from the Xylella infecton In Spain, if the infection expanded and the majority of trees became infected and died, the costs could run to â¬17 billion over the next 50 years. A similar scenario in Italy would amount to over five billion, while in Greece, the losses would be under two billion. If the rate of infection is slowed down, or resistant varieties are planted instead, then these costs would be significantly reduced. However, the authors believe, whatever happens, there will likely be a knock-on impact on consumers. ""The expected effect could be that there would be a shortage of supply,"" said lead author Kevin Schneider from Wageningen University in the Netherlands. ""And I would expect that if prices go up, consumers will be worse off."" The authors say that while their analysis looks at economics, there are also potentially large touristic and cultural losses caused by the bacterium that can't be ignored. ""You really hear devastating stories of infected orchards that were inherited over generations,"" said Dr Schneider. ""It's the same orchard that their grandparents were once working on. So how do you put an economic number on the loss of something like this. The cultural heritage value would be far larger than we could compute."" There are a growing number of scientific initiatives to try and take the fight to the bacterium, including using insect repelling clays, vegetative barriers and genetic analysis to determine why some plants are more susceptible to the infection than others. Ultimately, the researchers believe that beating the pathogen will require trees that are resistant to the disease. ""Seeking resistant cultivars or immune species is one of the most promising, and environmentally sustainable, long-term control strategies to which the  European scientific community is devoting relevant research efforts,"" said Dr Saponari, ""Sustainable strategies to reduce the population of the insects is the other pillar for the control of the vector-borne disease, in this regard, mechanical intervention to remove weeds in spring is one of the most efficacious applications to reduce the populations of the insect, indeed several other strategies are also being studied to implement the control of the insects,"" she added. While two varieties of olive tree have been found to have some resistance, the authors are calling for research in this area to be significantly boosted.

Austria to reopen some shops as lockdown eases,"Austrians began venturing out to DIY shops as the lockdown eased on Tuesday Thousands of shops have reopened in Austria, as it seeks to ease restrictions brought in to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Garden centres, DIY stores and small shops can open but with strict rules on social distancing. In Italy, where over 20,000 people have died in the pandemic, a limited number of shops and businesses have been allowed to reopen. But some of the worst-hit regions have decided to hold off. Lombardy and other regions in the north will maintain their measures for longer. After five weeks under lockdown, shops selling books, stationery and clothes for babies and young children can reopen their doors but with strict rules on customer numbers and hygiene. Meanwhile, Denmark has said it intends to ease its lockdown faster than originally planned. The European Commission has urged EU countries to co-ordinate with each other to relax measures gradually. An internal document sent by the Commission to EU governments said that even phased measures would ""unavoidably lead to a corresponding increase in new cases"". Lifting restrictions had to wait for the spread of the virus to be reduced for a significant period, it said, with enough capacity in intensive care units to cope with a second surge in cases and increased testing, along with mass antibody tests. Businesses, shops and schools should lead the way, followed by limited reopening of restaurants, bars and cafes. Italy's regions have adapted the relaxation of rules according to the scale of the outbreak In other developments: Denmark was already opening schools for younger children from Wednesday, but Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen says hospital cases are falling so she will talk to other political parties about a further relaxation of the lockdown measures Spain allowed some businesses to return to work Poland will gradually lift restrictions on its economy from Sunday, probably starting with shops Montenegro's authorities are to prevent church services from taking place over Orthodox Easter at the weekend A French court has ordered Amazon to limit deliveries to essential goods, to enable the company to assess the risk of infection to its workers, after unions said it was not doing enough to protect them. Spain reported its lowest increase in infections since 20 March on Tuesday. There has been a 1.8% increase from Monday to 3,045. The number of deaths has gone up by 567 to 18,056. President Emmanuel Macron extended France's lockdown for another four weeks until 11 May, as he said current restrictions had slowed the virus but not beaten it. The head of Germany's Robert Koch public health institute said that while there had been a slowdown it was too early to talk of a clear trend. The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomed the slowing down of infections in some European countriesbut warned against lifting restrictions too early,so as not to prompt ""a deadly resurgence"". Austria was one of the first European countries to follow neighbouring Italy in imposing strict lockdown measures about a month ago, and the government says it has managed to flatten the curve of new infections. It has so far reported about 14,000 cases and 368 deaths. Last week, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz unveiled plans to lift restrictions gradually. Why you now have to wear a mask in Austrian shops Denmark takes steps to open up again When home gets violent under lockdown in Europe From Tuesday, shops under 400 sq m (4,300 sq ft) in size are allowed to reopen, along with hardware stores and garden centres. But it is also compulsory for people to wear a mask in supermarkets and pharmacies. ""Experience in countries that have handled it well has taught us that we have to move gradually,"" Economy Minister Margarete SchrambÃ¶ck told Austrian TV. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Larger shops, shopping centres and hairdressers are due to reopen from 1 May, while restaurants and hotels could reopen from mid-May if health conditions allow, Austria's chancellor has said. The reopening of bookshops and clothes stores for young children is a glimmer of hope, after Italy saw 20,465 fatalities, second only to the US in the number of deaths officially caused by Covid-19. The daily death toll is now falling and the number of patients in intensive care has dropped for 10 days in a row, to 3,260. But Lombardy, where Italy's outbreak began, still saw another 280 deaths declared on Monday, and officials there have decided to allow children's clothing shops to open, but not bookshops. This video can not be played With face masks in high demand, we look at whether they really can protect people from the virus Also in the north, some of the worst-affected areas of Emilia-Romagna will stay locked down, while in Veneto officials are talking of a ""soft lockdown"". Bookshops and clothing stores can open for two days a week, says Veneto governor Luca Zaia, and a ban on exercising more than 200m away from home has been lifted. But residents will still need to wear a mask and gloves if they go out. In his address on Monday evening, President Macron said the outbreak in France was ""beginning to steady... (and) hope is returning"". The daily number of deaths rose slightly, taking the country's total to just under 15,000. ""The eleventh of May will be the start of a new phase,"" Mr Macron said. ""It will be progressive and the rules can be adapted according to our results."" Lockdown, what lockdown? Sweden's unusual response Italy orders rescued migrants onto quarantine ship He said schools would gradually reopen after the new extension but restaurants would stay closed and there could be no festivals until mid-July. He said the most vulnerable people should remain in isolation even after the rules were eased. Lothar Wieler, the head of Germany's Robert Koch Institute, said on Tuesday that infections were now levelling off, but at a relatively high level. Germany has seen 2,969 deaths, according to RKI figures, although Johns Hopkins University in the US puts the number at almost 3,200. Chancellor Angela Merkel will hold talks on Wednesday with regional leaders on how to exit the country's lockdown. ""We cannot yet conclusively determine whether the number of cases is actually falling,"" Mr Wieler said. The RKI is aiming to bring down the infection rate from 1.2 per person now to below one. A nursing home in RÃ¼mpel in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein has gone into quarantine after 53 residents and 19 staff tested positive for coronavirus. Meanwhile, the number of people who have died with the virus in the Netherlands increased by 86 to 2,823 on Monday. The number of confirmed cases rose by almost 1,000. Cases and deaths also increased in Belgium, which is now among the worst-affected countries in Europe. More than 4,000 people have now died with Covid-19 in the country, officials said.

"Coronavirus causes jump in total number of deathsThere were more than 16,000 deaths in the week ending 3 April - 6,000 more than normal.Health","More than one in five deaths in England and Wales is linked to coronavirus, figures show. The Office for National Statistics said in the week ending 3 April the virus was cited on 3,475 death certificates. It pushed the total number of deaths in that week to over 16,000 - a record high and 6,000 more than normal at this time of year when deaths tend to fall. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rushi Sunak acknowledged there were ""tough times"" ahead economically. It comes as the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK's tax and spending watchdog, warned the pandemiccould see the economy shrink by a record 35% by June. Mr Sunak told No 10's daily coronavirus briefing that it was ""clear"" the situation could be ""much worse"" without the action taken so far. Live page: Care homes 'not forgotten' Which regions have been worst hit by coronavirus? Families fear for loved ones in care homes But he admitted the government could not ""protect every business or household"" as it was clear coronavirus would have ""serious implications"". And he said the economy would bounce back, adding the ""single most important thing is to protect health of everyone"". The ONS report looked at the impact the numbers of people dying with coronavirus alongside all other deaths. Normally at this time of year deaths drop because there is less flu circulating than there is in winter. But instead it jumped up by to a record level of 16,000, the highest number seen since the ONS started publishing data in 2005, topping the biggest weekly toll during the 2015 flu outbreak. ONS official Nick Stripe said it was clear the coronavirus pandemic had reversed that trend, saying the rising number of deaths was ""hugely significant"". ""This is not normal,"" he added. But what is not clear is what else is contributing to this spike in deaths - the coronavirus cases contributed just over half of the ""extra"" 6,000 deaths. It could be that cases of coronavirus are going undetected or other factors related to the lockdown and outbreak are having an impact, such as people not seeking treatment for other conditions or mental health deaths going up. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in risk at the University of Cambridge, said this needed investigating. But he said he had ""never been as shocked"" as when he saw the scale of the increase in deaths. ""I was upset. It is incredibly vivid. These are people,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The ONS data lags behind the daily death figures reported by the government. This is because it relies on death certificates, which are only often registered some days after the death, whereas the government figures are compiled from confirmed cases of deaths of patients who have tested positive for coronavirus, which can be gathered more quickly. The government figures released on Tuesday revealed there had been another 778 deaths, bringing the total to 12,107 by 17:00 BST on Monday. Another 5,252 people have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases to nearly 94,000 by 09:00 BST on Tuesday. Edna Summerfield, 94, died earlier this month after testing positive for coronavirus. Her family believes she contracted it at her care home in Birmingham before she went into hospital on 7 April. Her daughter-in-law Sylvia Summerfield said she feels people in care homes are being neglected - and called for PPE for care home staff as a matter of urgency. ""How many more elderly have got to die in care homes, infected by staff who don't know they have the virus?"" she said. ""It is a very difficult time for us and I feel like people in care homes are being neglected. ""My mother in law didn't deserve the death she had. All the other residents are vulnerable in that care home now."" The fact the government figures rely on deaths where a patient has tested positive - and in England and Northern Ireland this only covers hospital patients - has led to suggestions there has been an under-reporting of deaths in care homes and other community settings. The ONS data does look at deaths elsewhere and shows that one in 10 coronavirus deaths this year have been in the community - half, just over 200, have been in care homes. But care sector leaders are warning the true toll in care homes is much greater. Age UK says the virus is ""running wild"" in care homes with Care England, the umbrella body for care homes, estimating there have been nearly 1,000 deaths. Elderly being 'airbrushed' out of virus figures If the reports are right it could be that there has been a spike in deaths over the past fortnight or that death certificates are not picking up all the cases. The government confirmed there had been coronavirus outbreaks at more than 2,000 care homes in England - although they did not specify the number of deaths that had occurred. This video can not be played ""The carers knew the little things about mum that were important to her"" says Karin Pointon Industry leaders from Age UK, Marie Curie, Care England, Independent Age and the Alzheimer's Society called for a daily update on the situation. ""The current figures are airbrushing older people out like they don't matter,"" Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said. About 410,000 people live in care homes in the UK, living in 11,300 care homes for older people supplied by 5,500 different providers. Mr Sunak told Tuesday's briefing that care home residents and workers had ""absolutely not been forgotten"". Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle added that health bodies were aiming to have figures on coronavirus-related deaths in care homes published daily. ""In these very dispersed systems we just need to be absolutely clear that the cause of death that is attributed is correct, and that is what takes time on the death certificate to get right,"" she said.

"MPs summon China-owned firm over security concernsMPs to summon British based, Chinese-owned firm executives over plans to transfer sensitive technology.Business","A leading UK-based firm will be summoned on Tuesday by MPs to answer questions over security concerns. There are concerns that the Chinese owner of Imagination Technologies has renewed efforts to transfer ownership of sensitive security software to companies controlled by China. Lawmakers worry the coronavirus crisis is diverting attention from controversial technology transfers. The fear is that networks in the UK, Europe and the US could be compromised. Speaking to the BBC, Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee said he was concerned that technology developed by Imagination Technologies, based in Hertfordshire, could be used to fine tune the design of so-called ""backdoors"" into strategically important digital infrastructure. ""The world has changed and companies - particularly tech companies - are on the frontline,"" said Mr Tugendhat. ""Whoever writes the code, writes the rules for the world, more than any regulation passed by bureaucrats. There's no point in taking back control from Brussels, only to hand it over to Beijing."" Coronavirus: Huawei urges UK not to make 5G U-turn after pandemic US 'considers de-listing' Chinese companies Huawei: The storm over the Chinese telecoms giant Imagination Technologies was acquired by a US-based but Chinese state-owned investment firm called Canyon Bridge in September 2017, which is in turn owned by a Chinese state-owned investment fund called China Reform. Mr Tugendhat said Theresa May's government approved the acquisition on the basis that Canyon Bridge was licensed and regulated by US law. Since then it has moved its headquarters to the Cayman Islands and as such is no longer a US-controlled entity. Several senior executives, including chief executive Ron Black, have stepped down recently citing concerns about the future direction and ownership of the company. Chief product officer Steve Evans and chief technical officer John Rayfield also resigned recently. Mr Evans is understood to have said in his resignation letter: ""I will not be part of a company that is effectively controlled by the Chinese government."" An attempt by China Reform to stage a boardroom coup ten days ago by appointing four of its own directors were aborted, but the call for evidence comes amid renewed concerns that the Chinese owners of Imagination are preparing a fresh attempt to transfer sensitive technology patents to mainland China. Huawei executives were quizzed by MPs about whether China would have the ability to snoop on UK mobile network communications in April 2019 As well as designing graphics and virtual reality software for computer chips, industry experts say that Imagination also produces software which can detect whether any weaknesses in sensitive digital networks - so-called ""backdoors"" are the result of error or intention. The UK has already approved the limited use of Chinese-owned Huawei equipmentin the construction of new superfast 5G networksthat promise to deliver better connectivity for use in autonomous cars, utilities, power stations, the national health service and many others. There is no suggestion that Huawei is directly connected to Imagination, or its ultimate owners - the state-owned China Reform investment fund. The call for evidence comes a day after EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager warned that companies across the EU - many of which have been or are being pushed the brink of bankruptcy by the economic effects of Coronavirus - are vulnerable to takeover from Chinese companies. In the UK, the Treasury is considering plans for the state to take ownership stakes in thousands of businesses, to prevent mass bankruptcies of businesses unable or unwilling to take on extra debt. The situation is delicate as many EU countries are gratefully accepting donations of virus-fighting equipment from China. The country, which appears to be ""first in - first out"", is now emerging from a crisis from which it bore the initial brunt. Neither Imagination Technologies, nor its owner China Reform returned the BBC's request for comment.

Deadly olive tree disease 'could cost billions',"The impact of infection with Xylella - the trees on the right have not yet been exposed to the bacterium Researchers say the economic costs of a deadly pathogen affecting olive trees in Europe could run to over â¬20 billion. They've modelled the future worst impacts of theXylella fastidiosapathogen which has killed swathes of trees in Italy. Spread by insects, the bacterium now poses a potential threat to olive plantations in Spain and Greece. The disease could increase the costs of olive oil for consumers. Olive tree killer still threatens EU Revealed: The secret life of the spittlebug Olive killer disease reaches Spain Xylella is considered to be one of the most dangerous pathogens for plants anywhere in the world. At present there is no cure for the infection. It can infect cherry, almond and plum trees as well as olives. It has become closely associated with olives after a strain was discovered in trees in Puglia in Italy in 2013. The organism is transmitted by sap-sucking insects such as spittlebugs. The infection limits the tree's ability to move water and nutrients and over time it withers and dies. Plants infected with the bacterium have to be destroyed to prevent the spread In Italy, the consequences of the spread of the disease have been devastating, with an estimated 60% decline in crop yields since the first discovery in 2013. ""The damage to the olives also causes a depreciation of the value of the land, and to the touristic attractiveness of this region,"" said Dr Maria Saponari, from the CNR Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection in Italy. ""It's had a severe impact on the local economy and jobs connected with agriculture."" As well as in Italy, the Xylella bacterium has now been found in Spain, France and Portugal. Tackling it at present involves removing infected trees and trying to clamp down on the movement of plant material and the insects that spread the disease. But if these measures fail, what will be the financial impact of the infection? Inthis new study,,externalresearchers modelled different scenarios including what would happen if all growing ceased due to tree death. They also compared this worst case with a scenario where replanting with resistant varieties occurred. The team made projections for Italy, Spain and Greece, which between them account for 95% of European olive oil production. Olive trees dry up and ultimately die from the Xylella infecton In Spain, if the infection expanded and the majority of trees became infected and died, the costs could run to â¬17 billion over the next 50 years. A similar scenario in Italy would amount to over five billion, while in Greece, the losses would be under two billion. If the rate of infection is slowed down, or resistant varieties are planted instead, then these costs would be significantly reduced. However, the authors believe, whatever happens, there will likely be a knock-on impact on consumers. ""The expected effect could be that there would be a shortage of supply,"" said lead author Kevin Schneider from Wageningen University in the Netherlands. ""And I would expect that if prices go up, consumers will be worse off."" The authors say that while their analysis looks at economics, there are also potentially large touristic and cultural losses caused by the bacterium that can't be ignored. ""You really hear devastating stories of infected orchards that were inherited over generations,"" said Dr Schneider. ""It's the same orchard that their grandparents were once working on. So how do you put an economic number on the loss of something like this. The cultural heritage value would be far larger than we could compute."" There are a growing number of scientific initiatives to try and take the fight to the bacterium, including using insect repelling clays, vegetative barriers and genetic analysis to determine why some plants are more susceptible to the infection than others. Ultimately, the researchers believe that beating the pathogen will require trees that are resistant to the disease. ""Seeking resistant cultivars or immune species is one of the most promising, and environmentally sustainable, long-term control strategies to which the  European scientific community is devoting relevant research efforts,"" said Dr Saponari, ""Sustainable strategies to reduce the population of the insects is the other pillar for the control of the vector-borne disease, in this regard, mechanical intervention to remove weeds in spring is one of the most efficacious applications to reduce the populations of the insect, indeed several other strategies are also being studied to implement the control of the insects,"" she added. While two varieties of olive tree have been found to have some resistance, the authors are calling for research in this area to be significantly boosted.

French F1 Grand Prix set to be postponedThe French Grand Prix is set to be the next Formula 1 event to be postponed as a result of the coronavirus crisis.,"Lewis Hamilton beat Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc to win the 2019 French Grand Prix The French Grand Prix is set to be the next Formula 1 event to be postponed as a result of the coronavirus crisis. French President Emmanuel Macron said in a televised address to the nation on Monday that restrictions on public events would continue until mid-July. France's round of the F1 championship is due to be held at the Circuit Paul Ricard, near Marseille, on 28 June. F1 was unable to officially confirm the situation surrounding the race when contacted by BBC Sport. Macron said France's lockdown would be extended until 11 May, after which creches and schools would progressively reopen, while bars, restaurants, and cinemas would stay shut. There would be no summer festivals ""before mid-July"". The move seems to make it impossible to hold an event that was attended by 135,000 people last year. The race would be the 10th grand prix to be called off at the start of a season that has been laid waste by the coronavirus crisis. Formula 1: UK-based teams receive more than 20,000 orders from NHS The latest coronavirus news F1 says it is considering all options as it looks for a way to reconfigure the season later this year. The hope is the season can start in Europe in the summer, and it is possible that the first races at least could be held behind closed doors. Ross Brawn, F1's managing director, said last week that a viable World Championship seasoncould be held before the end of the year,even if the first race did not take until October. But he added that the season could run into January 2021 to fit in more races. F1 is facing a serious financial shortfall as a result of the lack of racing as all three of its main revenue streams are under threat - race-hosting fees, broadcast rights and sponsorship income. Only one race has so far been cancelled permanently, with Monaco deciding to give up on its event this year because it said it could not find a suitable alternative slot. All the others have been postponed in the hope of finding alternative dates once racing can get under way. The F1 teams are on a factory shutdown, having brought the traditional summer break forward from August so as to be in the best place possible once travel restrictions are lifted. Five of the seven UK-based teams have placed many of their staff on enforced leave as a result of the lack of action. And F1's bosses have taken a series of steps to cut costs with the future so uncertain. Measures include the postponement by a year of a major regulation change that was scheduled to come into force in 2021, and the requirement for teams to use the same cars for the 2021 season as they will this year. And bosses are in the midst of negotiations over lowering the budget cap that is set to come into force next year at $175m (Â£137.9m). A reduction to $150m has already been agreed informally and there is ameeting scheduled for this weekto discuss the idea of potentially reducing it to $125m.

Sir Lindsay Hoyle tells MPs plans for some Commons business to be held virtually are âprogressing wellâ. A reminder that the latest daily update on coronavirus from Public Health Wales reported 19 further deaths. This brings the total number of deaths in Wales so far to 403. Public Health Wales includes all deaths in hospitals and any others they are given from the wider community in their figures. Dr Robin Howe, incident director, also said 238 new cases had tested positive bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 5,848.   One in nine mortgage holders in the UK has taken a so-called ""payment holiday"" to help their financial situation as a result of coronavirus. Lenders have agreed that1.2 million homeowners can delay repaymentsas jobs are cut and wages reduced. Typically, this defers a mortgage bill of Â£775 a month for up to three months. A woman has been jailed after coughing on two officers and claiming she was infected with Covid-19, Dyfed-Powys Police has said. Ch Insp Louise Harries said the assault happened after officers went to deal with a domestic incident. The 44-year-old from Milford Haven, admitted assaulting emergency services workers, obstructing a police officer and criminal damage. Swansea magistrates jailed her for eight weeks. âOur officers had been called to deal with a domestic incident, and were assaulted as they tried to carry out their duties,"" said Ch Insp Harries. âShe also spat inside the police car, and wiped her nose on the headrest, causing officers to believe she might have further spread the virus. ""To purposely make our officers believe they might have become infected is not something Dyfed-Powys Police will take lightly.â The force said 10 officers have been assaulted in Pembrokeshire over the past few days. Tributes have been paid
to healthcare worker Leilani Medel from Bridgend who has died after contracting
coronavirus. Mrs Medel, 41, who was originally from the Philippines, died on Thursday at the Princess of Wales Hospital. Her husband Johnny remains in a critical condition in hospital having also developed symptoms. Speaking from the Philippines, Mrs Medel's aunt Shiela Ancheta said: âIt doesn't seem real
that she is gone from us. She was full of life. âWe just want her to

A campaign has been launched to for residents to record the lockdown they are living through. Flintshire council's North East Wales Archive Service is looking for diaries, photos, poems, drawings and paintings. It also wants children to write a letter to ""future children"" to explain how the current lockdown has changed their lives. It says the purpose of keeping archives is to preserve historical records to aid future understanding of events, people and places in history. Coronavirus prompts spike in mortality with data showing weekly deaths have hit a record high. Some of the drugs seized by North Wales Police A ""large quantity"" of drugs believed to have been destined for Wrexham's Berwyn Prison has been seized by police. Officers intercepted a car travelling with the drugs - despite coronavirus restrictions - on Monday, North Wales Police tweeted. The vehicle was stopped on an industrial estate, with a passenger fleeing toward a wooded area. ""If they're your drugs feel free to contact us,"" the force said on Twitter.  The Welsh Ambulance Service has asked businesses to come up with new ways to speed up cleaning its vehicles during the pandemic. Ambulances which have transported a patient suspected of coronavirus have to be decontaminated, increasing the time before the next patient can be collected. The current decontamination process takes between 30 and 45 minutes but in some cases can be a number of hours. More than 200 responses have been shortlisted. Jonathan Turnbull-Ross, the interim assistant director of quality governance, said he was ""genuinely excited by the ideas"". UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock gives assurances to Scotland and the other devolved nations after a row about supplies. The 2020 Tour de France looks set to be postponed after the French government's decision today to extend the ban on mass gatherings because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Scientists to review impact of virus lockdown,"This video can not be played Baroness Altman says the health system is ""staked against"" care homes Many older people are being ""airbrushed"" out of coronavirus figures in the UK, charities have warned. The official death toll has been criticised for only covering people who die in hospital - but not those in care homes or in their own houses. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told the BBC the daily figure was based on hospital deaths because ""it's accurate and quick"". Meanwhile, scientists will begin a review of the UK lockdown later. The evaluation will be passed to the government - butministers have said it was unlikely restrictions would change. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, which include every community death linked to Covid-19 in England and Wales, showed a total of 406 such deaths registered up to 3 April had occurred outside of hospitals. That would have added an extra 11% to the official UK figures, based solely on deaths in hospitals, that were being reported at that time. Of those extra deaths, 217 took place in care homes, 33 in hospices, 136 in private homes, three in other communal establishments and 17 elsewhere. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has said details about the number of coronavirus-related deaths in care homesremain unclear, but it was reported last week that there were cases of Covid-19in 20 care homes across the nation. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Industry leaders from Age UK, Marie Curie, Care England, Independent Age and the Alzheimer's Society have written to Health Secretary Matt Hancockdemanding a care package to support social care through the pandemic,external. They have also called for a daily update on deaths in the care system. It comes after the government confirmed there had been coronavirus outbreaks at more than 2,000 care homes in England - although they did not specify the number of deaths that had occurred. The figures prompted the charity Age UK to claim coronavirus is ""running wild"" in care homes for elderly people. ""The current figures are airbrushing older people out like they don't matter,"" Caroline Abrahams, the charity's director, said. Meanwhile, Britain's largest care home operator, HC-One, said coronavirus was present in two-thirds - 232 - of the group's care homes. Its director, Sir David Behan, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that coronavirus deaths represented about one-third of all deaths at HC-One's care homes over the last three weeks. HC-One has 329 care homes throughout England, Scotland and Wales. MHA, a charity which operates 131 homes, said there had been 210 coronavirus-related deaths. About 410,000 people,externallive in care homes in the UK, living in 11,300 care homes for older people supplied by 5,500 different providers. Addressing why deaths in care homes are not being included in the government's data, Ms Coffey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the figures published weekly by the ONS is a ""fair"" way of establishing the ""unfortunate picture"" of where deaths are occurring. England's care home regulator, the Care Quality Commission, has said it will begin recording deaths in adult social care from this week - asking care providers to give daily updates on the number of confirmed and suspected cases. Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall said daily figures were essential to dealing with the ""emerging crisis"" in care homes and called for the government to offer social care ""whatever resources it needs"". Nurse 'paid ultimate price' for lack of PPE Coronavirus: 'John was alone for a week' Will face masks become the new norm? Conservative peer and former work and pensions minister Baroness Altmann told Today that ""one or two"" people in care homes had said to her they felt as though older people are being treated ""like lambs to the slaughter"". ""They [care homes] are left without protective equipment, they are left without testing,"" she said. She added that ""the mark of a civilised society"" was ""how it treats it most vulnerable and oldest citizens"". It comes after Ms Abrahams said care homes were ""underprepared"" for the outbreak, adding that the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing was leading to the spread of coronavirus across the care home sector. However, Ms Coffey told the Today programme that the care sector was not being left behind, adding that PPE was being delivered ""to over 26,000 care settings across the country including care homes, home care providers and also hospices"". On Monday, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty told the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing that 92 homes in the UK reported outbreaks in one day. The Department of Health and Social Care later confirmed 2,099 care homes in England have so far had cases of the virus. Care England has estimated there have been nearly 1,000 deaths from coronavirus in care homes, leaving social care as ""the neglected front line"". The Labour Party has called on the government to publish daily figures of deaths in care homes to highlight the ""true scale"" of the spread of the virus, which causes the Covid-19 disease. The issue has regularly been raised by journalists at the daily Downing Street briefing and the government response has been that the number announced each day is based on hospital figures as this can be quickly gathered and analysed - whereas deaths in the wider community take much longer to be collated after death certificates are issued by doctors. The government says it is following the international standard by quoting the hospital figures each day - and that the fuller ONS figures can lag many days behind. The latest care homes to confirm residents have died with symptoms of the virus includea home in Drumchapel, Glasgow, a specialistdementia home in Selston, Nottinghamshire, and a home in County Durham where13 residents have died. The Department of Health's official death number of deaths of people in hospital with coronavirus rose to 11,329 on Monday - up by 717 in a day. The BBC's science editor David Shukman said the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) meeting later in the day will evaluate various ways coronavirus is unfolding in the UK. It will look at hospital admissions, the approach to testing, data on intensive care capacity and deaths, the effectiveness of lockdown tactics, and whether or not the public should be advised to wear face masks outdoors. Meanwhile, the government has defended itself after reports it missed three chances to bulk-buy PPE for healthcare workers treating virus patients. Health workers in 25 EU countries are set to receive deliveries of kit worth Â£1.3bn in the coming days, according to the Guardian. The paper reports the UK missed three opportunities,externalto join the scheme and has not taken part in talks on future purchases. The Department of Health said it would ""consider participating in future EU joint procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time"". ""We will continue to work with European countries and others in order to make sure that we can increase the capacity within the NHS,"" they said.

24 hours in New York's virus fight,"By last Tuesday, the death toll from coronavirus in New York City had passed that of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. The figure was reached only three weeks after the first coronavirus death in the city. The outbreak has placed New York at the centre of the global pandemic and put an unprecedented strain on the city's emergency workers and frontline staff. Over the course of Tuesday, six of those people - two doctors, an undertaker, two senior care home staff and a food delivery worker - kept diaries of their day and shared them with the BBC. This is their story. Kathleen Flanagan returns from a late shift at a nursing home. The TV is on in the living room, playing the sitcom That '70s Show.  As has become the custom in her household she shouts ""Hello"" to let her family know that she is home and to make sure they avoid contact with her. She heads downstairs into the laundry room, takes off her clothes and showers. Everything she has worn at work must go into the washing machine before she sees her husband and children. When she heads back up the stairs, she is greeted by a bouquet of sunflowers in the kitchen. A card from her eight-year-old son reads: ""Keep kicking butt Mom!"" Two of her three sons are asleep on the couch waiting for her. She cooks eggs and spinach for dinner and shares details of her day with her husband - the good news is that coronavirus patients in one of the centres she oversees are starting to look better, but in another the situation is getting worse. She opens her laptop to do some work and falls asleep somewhere between 01:00 and 02:00. Doctor Jennifer Haythe is woken by a call from the intensive care unit at her hospital, letting her know about a Covid-19 patient whose condition is deteriorating. The 46-year-old hangs up the phone and tosses and turns in bed, worrying about the patient. She rethinks the plan for them and then is met by the increasingly familiar feeling of loneliness. 'Like 9/11 every day': A New York paramedic's diary Like many healthcare professionals working with coronavirus patients, Jennifer is living separately from her family. She is staying in an apartment in Greenwich Village, while her husband and children are in their house upstate. Faced with an eerie silence outside and missing her loved ones, she does a deep breathing exercise: ""In for four, hold for seven, out for eight."" It must work because she falls asleep. Outside the city, in the New York state town of Corinth, Faith Willett, a director of nursing at a care home, is woken by a member of staff reporting a high fever. She advises her to self-isolate and contact a doctor as soon as possible. Faith feels sick and struggles to fall back to sleep. She scrolls through her phone to see the latest news on the coronavirus outbreak, paying close attention to local updates that might be worrying residents and their families. In deserted Times Square, a Muslim woman prays on Tuesday The news feels so surreal that the 46-year-old nurse wonders if she's asleep. She wakes her husband to ask if she's dreaming. ""No, babes, you're awake,"" he replies. He tells her to get some rest. After a few hours of disturbed sleep, she wakes to her alarm. She grabs her computer and scans the latest updates from her colleagues. She can breathe a sigh of relief. There are no confirmed cases - for now. Funeral director Steven Baxter is already out of the house. His hours have completely changed since the virus struck, as he and funeral workers across New York struggle to keep up with the rising number of fatalities. The days of wearing a suit to work are gone. He now dons ""scrubs"" that he can throw out afterwards, without risking cross-contamination. The trainers he wears to work are always kept outside. He sets off to a nursing home, where he has to collect the body of yet another coronavirus victim. It is the first of several such visits he will have to make that day. Back in Greenwich Village, doctor Jennifer Hayth wakes up to her alarm. She opens her eyes with the fleeting hope that the past few weeks have been a bad dream. She has a shower and gets ready for work. There are no dogs for her to walk, no husband to kiss goodbye and no children to prepare breakfast for. She heads to a coffee shop where a woman walking her dog notices her doctor's uniform and thanks her. In the cafe, the only other customer - a retired police officer - pays for her coffee. Nursing home worker Kathleen (L), doctor Jennifer (C), delivery driver Sarujen (R) The Cat Stevens song Peace Train comes on the radio as she drives to work at Columbia University Medical Center. She hasn't heard it for a while and it makes her feel energised. She looks over the highway at the USNS Comfort - a Navy hospital ship docked in New York City where coronavirus patients are being treated - and thinks to herself that it seems almost majestic. Arriving at work, she puts on her mask, gown, gloves and other equipment required for working with coronavirus patients and heads over for another day in the ICU. Nurse Kathleen Flanagan wakes to a hug from her eight-year-old son. Before she leaves the house, he performs a dance to the song High Hopes by the band Panic! At the Disco. She listens to it again in the car, applying the lyrics to her own life. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated... Had to have high, high hopes for a living As she listens to the song, she passes the traffic light where last month she received a phone call that changed everything. A colleague at a nursing and rehabilitation centre in New York City told her that two residents had fevers and respiratory symptoms - the first signs of coronavirus in any of the six Centers Health Care facilities she oversees. She was heading to a different centre at the time and was faced with the decision of whether to help remotely or change her plans and put herself on the frontlines of the outbreak. She turned her car around. Her normal job does not include direct patient care. But three weeks later, she continues to take a hands-on role at the centres with coronavirus patients in spite of the risks. At the Glens Falls Center nursing home, Faith Willett has been at work for about an hour and there is already cause for concern. Before leaving the house this morning, she said her personal mantra aloud to herself in the shower: ""We've got this."" Like every day in recent weeks, she hoped there would be no signs of coronavirus in the centre. But as a nurse walked out of a resident's room during the routine morning checks, Faith could tell from her eyes it was bad news - the resident had a high temperature and was getting short of breath while reading her Bible. Coronavirus has forced carers like Faith Willett to go against all their natural instincts All the staff at the home know this might end up being the day the virus made its way in. Masks need to be issued and the door to the resident's room must be closed, with only designated caregivers in full protective equipment allowed in. Faith considers the order. You should never close a door to a resident's room unless they ask you to - it's a violation of their rights; it's forced isolation; it's mistreatment, she thinks. But she reminds herself that they must go against all their instincts as caregivers to save lives. A nurse in full protective equipment goes into the room to perform the test. There are tears in the nurse's eyes but they soften as she walks in. She completes the test, packages it and takes it to the lab. Faith admires the woman's bravery for being able to do it. Steven Baxter is sorting through death certificates and other documentation at Gannon Funeral Home in Manhattan. The phone line has just opened so he is preparing for another day of calls from families who have lost loved ones to the virus. The 53-year-old recently converted the chapel in the funeral home into a morgue. He has a rule: the dead need to be treated with respect and given adequate space. But the number of bodies coming in is hard to keep up with. Later today he will need to take the bodies of eight Covid-19 patients to be cremated, and to chase a supplier about cremation boxes, which are increasingly in short supply. It will be about three weeks before the person he collected this morning can be cremated - the pandemic has put a strain on the system, creating major backlogs. All his days are merging into one at the moment. The ""removal"" this morning was like any other in the time of coronavirus - he put on a respirator and other protective equipment, and used disinfectant spray as he worked to ensure he was safely transferring the body. People not directly on the frontline are also performing critical jobs to prevent the virus spreading. Since the pandemic began, doctor Michael Morgenstern has swapped his subway commute for a walk upstairs. This morning, he logs on to video conferencing platform Zoom for his first appointment of the day. Many of his patients are elderly and part of his role now is explaining the risks of coronavirus to them, and the precautions they should take. People queue at a food distribution centre in Harlem The first patient wants to go out and visit two other doctors. Michael asks the son, who is also on the call, to try to see if the appointments can be conducted over the phone or through a video platform. He is concerned about people exposing themselves to the virus and has spent much of his morning up to now working on a petition calling for the public to wear non-medical face masks, in line with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control. He repeats the mantra ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" to himself as he works. His legs shake as he begins his second appointment of the day. He's nervous about what's happening in the world. Faith Willett gets a call from the nurse who fell ill - she can't get tested and has instead been labelled ""presumed positive"". Faith is angry about the lack of testing for a frontline worker. She worries that the residents may have been exposed and then finds herself wondering - selfishly, she thinks -  if she too might have been. Five other people working at the home have been tested for Covid-19 because of symptoms - four were negative and the fifth is pending. Faith and her colleagues all worry about the same thing: they don't want to be the person who brings the virus into the facility. At another nursing and rehabilitation home, Kathleen Flanagan has spent much of the morning checking on residents with coronavirus symptoms. The hospital calls to discuss returning one long-term resident, assuring her that he is alert and responsive. Two others are at the hospital. One is not doing well. When asked who his next of kin are, she replies: ""We are his family."" She urges the doctor to fight for him. At the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, a hospital worker takes a moment to pause Michael Morgenstern sees his next patient via video call. An elderly person with cancer. The cancer appears to be spreading but while the patient is continuing with chemotherapy, they are holding off on adding radiation treatment for now because of the Covid-19 risk. Michael is worried. He advises relatives who are still going outside to consider wearing face masks when they are around the patient. He continues to see patients and work with volunteers for his coronavirus campaign throughout the morning. One of the patients was born only shortly after the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, he thinks to himself. Doctor Jennifer Haythe is carrying out rounds in the ICU. Everyone she sees is a Covid-19 patient. They are all on ventilators. She passes colleagues but can only see their eyes. In them she sees stress, but also hope and courage. A patient is transported through Jennifer's hospital in Manhattan As she attends to sick and dying patients she thinks about what it must be like for them and their families. ""A hospital without visitors. What is that?"" she asks herself. Sarujen Sivakumar, a 22-year-old Lebanese-born delivery team manager for Eat Offbeat - a catering company led by immigrants and refugees - heads out to work. Like many businesses across New York, his company has had to re-model amid the pandemic and now sells coronavirus ""care packages"" of a week's worth of meals and snacks. As he begins his journey, he is struck again by how quiet the city is. In the six years since he arrived here as a refugee, he has never seen it like this. There are no groups talking to each other, no performers at the subway station. He feels almost as if he is in a video game. Before the outbreak, he would greet his colleagues with special handshakes and hugs. But as he walks into the kitchen today, he knows he has to keep his distance. At the Glens Falls nursing home, it is visiting time. Faith and her colleagues bring residents into the dining room where there are big windows through which they can see their relatives. Families wait outside in their cars and take turns coming to the windows. They have agreed to limit their visits to 10 minutes each. As emotional reunions take place through the glass, Faith observes the range of tears being shed - joy, laughter, sadness and, of course, fear. The chefs at Sarujen's company say they are too scared to take the train to work any more, but also worry about how they would survive financially if the company stops running. Sarujen knows how hard he and others at the company worked to get where they are today. He worries that if it closes, it won't be the same again in the future. There is little time to talk about it in depth as they have deliveries to get on with. Steven Baxter heads to a funeral home to collect the body of another coronavirus victim. He received a call the previous day from a man whose father had died. He couldn't afford what the company was charging for a cremation and needed someone else to take over. As he collects the body, Steven is angry about what he sees as exploitation of victims of a health crisis. He believes the price that was being charged is four times the average in the city. It's the news everyone had been dreading. The result for the fifth employee tested at Faith Willett's home comes back positive. She tells herself there's no time to feel - she needs to act. She begins the difficult process of alerting residents and their families. Messages in support of medical staff have appeared outside Mount Sinai West Medical Center While speaking to a patient earlier in the day who was unable to get a mask, doctor Michael Morgenstern shows him how to fashion one out of a T-shirt. He decides others may also need to see how to do this so shoots a video andshares it online,external. As Sarujen drops off his last package, he gets a call asking him to join a team meeting about the future of the company. At the meeting, they agree that the delivery drivers will take the chefs to and from work so they can avoid trains. He is happy that he can continue working but exhausted from stress over the virus and the day's concerns over his job. Steven Baxter returns home from the funeral home but his day isn't over. His twin sons are playing basketball in the backyard. They ask him if he has to shower. When he says yes, they know what sort of day he must have had. For the next few hours, he deals with calls from more bereaved families. He doesn't have time to speak with his wife, who is also a funeral director. He falls asleep before his children. He has to be at another nursing home to collect another body at 04:00. Jennifer has a hot bath and is ready to crawl into bed. Even though her hours haven't changed, she feels much more exhausted than before. As she responds to more texts about patient care, she reviews how she feels. Achy, tired, sore throat. She wonders if she should get tested. Faith Willett gets a call from a nurse who says she can't do an upcoming shift. She isn't unwell but news has got around about today's positive result at the nursing home. The nurse's skills and training are invaluable. Faith can't understand the woman's decision, which she sees as jumping ship at a time of crisis. Jennifer watches an episode of TV sitcom Friends. It is all she can manage to watch these days - she struggles to focus on anything too heavy. She has a goodnight FaceTime with her children before turning out the lights. She hasn't seen them in person for eight days. As she closes her eyes, she makes a mental note: ""Thank the cast of Friends when this is over."" Kathleen Flanagan has been home for about an hour. It was the usual routine - a shout of ""hello"" to the family again, clothes in the washing machine again, a shower again. She has time for only one meal a day at the moment. Today it was eggs and spinach, again. She goes to sleep with The Office playing on Netflix. It is her winding-down time before she has to start again. But her phone stays close in case anyone needs her. There are only a few hours before Faith has to start work again. She has been trying to get some rest but is woken by an email reminder from the department of health about an upcoming call about the virus. There has been no news from her nursing home of new or worsening symptoms. But that doesn't mean she can relax. Throughout this day, Tuesday 7 April, another 779 people died of coronavirus in New York state - a new high. This grim record is surpassed again the next day.

'Don't expect changes to UK virus lockdown yet',"The government does not expect to make changes to coronavirus lockdown restrictions this week, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary said the UK's plan ""is working"" but that ""we are still not past the peak of this virus"". ""Keep this up, we have come too far, lost too many loved ones and sacrificed too much to ease up,"" he said. It came as the government said it might change its advice to the public on wearing face masks outdoors. Will face masks become the new norm? The UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the daily Downing Street news conference the guidance was subject to an ongoing review. He added that the government had already seen ""more persuasive"" data suggesting masks can stop a person passing the virus to someone else, rather than preventing them from catching it. The World Health Organization said,externalit remains the case that medical masks should be reserved for healthcare workers, not the general public. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health LOCKDOWN:How do we lift restrictions? Mr Raab - who is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he recovers from coronavirus - said a meeting of scientific advisers would take place to review evidence relating to the current lockdown restrictions this week. ""We don't expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point and we won't until we're confident, as confident as we realistically can be, that any such changes can be safely made,"" he said. He told the news conference that easing restrictions too early would ""risk a second wave"" of infections. Responding to claims the government lacks an exit strategy, Mr Raab said it was ""crucially important that we do not take our eye off the ball or the public's focus"" off social distancing measures. He admitted the government had been ""concerned"" people ""might start ignoring the advice or cutting corners given the temptation to go out into the sunshine"" over the Easter weekend. However, he said the ""overwhelming"" majority of people stayed at home. Speaking on ITV's Coronavirus Q&A programme, Sir Patrick Vallance said of the lockdown: ""It is important that we continue it long enough and that we do not just say 'victory - remove it immediately in totality'. ""The next phase of this is understanding how and when to release these measures in a way that is safe."" The number of deaths in UK hospitals has risen to 11,329 - up by 717 since Sunday. The Department of Health said a further 4,342 people had tested positive for coronavirus as of 09:00 BST on Monday. It has become a vexed issue in this pandemic and the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the country's stance was being reviewed. So far the UK has advised against the use of face masks by the general public. There remains concern that wearing one gives people a false sense of security leading to them slacking off other measures such as hand washing. But the United States changed its mind and recommends that even healthy people do wear them. That shift was in part due to the science showing people were infectious for a day before they start showing symptoms. The World Health Organization's special envoy on coronavirus, Dr David Nabarro, said he thought wearing face masks would become the ""norm"". He said the priority was health care workers and then for people who have the disease to minimise their risk of spreading it. But in the future he can see face masks being recommended for people who can't socially distance in their jobs, such as hairdressers, and then eventually everyone. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, told the briefing that 92 care homes had detected an outbreak of coronavirus in the last day alone. ""If an outbreak is suspected public health authorities will go in to do testing to check if an outbreak has taken place,"" he said. The Department of Health later confirmed to the BBC that coronavirus outbreaks have been detected at 2,099 facilities in England so far. Prof Whitty added that he would like to have ""much more extensive testing"" in care homes due to the ""large numbers of vulnerable people"" there. ""One of the things we want to do is to extend the amount of testing of people in care homes as the ability to test ramps up over the next few weeks,"" he said. Liz Kendall, Labour's shadow minister for social care, called on the government to publish daily figures of deaths in care homes ""so we know the true scale of the problem and how fast it is spreading"". It came as 13 residents of one 72-bed care home in County Durham were confirmed to havedied after displaying symptoms of coronavirus. Meanwhile, Sir Patrick warned the number of deaths recorded in the UK is likely to rise in the coming days before they could plateau. He said: ""I think this week we are going to see a further increase, thereafter we should see a plateau as the effects of social-distancing come through. That plateau may last for some time and begin to decrease.""

The US clothing firms now making gowns and gloves,"The US, like other countries, is grappling with shortages of medical supplies, but shies away from central directives In a normal year Michael Rubin's athletic apparel factory in Pennsylvania would be ramping up for the start of baseball season, churning out team uniforms and clothing to sell to fans. Instead his company, Fanatics, has remade itself into a gown and mask manufacturer for hospitals facing shortages of protective gear as they fight the coronavirus. Fanatics isn't alone. Thousands of companies across the US have responded to pleas for help from hospitals facing shortages of critical health supplies. Clothing companies like Gap and Hanes are making gowns and scrubs. Ford and General Motors are repurposing fans and batteries, typically used in cars, to make ventilators. Boeing and Apple are making face shields.  Luxury brands, distilleries - even state prisoners - are producing hand sanitiser. ""We felt it was our responsibility to help pitch in,"" says Mr Rubin. Firms responding in what he calls this ""dire time of need"" aren't necessarily going to profit from the enterprise but they are proving a point: The private sector is famously good at responding nimbly and quickly to changing demands. Fanatics used baseball uniform material to make non-surgical masks The shortages in the US are are not unique, nor is the response from the private sector. In the UK, engineering firm Dyson has designed a new ventilator; in France, Chanel is contributing masks; in Germany, Volkswagen and other firms are manufacturing protective equipment. But the White House has been notably hands-off when it comes to establishing any co-ordinated, centralised response, says Nada Sanders, professor of supply chain management at Northeastern University. This has led to a free-for-all, as local governments and hospitals competed to buy products or find donations, scam artists emerged, and prices skyrocketed. The US has allowed ""pure capitalism to serve as an incentive"" says Dr Sanders. ""Companies want to step up to the plate and so many are. I really applaud them, but I also find it even more frustrating because I see the chaos."" What are ventilators and why are they important? Coronavirus: New York warns of major medical shortages Coronavirus: Can we 3D-print our way out of the PPE shortage? In the European Union, the shortages were caused by inadequate reserves of equipment, as coronavirus cases surged and shipments from overseas were delayed. But in the US, which has a national stockpile of supplies, including badly-needed ventilators, a slow federal response has added to the problem, says Prashant Yadav, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and a professor at INSEAD. ""Outcomes are pretty bad in both [Europe and America], but in one place they don't have large resources in a stockpile. They didn't have a large manufacturing base,"" he says. ""Our decision-making wasn't working right or our coordinating mechanisms weren't working right."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lack of medical supplies 'a national shame' Converting factories to make basic products like sanitiser or masks isn't necessarily that difficult or expensive. Mr Rubin's factory shipped its first masks within three days and now produces about 10,000 daily. But getting companies to start making machines like ventilators - which have dozens of parts sourced globally - is far more complex and requires government intervention, says Dr Sanders. While some states, including California, have voluntarily sent existing ventilators to virus hotspots like New York, Dr Sanders says a national response is needed, to ensure there is a clear inventory of what's on hand and the ability to shift resources to the places that need it most. ""This is supply chain 101 ... it's not like it's really that hard,"" she says. ""The lack of coordinated national response is really infuriating."" Under pressure to act, President Donald Trump has targeted some companies with orders to produce items in high demand and banned exports of medical supplies. Federal health officials also announced a $50m deal with General Motors to produce 30,000 ventilators. But for weeks Mr Trump resisted using the full extent of his authority to compel firms to produce equipment and prioritise deliveries. Mr Trump has suggested a government report about shortages was politically motivated ""We're a country not based on nationalising our business,"" he said last month. ""Call a person over in Venezuela. Ask them, how did nationalisation of their businesses work out? Not too well. The concept of nationalising our business is not a good concept."" New York Senator Chuck Schumer, a leading Democrat, last week called on the president to appoint a national 'czar' to oversee distribution and production. ""The hunting and pecking isn't working,"" he told reporters. It is not clear that the president will change tack. Luckily in some places the private sector efforts are coming through. St Luke's University Health Network, which worked with Fanatics to design its masks, now has about 30 days worth of protective gear on hand, says vice president Chad Brisendine. Contributions from non-traditional suppliers account for ""a quarter or more"" of that. ""Between the external, local, non-traditional suppliers, plus the donations, that really helped us,"" Mr Brisendine says. But the Pennsylvania hospital system has still been forced to introduce new cleaning procedures so it can reuse masks and other equipment more intensively, he adds. Mr Brisendine says he's worried the wider needs are so great, even a stronger federal response wouldn't resolve the problems his health network now faces. ""I just wonder how fast they can move,"" he says. ""When you need it, you needed it yesterday.""

Here are their stories. After that White House briefing from the president, weâre pausing our live page coverage for the time being. If youâve been following our updates, thanks for joining us. To recap, here are some of the dayâs key developments:  Our teams in Asia will be back with you soon, bringing you all the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic from the US and across the world. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington At one level, Trump's move is about the coronavirus. Administration officials have been sharply accusing the WHO of missteps in the handling of the pandemic, saying it was biased towards China. They say the WHO was too ready to support Chinaâs deceptive early claims about the virus and then didnât push hard enough against Beijingâs attempts to cover up its misinformation. In particular President Trump has latched onto the WHOâs criticism of his travel restrictions against China. But at another level, this move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to curtail Chinaâs growing global influence, especially in international organisations. The Wall Street Journal reports that the decision stems from an ongoing discussion on whether to link US aid dollars to the number of Americans working in the groups that receive them. Trump ends the press conference after less than 90 minutes, cutting short one reporter who wanted to ask a second question on behalf of a colleague who could not attend today. ""Who cares,"" says the president with a shrug. No other members of the coronavirus task force, such as Vice-President Mike Pence, Dr Anthony Fauci or Dr Deborah Birx, spoke today. Trump is asked why he previously praised China's ""transparency"" but is today saying their ""so-called transparency"" cost lives. ""Well you know if Iâm so good to China then why am I the only person that closed our border so tightly to China?"" he hits back. ""I don't talk about China's transparency!"" he adds. In fact, on 24 January, whilst negotiating a trade deal, Trump tweeted: ""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency."" Furthermore, other countries have also tightened their borders, and banned non-essential travel, in response to the outbreak. This exchange with the reporter arose because, earlier in this press conference, Trump said he was pulling US funding to the WHO because the agency ""defended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising its so-called transparency"". Airports have been emptied amid the pandemic The US has agreed a roughly $25bn (Â£19.8bn) rescue package for 10 of the country's biggest airlines as travel plunges due to the coronavirus. American Airlines, United, Delta and Southwest are among the recipients. The money is to be provided through a combination of low-cost loans and direct grants. Congress had planned for the aid as part of its roughly $2.2tn emergency relief bill last month, but airlines had hesitated over some of the conditions. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said the airline deal would ""support American workers and help preserve the strategic importance of the airline industry while allowing for appropriate compensation to the taxpayers"". ""We look forward to working with the airlines to finalise the necessary agreements and disburse funds as quickly as possible."" The president says: âWe have to get our sports back. I'm tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old.â The National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, National Hockey League have all either cancelled or delayed their seasons amid the pandemic. A sign at the closed Banc of California stadium in LA tells people to stay home Trump has been feuding with governors over who has the right to end lockdowns. But in a change of tone on Tuesday, he said: ""The governors are responsible, they have to take charge and do a great job."" He said the plans to reopen the country are close to being finalised and could be even earlier than 1 May. ""I will be speaking to all 50 governors very shortly and I will then be authorising each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their state at a time and in a manner as most appropriate."" He added: ""The federal government will be watching them closely. We will hold governors accountable, but will be working with them to make sure it goes really well."" Experts agree it's the state governors who are responsible for policing their states under US law. He said that governors âare going to do a great job of leading."" âAnd if weâre unhappy with a state, weâre going to let them know that weâre unhappy,"" he added. Zoos that should have been crowded in the sunny Easter holidays are now hard up, asking for donations, as the coronavirus lockdown bites. A zoo director in northern Germany has even admitted that some animals might soon have to be fed to others. ""We've listed the animals we'll have to slaughter first,"" NeumÃ¼nster Zoo's Verena Kaspari told Die Welt newspaper. She said killing some animals so that others could live would be a last resort, but even that would not solve the financial problem. Read more on this story here. The panda twins in Berlin Zoo would draw big crowds in normal times ""Many countries said they were going to listen to the WHO and they have problems now the likes of which they cannot believe,"" Trump continues. He adds: ""The world received all sorts of false information about misinformation and mortality."" If the WHO had gone to China to oversee the outbreak, mores lives would have been saved, he claims, adding that ""their reliance on China's disclosures... likely caused a 20-fold increase in cases worldwide and it may be much more than that."" ""So much death has been caused by their mistakes,"" he says. The US president previously praised China's role in containing the virus in this tweet, sent a few days after the two countries signed a trade deal. Allow Twitter content?

Trump also accused the WHO of putting political correctness above saving lives and taking China's claims about the outbreak at face value. Mr Trump has accused the WHO of being biased towards China in recent weeks, and recently attacked the organisation for being too âChina-centricâ in its tackling of the coronavirus pandemic. US financial contributions to the WHO accounted for just under 15% of its funding in 2019. The US decided against using a coronavirus test approved by the WHOin January, in favour of a test being developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - but some of them did not work properly, and led to inconclusive results. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the first African head of the WHO, has beenaccused of being too cozy with China in the past. ""I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to access the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" says Trump. ""The WHO failed in its basic duty and it must be held accountable,"" he adds. The White House coronavirus task force briefing has begun. You canwatch it live here. It comes a day after President Trump pilloried the media, argued with reporters, and played in the briefing room a campaign-style video praising his handling of the pandemic. California governor Gavin Newsom has warned that mass gatherings of hundreds or thousands of people are likely to be banned until at least summer. He made the announcement during a news conference on Tuesday, where he also said that stay-at-home orders could be loosened âa few weeksâ after evidence shows the rate of coronavirus infections and deaths are decreasing. He warned that things would be changing in the state and some measures may stay in place for some time. âYou may have dinner where the waiter is wearing gloves and maybe a face mask, where menus may be disposable, where your temperature is checked as you walk into the restaurant,â he said. Mass gatherings in the state, such as Coachella festival, have already been rescheduled or cancelled. A group of high school pupils in Calgary, Canada, have created a hotline for elderly people stuck under lockdown to hear a young human voice. The free telephone line, 1-877-JOY-4ALL, offers recordings of stories, jokes, letters, poetry, music and words of encouragement. New recordings, including in other languages, are being added every day. ""During these challenging times and ongoing public health measures, we know that it is especially difficult for seniors and folks experiencing isolation,"" their website says.

Franceâs foreign minister has summoned the Chinese ambassador following comments made on the embassy's website about western countriesâ handling of Covid-19. The comments were made by an unnamed diplomat and in part suggested that pensioners had been left to die in nursing homes. Yves Le Drian said he expressed his disapproval to ambassador Lu Shaye on Tuesday. In a statement he said: âCertain publicly voiced opinions by representatives of the Chinese embassy in France are not in line with the quality of the bilateral relation between our two countries.â Angela was 34 weeks pregnant when she was put into a coma A US mother who was pregnant when she tested positive for Covid-19, has delivered her baby daughter while in a medically induced coma. Angela Primachenko, a 27-year-old respiratory therapist from Vancouver, Washington, was on a ventilator when doctors chose to induce labour in order to increase her odds of beating the illness and for the child's own safety. ""I feel like I'm a miracle walking,"" she told NBC News after tests showed that she was now Covid-negative. Primachenko was 33 weeks pregnant when she became ill on 24 March.

""You know if somebody else endorsed that medication it would be great,"" he said, claiming that US media has remained skeptical just because he has supported it. ""But it's OK. The word is out.

'Don't expect changes to UK virus lockdown yet'The government says it could change its advice on using face masks if evidence supported such a move.,"The government does not expect to make changes to coronavirus lockdown restrictions this week, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary said the UK's plan ""is working"" but that ""we are still not past the peak of this virus"". ""Keep this up, we have come too far, lost too many loved ones and sacrificed too much to ease up,"" he said. It came as the government said it might change its advice to the public on wearing face masks outdoors. Will face masks become the new norm? The UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the daily Downing Street news conference the guidance was subject to an ongoing review. He added that the government had already seen ""more persuasive"" data suggesting masks can stop a person passing the virus to someone else, rather than preventing them from catching it. The World Health Organization said,externalit remains the case that medical masks should be reserved for healthcare workers, not the general public. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health LOCKDOWN:How do we lift restrictions? Mr Raab - who is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he recovers from coronavirus - said a meeting of scientific advisers would take place to review evidence relating to the current lockdown restrictions this week. ""We don't expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point and we won't until we're confident, as confident as we realistically can be, that any such changes can be safely made,"" he said. He told the news conference that easing restrictions too early would ""risk a second wave"" of infections. Responding to claims the government lacks an exit strategy, Mr Raab said it was ""crucially important that we do not take our eye off the ball or the public's focus"" off social distancing measures. He admitted the government had been ""concerned"" people ""might start ignoring the advice or cutting corners given the temptation to go out into the sunshine"" over the Easter weekend. However, he said the ""overwhelming"" majority of people stayed at home. Speaking on ITV's Coronavirus Q&A programme, Sir Patrick Vallance said of the lockdown: ""It is important that we continue it long enough and that we do not just say 'victory - remove it immediately in totality'. ""The next phase of this is understanding how and when to release these measures in a way that is safe."" The number of deaths in UK hospitals has risen to 11,329 - up by 717 since Sunday. The Department of Health said a further 4,342 people had tested positive for coronavirus as of 09:00 BST on Monday. It has become a vexed issue in this pandemic and the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the country's stance was being reviewed. So far the UK has advised against the use of face masks by the general public. There remains concern that wearing one gives people a false sense of security leading to them slacking off other measures such as hand washing. But the United States changed its mind and recommends that even healthy people do wear them. That shift was in part due to the science showing people were infectious for a day before they start showing symptoms. The World Health Organization's special envoy on coronavirus, Dr David Nabarro, said he thought wearing face masks would become the ""norm"". He said the priority was health care workers and then for people who have the disease to minimise their risk of spreading it. But in the future he can see face masks being recommended for people who can't socially distance in their jobs, such as hairdressers, and then eventually everyone. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, told the briefing that 92 care homes had detected an outbreak of coronavirus in the last day alone. ""If an outbreak is suspected public health authorities will go in to do testing to check if an outbreak has taken place,"" he said. The Department of Health later confirmed to the BBC that coronavirus outbreaks have been detected at 2,099 facilities in England so far. Prof Whitty added that he would like to have ""much more extensive testing"" in care homes due to the ""large numbers of vulnerable people"" there. ""One of the things we want to do is to extend the amount of testing of people in care homes as the ability to test ramps up over the next few weeks,"" he said. Liz Kendall, Labour's shadow minister for social care, called on the government to publish daily figures of deaths in care homes ""so we know the true scale of the problem and how fast it is spreading"". It came as 13 residents of one 72-bed care home in County Durham were confirmed to havedied after displaying symptoms of coronavirus. Meanwhile, Sir Patrick warned the number of deaths recorded in the UK is likely to rise in the coming days before they could plateau. He said: ""I think this week we are going to see a further increase, thereafter we should see a plateau as the effects of social-distancing come through. That plateau may last for some time and begin to decrease.""
