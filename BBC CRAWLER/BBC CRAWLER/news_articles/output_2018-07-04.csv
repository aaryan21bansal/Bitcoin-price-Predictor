The six-year-old's body was found on the Isle of Bute on Monday, just hours after she was reported missing. Detectives working on the case said they were still seeking information from the public, especially anyone who was in the Ardbeg Road area where Alesha's body was found. The lead detective described the arrest as a ""major development"". Additional police officers were sent to the Isle of Bute to assist with the investigation Det Supt Stuart Houston said: ""The response to our earlier public appeals has been significant. ""However... I am still appealing for anyone who was in the Ardbeg Road area of Bute on Sunday night or in the early hours of Monday and who may have information about Alesha's death to contact us. ""Anyone who has CCTV at their home or business, or indeed any motorists with dashcam footage which might help with our investigation are also urged to get in touch.""

Jaguar boss: Brexit threatens investment,"Jaguar Land Rover has warned that a ""bad"" Brexit deal would threaten Â£80bn worth of investment plans for the UK and may force it to close factories. The UK's biggest carmaker, owned by India's Tata Motors, said its ""heart and soul is in the UK"". But without frictionless trade JLR said its UK investment plans would be in jeopardy. The warning came as Downing Street set out details of apossible post-Brexit customs arrangement. No 10 sets out new Brexit customs plan BMW joins Airbus in Brexit warning Government looks for business Brexit support Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Ralf Speth said: ""A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than Â£1.2bn profit each year. ""As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around Â£50bn in the UK in the past five years - with plans for a further Â£80bn more in the next five. ""This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome."" Mr Speth said the firm urgently needs ""greater certainty"" to continue to investing heavily in the UK. He told the Financial Times:,external""If I'm forced to go out because we don't have the right deal, then we have to close plants here in the UK and it will be very, very sad. This is hypothetical, and I hope it's an option we never have to go for."" Uncertainty over Brexit, as well as the future of diesel cars, has already led the carmaker to announce a series of changes to its UK business. At the beginning of the year, JLR said it would cut production at its plant in Halewood, Merseyside where it builds three of its Range Rover models. In April, it decided not to renew the contracts for 1,000 temporary workers in Solihull. Last month, JLR said it would shift production of the Land Rover Discovery SUV to Slovakia, potentially leading to some UK job losses. However, the carmaker also said that it was investing in its Solihull site to allow it to build its new Range Rover models, some of which will be electric-powered, from 2020. PB Balaji, chief financial officer at Tata Motors, said: ""Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Motors have always maintained that the uncertainties from Brexit are avoidable and the business seeks clarity to ensure that industry takes timely and right decisions to manage the transition. ""Additionally, Jaguar Land Rover needs free and full access to the single market beyond transition to remain competitive which we also firmly believe is in the best long term interests of the United Kingdom. ""The recent statement from JLR only reaffirms this position that a Brexit which increases bureaucracy, reduces productivity and competitiveness of the UK industry is in no-one's interest."" As well as Halewood and Solihull, JLR also has a manufacturing plant in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham where it makes its Jaguar cars. Last year, it made more than 600,000 cars, 20% of which were sold to mainland Europe, one of its biggest markets. JLR said that it spent Â£5.67bn with UK suppliers of production parts during its last financial year, as well as Â£5.37bn with EU-based businesses. Simon Jack, BBC business editor JLR may be Indian-owned, but its brand and - as the company puts it - its heart and soul is in the UK. It employs 40,000 people directly and 260,000 work in its supply chain. JLR's warning follows those of Airbus, BMW and Nissan who have all said further investment in the UK is ""under review"" and could be cancelled if the country leaves the EU without a deal that ensures frictionless trade. JLR insiders say Â£80bn worth of future investment in the UK over the next five years ""could be lost"". The intervention of such a major employer - which in many ways is rightly perceived as more British than the likes of BMW, Airbus and Nissan - will heap more pressure on the government ahead of a crunch meeting of government ministers on Friday. At this meeting, business hopes the government will finally settle on its own preferred version of the UK's future economic relationship with its largest market. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the government was ""determined"" to make sure JLR could ""continue to prosper and invest in Britain"". The Jaguar Land Rover warning follows similar statements from BMW and Airbus. However, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called these warnings ""completely inappropriate"". Allow Twitter content?

Ex-football coach jailed for sex abuse,"George Ormond was convicted of 36 offences A former Newcastle United youth team aid has been jailed for 20 years after being convicted of a string of sex abuse offences spanning 25 years. George Ormond, 62, coached a grassroots football club in the 1970s and 1980s before going on to work for United's youth system in the 1990s. Newcastle Crown Court heard he used his ""position of power"" to abuse 18 boys and young men between 1973 and 1998. He wasconvicted of 35 chargesof indecent assault and one of indecency. Ormond, who the court was told has been living at temporary addresses in Gateshead, was cleared of two further charges following a six-week trial. The jury was told Ormond ""manipulated his position"" and held out a ""glittering future"" to young players, but could block their progress if they stood up to him. How a hidden tape helped catch George Ormond He would indecently touch boys while massaging them or treating them for injuries and insist they not wear anything under their shorts, then check they had followed the rule. Judge Edward Bindloss described Ormond as ""wholly preoccupied with sex"" and said he ""used his position as a respected football coach to target boys and young men in his care"". He said: ""Some victims you do not even remember - what was for you momentary sexual gratification was for your victims a lifetime of difficulty."" George Ormond was also jailed in 2002 for sex offences Victims' statements described their shame and embarrassment, and in some cases deep regret that they had not spoken out earlier. One said his ambition had been to become a footballer but ""that dream turned into a living nightmare"". Judge Bindloss said: ""No-one observing this trial could have failed to have been moved by the complainants and other witnesses over the six weeks of evidence. ""[They were] largely men in their 50s, largely from working class and sporting backgrounds, speaking with calm and quiet dignity about how they failed to understand what was happening to them. ""And because of the times they lived in, and due to their circumstances, they were unable to speak about it."" Former Newcastle United player Derek Bell was abused by George Ormond but was ""too scared"" to speak out at the time In 2002 Ormond was jailed for six years after being found guilty of abusing seven boys under 16 between 1975 and 1999. Defending Ormond, Rebecca Trowler QC, said he had not been in trouble since his release from prison in 2006. He had been living off his savings, and his only close relationship now was with his mother, who was in her 80s.

Macron warning on Africa migrant centres,"This video can not be played Franceâs president has visited a nightclub founded by legendary musician Fela Kuti in Lagos French President Emmanuel Macron has told the BBC that EU plans to create migrant processing centres in North Africa will not work unless the process is led by those countries. Speaking during a visit to Nigeria, Mr Macron said many African countries were worried that such centres would act as a pull factor for migrants. No African country has so far agreed to host the centres. EU leaders agreed to explore the idea at a summit earlier this month. Trapped in a country everyone wants to leave Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? Mr Macron said that Europe would be dealing with migration from Africa for decades due to what he called the fundamental problem of unplanned population growth in Africa. He has been criticised for saying the same thing in the past, with some accusing him of repeating colonial rhetoric. However he also said that the EU could not take decisions for African countries. The idea of migrant processing centres in North Africa ""can fly, just if some African governments decide to organise it"", he said. Mr Macron said his top priority was to discourage people from taking ""crazy risks"" and putting their lives in danger in order to get to Europe. They reached a deal after marathon negotiations in Brussels, butthey have since differed sharply on how the plan would be implemented. The measures they agreed on included: Exploring the possibility of ""regional disembarkation platforms"", designed to thwart people-smuggling gangs by processing migrants outside the EU Setting up secure migrant processing centres in EU countries, although no country has yet volunteered to host one. Mr Macron said France would not host one as it was not a country where migrants landed but Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the centres could be anywhere in the EU Strengthening external border controls, with more funding for Turkey and countries in North Africa Boosting investment in Africa to help the continent achieve a ""socio-economic transformation"" so people no longer want to leave in pursuit of a better life in Europe Earlier on in his trip to Lagos, Mr Macron told Nigerian entrepreneurs his aim was to help Africa succeed, offer new hope to African youth and persuade Europeans that Africa was part of their ""common destiny"".

Moor fire 'being treated as arson',"Soldiers were called in to assist efforts to contain the fire A huge moor fire which is ""continuing to burn"" is being treated as arson. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said people were seen lighting a bonfire on the moors near Stalybridge on 24 June, shortly before a call was made to the fire service. Ch Supt Neil Evans said ""solid evidence"" on how the fire started ""will not be easy to establish"". Hundreds of firefighters have been tackling the blaze, which spread to nearby Saddleworth Moor. GMP said no arrests had been made but witnesses saw ""a group of males"" lighting the bonfire near to Buckton Vale at about 19:30 BST, 50 minutes before the 999 call was made. This video can not be played Drones capture vast moorland blaze A spokeswoman said the information had ""come to light via Facebook in the past few days"" and officers were ""currently pursuing this as a possible line of inquiry"". She said police were ""aware of some items discarded there"" which had been recovered, but ""quite a lot of evidence which might have been available at the time has been irretrievably damaged"". She added that there had been a ""pattern, unreported to police, of people possibly setting bonfires [and] discarding cigarettes that has resulted in very small scale fires in the past"". The fire, which at its peak covered an area of 7 sq miles (18 sq km), remains ""extremely challenging"", police said. Helicopters are being used to fight blazes near Saddleworth Moor and Winter Hill Greater Manchester Fire Service said 10 crews remained at the blaze, where they have been supported by colleagues from across the country and about 100 troops from the Royal Regiment of Scotland (4 SCOTS). Interim Chief Fire Officer Dawn Docx said firefighters were working with police to the ""source of the ignition [and] there is an area of interest that specialist officers are inspecting"". She added that crews were ""working in extremely difficult and challenging circumstances and are continuing to work hard to put out the multiple fires across the moorlands"". Local residents rally round firefighters and soldiers Moorland 'needed controlled burning' What the fire means for wildlife Ch Supt Evans said the investigation into the fire was difficult as the ""scale of this fire is exceptional"". ""The areas we have been able to look include dusty ash, burnt peat and grass and, because of this, our work with the fire service will be painstaking,"" he added. Troops joined firefighters at the blaze following a request from Greater Manchester's mayor Efforts have been supported by helicopters from water firm United Utilities, which are also aiding efforts to contain a blaze on Winter Hill, near Bolton. About 20 crews from Lancashire Fire Service are working on that blaze, which began on 28 June and is also being investigated as arson. A 22-year-old man, from Bolton, was arrested the following dayon suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life and has since been released under investigation.

Woman forces Statue of Liberty evacuation,"This video can not be played The person could be seen climbing around the base of the Statue of Liberty in New York A woman who climbed up on the Statue of Liberty and sat on the monument's base has been charged with trespassing. Tourists were evacuated from Liberty Island in New York Harbour on Wednesday during a three-hour stand-off involving local and federal authorities. She was identified as Therese Okoumou, a 44-year-old naturalised US citizen from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ms Okoumou said she was protesting against President Trump's zero-tolerance policy on immigration. She pleaded not guilty to charges of misdemeanour trespassing and disorderly conduct in a Manhattan court on Thursday. She faces up to six months in jail on each charge. A federal magistrate judge released Ms Okoumou without bail after she spent a night behind bars, US media report. Ms Okoumou, donning a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ""White Supremacy is Terrorism"", told reporters outside the courthouse that she scaled the landmark in an impromptu protest over the Trump administration's immigration policy, which has left thousands of migrant children separated from their parents. ""When they go low, we go high and I went as high as I could,"" she said, quoting former First Lady Michelle Obama. ""No children belong in a cage."" US Attorney Geoffrey Berman saidin a statement,externalthat Ms Okoumou ""staged a dangerous stunt that alarmed the public and endangered her own life and the lives of the NYPD officers who responded to the scene. ""While we must and do respect the rights of the people to peaceable protest, that right does not extend to breaking the law in ways that put others at risk. "" The charges allege she endangered herself and officers by refusing to come down during the three-hour standoff. Officers had to climb up 100ft (30m) on the statue in order to reach her. Abolish Ice: A new demand from the left The stories behind these two protest pictures ""At first, she wasn't friendly with us, but we took the time to get a rapport with her so that took a while,"" New York Police Detective Brian Glacken said at a news conference. ""She just kind of mentioned the kids in Texas. I guess the whole debate that's going on about that,"" he said in reference to migrant children who have been taken away from parents held in custody for entering the US illegally. ""In the beginning, she threatened to push us off, push the ladder off, but we stayed with her,"" he continued. Earlier, several people were arrested after holding a protest at the statue. In pictures: Fourth of July celebrations Members of the activist group Rise and Resist had earlier unveiled an ""Abolish Ice"" banner on the statue's pedestal. The sign referred to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the government agency responsible for removing undocumented immigrants from the US. National Park Service police and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) were called to the scene around 15:30 on Wednesday shortly after reports of an individual climbing the monument. It took officials nearly three hours to remove Ms Okoumou. One eyewitness, Eric Kwasi Oppongto, posted a short video of the incident on Twitter, which he said involved an individual with a T-shirt emblazoned with ""Trump care makes me sick"" and ""Rise and Resist"".

It took police three hours to coax Ms Okoumou, a personal trainer, down via a ladder that had been secured to the statue's pedestal. They said prosecutors would decide later whether she would be charged with any crime. Detective Glacken, who works for the New York Police Department's Emergency Service Unit, said it had not been an easy operation. ""It was a really technical rescue just because of the slopes up there - I mean, it wasn't a flat surface. There was nothing for [my colleague] Chris [Williams] and I to grab on to,"" he said. ""At first she wasn't friendly with us but we took our time to basically get a dialogue with her... when we got her and she couldn't go any further I think she realised that her time was up up there."" Rise and Resist initially denied any connection to the climber. The anti-Trump activist group later admitted that Ms Okoumou had helped plan the banner demonstration, but maintained the climbing stunt was her idea. Demonstrations have recently taken place across the country over US authorities' removal of hundreds of child migrants from their parents, who were detained for crossing the border without documentation. Liberty statue 'Refugees Welcome' banner Rise and Resist members say Ms Okoumou helped plan the banner demonstration Wednesday's protests took place on the Fourth of July holiday celebrating US independence. National Park Services officials estimate that approximately 20,000 tourists visit the statue to mark the holiday. On Twitter, a conservative black comedian criticised the protester. ""I never seen a black person climb the statue to protest against black on black crime & that separates families permanently,"" wrote Terrence Williams. But other users praised the demonstration, and that it occurred on US independence day. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Baby deaths arrest woman is nurse,"Lucy Letby pictured in 2013 A woman held on suspicion of the murder of eight babies and the attempted murder of another six at a hospital is 28-year-old nurse Lucy Letby. Ms Letby was arrested on Tuesday in a probe into the deaths of 17 infants at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Police are searching her house in Westbourne Road, Chester, about a mile from the hospital. Detectives are also investigating 15 non-fatal collapses at the neonatal unit between March 2015 and July 2016. Officers were also seen at Ms Letby's parents' property in Hereford. Police officers are searching a house and a car in Westbourne Road, Chester The arrest comes as part of a long-running investigation into a higher than expected number of baby deaths at the hospital. The cases being investigated involve families from the Cheshire and north Wales area. Cheshire Police has not officially named the suspect but said the woman arrested remains in custody. Woman held in baby deaths probe Hospital baby deaths probed by police Baby death hospital staffing 'inadequate' Police are said to have arrived at the home in Chester at about 06:00 BST on Tuesday. A neighbour said: ""I saw lots of police cars arrive, a few cars then a big police van, and gradually more and more came and they put up the tent."" Lucy Letby, 28, was arrested on Tuesday Local residents said officers moved a small, silver Suzuki car, which had an NHS parking permit in the window, from the driveway of the address to erect the tent. In a 2013 interview with the Chester And District Standard, Ms Letby said she began working on the unit after graduating and cared for babies requiring various levels of support. She had worked on the unit as a student nurse during three years of training before qualifying as a children's nurse at The University of Chester in 2011. The Countess of Chester Hospital declined to comment on whether any staff had been suspended. Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust also confirmed Ms Letby did training placements with them. A Trust spokesperson said: ""We are co-operating with police as part of their investigation which includes a routine review of patients cared for on our Neonatal Unit during the time of these placements. ""There is currently no suggestion that any patients at Liverpool Women's came to any harm in relation to this investigation."" Police were asked to investigate the deaths of eight babies at Chester in May 2017, a probe which has since widened to include nine more. The hospital says the neonatal unit was ""safe to continue in its current form"" and remained open to women over 32 weeks into their pregnancy Murder arrest over baby deaths Baby deaths probed by police Staffing 'inadequate' at death hospital Countess of Chester Hospital Cheshire Police Search for off-duty ambulance worker who helped dad after car crash Couple on grounded easyjet plane given 'one twirl and a cup of coffee' in six hours Heartbroken family pay tribute to 'the best dad' after collision Man and woman charged in connection with M62 crash death appear in court Burglar caught by police said he was looking for Christmas presents for his children Liverpool's 'little pub with the big heart' Coopers Town House celebrates 100 years LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Delivering brand-new miracles in 1970s East End Watch the latest series of Call the Midwife on iPlayer now Mark-Anthony Turnage shares the soundtrack of his life Once called 'Britainâs hippest composer', he's tackled topics from drug abuse to football in his work Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the bread factory he used to work in, and sees how they make 1.4 million loaves a week What's behind the global surrogacy boom?

Skripals 'were under Russian surveillance',"Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were being monitored by the Russian authorities in the months before their poisoning,BBC Newsnightunderstands. The government alleged, in a letter to Nato, that the Russian authorities had hacked into Yulia's email account in 2013. I understand briefings given to UK ministers and allied governments suggested it went well beyond this. Sergei and his daughter were poisoned in Salisbury in March. With the police investigation not saying whether it has identified any suspects, four months after the Salisbury incident, the UK government's case against Russia is still based largely on secret intelligence. Both former spy Sergei, and his daughter, had been monitored for some time before March this year - something found out after the poisoning. Yulia's mobile phone has since been closely studied for signs of malware that could have allowed it to be used to track her whereabouts. Questions remain though about whether any of the surveillance of her and her father was detected before the attempt, and should have prompted an increased level of protection. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Skripal 'regretted being double agent' What are Novichok agents and what do they do? Nerve agent 'used to try to kill' Sergei Skripal The other main reason why the government blamed Russia rests with the identification of so-called Novichok nerve agent and its specific chemical properties. Experts from the OPCW international watchdog were invited to Salisbury to take samples in late March. They confirmed the UK's identification of the agent in the unclassified section of their report, which emphasised the high purity of the agent used to poison the Skripals. Investigators in hazmat suits walk near where Sergei and Yulia were found I understand that the classified section goes into further detail both about the purity and persistence of the poison. From this, it was deduced that the Novichok was produced by people employing a high level of skill in a very advanced laboratory. The inference was that the nerve agent could only have come from one or two labs in the world. Novichok agents were developed in the last days of the USSR, at the Shikhany facility in southern Russia. I met Sergei on a few occasions last summer and found him to be a private character who did not, even under the circumstances then prevailing, wish to draw attention to himself. He agreed to see me as a writer of history books rather than as a news journalist, since I was researching one on the post-Cold War espionage battle between Russia and the West. Information gained in these interviews was fed into my Newsnight coverage during the early days after the poisoning. I have not felt ready until now to acknowledge explicitly that we had met, but do now that the book is nearing completion. As a man, Sergei is proud of his achievements, both before and after joining his country's intelligence service. He has a deadpan wit and is remarkably stoical given the reverses he's suffered in his life; from his imprisonment following conviction in 2006 on charges of spying for Britain, to the loss of his wife Liudmila to cancer in 2012, and the untimely death of his son Alexander (or Sasha) last summer. Sergei Skripal is pictured here in a court in Moscow in 2006 His domestic routine appeared settled and quiet, with regular visits to the cemetery, favourite shops, and lately the Railway Social Club. Certainly he did not seem to feel himself under great threat. Sergei's Salisbury life might be best described as semi-retired, since he was making occasional trips to lecture or advise friendly intelligence services. But this appeared to be a standard arrangement with defectors, the former KGB man Oleg Gordievsky similarly giving talks to MI6 training courses and foreign agencies. One theory that investigators are probing is that Russia's spies might have regarded Skripal's activities of this kind as evidence he had re-entered the espionage world. Both he and his daughter must now make difficult decisions about their future. Yulia has spoken about her hopes of returning to Russia ""one day"". Her visit in March was only supposed to last a fortnight but now it is unclear what will become of her. Certainly, she is committed for the time being to helping in her father's recovery. For Sergei the equation is different. He was not expecting to go back to Russia, and now he knows he will not be returning to his home in this country either. His house in Salisbury has been bought by the government both as a crime scene and a place still in need of extensive decontamination. Will he make a new life under an assumed identity in the US or a Commonwealth country? That promises to be an extremely difficult decision. Certainly in US witness protection schemes, people are often asked to cut themselves adrift completely from their past. Having seen the peaceful life that he was enjoying in Salisbury last summer, I would imagine that will be very hard for Sergei. From the UK government point of view there is both an acknowledgement that Sergei and Yulia will be free to make their own choices and but also a hope that these will not trigger further political rows with Russia. The saga of Alexander Litvinenko, killed by polonium poisoning in 2006, shows though that those in government who want to move on from the Skripal affair may not have things all their own way. In the Litvinenko case, a police arrest warrant for the suspected poisoner, seven months after the deed, reignited the row. Should the police name suspects for Salisbury in the coming months, either in the poisoning or the surveillance of the Skripals that preceded it, then the issue will return to the world's front pages.

Chinese tycoon dies from fall in France,"The co-founder and chairman of the giant Chinese conglomerate HNA Group has died in a fall in southern France, while touring the Provence region. Wang Jian, 57, had climbed on a high parapet to take photographs in the picturesque village of Bonnieux when he fell, police said. Rescue services in the region were unable to revive him. Mr Wang helped turn HNA into one of the world's biggest companies, with assets in aviation, tourism and finance. It has major stakes in Deutsche Bank, hotel chain Hilton and skyscrapers in Londonand employs more than 400,000 people worldwide. The company is currently in the process of selling down some of its international assets in a bid to reduce its domestic debt built up during a rapid expansion in recent years. The company, which turned its website grey in a gesture of mourning, said it had lost an ""exceptionally gifted leader,externaland role model, whose vision and values will continue to be a beacon for all who had the good fortune to know him"". Police are not treating his death as suspicious. Mr Wang was among a party of about 10 tourists visiting Bonnieux, in the picturesque Luberon area, on Tuesday morning, the France Bleu news site reports. He was near the village's upper church when he climbed onto a parapet at about 11:30 (09:30 GMT) to take pictures of the ""superb panorama"" offered by the Cedres forest, the site says. Speaking through their own interpreter, Mr Wang's travelling companions told police it had been an accident. A local police chief, Hubert Meriaux, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency that Mr Wang had been trying to get his family to take a picture of him when he fell. According to various sources, he fell between 12m (39ft) and 15m (49ft). His widow was expected to arrive in the region on Wednesday, according to France Bleu. By Vincent Ni, BBC News Chinese For a co-founder of a regional airline in China, Wang Jian's rise to prominence in international business might come as a surprise to many. The 57-year-old defied this stereotype. He and his co-founder Chen Feng transformed HNA (Hainan Airlines) into one of China's most acquisitive companies, with more than $230bn (Â£175bn) in assets and a huge amount of debt. To many on China's internet, his death seems to have triggered curiosity. Just last month, HNA had to deny rumours that Mr Chen had died. Authorities in France have confirmed Mr Wang's death is not being treated as suspicious. Although he is not as well-known as Mr Chen in media, Mr Wang is said to have taken a hands-on approach to running the company. This explains why HNA's dollar bonds fell after the company confirmed the news of his death. The success of HNA can be attributed to the savviness of Mr Wang and Mr Chen but the future of this company might still, in part, depend on the government's policies. Last year, as Beijing started to curb financial risks posed by such debt-ridden conglomerates, HNA had to embark on a selling spree to pay down its debt.

WPP threatens Sorrell's share awards,"Sir Martin Sorrell WPP has threatened to take away share awards worth millions from its former chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell over his rival bid for digital production company MediaMonks. The share awards are potentially worth about Â£20m,Sky News reported,external. Dutch firm Mediamonks is facing takeover bids from both WPP and Sir Martin's new S4 Capital venture. A source close to Sir Martin told the BBC: ""I would say WPP are trying to muddy the waters, stir things up"". Speaking on condition of anonymity, the source said that WPP's lawyers had written to Sir Martin claiming that was likely to be in breach of his confidentiality obligations. He added: ""If WPP is going to start some sort of procedural process, Sir Martin will fight it. But this guy is worth Â£400m to Â£500m. He is not going to allow Â£20m to stand in the way what he is trying to do."" He described relations between Sir Martin and the advertising company he founded, WPP, as ""obviously not very good."" He added: ""He is not out to damage WPP. He is still one of the largest, if not the largest private shareholder in WPP, so why would he want to do that?"" Sir Martin bought WPP in 1985 and turned it into the world's biggest advertising and media company with revenues of Â£15bn. However, he stepped down as chief executive in April after the board said it was investigating claims of misconduct. There were allegations relating to the use of company funds to pay for a prostitute, which Sir Martin has denied. WPP later said its board had appointed independent counsel to conduct the investigation. Within weeks of leaving WPP, Sir Martin had bought a shell company, and renamed it S4 Capital. He described it as ""a company that aims to build a multinational communication services business focused on growth.""

Star Wars actor: 'I considered suicide',"Star Wars alien Jar Jar Binks became one of the most reviled characters in film history The actor who played Jar Jar Binks in the Star Wars franchise has revealed how the vicious backlash against the character left him close to suicide. Ahmed Best provided the voice and motion capture for the gawky CGI alien in the Star Wars prequels, beginning with 1999's Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. At the time he was 25, and it was his first major film role. Sadly for Best, the reception from fans and the media was terrible. Jar Jar Binks quickly became the most hated character in the Star Wars universe, and critics branded Best's cartoonish portrayal a dumbed-down exercise in child-pleasing - or worse, a racist stereotype with a misplaced Caribbean accent. Star Wars: 'Time for female director' Star Wars: In defence of the prequels Should Star Wars have stopped at just one film? Best did not name the Star Wars films in his emotional post, but shared a picture with his young son, writing: ""20 years next year I faced a media backlash that still affects my career today. This was the place I almost ended my life. ""It's still hard to talk about. I survived and now this little guy is my gift for survival. Would this be a good story for my solo show? Lemme know."" The message provoked an outpouring of support from fans and fellow Star Wars alumni - including director Rian Johnson, whose work includes Star Wars: The Last Jedi. ""Lots of love to you Ahmed,"" Johnson tweeted. ""I think there are many of us who'd get quite a lot from hearing your story."" Ahmed Best was in his mid-20s when he first played Jar Jar, and a tide of vitriol was unleashed Actor Frank Oz, a puppeteer who voiced the Jedi master Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), declared that he ""LOVED Jar Jar Binks"", adding, ""I just will never understand the harshness of people's dislike of him. I do character work. He is a GREAT character!"" Best replied with gratitude, telling Oz: ""Thanks @TheFrankOzJam you've always been kind, generous and supportive. Love to you my friend."" Many Star Wars fans weighed in to share appreciation for the bumbling orange Jar Jar - who in the story is a Gungan general from the planet Naboo. Some observed that the level of private suffering Best endured - even though he was not recognisable as the face of the character - shows it's important to remember that actors are just ordinary people doing a job. ""When people make things you don't like, they're not trying to hurt you,"" screenwriter @BryanEdwardHill tweeted. Best has touched on the startling toll Jar Jar took on him previously, telling Wired he even got death threats. ""I had people come to me and say: 'You destroyed my childhood',"" he said. ""That's difficult for a 25-year-old to hear."" Star Wars creator George Lucas has long defended Best's opinion-splitting character,external- whom he says was based on the Disney cartoon Goofy. Speaking to the BBC in 1999, he firmly rejected suggestions of any racial stereotyping. ""How in the world could you take an orange amphibian and say that he's a Jamaican?"" he said. ""It's completely absurd. Believe me, Jar Jar was not drawn from a Jamaican, from any stretch of the imagination. ""There is a group of fans for the films that doesn't like comic sidekicks. They want the films to be tough like Terminator, and they get very upset and opinionated about anything that has anything to do with being childlike."" In 2015, when asked which Star Wars character he would most like to be, he smiled wryly and replied, ""Jar Jar Binks.""

Three charged over actress kidnapping,"McCrackin, pictured in 2006, is an actress and songwriter Three people have been charged with kidnapping a star of the Halloween film series, along with another actor - holding the latter for ransom. Two men and one woman have been charged with 17 felony counts, including kidnapping and assault with a firearm. They are accused of kidnapping actor Joseph Capone and Daisy McCrackin - a star of 2002's Halloween: Resurrection - from the actress's Los Angeles home.

Official documents say Capone was stripped naked and tied up in a bathtub, while McCrackin was driven to several banks, in her own car, and told to provide at least $10,000 (Â£7,500) for the release of her fellow actor. According to the official news release,external, McCrackin was able to escape and alert police after being driven back to her home.

McVey sorry for Universal Credit claims,"This video can not be played Esther McVey: ""In fact, the NAO did not say that."" Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has apologised to Parliament for making ""inadvertently misleading"" statements about Universal Credit. She said she had ""mistakenly"" told MPs on Monday the National Audit Office felt the benefit was progressing too slowly and should be rolled out faster. The head of the spending watchdog had said the claims were ""incorrect"" as it had reservations about the process. Labour had called on Ms McVey to apologise or ""consider her position"". Ms McVey told MPs that she had meant to say that the spending watchdog believed there was ""no practical alternative"" to continuing with the development of Universal Credit, which rolls six benefits into one. But she stood by her assertion that the NAO had not been able to examine the impact of recent changes to how claimants were receiving their payments as they ""were still being felt and by definition, couldn't have been fully taken into account by the report"". Asked earlier about Ms McVey's conduct by Labour MP Marsha de Cordova, Theresa May said her colleague would be ""correcting the record"". In a report published last month,external, the NAO said the government's flagship benefits system was not delivering value for money and could end up costing more to administer than the benefits system it is replacing. What is universal credit? Universal Credit 'not value for money' Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? It warned some claimants switching to Universal Credit, which rolls six working-age benefits into one, had waited eight months to be paid. While the report noted that the Department for Work and Pensions did ""not accept"" that Universal Credit had caused hardship among claimants, it pointed to a recent internal departmental report that showed 40% of claimants were experiencing financial difficulties. The head of the NAO - Sir Amyas Morse - took the unusual step of writing to Ms McVey to take issue with how she responded to the report. Speaking in the Commons on 2 July, Ms McVey said the report had not taken into account ""significant"" changes recently made and their impact on the number of people being paid on time and in full. Universal Credit merges six benefits (income support; income-based jobseeker's allowance; income-related employment and support allowance; housing benefit; child tax credit; working tax credit) into one. It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover the benefits for which they are eligible. Claimants then have to pay costs, such as rent, out of their UC payment. It can be claimed by people whether they are in or out of work - but payment decreases as you earn more. She said 80% of claimants had received their payments in full and on time and of the 10% who had not received any money within the first month, this was down to problems with self-verification and not fulfilling their commitments. In response to further questions from Labour MPs, she said the watchdog was ""also concerned that it was rolling out too slowly... and needs to continue at a faster rate"". This video can not be played Labour MP: Has McVey offered resignation? But Sir Amyas said the report had been based on the most up-to-date information and had been ""fully agreed"" with DWP officials a week before its release. I don't even have 4p to my name Theresa May urged to halt Universal Credit Charity calls for Universal Credit action He added: ""I'm afraid your statement that the NAO was concerned Universal Credit is currently ""rolling but too slowly"" and needs to ""continue at a faster rate"" is also not correct. ""While we recognise regrettable early delays, my recommendation made clearly on page 11 of the report is the department must now ensure it is ready before it starts to transfer people over from previous benefits. ""This will avoid the department's performance declining further as it faces higher claimant volumes. ""I also recommended the department learns from experiences of claimants and third parties, as well as the insights it has gained from the roll-out so far."" He said it had not been calculated how many claimants were experiencing difficulties or hardship but it was known that 20% of claimants were not paid in full on time and 25% said they couldn't make an online claim. Esther McVey is no stranger to controversy. As employment minister in David Cameron's government she was often sent out to defend contentious policies such as the so-called bedroom tax. Supporters praised her straight-talking style, but her approach attracted criticism too - not least comments she made apparently defending a rise in the use of food banks. Ms McVey lost her Wirral West seat in 2015 before returning to Parliament last year as MP for Tatton. She was quickly promoted to the cabinet. As work and pensions secretary, she was criticised for suggesting changes to child tax credits which mean sexual assault victims must prove their eligibility might be an opportunity for women to get help. Being publicly rebuked by the National Audit Office is another damaging moment - but so far Ms McVey looks set to keep her job. Her apology to Parliament was by no means unprecedented - other ministerial careers have survived similar incidents. And right now, Theresa May can ill afford further turmoil at the top of government by risking a cabinet reshuffle. Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood had said Ms McVey had ""appeared to mislead Parliament"" which was a ""very serious matter"". She had called on Ms McVey to make a full apology or ""consider her position"". Universal Credit is currently available in 353 job centres and the government says it is ""on track"" to be rolled out to all job centres nationally by the end of 2018. In her 2 July statement, Ms McVey said 83% of claimants who responded had said they were satisfied with customer service.

The best celeb reaction to England's win,"England fans woke up thinking about only one thing on Wednesday - the fact that football is well and truly coming home. There were scenes of joy in living rooms and pubs across the country, as well as in the streets. Celebs were just as overwhelmed as us by Jordan Pickford's heroics as Englandwon a World Cup matchon penalties for the first time. Stormzy was among just two celebs to have their reactions filmed. The rapper was headlining his own festival in Ibiza as the match took place - but stopped it to watch the penalties. Needless to say it went off as Eric Dier's decisive spot-kick went in. This video can not be played Stormzy on stage at his Merky Festival in Ibiza Elsewhere, ex-Eastenders hardman Ross Kemp's reaction - filmed topless as well as completely breathless - has got him a lot of attention on social media.

Colombian mum 'I'll support England now',"Sofia and Kitt's two children said they were supporting both sides For one family watching theColombia v England World Cupmatch there was an extra level of tension. Colombian Sofia Baguley and her English husband, Kitt, watched the match together in their Tunbridge Wells home. Sofia said: ""I had to cover my head with my Colombian flag and couldn't bear to watch the last two penalties."" James, the couple's 13-year-old son, was supporting both teams, while their daughter, Gabriela, had her headphones on for the game, Sofia said. ""I'm really sorry,"" the 11-year-old said, after the game, giving her mum a huge hug. The couple had prepared a family meal with food from both countries before the match on Tuesday. England's first ever penalty shootout win in a World Cupsecured a quarter-final meeting with Sweden on Saturday afternoon. Dad, Kitt supported his native England...

Kitt said he felt guilty about celebrating in front of his wife, but the couple say they are now looking forward to supporting England on Saturday.

World Cup economic boost 'worth billions',"The economy could receive a boost worth billions if England make it to the World Cup final, research suggests. Work done by the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) estimates that the economy has benefitted from extra spending of more than Â£1bn this year. The centre estimates that spending will rise to Â£2.7bn if England makes it to the finals. It says much of the spending will be at shops with fans stocking up on food and drink before watching matches at home. Professor Joshua Bamfield, CRR director, said the amount spent so far was about Â£800m more than during the 2014 World Cup when England crashed out of the tournament before reaching the knockout stages. In its report on the last World Cup the CRR says: ""Every goal scored by an England footballer - right the way to the final - would be worth Â£165.3m to England's retailers and an extra Â£33.2m to pubs, hotels and restaurants."" However England goals in 2014 proved to be thin on the ground. Prof Bamfield said: ""At the last World Cup we didn't get past the group stage and from a retail point of view sales fell off a cliff. ""This time no one expected much - they were so used to being kicked in the teeth - but once they started playing it all changed. ""The spending patterns also fit in with the current retail theme of 'experience'. People want to spend their money going to the pub or having a barbecue with their friend and watching the match."" Colombia's goalkeeper David Ospina concedes a goal in England game on Tuesday Last week pub owner Greene King, after reporting a disappointing set of profits for last year, said things were looking up thanks to the hot weather and the World Cup. The chain sold half a million extra pints during the Panama match. Chief executive Rooney Anand said: "" It remains true that when the sun shines, or sport is on, people do want to go to the pub."" Prof Bamfield said the World Cup also provided a reason for consumers to splash out on electronics such as a new bigscreen television. ""People may have been meaning to get a new TV or computer for some time and the World Cup gives them the opportunity to make the decision,"" he said. ""Also, people are buying souvenirs, parents and grandparents are using the competition as a reason to buy kit for children."" Economists are also seeing the competition add some optimism to thestrong numbers reported on Wednesday for the UK's services sector. Howard Archer, chief economist at the EY Item Club, said: ""A significantly improved survey for the dominant services sector adds to the feel good factor, after England actually winning a penalty shoot out to reach the quarter finals of the World Cup."" However, if sporting success leads to stronger economic growth it may also lead to higher interest rates. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist and a member of its Monetary Policy Committee, said World Cup success was adding to the general recovery of the economy. ""The underlying picture now appears to be one of gently rising household spending,"" he said. ""And then, of course, there is the World Cup. Without wishing to tempt fate, England's recent sporting success on the football field... has probably added to that feelgood factor among England-supporting consumers.""

Macron warning on Africa migrant centresFrance's president tells the BBC that Europe will be dealing with migration from Africa for decades.Africa,"This video can not be played Franceâs president has visited a nightclub founded by legendary musician Fela Kuti in Lagos French President Emmanuel Macron has told the BBC that EU plans to create migrant processing centres in North Africa will not work unless the process is led by those countries. Speaking during a visit to Nigeria, Mr Macron said many African countries were worried that such centres would act as a pull factor for migrants. No African country has so far agreed to host the centres. EU leaders agreed to explore the idea at a summit earlier this month. Trapped in a country everyone wants to leave Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? Mr Macron said that Europe would be dealing with migration from Africa for decades due to what he called the fundamental problem of unplanned population growth in Africa. He has been criticised for saying the same thing in the past, with some accusing him of repeating colonial rhetoric. However he also said that the EU could not take decisions for African countries. The idea of migrant processing centres in North Africa ""can fly, just if some African governments decide to organise it"", he said. Mr Macron said his top priority was to discourage people from taking ""crazy risks"" and putting their lives in danger in order to get to Europe. They reached a deal after marathon negotiations in Brussels, butthey have since differed sharply on how the plan would be implemented. The measures they agreed on included: Exploring the possibility of ""regional disembarkation platforms"", designed to thwart people-smuggling gangs by processing migrants outside the EU Setting up secure migrant processing centres in EU countries, although no country has yet volunteered to host one. Mr Macron said France would not host one as it was not a country where migrants landed but Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the centres could be anywhere in the EU Strengthening external border controls, with more funding for Turkey and countries in North Africa Boosting investment in Africa to help the continent achieve a ""socio-economic transformation"" so people no longer want to leave in pursuit of a better life in Europe Earlier on in his trip to Lagos, Mr Macron told Nigerian entrepreneurs his aim was to help Africa succeed, offer new hope to African youth and persuade Europeans that Africa was part of their ""common destiny"".

Ex-football coach jailed for sex abuseGeorge Ormond joined Newcastle United's youth coaching system in the 1990s.Tyne & Wear,"George Ormond was convicted of 36 offences A former Newcastle United youth team aid has been jailed for 20 years after being convicted of a string of sex abuse offences spanning 25 years. George Ormond, 62, coached a grassroots football club in the 1970s and 1980s before going on to work for United's youth system in the 1990s. Newcastle Crown Court heard he used his ""position of power"" to abuse 18 boys and young men between 1973 and 1998. He wasconvicted of 35 chargesof indecent assault and one of indecency. Ormond, who the court was told has been living at temporary addresses in Gateshead, was cleared of two further charges following a six-week trial. The jury was told Ormond ""manipulated his position"" and held out a ""glittering future"" to young players, but could block their progress if they stood up to him. How a hidden tape helped catch George Ormond He would indecently touch boys while massaging them or treating them for injuries and insist they not wear anything under their shorts, then check they had followed the rule. Judge Edward Bindloss described Ormond as ""wholly preoccupied with sex"" and said he ""used his position as a respected football coach to target boys and young men in his care"". He said: ""Some victims you do not even remember - what was for you momentary sexual gratification was for your victims a lifetime of difficulty."" George Ormond was also jailed in 2002 for sex offences Victims' statements described their shame and embarrassment, and in some cases deep regret that they had not spoken out earlier. One said his ambition had been to become a footballer but ""that dream turned into a living nightmare"". Judge Bindloss said: ""No-one observing this trial could have failed to have been moved by the complainants and other witnesses over the six weeks of evidence. ""[They were] largely men in their 50s, largely from working class and sporting backgrounds, speaking with calm and quiet dignity about how they failed to understand what was happening to them. ""And because of the times they lived in, and due to their circumstances, they were unable to speak about it."" Former Newcastle United player Derek Bell was abused by George Ormond but was ""too scared"" to speak out at the time In 2002 Ormond was jailed for six years after being found guilty of abusing seven boys under 16 between 1975 and 1999.

Tory peer calls for Islamophobia inquiry,"Baroness Warsi said the time had passed for an internal inquiry The Tories' handling of allegations of Islamophobia has been ""woefully inept"" and they must now hold an independent inquiry, a former party chair has said. Baroness Warsi said her party should learn from Labour's response to anti-Semitism allegations and not seek to use promises of action as a ""fig leaf"" to hide the true extent of the problem. ""Nothing tangible"" had happened since she first raised the issue, she said. The party said it took claims of anti-Muslim prejudice extremely seriously. The Muslim Council of Britain recently complained that its own request for an inquiry had been ignored and accused the party of ""turning a blind eye"" to the issue. It has compiled a dossier listing Conservative councillors and candidates who have been suspended or expelled following allegations of anti-Muslim prejudice. Warsi: Tories must act on Islamophobia It has voiced concern about the tone of Richmond Park MP Zac Goldsmith's 2016 campaign for the London mayoralty, and about social media messages shared by Harrow East MP Bob Blackman - who has strongly denied any allegation of anti-Muslim prejudice. In an article for the Guardian,external, Baroness Warsi - who was the UK's first female Muslim cabinet minister - said both Mr Goldsmith and Mr Blackman should receive ""mandatory enrolment"" on diversity training courses. The Conservatives' promise of voluntary courses for those who wanted them was ""not enough"", she said, warning the party needed to be ""proactive and change its culture"". The peer said she had written to Theresa May about the issue and submitted a dossier of evidence but ""absolutely nothing tangible"" had happened in response. The time for an internal investigation had passed, she said, and only a ""forensic, wide-ranging and transparent inquiry"" would now suffice. The Conservatives say any members found to have behaved inappropriately have been suspended and investigations launched.

Vote Leave campaign 'broke electoral law'The EU Leave campaign is expected to be found guilty of four charges of breaking electoral law.,"This video can not be played Former Vote Leave chief Matthew Elliott defended his group's actions The official Brexit campaign is expected to be found guilty of four charges of breaking electoral law, the BBC has been told. The draft of an investigation into Vote Leave concludes it broke spending limits and failed to comply with some of the rules. It also imposes fines as a result of its findings. But the group's former chief executive claimed the Electoral Commission had not followed due process. Matthew Elliott has submitted a 500-page dossier to the Electoral Commission rebutting the claims. The commission said Vote Leave had taken the ""unusual step"" of going public having seen the draft report. According to Vote Leave's dossier, the commission finds the campaign group: made an inaccurate return of campaign expenditure is missing invoices and receipts failed to comply with a statutory notice exceeded its spending limit Crucially, the draft report is said to claim there was coordination between Vote Leave and a smaller campaign, BeLeave, which received a donation of more than Â£600,000 in the closing weeks of the referendum, after advice from the Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings. For months there have been allegations that the two campaigns broke the rules by working together too closely. The electoral rules stipulate that different campaign groups can work loosely together but they must not have a ""common plan"". This has always been denied by the two groups and has been investigated twice already by the Electoral Commission. Vote Leave now admits there was email correspondence between a donor, Anthony Clake, and Mr Cummings about passing a donation on to BeLeave. It is understood that this third investigation concludes that there was a ""common plan"", and therefore the law was broken. A spokesperson for the Electoral Commission said: ""The commission has concluded its investigation and, having reached initial findings, provided Vote Leave with a 28-day period to make any further or new representations. That period ended on Tuesday 3 July. ""The unusual step taken by Vote Leave in sharing its views on the Electoral Commission's initial findings does not affect the process set out in law."" It said it would give ""due considerations"" to representations it had received and then publish a ""thorough and detailed closing report in order to provide a full and balanced account"". Speaking to the BBC, Mr Elliott said the commission had ""listened to one side of the story"". ""We offered to go in for interviews, both at board level and at staff level,"" he said. ""They haven't accepted any interviews from our side."" Mr Elliott said he thought Vote Leave had ""acted both within the letter of the law and also the spirit of the law"", and that it was perfectly legitimate that they would ""work alongside other groups and encourage them and encourage their activities"". Vote Leave was the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum He denied that he was simply trying to deflect the coming criticism of the campaign. ""We're saying 'can they look at our side of the story?''', he said, adding that they would take legal action to try to overturn the charges if they were not withdrawn. Tamsin Allen, the solicitor who represents the whistleblowers who went public with claims that Vote Leave broke the law, said: ""Vote Leave may not like this conclusion, but there is clearly a proper evidential basis for it. ""The commission should be permitted to complete its work and we await the release of its final report."" One of the whistleblowers, Christopher Wylie, called for the referendum to be rerun, saying: ""If sanctions are issued against Vote Leave or their affiliates, this means the law was broken."" Another whistleblower, former Vote Leave activist Shahmir Sanni, said: ""I'm waiting for the report, but just for clarity, I told you so."" During Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said she would not comment on ""a leaked report"" after the matter was raised by the SNP. She added that the government would consider the final report and any recommendations. A spokesman for Anthony Clake, whose donation was given to BeLeave at the suggestion of Mr Cummings, said: ""Mr Clake was told by Mr Cummings that Vote Leave was reaching its spending limits, so he suggested that he could give it to BeLeave instead, which he did. ""Any alleged collusion between the campaigns is a matter for them.""

Prime Minister's Questions: The verdictTheresa May clashed with Jeremy Corbyn over bus services - here are the key bits.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says having a free pass is ""not much use if there was not a bus"". Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. Theresa May opened by paying tribute toPrivate Reece Millerwho died while on operations in Estonia. He served the country with great distinction, she added. The PM went on to praise the dedication and hard work of NHS staff on its 70th birthday and in the final bit of her preamble she congratulated the England football team on their World Cup win on Tuesday night.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn echoed the tributes to Pte Miller and the football team.

Mrs May responded by highlighting the extra funding being put into the NHS, before saying that people's working habits had been changing which had led to less use of buses around the country. She added that Mr Corbyn should ask local councils what they were doing about bus services. Mr Corbyn claimed 500 bus routes per year had been cut and asked if the prime minister thought ""bus services are a public responsibility or just something you leave to the market"". The prime minister picked up on Mr Corbyn's mention of lower-paid people being hit hardest when bus services were cut or fares increased. She said that the government was helping those people in a variety of ways, such as increasing the minimum wage. You wait ages for a bus question and a whole host came along at once - Mr Corbyn, sticking with his theme, said there were 26m fewer bus journeys across the north of England and the Midlands and he asked the PM if she thought deregulation of the buses had been a success or a failure.

The PM did not answer that question directly, instead noting that bus use in London had gone down since Labour's mayor was elected, and then, to cheers from her MPs, said the Conservative Mayor for the West Midlands had extended free bus travel to students and apprentices. ""It will be a Labour government that saves the bus industry and a Labour government that gives free fares to under-26-year-olds,"" said Mr Corbyn, who also said private bus firms had made Â£3.3bn of profit since 2010. He asked why the government didn't give local authorities more powers over bus operators. Mrs May hit back saying she would take ""no lessons"" from Labour on devolution of powers to councils. And she ended with a now-almost-traditional listing of things the government had achieved - such as record employment as it builds a ""Britain fit for the future"". This video can not be played Ian Blackford claims Conservatives are ""systematically shielding their donations from public scrutiny"" The SNP's Ian Blackford began by congratulating England on their World Cup victory -his party's calling of votes during the match last night annoyed some- before raising the issue of Vote Leave ""being expected to be found guilty of breaking electoral law"". Mrs May said she would not comment on a leaked report that the government had not yet seen. She said the government would consider it when it received it. (you can read the BBC story on it here) She then said all donations to the Scottish Conservatives were accepted and declared in accordance with the law after Mr Blackford accused the party of ""systematically shielding donations from public scrutiny"". Referring to reports on the Ferret website, he alleged the Scottish Conservatives had received Â£319,000 from the Scottish Unionist Association Trust and said there was no information about who manages the trust, who its donors are or its assets. He urged the prime minister to reveal what checks had taken place before the money was accepted and for an investigation. Mrs May said the Scottish Conservatives worked with the Electoral Commission to make sure donations are accepted and declared properly.

Here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's verdict: Conservatives in general and the government in particular have found a week of cabinet splits and ministerial crossfire over Brexit pretty hard to take. So did Jeremy Corbyn miss an opportunity to rub salt into open wounds, by talking about buses, not Brexit? The Westminster bubble always prefers to hear about its own concerns, but it is flat out wrong to be dismissive of the problems on the buses - and maybe the choice of question reflected his experience of trying to penetrate the PM's carefully phrased formulae on customs unions and immigration. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""As we leave the UK...as we leave the EU"" But if Mr Corbyn didn't delve into Brexit, Brexiteers Owen Paterson and Sir Edward Leigh did attempt to drill down. Mr Patterson delivered a humorous-sounding question referencing President Macron's plan to hold performance reviews of his cabinet. But don't mistake the menace behind the genial grin. He was targeting ""soft Brexit"" cabinet ministers like the chancellor and the business secretary, to be sure, but he was also nailing the PM to her own election promises, and signalling that he wanted no retreat from them. Sir Edward followed up by seeking reassurance on key Brexiteer concerns about securing control of immigration, and allowing the UK to strike independent trade deals, unrestricted by the EU's single market rules. The PM assured him her red lines remained in place. It sounds reassuring, but were the questioners reassured? And I was also struck by the giggles produced by her assertion that she led a strong cabinet team - the opposition doesn't even bother to jeer such claims any more. The SNP Leader Ian Blackford had a predictably rough ride after his party forced divisions last night to keep MPs voting while the England-Colombia game was on. But he zeroed in on questions about political funding. Does this mark the opening of a parliamentary second front, attacking Brexit by attacking the legitimacy of the referendum verdict? One telling point is the way the noise level dropped as his question unfolded, and then redoubled as he continued. Maybe the hecklers recognised a threat. This video can not be played Labour MP: Has McVey offered resignation? Then, the Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey was added to the list of under-fire Cabinet ministers when Labour's Marsha De Cordova raised the blistering rebuke she'd suffered from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the government's Wastefinder-General for misleading the House of Commons over the contents of his National Audit Office's report on the roll-out of the new super-benefit, Universal Credit. First, Marsha De Cordova skilfully avoided the procedural bear traps around accusations of this kind, when a false word could quite easily have resulted in the Speaker intervening, And then the PM responded by announcing that Esther McVey would apologise after question time - when she endured a brief noisy few minutes ""correcting the record"". Following her statement, the Labour Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, Frank Field, said he had applied for an urgent question, to be asked tomorrow, on the issue. So, to summarise, the PM navigated through some dangerous waters on Brexit, but the exchanges with her backbenchers had a rather rote and ritual feel. And the questions provided a reminder that Brexit is not the only issue; Sir Oliver Heald's hardline call for action on the crisis on the railways demonstrates the heat Tory MPs are taking from commuters, the implementation of Universal Credit touches millions of voters and Jeremy Corbyn's bus questions highlighted another public service problem. The PM was, as ever, well prepared and went on the attack where she could. But the overall impression was of problems crowding in from all quarters while the government wrestles with Brexit.

"Woman, 92, kills son over care home plan","Anna Mae Blessing is charged with murder, aggravated assault and kidnapping A 92-year-old US woman shot and killed her son, 72, in order to avoid being sent into a care home, police say. Anna Mae Blessing, who is charged with murder, contemplated her son's intentions to put her into care for days, according to court documents. ""You took my life, so I'm taking yours,"" she reportedly said as she was escorted out of the Arizona home she shared with her son and his girlfriend. Mrs Blessing told police she had intended to kill herself, too. The incident happened in the morning of 2 July in the town of Fountain Hills, Maricopa county, police records obtained by local media say. Mrs Blessing's son, whose name has not been released, wanted her to leave for an assisted living facility because she ""had become difficult to live with"". The mother concealed two firearms in her robe pockets before confronting her son,externalin his bedroom, police said in a statement. During the ensuing argument, she pulled out one revolver, purchased in the 1970s, and fired at her son. Police found the son dead,external, with two bullet wounds to his neck and jaw. Mrs Blessing then pointed the gun at her son's 57-year-old girlfriend, who managed to wrestle it away and throw it into a corner of the room. She pulled out a second pistol, which she told police her late husband had given to her in the 1970s. The girlfriend managed to knock this one out of Mrs Blessing's hands, too, before escaping and calling the sheriff's office. Police found Mrs Blessing in a reclining chair in her bedroom. She later told them she deserved to be ""put to sleep"" for her actions. She is charged with first-degree murder, aggravated assault and kidnapping, and her bail was set at $500,000.

The environment secretary said the UK would be in the ""driving seat"" in quota negotiations once the UK leaves the EU's Common Fisheries Policy but would not commit to a specific figure. At the moment, quotas are assigned to each country, with limits on species. UK fishing groups are pressing to keep more than 80% of domestic catch. The Scottish government said it had not been properly consulted about the UK's proposals for fishing after Brexit,unveiled on Wednesday,external, and had ""significant concerns"" about them. The UK says it gets a bad deal under current arrangements. In 2014, half of UK fish production was exported to the EU, a quarter to outside the EU and a quarter was consumed domestically. Fishermen protest over post-Brexit deal What kind of Brexit do voters want? There were protests earlier this year when it was revealed that the UK would continue to be bound by the Common Fisheries Policy during the post-Brexit transition period which is due to run until the end of 2020. Ministers have urged the industry to keep their ""eyes on the prize"" of getting full control and have now published a White Paper setting out their vision for how they UK will do this as an ""independent coastal state"". This video can not be played The UK will decide fishing access in British waters post-Brexit, the environment secretary tells Today Mr Gove told the BBC that from 2021 the UK would control fishing access to a 200 nautical mile ""exclusive economic zone"" around its coastline. While he would not be drawn on what share of catch the UK could keep in this area after Brexit, he said there was no reason the UK should be in a ""weaker position"" than Norway or Iceland - which retains 80% and 95% respectively of fish caught in their territorial waters. ""Like other independent coastal states, we can decide who has access to our waters and we can ensure that a greater proportion of the fish in our waters is caught by British vessels, landed in British ports and processed by British producers,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. While accepting there would still be annual negotiations over catch quotas in British waters, he said ""it will be a negotiation where we hold the cards and we are in the driving seat"". Mr Gove said market access for fish exports - which has yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU - would be treated separately from the question of access to each other's waters. The EU haspreviously suggestedthe two issues should be tied together. Half of UK fish production was exported to the EU in 2014 During a Commons debate on the plans, Conservative MP John Redwood said Brexit could be a fillip for the UK's 10,000 or so fish and chip shops. ""Isn't it the case that we have a huge opportunity here to make sure that much more of the fish is landed by our boats in order to make sure that our traditional fish and chips is once again fish from our fishing grounds, properly looked after by a national policy?"" he said. But Labour warned of a gap between what Mr Gove hoped for and what he could deliver. ""This white paper is full of optimism for the negotiations but the only deal so far agreed on fishing is we'll keep EU fishing policies during the transition period - and we're not holding our breath that this will all go according to plan,"" said shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman. Ministers have said they will publish an annual statement of fish stocks and work with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments, to whom fishing policy is devolved, to help any struggling stocks to recover as well as helping them to ""maximise their power to manage their fisheries"". But the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins said there was no mention in the report of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, which he said had been vital in helping coastal communities in Scotland and across the UK to diversify. ""There are a number of areas where we think there have been omissions,"" he told BBC News. Brexiteers including Nigel Farage protested in April at a delay in leaving the Common Fisheries Policy ""And half the fish landed are sold into European markets so there are concerns around what will happen with that valuable product."" Scottish Fishermen's Federation chief executive Bertie Armstrong - who has suggested the UK could emulate Norway and Iceland - urged ministers to show ""real backbone"" in the negotiations ahead. ""At last we have a positive statement of taking back control of our waters and righting some of the wrongs that have been running for forty years,"" he said. Fishing featured prominently in the 2016 EU referendum campaign, with Leave campaigners saying the current rules encouraged overfishing and mismanaged stocks - and it led to one of the campaign's most memorable moments as Nigel Farage and Bob Geldof traded insults on boats during a protest on the Thames. UKIP's fishing spokesman Mike Hookem warned the industry would see little change under Mr Gove's plans. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Video shows Thai cave boys in good healthThe boys are seen wrapped in blankets and with divers, as a huge operation continues to free them.Asia","This video can not be played The boys can be seen introducing themselves next to a diver in a wetsuit A new video has been released of the 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a Thai cave, in which they say they are in good health. Smiling and at times laughing, they introduce themselves one by one. They were found on Monday after nine days trapped deep in the cave by rising water, and have since received food and medical treatment. But their rescue may take months as they must either be taught to dive or wait for the water to recede. The concern is that the rainy season has only just begun, so water levels in the Tham Luang cave will almost certainly continue to rise. How will the boys cope underground? What are the rescue options? The video posted on the Thai Navy special forces Facebook page,externalshows the team draped in foil blankets to keep them warm. The boys all give their names, and a traditional Thai greeting Lit by torches and with divers sitting alongside, they each give their name and the traditional ""wai"" greeting, putting their palms together. Two other videos show the group having some light scratches treated by a military doctor. The boys are also again seen asking how soon food is coming. Written on a rock in the cave can be seen the name of the football team and of the navy unit involved in the rescue. Two Thai navy divers will be staying with the group underground from now on. ""Now we are teaching the children to swim and dive,"" Thai Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. A report in The Guardian saysthe boys are being trained to breathe through scuba masks,external. But a source inside the Thai navy diving team has told the BBC that taking the boys, few of whom can even swim, out through the narrow flooded passages is too risky. He said the journey in to where they were, deep in the caves, had exhausted even experienced divers. So they were seriously considering keeping the boys there for the full four or five months of the rainy season, he added. Some of the route involves squeezing through tight gaps underwater. In parts it is too narrow to wear an oxygen tank and the exits are not visible, so it would be easy for a child to panic. However, other Thai officials say they may need to bring the boys out quickly if water levels rise. Weather forecasts for the area are being closely monitored for heavy rain which could trigger further flooding. Before they were found, they would have lived in total darkness once any torch batteries had expired. However, the three basic conditions for survival were met: The temperature in the cave is thought to be around 26C (79F) so hypothermia was not an issue There was sufficient oxygen because air enters through porous limestone or cracks in the rocks. They had drinkable water Oxygen may yet become a problem should the water level rise and the air pocket they are in get smaller. Unknown factors include the possibility of dangerous animals like snakes in the cave or of contamination from bat droppings. Rescuers are trying to work out how best to bring them all to safety, with officials stressing they do not intend to take any risks with the boys' safety. This video can not be played Families have been shown new footage of the 12 boys and their coach stuck in a cave in Thailand. At a news conference, officials said no rescue attempt would be made on Wednesday but conditions were perfect for a rehearsal. Water continues to be pumped out of the cave complex and officials have said they are confident they have been able to stop more water getting into the chamber the boys are in. Emergency teams are also trying to install a phone line so the group can talk to their families but attempts to do so failed on Tuesday. Outside the cave, medics are staging rehearsals in case the group can be brought out soon. Other teams are still scouring the mountainside in the hope of finding another way into - and out of - the cave. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two collapse near nerve agent attack site,"The pair, believed to be Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley, were found unconscious on Saturday A man and woman are in a critical condition after being exposed to an unknown substance, which counter terrorism officers are investigating. The pair, believed to be Charlie Rowley, 45, and Dawn Sturgess, 44, were found unconscious at a house in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on Saturday. It is understood tests are being carried out on the substance at a government chemical weapons laboratory. Amesbury is about eight miles from the Salisbury Russian spy poisoning site. Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with Novichok, a suspected military nerve agent, in March. The substance Novichok was identified by the defence research facility at Porton Down, which is understood to be carrying out tests on the latest substance. Investigators are trying to work out if the Novichok could have been prepared in Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury, and the Amesbury pair came into contact with its residue. Police have cordoned off a number of areas including Muggleton Road in Amesbury The government's emergency committee, Cobra, has met in the Cabinet Office at an official level to discuss the events in Amesbury, which is being ""treated with the utmost seriousness"". A further meeting of the committee will be held on Wednesday evening to hear updates on the situation which was initially treated as a suspected drugs-related incident. Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury was one of a number of areas cordoned off The Met said counter terrorism officers are now working with Wiltshire Police ""given the recent events in Salisbury"". Wiltshire Police said it was ""open-minded"" about the cause after the pair, who are British nationals, were found at the house in Muggleton Road, Amesbury. Paramedics were called twice to the property, firstly in the morning after Ms Sturgess had collapsed and then later the same day after reports Mr Rowley had also fallen unwell. While it was not clear whether a crime had been committed, the force said, a number of places in Amesbury and Salisbury known to have been frequented by the couple had been cordoned off. Are you in the area? Do you have any information you can share? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? It said the public can expect to see an increased police presence in and around Amesbury and Salisbury. ""It was initially believed that the two patients fell ill after using possibly heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs,"" Wiltshire Police said. ""They are both currently receiving treatment for suspected exposure to an unknown substance at Salisbury District Hospital,"" it added. The Amesbury branch of Boots has closed on Wednesday morning as a ""precautionary measure"" The pair are believed to have attended a family fun day at Amesbury Baptist Church Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess are believed to have attended a family fun day at Amesbury Baptist Church on Saturday afternoon before they were found unconscious in the property they had just moved into. Roy Collins, church secretary, said ""nobody else has suffered any ill-effects"" from attending the community event and ""there was nothing going on that was nefarious"". ""There have been no reports of any other incidents,"" he said. ""We are all quite puzzled and shocked - naturally the connection with Salisbury and recent events there mean there is a heightened public interest."" Boots has closed its Amesbury store as ""a precautionary measure"" to allow police to carry out an investigation, a spokesperson confirmed. Neighbours tell me the peace at this usually quiet new estate in Amesbury was broken at about 18:30 BST on Saturday evening. It was hot and many were out having barbecues when they heard sirens and saw flashing lights as first ambulances, then the fire brigade and police arrived in Muggleton Road. They saw seven fire engines and fire officers wearing hazmat suits at the scene. The house was cordoned off and the word here was that this was a suspected drugs overdose. This morning many are in disbelief that this has been declared a major incident and that so many reporters from national media have descended on their doorsteps. Two police cars and three officers are here as Wiltshire Police is yet again dealing with a major incident just a few miles away from where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found. The fire service was also called to Muggleton Road on Saturday evening Wiltshire and Dorset Fire Rescue Service said seven vehicles and two specialist ones had attended Muggleton Road on Saturday evening. Crews in hazmat suits, which are worn to deal with dangerous or hazardous substances, were sent to the scene in what the fire service described as a ""standard procedure response"". Chloe Edwards, a 17-year-old college student who lives near the cordoned-off flat, said she was having dinner when ""all these emergency vehicles turned up"" and was told to stay inside. ""They were putting on these green suits and we thought it was the gas as our electricity was turned off as well,"" she said. ""We wanted to know what happened and with the Russian attack happening not long ago we just assumed the worst. ""I am not sure how long they were in there but we couldn't get out of the house for two-and-a-half hours."" This video can not be played Residents react to news of latest incident in Amesbury Resident Jake Murphy said he was watching the football on Tuesday night when ""all these police cars appeared"". ""I didn't know what was happening,"" he said. Justin Doughty, who lives opposite the police cordon, said none of the residents have been ""told anything by the police"". ""We would have thought the police would have been more forthcoming and keep us in the loop."" A government source said: ""Senior Whitehall officials are being kept informed of what is going on on the ground as we seek to establish the facts of this case. ""No definitive conclusions have yet been established."" Wiltshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Angus Macpherson said the police had worked hard at ""containing any risk that might be there"". ""There's no reason to think it's connected with matters of last month,"" he said. ""I haven't seen anything in this incident yet that I would consider to be an overreaction in terms of previous incidents, it all seems fairly textbook."" Public Health England said it did not believe there was a ""significant health risk"" to the wider public, although its advice was being continually assessed. The hospital was ""open as usual"" and advised patients to attend routine appointments unless contacted and advised to do otherwise. Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals?

'Age better by doing right workouts',"Too many of us are neglecting to do exercises for strong muscles and bones, says Public Health England (PHE). It's launched a new report giving advice on how people can age better by doing the right workouts. While the message about doing aerobic exercise for a healthy heart and lungs is getting through, people are less clear about the need to look after their overall strength too, it says. We should all be doing strengthening exercises at least twice a week. Lifting weights is one option, but taking up tennis or dancing also works, says PHE and the Centre for Ageing Better. Activities offering the most benefit include: Ball games Racket sports Dance Nordic walking (walking with poles to give your upper body a workout as well as your legs) Resistance training (using weights or bands or your own body weight to push or pull against for a workout) Yoga, Tai Chi and cycling are also somewhat good for bones, muscles and balance. Only one in three men and one in four women is doing enough of the right types of exercise to keep both healthy and strong, say the experts. Muscle and bone strengthening and balance activity can improve physical and wellbeing at any age and reduce the risk of an early death. It can also help improve health during difficult or life-changing times like pregnancy, menopause, onset of or diagnosis of disease, retirement and recovery from hospitalisation. The experts advise young people to build up muscle and bone mass, which tends to peak by the time we reach 30. Older adults need exercises to maintain what they've hopefully already got and slow the natural decline that happens with age. Unfit in middle age: Are you doomed? Those who are frail and/or at risk of fractures, including people with osteoporosis, should be especially careful, however, particularly with higher-impact activities such as tennis, and seek advice from their doctor. Dr Zoe Williams from Public Health England said: ""Being active isn't just about getting your heart pumping - although this is a good way to begin. Strength and balance activities work in conjunction with cardio activities like brisk walking, and come with a range of health benefits throughout your life - it's never too late to start."" Adults should do: At least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, every week AND Strength exercises on two or more days a week that will work all the major muscles Five ways to get your body moving at work Unfit in middle age: Are you doomed?

Six-year-old's death treated as murder,"This video can not be played Alesha MacPhail murder: 'Help us build a timeline' Police on the Isle of Bute have confirmed schoolgirl Alesha MacPhail was murdered. The case has become a murder inquiry following a post-mortem examination on the six-year-old, although detectives have yet to say how she died. Officers also confirmed a car was among a number of items recovered by them as part of the ongoing investigation. Alesha's body was found by a member of the public in woodland on the site of a former hotel on Ardbeg Road on Monday. She had been staying at her grandmother's house but was reported missing at about 06:25. Her body was found half a mile away less than three hours later. Sunday 1 July- Six-year-old Alesha, from Airdrie in North Lanarkshire, was a few days into a three-week summer break visiting relatives on the island of Bute. It is understood she was staying with her father Rab MacPhail and her grandparents, Angela and Calum King, in a house in Ardbeg Road, between Rothesay and Port Bannatyne. 06:25 Monday 2 July- Alesha is reported missing. Grandmother Angela King posts appeal for help on Facebook. About 09:00 Monday 2 July- Alesha's body is found by a member of the public in woodland on the site of the former Kyles of Bute hydropathic hotel - about half a mile from where she was staying. Tuesday 3 July- A post-mortem examination is held and police confirm they have launched a murder inquiry. A school picture of Alesha MacPhail is left outside the house on Ardbeg Road on Bute Det Supt Stuart Houston, from Police Scotland's major investigation team, said Alesha's family was ""utterly devastated"" by what had happened. He said: ""Like any other six-year-old, Alesha was looking forward to enjoying her holidays from primary school and was only a few days into a three-week summer break visiting relatives on the island. ""For such a young girl to have her life taken away is incomprehensible."" Police are now treating the death of Alesha MacPhail as murder Forensic teams have been carrying out investigations on the island Det Supt Houston said he was keen to speak to anyone who was involved in a search for Alesha that took place just before 06:00 on Monday. He said: ""I'm keen to find out who was there that has not engaged with the police yet, what areas they maybe searched and anything they may have seen or heard at the time. ""I am also now really keen to speak to anyone who was in the area of Ardbeg Road from late on the Sunday evening, into the early hours of Monday morning."" Police want to speak to people involved in the search for Alesha before 06:00 on Monday Det Supt Houston said he wanted to hear from anyone who had seen or heard anything unusual at that time. He said police were exploring a number of lines of inquiry and were now trying to piece together the timeline between Alesha going missing and her body being discovered. He urged people to come forward with information, no matter how insignificant they may consider it to be. Referring to rumours that Alesha sleepwalked, Det Supt Houston said police were looking at all possibilities. He would not reveal the cause of death. A heavy police presence remains on the island Ch Supt Hazel Hendren, the local police commander for Argyll and Bute, said officers would be on patrol in the area all day and night. ""Every available resource from across Police Scotland is being made available to this major investigation,"" she said. ""Our absolute priority is catching the person responsible for this horrendous act as quickly as possible. ""I understand that there will be a high level of concern among people living in this close-knit community but I want to reassure people that everything possible is being done."" Police forensic officers search a garden at a house on Ardbeg Road on the Isle of Bute She added: ""It's very important that people are vigilant. I would also ask the community and holidaymakers to look out for each other and please look out for your families and the security and safety of your homes."" ""Anything that is worrying or concerning please address the officers."" Bute is an island in the Firth of Clyde, easily accessible from the west of Scotland via a regular 35-minute ferry from Wemyss Bay in Inverclyde. The island has a population of about 6,500 people and the main town is Rothesay. It established a reputation as a popular tourist destination in the Victorian era. Generations of holidaymakers from the Glasgow area have made the trip ""doon the watter"" to Bute on a paddle-steamer. A policeman leaves balloons for a member of the public outside the house on Ardbeg Road Earlier, thehead teacher of the primary school attended by Alesha had described her as a ""happy, smiley"" girlwho would be ""greatly missed"". The primary school is in Airdrie where Alesha's mother, Georgina Lochrane, is understood to live. Reverend Owain Jones said people had been ""stunned"" by the death and subsequent murder investigation. He has opened his United Church of Bute in Rothesay to allow people to visit at any time. Rev Jones said: ""We're all absolutely staggered, we have no words for this and it's beyond any power of words to express. ""We're all just really sitting in a kind of shared stunned silence just trying to uphold each other. ""Bute is one of these places that is incredibly safe, you take all sorts of things for granted here and don't panic if you forget to lock the house or whatever."" Farmer David McVey told BBC Radio Scotland'sJohn Beattie programme: ""Everybody on the island is feeling it and it is so heart-breaking. Soft toys, flowers and dolls are among the items people have left near the police cordon ""It is tragic, absolutely tragic."" Mr McVey said the girls who help clean out his horses knew Alesha. And he said every conversation on the island inevitably turned to the murder. He added: ""I'm taking phone calls about other matters and the first thing people are talking about is what has happened. ""You genuinely feel like you want to start crying because it is so emotionally upsetting. ""It is just unbelievable.""

Farmers 'fight to survive' in heatwave,"Farmers have brought in emergency water tankers Farmers in Wales are warning that they could be fighting to survive if the summer's dry weather continues. Many say the grass they feed their cows effectively stopped growing weeks ago, prompting concerns about the food available to herds in the longer term. The weeks of scorching weather follow heavy snow storms in late winter. NFU Cymru has also warned farmers that they have ""a duty of care"" to animals, as forecasts predict two more weeks of soaring temperatures. Scorched earth on a farm in northern Pembrokeshire The warm weatherreached a record high of 32.6C in Porthmadog in Gwyneddat the end of June and the heatwave has continued this week. NFU Cymru President John Davies said he had heard farmers were already using their winter supplies of fodder because the lack of rain had stunted grass growth while the ""intense"" heat was ""burning off crops"". This video can not be played How the 1976 heatwave affected Wales How is Wales coping in the heatwave? Keeping animals cool in the heatwave Sheep rescued from under snow drift Mr Davies said: ""We've heard of farmers who are already using their winter supplies of fodder to feed livestock and with fodder already at a premium this could become a real problem later in the year."" The union has now relaunched its free fodder bank service to help members find animal feed or sell any surplus. Some farmers are having to feed animals on winter stocks The union has also had reports of many farm wells, ponds, ditches and some boreholes running dry. Some farmers are opting to dig new boreholes or in extreme cases, pay to bring in extra water. Gareth Richards, chair of NFU Cymru's milk board, said the weather could have an ""unprecedented"" impact on the dairy industry. Mr Richards, who farms in Pembrokeshire, said: ""For the majority of dairy farmers it's just a case of surviving day by day to get through, and hopefully the rains will come."" Aled Rees, who runs an organic dairy farm in north Pembrokeshire, said in 20 years of farming he had never experienced conditions like it. ""It's the loss of milk to start off with because in this weather the cows aren't milking as they should,"" he said. Slim pickings as grazing dries up ""They've dropped around three litres of milk per head, so there's a financial cost to that because there's a loss of income."" Mr Rees estimates that it has cost him around Â£13,000 more in the last month because he has had to buy in additional organic feed. ""Because we're already rationing it, we have enough grass in the fields left to last just under two weeks,"" he said. ""But after that it really needs to rain or I'm not sure what we're going to do."" A farmer checks his dried-out grass Meanwhile NFU Cymru has warned that members should follow ""the highest possible standards of husbandry"" for their animals. ""The priority for livestock farms will be protecting the welfare of their animals, putting plans in place to ensure these animals' needs are met, making sure they have access to fresh water and shade from the sun,"" said Mr Davies.

SNP 'forced votes during England match',"The Scottish National Party has been accused of ""pathetic theatrics"" by a Tory MP for forcing five votes during England's World Cup tie with Colombia. Douglas Ross, a football ref as well as MP for Moray, also suggested SNP MPs had been deliberately slow in voting. One minister urged SNP MP Ian Blackford to ""think of the people who work here"". But he said ministers were responsible for the timetable and the votes represented the SNP's chance to ""speak out against the continued austerity"". Allow Twitter content?

The school with 300 holes in the roof,"King's school is the most improved school in its area, but is struggling to find cash for staff and repairs A West Midlands head teacher is ""extremely angry"" at budget shortages which have meant cutting 14 staff - and left his school with 300 holes in the roof. James Ludlow, head of the King's Church of England school, has also had to cancel music lessons and art events. Heads' leader Geoff Barton has warned the education secretary any further budget pressures on schools would be ""catastrophic"" and risk ""insolvencies"". But the Department for Education says school funding has been protected. ""It's really heartbreaking,"" said Mr Ludlow, head of the Wolverhampton school, standing beside a bucket for collecting rain in a corridor. ""When it rains, and we've had some heavy downpours, water comes through into the corridors and brings bits of the ceiling down,"" he says. This video can not be played When it rains, the school has to cope with hundreds of holes in the roof This is the most improved school in the area and Mr Ludlow is exasperated that his efforts to turn around a school serving many disadvantaged pupils seem to be hampered whichever way he turns. There is a Â£350,000 shortfall in the budget for next year, with another Â£5m repair bill to fix the building. Subsidies for music lessons for poorer pupils have been stopped. Animals, which were particularly liked by pupils with special needs, had to be taken away. This video can not be played ""I knew we didn't have a lot of money. But I didn't realise it was that bad."" The school play, held at a venue in town and which for years has given pupils a chance to showcase their skills - has been cancelled. ""I didn't believe it. I thought they were joking. It was something I really looked forward to,"" said Anya, 14. 'Schools can have anything... except more money' Is social mobility really about school cash? Hinds acknowledges funding pressures on schools Heads warn of 'chronic' funding shortage ""I knew the school wasn't best for funding and we didn't have a lot of money. But I didn't realise it was that bad. I was really shocked. ""Put yourself in our shoes. It's not fair on us."" Marcel had been learning trumpet - but the lessons are going to cost more, making them unaffordable for his family because ""money at home is really tight"". ""I really love the trumpet. I enjoyed playing. It's really interesting. It's going to make me feel sad if I can't carry on,"" said the 12-year-old. This video can not be played Marcel said he loved playing the trumpet, but will have to give it up ""I went home and said to my mum, 'I know I won't be able to carry on,'"" said Kelsey, 11, who found her guitar lessons were going to cost more. ""It was a real shame that I had to stop. Music is part of me. I can show people who I am. I can express myself. ""The teachers are also very upset because they know opportunities are being taken from the children."" Charges for music lessons have increased: ""I went home and said to my mum, 'I know I won't be able to carry on.'"" Olivia, 15, said cutting arts and drama was not just about losing a chance for students to express themselves. ""It's important,"" she said. ""It could be their career."" But it's not a simple problem with easy scapegoats - the school is an embodiment of how policies of successive governments can have unintended consequences. It was re-built under the last Labour government - with shiny design features and a landscaped setting. And from the outside it looks like a showcase. But when it rains, the water comes through those 300 holes - and when the Sun shines, almost none of the windows can be opened. You might think it was a job for the builders to put right, except that's Carillion, which collapsed earlier this year. Olivia says not learning an instrument could mean missing out on a career When schools struggle, the typical policy response has been to turn them into academies. But the King's school has been caught in the twilight zone of so-called ""orphan"" or ""zombie"" academies, where schools are given academy status but there is no sponsor or academy trust to lead them. Next, the school was hit by the current big story in England's schools - the lack of cash. The King's school, with hugely expensive buildings and a crippling repair, bill has been hit by the squeeze on school budgets. ""It makes me extremely angry. I didn't come into teaching to cut back and cut back. I came here to improve children's lives,"" said Mr Ludlow. ""Our school offers something unique to students,"" says the head teacher ""Our school offers something unique to students. They love coming here. And to have to say to them we're going to have to increase the charges, we're going to have to take things away, it's really heartbreaking, as a teacher and a human being. ""I think some people think schools are just whingeing about it and just making it up and they could save money. ""But I can assure everybody that every penny is accounted for and that we use every penny extremely wisely and the pot of money is running very low."" ""I didn't come into teaching to cut back and cut back,"" says head teacher James Ludlow Mr Ludlow, who had to move out of his own office when the water was running down the walls, said the school had been trying to cut spending but costs were rising more rapidly than his budget. This is part of a national picture, with schools across England warning about funding problems or asking parents for money to fill the gap. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, has written a letter to the Education Secretary Damian Hinds, warning that school standards are being threatened. The next pay round for teachers is imminent - and Mr Barton has told the education secretary that any more cost pressures, such as unfunded pay awards, would be ""unaffordable and catastrophic, undoubtedly pushing some institutions into insolvency"". ""Funding is definitely getting worse in schools,"" says the heads' leader. This video can not be played Geoff Barton warns that cash pressures are directly linked to damaging standards in school. ""If you're a head teacher, the only way that you're going to make significant savings is to cut staff - and that's what happening at the moment. ""Unless something is done about funding, it is inevitable that standards of education will go down. ""If you've got fewer teachers, fewer teaching assistants, larger class sizes, if you're cutting some of the classes that would have motivated students, of course standards are going to go down."" The Department for Education says that ""record levels of funding are going into schools, with core school funding rising to Â£43.5bn by 2020"". The education department also argues that levels of spending need to be judged over the longer term - and that per pupil funding has risen by 50% over the past two decades.

UK lesbian wins right to HK spouse visa,"Same-sex marriages are not recognised in Hong Kong A married British lesbian has won the right to live and work in Hong Kong with her wife, in a landmark ruling from the territory's top court. The court found the woman, identified as QT, should be granted a spousal visa which she had initially been denied. The decision ends a long-running legal battle and could enable more same-sex couples to move to the financial hub. Same-sex marriages are not recognised in Hong Kong although discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal. ""I have fought this long battle because the government... has treated me like a second class citizen because of my sexual orientation,"" said the British woman, through a statement released by her lawyer Michael Vidler. ""Although I cannot be [there] in person today, that does not diminish the joy I feel, knowing that Hong Kong's highest court has upheld my right to be treated equally."" QT entered into a civil partnership in England in 2011 after more than seven years with her partner. In the same year, the couple moved to Hong Kong after QT's partner was offered a job there. Hong Kong's LGBT rights debate Hong Kong profile In 2014, QT sued the director of immigration after she was denied a spousal visa that would have granted her resident status, and allowed her to work without the need for a separate visa. She won her case at the Court of Appeal, but that ruling was challenged and taken to the city's top court. The latest decision ends a three-year legal battle which drew support from banks and law firms keen to attract talent to Hong Kong. Firms including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley publicly backed QT and argued diverse hiring practices were needed to attract top talent. ""The ability to bring in dependants is an important issue for persons deciding whether to move to Hong Kong,"" the court said, according to AFP news agency. It said it was ""counter-productive"" to restrict that right to straight couples.

First ads banned under new junk food rules,"Cadbury, Chewits and Squashies sweets have become the first companies to have online adverts banned under new rules targeting junk food ads for children. The Advertising Standards Authority said the companies did not do enough to prevent under-16s seeing the content. New rules governing children's advertising,externalonline came into force last July, adding to rules already in place for TV ads. The adverts featured on the companies' websites, apps or social media. In its ruling,external, ASA banned Cadbury's use of a storybook titled The Tale Of The Great Easter Bunny on its website, which featured children hunting for eggs. Chewits had four Facebook posts banned which featured Chewie the Chewitsaurus in a number of campaigns. And a so-called advergame app called Squashies World, where players match pairs of Squashies by flicking them towards each other, was also banned. 'Ban cartoon characters' on unhealthy food Children 'bombarded by junk food' ads Online children's junk food ads banned Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance said: ""Whilst today's rulings should be celebrated, the complaints demonstrate the blatant ways in which the food and drink industry attempts to exploit loopholes in the rules."" ASA chief executive Guy Parker said: ""The ban on HFSS [high in fat, salt or sugar] ads in children's online media is working, but it's important that we enforce it rigorously. ""These rulings show that we're doing that and will help advertisers understand where we're drawing the line."" Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, said it would now ""build upon our longstanding commitment to not market directly to children under the age of 16"". Swizzels, which makes Squashies, said the advergame it created was not designed to appeal to children and did not ""in any way"" encourage children to eat sweets. Chewits producer Cloetta said its Chewitsaurus was not ""developed to target under-16s"" and was instead targeted at ""parents and young adults"". Separately, YouTube star Zoella and Pointless Blog, run by her partner Alfie Dayes, were not found to have broken the ASA rules, after advertising the confectionary brand Ferrero. The body found reasonable steps had been taken to target ads appropriately, and only a small portion of the the channel's viewers were under-16.

Trump 'to scrap' affirmative action policy,"Harvard currently faces a lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in its admissions process The Trump administration is set to roll back the Obama-era policies promoting diversity in universities, known as affirmative action, US media report. US Attorney General Jeff Sessions revoked 24 guidance documents on Tuesday, many involving race in schools and affirmative action recommendations. It comes as Harvard University faces a discrimination lawsuit alleging it limits admissions for Asian-Americans. In 2016, the US Supreme Court had ruled in favour of affirmative action. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the 2016 opinion, announced his retirement from the top US court last month. His departure gives President Donald Trump a chance to appoint a justice who more closely matches the administration's views on taking race into account in college admissions. The Trump administration is expected to tell schools not to consider race in the admissions process, discontinuing the policy former President Barack Obama adopted to promote more diversity at colleges and high schools. Academic affirmative action - known as positive action in the UK- which involves favouring minorities during the admissions process in order to promote campus diversity, has long proved controversial in the US. The lawsuit against Harvard currently filed by the Students for Fair Admissions alleges that the college holds Asian-American applicants to an unfairly high admissions standard. Harvard 'biased against Asian-Americans' US court upholds 'affirmative action' Do white US students really get a bad deal? The Justice Department is also currently investigating Harvard over racial discrimination allegations. In April, it called for the public disclosure of the Ivy League college's admissions practices. Harvard argues it ""does not discriminate against applicants from any group, including Asian-Americans"". Asian-Americans currently make up 22.2% of students admitted to Harvard,according to the university website,external. The US attorney general revoked several affirmative action guidances The guidelines,external, jointly issued by the education and justice departments under President Obama, encouraged universities to promote diversity on campuses. ""Learning environments comprised of students from diverse backgrounds provide an enhanced educational experience for individual students,"" the guidance reads. ""By choosing to create this kind of rich academic environment, educational institutions help students sharpen their critical thinking and analytical skills."" The guidance features ways to encourage diversity, including granting admission preferences to students from certain schools based on demographics and considering a student's race ""among other factors in its admissions procedures"". The Obama-era policy replaced the Bush-era view that discouraged affirmative action. The Bush-era guidance had been removed from the government website during the Obama administration,but it has since reappeared,external. Education Secretary Betsy DeVostold the Associated Press,externalshe would not debate or discuss the matter of race and college admissions. ""I think this has been a question before the courts and the courts have opined,"" Ms DeVos said. Butaccording to a Pew Research Center study,external, 71% of Americans surveyed in October 2017 have a positive view of affirmative action. Harvard University has one of the lowest admissions rates, accepting less than 6% of applicants Affirmative action, or the idea that disadvantaged groups should receive preferential treatment, first appeared in President John F Kennedy's 1961 executive order on federal contractor hiring. It took shape during the height of the civil rights movement, when President Lyndon Johnson signed a similar executive order in 1965 requiring government contractors to take steps to hire more minorities. Colleges and universities began using those same guidelines in their admissions process, but affirmative action soon prompted intense debate in the decades following, with several cases appearing before the US Supreme Court. The high court has outlawed using racial quotas, but has allowed colleges and universities to continue considering race in admitting students. Critics rail against it as ""reverse discrimination"", but proponents contend it is necessary to ensure diversity in education and employment.

'Major incident' declared after two collapse,"The pair, believed to be Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley, were found unconscious on Saturday A man and woman are in a critical condition after being exposed to an unknown substance, which counter terrorism officers are investigating. The pair, believed to be Charlie Rowley, 45, and Dawn Sturgess, 44, were found unconscious at a house in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on Saturday. It is understood tests are being carried out on the substance at a government chemical weapons laboratory. Amesbury is about eight miles from the Salisbury Russian spy poisoning site. Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with Novichok, a suspected military nerve agent, in March. The substance Novichok was identified by the defence research facility at Porton Down, which is understood to be carrying out tests on the latest substance. Investigators are trying to work out if the Novichok could have been prepared in Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury, and the Amesbury pair came into contact with its residue. Police have cordoned off a number of areas including Muggleton Road in Amesbury The government's emergency committee, Cobra, has met in the Cabinet Office at an official level to discuss the events in Amesbury, which is being ""treated with the utmost seriousness"". A further meeting of the committee will be held on Wednesday evening to hear updates on the situation which was initially treated as a suspected drugs-related incident. Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury was one of a number of areas cordoned off The Met said counter terrorism officers are now working with Wiltshire Police ""given the recent events in Salisbury"". Wiltshire Police said it was ""open-minded"" about the cause after the pair, who are British nationals, were found at the house in Muggleton Road, Amesbury. Paramedics were called twice to the property, firstly in the morning after Ms Sturgess had collapsed and then later the same day after reports Mr Rowley had also fallen unwell. While it was not clear whether a crime had been committed, the force said, a number of places in Amesbury and Salisbury known to have been frequented by the couple had been cordoned off. Are you in the area? Do you have any information you can share? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? It said the public can expect to see an increased police presence in and around Amesbury and Salisbury. ""It was initially believed that the two patients fell ill after using possibly heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs,"" Wiltshire Police said. ""They are both currently receiving treatment for suspected exposure to an unknown substance at Salisbury District Hospital,"" it added. The Amesbury branch of Boots has closed on Wednesday morning as a ""precautionary measure"" The pair are believed to have attended a family fun day at Amesbury Baptist Church Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess are believed to have attended a family fun day at Amesbury Baptist Church on Saturday afternoon before they were found unconscious in the property they had just moved into. Roy Collins, church secretary, said ""nobody else has suffered any ill-effects"" from attending the community event and ""there was nothing going on that was nefarious"". ""There have been no reports of any other incidents,"" he said. ""We are all quite puzzled and shocked - naturally the connection with Salisbury and recent events there mean there is a heightened public interest."" Boots has closed its Amesbury store as ""a precautionary measure"" to allow police to carry out an investigation, a spokesperson confirmed. Neighbours tell me the peace at this usually quiet new estate in Amesbury was broken at about 18:30 BST on Saturday evening. It was hot and many were out having barbecues when they heard sirens and saw flashing lights as first ambulances, then the fire brigade and police arrived in Muggleton Road. They saw seven fire engines and fire officers wearing hazmat suits at the scene. The house was cordoned off and the word here was that this was a suspected drugs overdose. This morning many are in disbelief that this has been declared a major incident and that so many reporters from national media have descended on their doorsteps. Two police cars and three officers are here as Wiltshire Police is yet again dealing with a major incident just a few miles away from where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found. The fire service was also called to Muggleton Road on Saturday evening Wiltshire and Dorset Fire Rescue Service said seven vehicles and two specialist ones had attended Muggleton Road on Saturday evening. Crews in hazmat suits, which are worn to deal with dangerous or hazardous substances, were sent to the scene in what the fire service described as a ""standard procedure response"". Chloe Edwards, a 17-year-old college student who lives near the cordoned-off flat, said she was having dinner when ""all these emergency vehicles turned up"" and was told to stay inside. ""They were putting on these green suits and we thought it was the gas as our electricity was turned off as well,"" she said. ""We wanted to know what happened and with the Russian attack happening not long ago we just assumed the worst. ""I am not sure how long they were in there but we couldn't get out of the house for two-and-a-half hours."" This video can not be played Residents react to news of latest incident in Amesbury Resident Jake Murphy said he was watching the football on Tuesday night when ""all these police cars appeared"". ""I didn't know what was happening,"" he said. Justin Doughty, who lives opposite the police cordon, said none of the residents have been ""told anything by the police"". ""We would have thought the police would have been more forthcoming and keep us in the loop."" A government source said: ""Senior Whitehall officials are being kept informed of what is going on on the ground as we seek to establish the facts of this case. ""No definitive conclusions have yet been established."" Wiltshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Angus Macpherson said the police had worked hard at ""containing any risk that might be there"". ""There's no reason to think it's connected with matters of last month,"" he said. ""I haven't seen anything in this incident yet that I would consider to be an overreaction in terms of previous incidents, it all seems fairly textbook."" Public Health England said it did not believe there was a ""significant health risk"" to the wider public, although its advice was being continually assessed. The hospital was ""open as usual"" and advised patients to attend routine appointments unless contacted and advised to do otherwise. Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals?

Vote Leave campaign 'broke electoral law'The EU Leave campaign is expected to be found guilty of four charges of breaking electoral law.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Former Vote Leave chief Matthew Elliott defended his group's actions The official Brexit campaign is expected to be found guilty of four charges of breaking electoral law, the BBC has been told. The draft of an investigation into Vote Leave concludes it broke spending limits and failed to comply with some of the rules. It also imposes fines as a result of its findings. But the group's former chief executive claimed the Electoral Commission had not followed due process. Matthew Elliott has submitted a 500-page dossier to the Electoral Commission rebutting the claims. The commission said Vote Leave had taken the ""unusual step"" of going public having seen the draft report. According to Vote Leave's dossier, the commission finds the campaign group: made an inaccurate return of campaign expenditure is missing invoices and receipts failed to comply with a statutory notice exceeded its spending limit Crucially, the draft report is said to claim there was coordination between Vote Leave and a smaller campaign, BeLeave, which received a donation of more than Â£600,000 in the closing weeks of the referendum, after advice from the Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings. For months there have been allegations that the two campaigns broke the rules by working together too closely. The electoral rules stipulate that different campaign groups can work loosely together but they must not have a ""common plan"". This has always been denied by the two groups and has been investigated twice already by the Electoral Commission. Vote Leave now admits there was email correspondence between a donor, Anthony Clake, and Mr Cummings about passing a donation on to BeLeave. It is understood that this third investigation concludes that there was a ""common plan"", and therefore the law was broken. A spokesperson for the Electoral Commission said: ""The commission has concluded its investigation and, having reached initial findings, provided Vote Leave with a 28-day period to make any further or new representations. That period ended on Tuesday 3 July. ""The unusual step taken by Vote Leave in sharing its views on the Electoral Commission's initial findings does not affect the process set out in law."" It said it would give ""due considerations"" to representations it had received and then publish a ""thorough and detailed closing report in order to provide a full and balanced account"". Speaking to the BBC, Mr Elliott said the commission had ""listened to one side of the story"". ""We offered to go in for interviews, both at board level and at staff level,"" he said. ""They haven't accepted any interviews from our side."" Mr Elliott said he thought Vote Leave had ""acted both within the letter of the law and also the spirit of the law"", and that it was perfectly legitimate that they would ""work alongside other groups and encourage them and encourage their activities"". Vote Leave was the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum He denied that he was simply trying to deflect the coming criticism of the campaign. ""We're saying 'can they look at our side of the story?''', he said, adding that they would take legal action to try to overturn the charges if they were not withdrawn. Tamsin Allen, the solicitor who represents the whistleblowers who went public with claims that Vote Leave broke the law, said: ""Vote Leave may not like this conclusion, but there is clearly a proper evidential basis for it. ""The commission should be permitted to complete its work and we await the release of its final report."" One of the whistleblowers, Christopher Wylie, called for the referendum to be rerun, saying: ""If sanctions are issued against Vote Leave or their affiliates, this means the law was broken."" Another whistleblower, former Vote Leave activist Shahmir Sanni, said: ""I'm waiting for the report, but just for clarity, I told you so."" During Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said she would not comment on ""a leaked report"" after the matter was raised by the SNP. She added that the government would consider the final report and any recommendations. A spokesman for Anthony Clake, whose donation was given to BeLeave at the suggestion of Mr Cummings, said: ""Mr Clake was told by Mr Cummings that Vote Leave was reaching its spending limits, so he suggested that he could give it to BeLeave instead, which he did. ""Any alleged collusion between the campaigns is a matter for them.""

UK lesbian wins right to HK spouse visaThe landmark case had secured support from firms keen to attract expatriates to the financial hub.Asia,"Same-sex marriages are not recognised in Hong Kong A married British lesbian has won the right to live and work in Hong Kong with her wife, in a landmark ruling from the territory's top court. The court found the woman, identified as QT, should be granted a spousal visa which she had initially been denied. The decision ends a long-running legal battle and could enable more same-sex couples to move to the financial hub. Same-sex marriages are not recognised in Hong Kong although discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal. ""I have fought this long battle because the government... has treated me like a second class citizen because of my sexual orientation,"" said the British woman, through a statement released by her lawyer Michael Vidler. ""Although I cannot be [there] in person today, that does not diminish the joy I feel, knowing that Hong Kong's highest court has upheld my right to be treated equally."" QT entered into a civil partnership in England in 2011 after more than seven years with her partner. In the same year, the couple moved to Hong Kong after QT's partner was offered a job there. Hong Kong's LGBT rights debate Hong Kong profile In 2014, QT sued the director of immigration after she was denied a spousal visa that would have granted her resident status, and allowed her to work without the need for a separate visa. She won her case at the Court of Appeal, but that ruling was challenged and taken to the city's top court. The latest decision ends a three-year legal battle which drew support from banks and law firms keen to attract talent to Hong Kong. Firms including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley publicly backed QT and argued diverse hiring practices were needed to attract top talent. ""The ability to bring in dependants is an important issue for persons deciding whether to move to Hong Kong,"" the court said, according to AFP news agency. It said it was ""counter-productive"" to restrict that right to straight couples.

UK to set out post-Brexit fishing plans,"This video can not be played Reality Check: Fishing after Brexit - sink or swim? The fishing industry will get a larger share of domestic catch after Brexit once the UK ""decides access"" to its own waters, Michael Gove has insisted. The environment secretary said the UK would be in the ""driving seat"" in quota negotiations once the UK leaves the EU's Common Fisheries Policy but would not commit to a specific figure. At the moment, quotas are assigned to each country, with limits on species. UK fishing groups are pressing to keep more than 80% of domestic catch. The Scottish government said it had not been properly consulted about the UK's proposals for fishing after Brexit,unveiled on Wednesday,external, and had ""significant concerns"" about them. The UK says it gets a bad deal under current arrangements. In 2014, half of UK fish production was exported to the EU, a quarter to outside the EU and a quarter was consumed domestically. Fishermen protest over post-Brexit deal What kind of Brexit do voters want? There were protests earlier this year when it was revealed that the UK would continue to be bound by the Common Fisheries Policy during the post-Brexit transition period which is due to run until the end of 2020. Ministers have urged the industry to keep their ""eyes on the prize"" of getting full control and have now published a White Paper setting out their vision for how they UK will do this as an ""independent coastal state"". This video can not be played The UK will decide fishing access in British waters post-Brexit, the environment secretary tells Today Mr Gove told the BBC that from 2021 the UK would control fishing access to a 200 nautical mile ""exclusive economic zone"" around its coastline. While he would not be drawn on what share of catch the UK could keep in this area after Brexit, he said there was no reason the UK should be in a ""weaker position"" than Norway or Iceland - which retains 80% and 95% respectively of fish caught in their territorial waters. ""Like other independent coastal states, we can decide who has access to our waters and we can ensure that a greater proportion of the fish in our waters is caught by British vessels, landed in British ports and processed by British producers,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. While accepting there would still be annual negotiations over catch quotas in British waters, he said ""it will be a negotiation where we hold the cards and we are in the driving seat"". Mr Gove said market access for fish exports - which has yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU - would be treated separately from the question of access to each other's waters. The EU haspreviously suggestedthe two issues should be tied together. Half of UK fish production was exported to the EU in 2014 During a Commons debate on the plans, Conservative MP John Redwood said Brexit could be a fillip for the UK's 10,000 or so fish and chip shops. ""Isn't it the case that we have a huge opportunity here to make sure that much more of the fish is landed by our boats in order to make sure that our traditional fish and chips is once again fish from our fishing grounds, properly looked after by a national policy?"" he said. But Labour warned of a gap between what Mr Gove hoped for and what he could deliver. ""This white paper is full of optimism for the negotiations but the only deal so far agreed on fishing is we'll keep EU fishing policies during the transition period - and we're not holding our breath that this will all go according to plan,"" said shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman. Ministers have said they will publish an annual statement of fish stocks and work with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments, to whom fishing policy is devolved, to help any struggling stocks to recover as well as helping them to ""maximise their power to manage their fisheries"". But the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins said there was no mention in the report of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, which he said had been vital in helping coastal communities in Scotland and across the UK to diversify. ""There are a number of areas where we think there have been omissions,"" he told BBC News. Brexiteers including Nigel Farage protested in April at a delay in leaving the Common Fisheries Policy ""And half the fish landed are sold into European markets so there are concerns around what will happen with that valuable product.""
