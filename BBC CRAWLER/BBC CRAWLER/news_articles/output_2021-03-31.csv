Schools abuse helpline and safeguarding review launched,"Website Everyone's Invited has published thousands of testimonies (stock image) A helpline and immediate review into sexual abuse in schools have been set up by the government in response to thousands of allegations from students. Ofsted will look at safeguarding in both state and independent schools. The helpline will be run by the NSPCC to both support potential victims and provide advice to children and adults. ""Sexual abuse in any form is abhorrent and it is vital that these allegations are dealt with properly,"" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said. ""While the majority of schools take their safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously, I am determined to make sure the right resources and processes are in place across the education system to support any victims of abuse to come forward."" The debate about a culture of sexual abuse at schools has escalated in recent weeks after a website set up for victims to anonymously post their experiences gained more than 11,000 posts, some from children as young as nine. Many of the allegations on the website refer to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university. Wendy Mair, from the Everyone's Invited site, said they were ""proud to have started a crucial conversation"", but disappointed the education secretary had not contacted them before the announcement. ""We are encouraged to see that the government has responded and taken the first initial steps to review rape culture in all schools,"" she said, adding that she hoped the site's team will be included in carrying out the review. ""The testimonies being shared through Everyone's Invited are extremely upsetting, and underline the urgent need to tackle violence against girls,"" said NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless. ""This is a watershed moment thanks to those who have found the courage to speak out."" Sex abuse claims 'not limited to private schools' School abuse: 'Raped girl ignored by teachers' The helpline will be open from 09:00 GMT on Thursday to offer support and advice to children and adults who are victims of sexual abuse in schools. This includes how to contact the police and report crimes, if they wish to, while parents and professionals can also get in touch. Students have contacted the BBC criticising what they see as their school's failure to tackle incidents or acknowledge the wider issues. Sarah, who is 18 and goes to a state school in London, said she had been ""sexually harassed on numerous occasions"" by students at a neighbouring private school. She said she feels incredibly let down by what she saw as her school's ""lack of response"" to the recent discussions around women's safety. ""It's really been left to students to care for each other, often leading to major tensions within peer groups as people attempt to 'confront' certain students known for sexually inappropriate behaviour,"" she said. In June 2020, Soma Sara, who is now 22, shared her experience on Instagram of what she calls ""rape culture"". Within a week she had received and shared more than 300 anonymous responses of people with stories of ""misogyny, harassment, abuse and assault"". The Everyone's Invited,externalwebsite now carries thousands of victims' testimonies, often from schools and universities. Experiences range from being drugged and raped at parties to explicit images being shared over messaging platforms. Another sixth former, from Kent, suggested there had been ""lots of sexual assault allegations"" made at her school, but that these had been played down. ""Before lockdown two we tried talking to the school and that has totally been ignored, and because of their 'prestigious' image they've been telling girls to keep quiet and to think of the accused's mental health,"" she said. Last week, pupils at Highgate School in North Londonwalked out of classesin protest at a perceived ""rape culture"", following the publication of accounts of alleged abuse. One male ex-pupiltold BBC Newsnightthat girls were ""hounded"" for naked selfies at the school. The school's governing body said it was ""truly sorry"" and had commissioned an external review. Ofsted will begin an immediate review of safeguarding policies in state and private schools, to determine whether guidance for schools around sexual harassment needs to be improved. It will conclude by the end of May More than half of young women had been sexually harassed at their school, college or university,polling of 1,000 young women,externalaged 14-21 last autumn suggested. One in five said they had received unwanted sexual comments and 8% had been groped, according to the figures from girls' rights charity Plan International UK. Conservative MP Maria Miller, former chairwoman of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, told BBC Breakfast there was ""far more to do"" on the issue. ""If we don't tackle it in our schools we leave young people leaving school thinking that is entirely right, that they're able to either sexually harass or be on the receiving end of sexual harassment,"" she said. ""And that's why we're seeing these behaviours going to our universities, our workplaces and beyond."" Ms Miller said new mandatory relationships education in England, and a forthcoming Online Harms Bill introducing age controls on online pornography, were ""steps in the right direction"". ""There is no doubt that schools can and should play a key role in this work, but this is a problem that reaches far beyond the school gates,"" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of head teachers' union NAHT, said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the union welcomed the review and the helpline, adding: ""Robust safeguarding is the number one priority of state and independent schools.""

Wales' pubs could reopen indoors in May,"Pubs and restaurant owners had been keen to know when they could reopen Pubs, restaurants and hotels in Wales may reopen indoors in time for the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. First Minister Mark Drakeford has set out a series of dates for easing lockdown, stretching into the next month. Under the plans two households could meet indoors from 10 May, if Covid cases remained low. Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK andCommon Travel Area,externalmay go ahead from 12 April. Restaurants and bars could reopen outdoors from 26 April and from 3 May, outdoor wedding receptions with up to 30 people may be permitted. But the changes could depend on the results ofthe Senedd election on 6 May, and whether the Welsh Labour leader is returned to power. The Welsh Conservatives' own plans would seemost rules on social contact scrapped by 17 May. Both the Tories and Plaid Cymru called forgyms to reopen now, while Plaid said the Senedd should be recalled to discuss more economic help for businesses. Under the Welsh plans gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities will also be able to reopen from 10 May. This will include individual or one-to-one training, but not exercise classes. Spring Bank Holiday Monday is 31 May, but the Welsh government has not specified an actual date for reopening hospitality indoors. It said after 17 May it would ""consider enabling indoor hospitality and remaining visitor accommodation to reopen in advance of the Spring Bank Holiday"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Delay to reopening gyms in Wales 'irresponsible' Cultural and sport events may welcome crowds back Only six people from two households will be able to meet in reopened beer gardens and should still socially distance. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the public emergency is not over. He toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""You see in the pattern a continuation of the step-by-step approach we've taken in Wales, doing the outdoor activities first because it's safer to be outdoors. ""But for the first time in the timetable we are now able to set out the first re-openings of indoor activities as well."" He added: ""The presence of the virus in Wales is the lowest in the United Kingdom, the rate of vaccination in Wales is the highest in the United Kingdom. ""On Saturday, we will complete the vaccination offerto everybody in the top nine priority groups, again the first country in the UK to get to that milestone."" Provided cases remain low, the following things will be permitted: Monday, 12 April Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK and Common Travel Area, dependant on restrictions where you are intending to travel to All non-essential retail and close contact services, like beauty salons, allowed to reopen Monday, 26 April Outdoor hospitality, including cafes, pubs and restaurants Outdoor attractions, including funfairs and theme parks End of 22:00 BST alcohol sale limit in shops Monday, 3 May Organised outdoor activities for up to 30 people Outdoor wedding receptions attended by no more than 30 people Monday, 10 May People will be allowed to form extended households again, allowing two households to meet and have contact indoors Gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities can reopen. Individual and one-to-one training will be allowed, but not exercise classes Monday, 17 May Children's indoor activities Community centres Organised indoor activities for adults, limited to a maximum of 15 people. This includes exercise classes Beyond that date, ministers would consider reopening indoor pubs and restaurants, and remaining visitor accommodation ahead of the Spring Bank Holiday. Lucy Hywel says throwing away stock has been painful Tracy Lawler, who owns The Dressing Room Boutique in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, said she cannot wait to reopen on 12 April. She said because her shop is ""is small and intimate I can keep it really ultra clean after each person has entered"". ""I'm probably one of the safest public places for people to come in and the government is saying to me that I can't open up [yet]â¦ very frustrating."" Lucy Hywel, who owns That's Lovely That giftshop in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, was also looking forward to reopening, but said: ""We're hurt and we're still hurting. ""I myself have thrown out loads of food, thousands of pounds worth of stock, even last week, stock I thought I may have sold in the lead up to Easter got chucked away and that pain is there every time you do something like that."" Victoria Hallimi says the past few months have been really tough Victoria Hallimi, who owns Victoria's Driving School in Swansea, gave her last lesson on 13 December but can now reopen on 12 April. She said: ""My phone was going a bit crazy last night as soon as the announcement was made. ""I was up until about 11, 11:30 last night scheduling everybody in."" She said the past few months had been ""really tough"" and her husband had been doing a lot of overtime to make up for her not being able to work. ""He can relax now,"" she added. Kelly John has not paid herself a wage since January Kelly John, owner of KMW Beauty in Maesteg, Bridgend county, said she has not paid herself a wage since January to ensure she had enough money in her business account to buy supplies when she was allowed to reopen. ""Luckily my husband is working, otherwise I wouldn't have a house,"" the mother-of-two said. ""But being an independent woman, it is really hard. I can't do anything - it's Easter this weekend and I haven't bought anything."" Meanwhile, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective, which represents more than 400 Welsh hospitality firms, said it welcomed the move but ""continues to press for certainty and support"" about funding to support them while they remain closed. The plans will move Wales into the ""alert level three,external"" stage of the government's control plan by 17 May. While parts of Wales' lockdown have eased quicker than elsewhere in the UK, the Welsh government had been reluctant to set out a full schedule for when different sectors would reopen. Friday's announcement is the most detailed list of dates given by the government since the winter lockdown began to be eased. It does not go as far as England's tentative plans to scrap social contact restrictions by 21 June, although Mark Drakeford has previously said that's""very optimistic"". Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new ""indicative dates"" were are there ""to help businesses plan and prepare"". ""We have to remember that the pandemic isn't over - it's more important than ever that we continue to work together to keep this terrible virus under control so that we can go on unlocking Wales."" What can I do now... and what comes next? Some sectors like cinemas and theatres have not been given a date to reopen in Wales. Following criticism of his plans for gyms and leisure centres, Mr Drakeford said the sector will be the first able to reopen indoors. Pubs will be able to open outdoors two weeks after England. The first minister said he had considered bringing that forward, but ""the advice was very clear that that was not advisable on public health grounds"". First Minister Mark Drakeford has criticised Boris Johnson's roadmap out of lockdown in England as being optimistic The Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Mr Drakeford's roadmap was ""very late in the day"". He said it was ""unfortunate"" that further funding had not been made available to hospitality sector - and said outdoor hospitality should be opening in line with England on 12 April. Mr Davies told Wales Today: ""What's really dumbfounding is that despite his mental health minister's assurances that gyms will be one of the first facilities to open, they are now not going to open until May."" Plaid Cymru Leader Adam Price said he would go faster on reopening gyms and indoor hospitality. ""We've also been calling for a much more accelerated timetable in terms of reopening gyms, because of their importance in terms of mental and physical well being. So I think it's disappointing to see that being delayed. ""There are dangers of course in moving too fast but there's an equal danger of being over cautious"". Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds said: ""Now that more and more of Wales is opening up and life is slowly returning to normal, it's time to put our recovery first. ""I want to see support for those individuals who will lose their jobs when furlough ends, those who are likely to lose their homes when the ban on evictions is lifted and those whose mental health has suffered as a result of this pandemic."" A UKIP spokesman said: ""With the success of the vaccine rollout, lockdowns no longer have any major impact on case numbers. ""The Welsh economy must be reopened now. Not in a month's time. This apathetic timeline will be the final nail in the coffin for many businesses that have been just about clinging on."" What are the stats in my area? The road out of the Welsh lockdown - key data to watch for The announcement comes as latest figures show admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 caseshit a record low- it stands at a daily seven-day average of 19. Covid hospital admissions are the lowest since the pandemic began with 17 confirmed and suspected Covid patients on Wednesday, with none at all in Swansea Bay hospitals.

Minimum wage rises for two million workers,"About two million of the UK's lowest-paid workers will get a pay rise from Thursday as the minimum wage goes up. The National Living Wage will rise 2.2% to Â£8.91, the equivalent of more than Â£345 a year for a full-time employee. It will also be given to 23 and 24-year-olds for the first time, not just those aged 25 and over. Statutory rates for apprentices and those aged between 18 and 22 will also rise, along with the voluntary ""Real Living Wage"". However, hundreds of thousands of low-paid workers on furlough will see no uplift at all after they were excluded. Furlough numbers climb sharply in January 'Finding work feels impossible for my generation' Ministers said the increases to minimum wages would particularly benefit workers in sectors such as retail, hospitality, cleaning and maintenance. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would be ""a welcome boost to families right across the UK"". Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng urged ""all workers"" to check their pay packets to ensure they were ""getting what they are entitled to, and remind employers of their duty to pay the correct wage"". From Â£8.72 to Â£8.91 an hour for workers over the age of 23 From Â£8.20 to Â£8.36 for those aged 21-22 From Â£6.45 to Â£6.56 for 18 to 20-year-olds From Â£4.55 to Â£4.62 for under-18s From Â£4.15 to Â£4.30 for apprentices What is the minimum wage? The voluntary Real Living Wage will rise to Â£10.85 an hour in London and Â£9.50 outside the capital, but only a small minority of employers have signed up to pay it. The foundation promoting it warned there was still a ""substantial gap"" between the statutory rates and one based on the actual cost of living. Much of the UK's retail and hospitality industries remain closed because of Covid, meaning many of the lowest-paid workers are on furlough and will miss out on a pay rise. They will continue to get 80% of their usual income, based on pre-pandemic rates for the minimum wage. About 800,000 of the lowest-paid workers were on furlough in February, according to the House of Commons Library. The government said furloughed workers who returned to work after 1 April would move on to the new minimum wage rates for hours worked. But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds hit out at the ""pay freeze"" for furloughed workers. ""Hitting Britain's families in their pockets isn't just wrong - it's economically illiterate. If families have less money to spend, then businesses will suffer and the recovery will take longer,"" she said. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, also said nobody should be expected to get by on less than the minimum wage. ""Low-paid workers on furlough have bills to pay like everyone else,"" she said. ""The government should guarantee that everybody will get at least the full rate of the minimum wage. And it should give all minimum wage workers a decent pay rise."" Mike Hawking of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation described the boost to the minimum wage as ""necessary"", but said that the pandemic had revealed the urgency of taking further steps to tackle in-work poverty. ""As we start to recover from the impact of the last year, too many workers are finding that minimum wage increases are being wiped out due to inadequate social security, insufficient hours available to them, and high housing costs."" Bryan Sanderson, chairman of the Low Pay Commission, which recommends the level at which the minimum wage should be set, said: ""This week's increase is our first step towards the government's target of two-thirds of median earnings. ""It is a real-terms increase, meaning that an hour's work can buy more than it could last year at the start of the pandemic. The level of the new rate, however, also reflects the need to protect workers from job losses."" The commission said its best estimate for the National Living Wage rate in 2022 was Â£9.42, but this is subject to more uncertainty than usual and is likely to change. This rise in the legal minimum wage will be welcome news, particularly as most households across the UK are also seeing their bills going up from the start of April. Planned price rises kick in for gas and electricity, council tax, water charges, the licence fee, TV and broadband rates, and NHS prescription charges in England. It'll be a stretch for many. For those minimum wage staff who are on furlough at the moment, the news is even harder. Pay for those who would normally be working in bars, restaurants, hairdressers and hotels will continue to be based on 80% of their pre-Covid earnings. They won't get the new pay rise until they start back to work again, but given the timetable on easing restrictions, many may be heading back to full employment soon.

Police determine cause of Woods crashThe details of what caused Tiger Woods' car crash will only be released if the 15-time major winner gives permission for police to share their findings.BBC Sport,"This video can not be played Tiger Woods suffered serious injuries in the crash The details of what caused Tiger Woods' car crash will only be released if the 15-time major winner gives permission for police to share their findings. A cause has been determined and the investigation is concluded, said Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva. Woods, 45, needed surgery after suffering a fractured leg and shattered ankle inthe crash on 23 February. ""We have the contents of the black box, everything completed, signed, sealed and delivered,"" said Villanueva. ""But we cannot release it without the permission of the people involved in the collision."" Woods returned to his Florida home from hospital earlier this month, saying he would work on ""getting stronger every day"". The American former world number one, who was recovering from back surgery at the time of his accident, was found unconscious and with his face and chin covered in blood at the scene. Los Angeles police said there was no evidence Woods had been impaired by drugs or alcohol at the time of the crash. Following the crash, Villanueva said Woods survived ""what would otherwise have been a fatal crash"" because the interior of his vehicle had remained largely intact. When confirming on Wednesday that the investigation had been concluded, he added: ""We have reached out to Tiger Woods and his personnel and there are some privacy issues on releasing information on the investigation. ""We are going to ask them if they can waive the privacy, and then we will be able to do a full release on all the information regarding the accident.""

"PwC says start when you like, leave when you likeAccountancy giant staff can choose the hours they work and mix home and office following pandemic.","From now on if you work for PriceWaterhouseCooper you'll be able to work from home a couple of days a week and start as early or late as you like. This summer you can knock off early on Fridays too. Following the pandemic the accountancy giant is offering its staff much more control over their working pattern. PwC chairman Kevin Ellis said he hoped this would make flexible working ""the norm rather than the exception"". ""We want our people to feel trusted and empowered,"" Mr Ellis said. Sunak: 'People may quit if made to work from home' 'People are tired of working from home' Nationwide tells 13,000 staff to 'work anywhere' A year of working from home and juggling childcare when schools were closed and other responsibilities mounted, has prompted many businesses to look again at the traditional working week. The building society Nationwide has told its staff they can choose whether to work at home or in the office. Oil giant BP has told office staff they can spend two days a week working from home and several banks are examining hybrid home-office arrangements. But PwC is the first of the big four accountancy firms to announce their post-pandemic strategy. Goldman Sachs' chief executive made clear he saw working from home during the pandemic as an ""aberration"" saying young employees at the investment bank needed direct contact and mentorship that you could only get in the office. But Mr Ellis said PwC wanted to retain a mix of working from home and the office. ""Without conscious planning now there's a risk we lose the best bits of these new ways of working when the economy opens up again,"" he said. ""The future of work is changing at such a pace we have to evolve continually how we do things to meet the needs of our people and our clients."" The pandemic has highlighted many advantages to working from home, the time and expense saved commuting, not having to wear tights or a tie, and a better work-life balance, including spending more time with the children. But for many the appeal of the zoom-in-a-tracksuit meeting is fading, compared to the idea of water-cooler moments and after-work drinks. They look forward to being back in the work environment, and free from the demands of the children. Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently suggested that employees might ""vote with their feet"" if they were required to work from home full time. He praised the ""the spontaneity, the team building, the culture that you create in a firm or an organisation from people actually spending physical time together"". There are the knock-on economic impacts of office life too. City centres full of office workers help support the livelihoods of sandwich sellers, retailers, cleaners and transport workers. The Canary Wharf financial complex in London currently only has about 6,000 going into work. Pre-pandemic it was 100,000 and the area is packed with shuttered wine bars and restaurants. Canary Wharf's head of strategy, Howard Dawber, claims people are missing office life, grabbing a coffee, lunch with colleagues and other aspects of city centre life. In fact only around a fifth of UK workers want to work from home entirely, and around the same proportion want to work only in the office, according to arecent survey carried out on behalf of the World Economic Forum,external. They point out that workplaces that operate a ""mixed mode"" will have to be aware it may have an impact on who gets promoted, with knock on implications for diversity, especially for women. PwC expect their staff will want the best of both worlds, and will adopt a ""blended working"" approach, spending around half of their working hours either in the office or at clients' workplaces. There is an assumption that the majority of people will condense their working week and finish at lunchtime on a Friday during July and August, PwC said. The new policies will be phased in as lockdown restrictions ease and its 22,000 staff return to the office.

PPS announces review of Storey funeral decisionProsecutors opted not to pursue cases against 24 Sinn FÃ©in politicians - including NI's deputy first minister.Northern Ireland,"Sinn FÃ©in's leader and deputy leader attended the funeral last June, along with former leader Gerry Adams (centre) The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) has announced a review of its decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey. The funeral last June attracted 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. The actions of 24 Sinn FÃ©in politicians were examined, including Ms O'Neill. Separately, Health Minister Robin Swann urged people to stick with restrictions and not be distracted by politics. The PPS said it has received requests for a review, including one from a politician on behalf of the public. UUP MLA Doug Beattie said he had submitted that request to the PPS on Tuesday on behalf of his constituents ""who have been materially affected both financially and emotionally by the original decision not to prosecute"". Mr Storey, 64, was a senior republican figure and had formerly been the head of intelligence for the IRA in the 1990s. The attendance of many senior Sinn FÃ©in politicians at his funeral in west Belfast, at a time when strict limits on gatherings were in place, caused a political furore. The decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral led to First Minister Arlene Foster on Tuesday calling for theresignation of Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Simon Byrne. She said he had lost the confidence of the unionist community, but he has rejected calls to step down. Arlene Foster has called for Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign On Wednesday, the PPS said its review process will be carried out by a senior PPS lawyer who was not involved in taking the original decisions. ""This lawyer will be assisted by obtaining the advice of senior counsel who is independent of the PPS and was also not in any way involved in the original decisions,"" the body said. DUP MP Ian Paisley said he welcomed the review decision and that he had, on behalf of a constituent, instructed solicitors to commence a judicial review of the decision, but that has been paused until the review is completed. The Northern Ireland Assembly will be recalled on Thursday for a censure motion against Sinn FÃ©in for its members' attendance. Mrs Foster told Good Morning Ulster that it was ""folly"" to ignore unionists' concerns, and those of the wider community. ""If Simon Byrne believes that he can dig in and stay, then we will have to look at other ways to deal with these issues."" She added: ""It cannot continue as normal."" Mrs Foster said Mr Byrne had ""engaged in leading an organisation into a position where they have lost the confidence of the unionist community"". Party colleague Gordon Lyons said on Wednesday morning that it continues to be the party's position that Michelle O'Neill should also resign. The Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) and the TUV have also called on the chief constable to resign. They have questioned whether unionist representatives should remain on the policing board. Mr Byrne said he would not step down, and that such an action would undermine his predecessor. On Wednesday, Mr Byrne told the Nolan Show that police warned the organisers of Bobby Storey's funeral in advance that their plan would be a breach of Covid regulations. He also insisted that no deals were done with the organisers. ""Nobody in the PSNI did a deal or looked the other way,"" Mr Byrne said. It is understood that the Police Ombudsman is giving ""careful consideration"" to issues raised in correspondence to the office, believed to be from the DUP. This review should not be overstated - it is something that happens, if not on a routine basis, certainly on a regular basis. There is a well established internal process within the PPS whereby people who are unhappy with the original decisions can have an internal review of that decision. This isn't a new call for evidence. This is simply a fresh pair of eyes and a different mind casting their eye over the same evidence and seeing whether the original decision is one that they agree with. In my experience, it would be unusual for the original decision in these cases to be overturned. Mr Byrne said on Tuesday that enforcing the coronavirus regulations has been a ""consistently challenging and often uncomfortable role for my officers"", and that police did recommend prosecutions in the case. ""The decision not to prosecute does not change our view that what happened last summer when large numbers of people chose not to 'stay at home' at the height of a global pandemic was unnecessary, irresponsible and insensitive. It was wrong,"" he added. Meanwhile, a meeting of the Northern Ireland Policing Board will be held in private on Thursday, but the public element of the meeting has been cancelled. Mrs Foster said it was not possible to table a motion of no confidence in Mr Byrne, as 10 days notice is required. She stopped short of saying whether DUP members of the board would step down, but did not rule it out. How Bobby Storey funeral investigation unfolded Reaction to PPS' Storey funeral decision NI police chief's tenure marked by setbacks DUP MLA and board member Mervyn Storey said he would challenge the chief constable over the ""appalling"" actions of the police in relation to the funeral and seek to find out how decisions were reached. ""Any senior officer who approved of or contributed to the decision-making around this policing operation is also in an untenable position,"" he said. Ms O'Neill said in the wake of the PPS announcement on Tuesday that she wanted to once again apologise ""for the hurt that has been caused to so many, including to Bobby Storey's own family who have been thrust into the headlines at a time of immense grief"". On Wednesday, the party's North Belfast MP John Finucane, who also attended the funeral and was interviewed by the PSNI, said ""mistakes were made"" over the way the funeral was organised. He also apologised. A large number of mourners turned out for the funeral of Bobby Storey But he said there was confusion over the Covid restrictions in place at the time. ""Mistakes were made, and I think that's very clear, and there are those who will struggle to accept our apology for that and I totally understand that,"" Mr Finucane said. SDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said the recall of the assembly would provide a ""forum of accountability"". The South Belfast MLA said the motion, which does not have any binding consequences, was not ""political game play"" but was about holding Sinn FÃ©in ministers to account. Simon Byrne has made it clear that he's not for turning on this. There is a massive divide here - we know the anger that the DUP feels about this. Arlene Foster said she has written to the Police Ombudsman, she's also raised it with the secretary of state and has called for Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to get involved and carry out their own assessment. There are those today questioning why the DUP appear to be piling pressure on the chief constable rather than Sinn FÃ©in, although we know that the DUP position remains that Michelle O'Neill should have stepped down at the time. Clearly, Sinn FÃ©in isn't going to do that and the DUP feels it also has to direct its anger at others involved. All of this more widely reflects the view held within grassroots loyalism and unionism for some time now that they feel frustrated that the PSNI doesn't have their confidence in terms of how it has handled events over the last year. The motion calls for the assembly to place on record its regret that the Sinn FÃ©in representatives, who attended the funeral last June, breached political messaging and undermined efforts to prevent transmission of the virus. Health Minister Robin Swann has urged people to stick with the Covid restrictions in place. ""What I would say to the people of Northern Ireland is don't let the political distraction that has come out over this take away from the public health message,"" he said. Mr Swann said we are entering a challenging period over Easter, but we are facing a ""joint enemy"". UUP leader Steve Aiken said his party had ""real concerns"" about the PSNI's senior leadership, and would be referring the matter to the Police Ombudsman. He said attendance at the Storey funeral had undermined the health message, but added that people should continue to follow Covid regulations and not be ""distracted"" from that. Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said that the party continues to have confidence in Mr Byrne. Health Minister Robin Swann urged people to stick with the Covid restrictions in place ""What we are very conscious of is the primary responsibility for what happened lies with Sinn FÃ©in and it would be perverse if we end up in the situation where the agencies who had to handle the situation are being held to account rather than those who were primarily responsible for what unfolded last June."" TUV leader Jim Allister has backed calls for Mr Byrne to resign, and said the decision not to prosecute had ""trashed"" Covid regulations. He added that the recall motion would keep a ""spotlight on those who were the lawbreakers and got away with it and those at the same time who were the lawmakers"".

"Wales' pubs could reopen indoors in MayTwo households could also be able to meet indoors, and gyms and leisure centres could open.","Pubs and restaurant owners had been keen to know when they could reopen Pubs, restaurants and hotels in Wales may reopen indoors in time for the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. First Minister Mark Drakeford has set out a series of dates for easing lockdown, stretching into the next month. Under the plans two households could meet indoors from 10 May, if Covid cases remained low. Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK andCommon Travel Area,externalmay go ahead from 12 April. Restaurants and bars could reopen outdoors from 26 April and from 3 May, outdoor wedding receptions with up to 30 people may be permitted. But the changes could depend on the results ofthe Senedd election on 6 May, and whether the Welsh Labour leader is returned to power. The Welsh Conservatives' own plans would seemost rules on social contact scrapped by 17 May. Both the Tories and Plaid Cymru called forgyms to reopen now, while Plaid said the Senedd should be recalled to discuss more economic help for businesses. Under the Welsh plans gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities will also be able to reopen from 10 May. This will include individual or one-to-one training, but not exercise classes. Spring Bank Holiday Monday is 31 May, but the Welsh government has not specified an actual date for reopening hospitality indoors. It said after 17 May it would ""consider enabling indoor hospitality and remaining visitor accommodation to reopen in advance of the Spring Bank Holiday"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Delay to reopening gyms in Wales 'irresponsible' Cultural and sport events may welcome crowds back Only six people from two households will be able to meet in reopened beer gardens and should still socially distance. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the public emergency is not over. He toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""You see in the pattern a continuation of the step-by-step approach we've taken in Wales, doing the outdoor activities first because it's safer to be outdoors. ""But for the first time in the timetable we are now able to set out the first re-openings of indoor activities as well."" He added: ""The presence of the virus in Wales is the lowest in the United Kingdom, the rate of vaccination in Wales is the highest in the United Kingdom. ""On Saturday, we will complete the vaccination offerto everybody in the top nine priority groups, again the first country in the UK to get to that milestone."" Provided cases remain low, the following things will be permitted: Monday, 12 April Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK and Common Travel Area, dependant on restrictions where you are intending to travel to All non-essential retail and close contact services, like beauty salons, allowed to reopen Monday, 26 April Outdoor hospitality, including cafes, pubs and restaurants Outdoor attractions, including funfairs and theme parks End of 22:00 BST alcohol sale limit in shops Monday, 3 May Organised outdoor activities for up to 30 people Outdoor wedding receptions attended by no more than 30 people Monday, 10 May People will be allowed to form extended households again, allowing two households to meet and have contact indoors Gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities can reopen. Individual and one-to-one training will be allowed, but not exercise classes Monday, 17 May Children's indoor activities Community centres Organised indoor activities for adults, limited to a maximum of 15 people. This includes exercise classes Beyond that date, ministers would consider reopening indoor pubs and restaurants, and remaining visitor accommodation ahead of the Spring Bank Holiday. Lucy Hywel says throwing away stock has been painful Tracy Lawler, who owns The Dressing Room Boutique in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, said she cannot wait to reopen on 12 April. She said because her shop is ""is small and intimate I can keep it really ultra clean after each person has entered"". ""I'm probably one of the safest public places for people to come in and the government is saying to me that I can't open up [yet]â¦ very frustrating."" Lucy Hywel, who owns That's Lovely That giftshop in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, was also looking forward to reopening, but said: ""We're hurt and we're still hurting. ""I myself have thrown out loads of food, thousands of pounds worth of stock, even last week, stock I thought I may have sold in the lead up to Easter got chucked away and that pain is there every time you do something like that."" Victoria Hallimi says the past few months have been really tough Victoria Hallimi, who owns Victoria's Driving School in Swansea, gave her last lesson on 13 December but can now reopen on 12 April. She said: ""My phone was going a bit crazy last night as soon as the announcement was made. ""I was up until about 11, 11:30 last night scheduling everybody in."" She said the past few months had been ""really tough"" and her husband had been doing a lot of overtime to make up for her not being able to work. ""He can relax now,"" she added. Kelly John has not paid herself a wage since January Kelly John, owner of KMW Beauty in Maesteg, Bridgend county, said she has not paid herself a wage since January to ensure she had enough money in her business account to buy supplies when she was allowed to reopen. ""Luckily my husband is working, otherwise I wouldn't have a house,"" the mother-of-two said. ""But being an independent woman, it is really hard. I can't do anything - it's Easter this weekend and I haven't bought anything."" Meanwhile, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective, which represents more than 400 Welsh hospitality firms, said it welcomed the move but ""continues to press for certainty and support"" about funding to support them while they remain closed. The plans will move Wales into the ""alert level three,external"" stage of the government's control plan by 17 May. While parts of Wales' lockdown have eased quicker than elsewhere in the UK, the Welsh government had been reluctant to set out a full schedule for when different sectors would reopen. Friday's announcement is the most detailed list of dates given by the government since the winter lockdown began to be eased. It does not go as far as England's tentative plans to scrap social contact restrictions by 21 June, although Mark Drakeford has previously said that's""very optimistic"". Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new ""indicative dates"" were are there ""to help businesses plan and prepare"". ""We have to remember that the pandemic isn't over - it's more important than ever that we continue to work together to keep this terrible virus under control so that we can go on unlocking Wales."" What can I do now... and what comes next? Some sectors like cinemas and theatres have not been given a date to reopen in Wales. Following criticism of his plans for gyms and leisure centres, Mr Drakeford said the sector will be the first able to reopen indoors. Pubs will be able to open outdoors two weeks after England. The first minister said he had considered bringing that forward, but ""the advice was very clear that that was not advisable on public health grounds"". First Minister Mark Drakeford has criticised Boris Johnson's roadmap out of lockdown in England as being optimistic The Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Mr Drakeford's roadmap was ""very late in the day"". He said it was ""unfortunate"" that further funding had not been made available to hospitality sector - and said outdoor hospitality should be opening in line with England on 12 April. Mr Davies told Wales Today: ""What's really dumbfounding is that despite his mental health minister's assurances that gyms will be one of the first facilities to open, they are now not going to open until May."" Plaid Cymru Leader Adam Price said he would go faster on reopening gyms and indoor hospitality. ""We've also been calling for a much more accelerated timetable in terms of reopening gyms, because of their importance in terms of mental and physical well being. So I think it's disappointing to see that being delayed. ""There are dangers of course in moving too fast but there's an equal danger of being over cautious"". Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds said: ""Now that more and more of Wales is opening up and life is slowly returning to normal, it's time to put our recovery first. ""I want to see support for those individuals who will lose their jobs when furlough ends, those who are likely to lose their homes when the ban on evictions is lifted and those whose mental health has suffered as a result of this pandemic."" A UKIP spokesman said: ""With the success of the vaccine rollout, lockdowns no longer have any major impact on case numbers. ""The Welsh economy must be reopened now. Not in a month's time. This apathetic timeline will be the final nail in the coffin for many businesses that have been just about clinging on."" What are the stats in my area? The road out of the Welsh lockdown - key data to watch for The announcement comes as latest figures show admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 caseshit a record low- it stands at a daily seven-day average of 19. Covid hospital admissions are the lowest since the pandemic began with 17 confirmed and suspected Covid patients on Wednesday, with none at all in Swansea Bay hospitals.

Bet365 boss earns Â£469m in a single year,"The usually low-profile Denise Coates was appointed CBE for services to the community and business in 2012 The boss of the gambling firm Bet365 has been awarded one of the biggest pay packets in UK corporate history. The highest paid director of Bet365 Group - believed to be founder and majority shareholder Denise Coates CBE - earned a salary of Â£421m in the year ending 29 March. She also earned Â£48m in dividends, taking her total pay to Â£469m. The company said the arrangements were ""appropriate and fair"", despite sales falling at the firm last year. But campaign group the High Pay Centre said it was ""appallingly inefficient for single individuals to hoard wealth in this way"". Ms Coates, who founded the Bet365 website 20 years ago in Stoke-on-Trent, has been the UK's highest paid boss for several years. How Bet365's Denise Coates hit her own jackpot She is also one of Britain's wealthiest women and a major philanthropist, donating millions through the Denise Coates Foundation. Her salary in the year to March was more than 50% higher than the Â£277m received in 2019 and meant she earned almost Â£1.2m every day last year. That was more than the bosses of every FTSE 100 company combined, according to the High Pay Centre. It came as sales at Bet365 fell 8% to Â£2.8bn as international sporting events were cancelled due to the pandemic. Profits slumped 74% to Â£194.7m. However, the company said it had not cut staff pay or laid off employees as a result of the crisis. It also did not make use of the furlough scheme. The company also paid Â£85m to Ms Coates's charitable foundation. Ms Coates and her brother John took over the gambling business 20 years ago, which was run by their father. Ms Coates now owns about half of the company. She has previously been described as one of the UK's ""most successful women"". Ms Coates achieved a first-class degree in econometrics and later trained as an accountant within the family firm, building further on the knowledge of the then small chain that she picked up while working part-time during high school. The chief executive's annual pay packet is likely to be the biggest in UK history. Earlier this month, hedge fund tycoon Sir Chris Hohn staked a claim to that title after paying himself Â£343m last year.

Campaigners criticise government race report,"A government-commissioned report which found that the UK ""no longer"" had a system rigged against minorities has been accused of ignoring black and ethnic minority people's concerns. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on how people's lives turned out. Campaigners said it laid the blame for inequality on individuals and families. And Labour has accused the government of downplaying institutional racism. The commission was set up after Black Lives Matter (BLM) anti-racism protests across the country last summer - triggered by the killing of George Floyd in the US. But its report has been was met with criticism from campaigners. Jabeer Butt, chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, said: ""The report seems to go out of its way to deny that there's anything that's been the result of policies we've put in place and instead puts the blame at individuals' decisions or at family's doors."" The GMB's national officer Rehana Azam said it ""feels like a deeply cynical report"", calling it ""completely irresponsible and immoral"" and accusing it of ignoring black and ethnic minority workers' concerns. Boris Johnson said the government would consider the implications of the report's recommendations for future policy and remained ""fully committed to building a fairer Britain"". Race report risks deepening distrust and division Key points: What does the race report say? 'You can't tell victims what racism is' Thecommission's 258-page report concluded,externalthat the UK is not yet a ""post-racial country"" - but its success in removing race-based disparity in education and, to a lesser extent, the economy, ""should be regarded as a model for other white-majority countries"". In his foreword to the report chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, said while the ""impediments and disparities do exist"", it continued, they were ""varied and ironically very few of them are directly to do with racism"". Black Lives Matter UKtweeted,externalthat it was ""disappointed"" that the report overlooked disproportionality in the criminal justice system. Black people in England and Wales are nine times more likely to be imprisoned than their white peers, it said. The report thanked the ""mainly young people"" behind the BLM movement for putting the focus on race but said progress could not be achieved by ""cleaving to a fatalistic account that insists nothing has changed"". Among the main findings of the report were: Children from minority ethnic communities did as well or better than white pupils in compulsory education, with black Caribbean pupils the only group to perform less well This success in education has ""transformed British society over the last 50 years into one offering far greater opportunities for all"" The pay gap between all ethnic minorities and the white majority population had shrunk to 2.3% overall and was barely significant for employees under 30 Diversity has increased in professions such as law and medicine But some communities continue to be ""haunted"" by historic racism, which is creating ""deep mistrust"" and could be a barrier to success Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova labelled the report a ""divisive polemic"" that downplayed institutional racism. Her colleague David Lammy, who led areview on racial bias in the justice system, tweeted that Britain's black community was being ""gaslighted"" and said he was ""tired of the endless debate about whether structural racism exists with little desire to actually address it"". Institutional racism was defined in the Macpherson report,commissioned after Stephen Lawrence's murder, as ""the collective failure of an organisation to provide the appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin"". Commission member Samir Shah, chief executive of a TV production company, said the commission did not believe there was no institutional racism in Britain but said the term had become ""divisive"". Racism was only one of the factors which caused disparities between ethnic groups, he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""People do have choices, they do have agency, it's not always that they're just victims of some miasmic racism that's in the air,"" he said. When setting up the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities during the Black Lives Matter protests last summer, Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""change the narrative, so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination"". But reaching a settled view on the question of racism in the UK was always going to be a struggle. Critics were concerned by the prime minister's assertion that he wanted ""to look very carefully at the real racism and discrimination that people face"". There was further unease among anti-racism groups at the reported involvement of Number 10 policy advisor Munira Mirza, because she had previously written of how institutional racism was ""a perception more than a reality"". The appointment of Tony Sewell to lead the inquiry once again disappointed anti-racism activists. One London-based organisation, Monitoring Group, considered seeking a judicial review to prevent his selection on the grounds that he had ""a longstanding record of public statements rejecting or minimising"" the impact of institutional racism in Britain. The accusation that this report is the result of a hand-picked committee, designed to say what ministers wanted to hear, will have some traction, whatever the commission and the government insist about its independence. Read more from Markhere. The commission said unemployment differences between ethnic groups had declined and the pay gap between ethnic minority workers and white workers was also falling and at its lowest level for almost a decade. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said ""institutional and structural racism exists in the UK, in both the labour market and wider society"", and said black and minority ethnic workers were far more likely ""to be in low-paid, insecure jobs"" compared to white workers. Prof Kehinde Andrews, a professor of black studies at Birmingham City University told BBC news the report was ""not a genuine attempt to understand racism in Britain"" or ""make a substantive change"". He said the fact there was a discussion over whether institutional racism existed was the problem, ""because it does exist, it clearly exists and the question should be 'how do we address this'"". Liberal Democrat equalities spokeswoman Wera Hobhouse said the report must not be used as an excuse to continue ""shameful inaction"" on issues of racial injustice. She called for an end to ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and the ""disproportionate"" use of police stop and search tactics. The commission found not enough information was given to the public about why police used stop and search, saying the focus was on drugs rather than knife offences. This video can not be played Institutional racism has become a 'catch-all phrase', Tony Sewell says In its recommendations, the commission also called for the term BAME, which stands for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic, to be dropped, calling it ""unhelpful"" and ""imprecise and often misleading"". Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a member of the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, said the report was not denying institutional racism existed but said the commission had not discovered evidence of it in the areas it had looked. Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said she ""warmly welcomed"" the report and was impressed by the analysis within the report, but added she was ""looking forward to understanding fully"" the issues that had been raised and ""what can be done"" to address them. The black British history you may not know about Six reports in four years but what action has been taken? Chancellor Rishi Sunak said progress had been made to tackle racism. ""That's not to say there aren't instances of racism that of course exist in this country,"" he told ITV. ""But if I think about the things that happened to me when I was a kid, I can't imagine those things happening to me now."" The report's 24 recommendations included: Extended school days to be phased in, starting with disadvantaged areas, to help pupils catch up on missed learning during the pandemic Children from disadvantaged backgrounds should have access to better quality careers advice in schools, funded by university outreach programmes More research is needed to examine why pupils perform well in certain communities, so this can be replicated to help all children succeed Organisations should stop funding unconscious bias training, with government and experts developing resources to help advance workplace equality SLEEP AND COVID:How do stressful situations affect our dreams?

Illegal gatherings warning after officers hurt,"This video can not be played Litter left after people enjoyed the sunshine in Wales just days after travel restrictions were eased Three police officers were injured when missiles were thrown and crowds dispersed at Cardiff Bay. South Wales Police said two people were arrested on suspicion of public order offences on Tuesday night and since released on bail. A second day of good weather in Wales has prompted police representatives to warn against illegal gatherings. On Tuesday as temperatures topped 21C, tourist spots saw aninflux of visitors. South Wales Police said officers intervened in an ""incident of violent disorder"" in Cardiff Bay at about 22:00 BST on Tuesday. It said a number of missiles, including bottles, were thrown at officers, three of whom suffered minor injuries. A 21-year-old man and 16-year-old boy were arrested and a knife was found. Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan Ch Insp Tony Williams said: ""The violence levelled at officers was despicable and will not be tolerated, nor will we tolerate the antisocial behaviour and criminality displayed by the minority on Tuesday evening."" He said increased patrols would be carried out in key areas. He appealed for people to ""take a sensible approach and to continue supporting the restrictions that do remain in place, in order to keep us all safe"".

Cardiff council said it had taken three hours to clean up the ""unacceptable amount of litter"" in Cardiff Bay and parks. A spokesman added: ""We would ask visitors enjoying these areas to dispose of their waste responsibly and, if a bin is full, take it to an empty one or take it home with them. ""Current Covid-19 restrictions allow up to six people from two households to meet outdoors while socially distanced and we would urge visitors to Cardiff Bay and to our parks and green spaces to follow these rules and help keep Cardiff safe.""

Some of the alcohol which was seized in Burry Port In Carmarthenshire, groups of up to 100 teenagers have been moved on and large amounts of alcohol seized after police responded to reports of anti-social behaviour near the coastal path in Burry Port.

Frustration over hundreds of vaccine no-shows Dyfed-Powys Police Sgt Gemma Davies said: ""We would like to appeal directly to parents to be aware of where their children are, and what they are doing. ""This behaviour is distressing for people living in Burry Port and we are urging you to be accountable for your children's actions.

""For the end of March, we have collected 175 bags of litter, which might not sound like a lot, but actually, it is,"" he said.

Wales' pubs set for outdoor reopening on 26 April,"Pubs and restaurant owners had been keen to know when they could reopen Pubs, restaurants and hotels in Wales may reopen indoors in time for the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. First Minister Mark Drakeford has set out a series of dates for easing lockdown, stretching into the next month. Under the plans two households could meet indoors from 10 May, if Covid cases remained low. Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK andCommon Travel Area,externalmay go ahead from 12 April. Restaurants and bars could reopen outdoors from 26 April and from 3 May, outdoor wedding receptions with up to 30 people may be permitted. But the changes could depend on the results ofthe Senedd election on 6 May, and whether the Welsh Labour leader is returned to power. The Welsh Conservatives' own plans would seemost rules on social contact scrapped by 17 May. Both the Tories and Plaid Cymru called forgyms to reopen now, while Plaid said the Senedd should be recalled to discuss more economic help for businesses. Under the Welsh plans gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities will also be able to reopen from 10 May. This will include individual or one-to-one training, but not exercise classes. Spring Bank Holiday Monday is 31 May, but the Welsh government has not specified an actual date for reopening hospitality indoors. It said after 17 May it would ""consider enabling indoor hospitality and remaining visitor accommodation to reopen in advance of the Spring Bank Holiday"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Delay to reopening gyms in Wales 'irresponsible' Cultural and sport events may welcome crowds back Only six people from two households will be able to meet in reopened beer gardens and should still socially distance. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the public emergency is not over. He toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""You see in the pattern a continuation of the step-by-step approach we've taken in Wales, doing the outdoor activities first because it's safer to be outdoors. ""But for the first time in the timetable we are now able to set out the first re-openings of indoor activities as well."" He added: ""The presence of the virus in Wales is the lowest in the United Kingdom, the rate of vaccination in Wales is the highest in the United Kingdom. ""On Saturday, we will complete the vaccination offerto everybody in the top nine priority groups, again the first country in the UK to get to that milestone."" Provided cases remain low, the following things will be permitted: Monday, 12 April Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK and Common Travel Area, dependant on restrictions where you are intending to travel to All non-essential retail and close contact services, like beauty salons, allowed to reopen Monday, 26 April Outdoor hospitality, including cafes, pubs and restaurants Outdoor attractions, including funfairs and theme parks End of 22:00 BST alcohol sale limit in shops Monday, 3 May Organised outdoor activities for up to 30 people Outdoor wedding receptions attended by no more than 30 people Monday, 10 May People will be allowed to form extended households again, allowing two households to meet and have contact indoors Gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities can reopen. Individual and one-to-one training will be allowed, but not exercise classes Monday, 17 May Children's indoor activities Community centres Organised indoor activities for adults, limited to a maximum of 15 people. This includes exercise classes Beyond that date, ministers would consider reopening indoor pubs and restaurants, and remaining visitor accommodation ahead of the Spring Bank Holiday. Lucy Hywel says throwing away stock has been painful Tracy Lawler, who owns The Dressing Room Boutique in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, said she cannot wait to reopen on 12 April. She said because her shop is ""is small and intimate I can keep it really ultra clean after each person has entered"". ""I'm probably one of the safest public places for people to come in and the government is saying to me that I can't open up [yet]â¦ very frustrating."" Lucy Hywel, who owns That's Lovely That giftshop in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, was also looking forward to reopening, but said: ""We're hurt and we're still hurting. ""I myself have thrown out loads of food, thousands of pounds worth of stock, even last week, stock I thought I may have sold in the lead up to Easter got chucked away and that pain is there every time you do something like that."" Victoria Hallimi says the past few months have been really tough Victoria Hallimi, who owns Victoria's Driving School in Swansea, gave her last lesson on 13 December but can now reopen on 12 April. She said: ""My phone was going a bit crazy last night as soon as the announcement was made. ""I was up until about 11, 11:30 last night scheduling everybody in."" She said the past few months had been ""really tough"" and her husband had been doing a lot of overtime to make up for her not being able to work. ""He can relax now,"" she added. Kelly John has not paid herself a wage since January Kelly John, owner of KMW Beauty in Maesteg, Bridgend county, said she has not paid herself a wage since January to ensure she had enough money in her business account to buy supplies when she was allowed to reopen. ""Luckily my husband is working, otherwise I wouldn't have a house,"" the mother-of-two said. ""But being an independent woman, it is really hard. I can't do anything - it's Easter this weekend and I haven't bought anything."" Meanwhile, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective, which represents more than 400 Welsh hospitality firms, said it welcomed the move but ""continues to press for certainty and support"" about funding to support them while they remain closed. The plans will move Wales into the ""alert level three,external"" stage of the government's control plan by 17 May. While parts of Wales' lockdown have eased quicker than elsewhere in the UK, the Welsh government had been reluctant to set out a full schedule for when different sectors would reopen. Friday's announcement is the most detailed list of dates given by the government since the winter lockdown began to be eased. It does not go as far as England's tentative plans to scrap social contact restrictions by 21 June, although Mark Drakeford has previously said that's""very optimistic"". Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new ""indicative dates"" were are there ""to help businesses plan and prepare"". ""We have to remember that the pandemic isn't over - it's more important than ever that we continue to work together to keep this terrible virus under control so that we can go on unlocking Wales."" What can I do now... and what comes next? Some sectors like cinemas and theatres have not been given a date to reopen in Wales. Following criticism of his plans for gyms and leisure centres, Mr Drakeford said the sector will be the first able to reopen indoors. Pubs will be able to open outdoors two weeks after England. The first minister said he had considered bringing that forward, but ""the advice was very clear that that was not advisable on public health grounds"". First Minister Mark Drakeford has criticised Boris Johnson's roadmap out of lockdown in England as being optimistic The Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Mr Drakeford's roadmap was ""very late in the day"". He said it was ""unfortunate"" that further funding had not been made available to hospitality sector - and said outdoor hospitality should be opening in line with England on 12 April. Mr Davies told Wales Today: ""What's really dumbfounding is that despite his mental health minister's assurances that gyms will be one of the first facilities to open, they are now not going to open until May."" Plaid Cymru Leader Adam Price said he would go faster on reopening gyms and indoor hospitality. ""We've also been calling for a much more accelerated timetable in terms of reopening gyms, because of their importance in terms of mental and physical well being. So I think it's disappointing to see that being delayed. ""There are dangers of course in moving too fast but there's an equal danger of being over cautious"". Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds said: ""Now that more and more of Wales is opening up and life is slowly returning to normal, it's time to put our recovery first. ""I want to see support for those individuals who will lose their jobs when furlough ends, those who are likely to lose their homes when the ban on evictions is lifted and those whose mental health has suffered as a result of this pandemic."" A UKIP spokesman said: ""With the success of the vaccine rollout, lockdowns no longer have any major impact on case numbers. ""The Welsh economy must be reopened now. Not in a month's time. This apathetic timeline will be the final nail in the coffin for many businesses that have been just about clinging on."" What are the stats in my area? The road out of the Welsh lockdown - key data to watch for The announcement comes as latest figures show admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 caseshit a record low- it stands at a daily seven-day average of 19. Covid hospital admissions are the lowest since the pandemic began with 17 confirmed and suspected Covid patients on Wednesday, with none at all in Swansea Bay hospitals.

"Campaigners criticise government race reportThe government-commissioned report finds UK system is ""no longer"" rigged against ethnic minorities.","A government-commissioned report which found that the UK ""no longer"" had a system rigged against minorities has been accused of ignoring black and ethnic minority people's concerns. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on how people's lives turned out. Campaigners said it laid the blame for inequality on individuals and families. And Labour has accused the government of downplaying institutional racism. The commission was set up after Black Lives Matter (BLM) anti-racism protests across the country last summer - triggered by the killing of George Floyd in the US. But its report has been was met with criticism from campaigners. Jabeer Butt, chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, said: ""The report seems to go out of its way to deny that there's anything that's been the result of policies we've put in place and instead puts the blame at individuals' decisions or at family's doors."" The GMB's national officer Rehana Azam said it ""feels like a deeply cynical report"", calling it ""completely irresponsible and immoral"" and accusing it of ignoring black and ethnic minority workers' concerns. Boris Johnson said the government would consider the implications of the report's recommendations for future policy and remained ""fully committed to building a fairer Britain"". Race report risks deepening distrust and division Key points: What does the race report say? 'You can't tell victims what racism is' Thecommission's 258-page report concluded,externalthat the UK is not yet a ""post-racial country"" - but its success in removing race-based disparity in education and, to a lesser extent, the economy, ""should be regarded as a model for other white-majority countries"". In his foreword to the report chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, said while the ""impediments and disparities do exist"", it continued, they were ""varied and ironically very few of them are directly to do with racism"". Black Lives Matter UKtweeted,externalthat it was ""disappointed"" that the report overlooked disproportionality in the criminal justice system. Black people in England and Wales are nine times more likely to be imprisoned than their white peers, it said. The report thanked the ""mainly young people"" behind the BLM movement for putting the focus on race but said progress could not be achieved by ""cleaving to a fatalistic account that insists nothing has changed"". Among the main findings of the report were: Children from minority ethnic communities did as well or better than white pupils in compulsory education, with black Caribbean pupils the only group to perform less well This success in education has ""transformed British society over the last 50 years into one offering far greater opportunities for all"" The pay gap between all ethnic minorities and the white majority population had shrunk to 2.3% overall and was barely significant for employees under 30 Diversity has increased in professions such as law and medicine But some communities continue to be ""haunted"" by historic racism, which is creating ""deep mistrust"" and could be a barrier to success Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova labelled the report a ""divisive polemic"" that downplayed institutional racism. Her colleague David Lammy, who led areview on racial bias in the justice system, tweeted that Britain's black community was being ""gaslighted"" and said he was ""tired of the endless debate about whether structural racism exists with little desire to actually address it"". Institutional racism was defined in the Macpherson report,commissioned after Stephen Lawrence's murder, as ""the collective failure of an organisation to provide the appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin"". Commission member Samir Shah, chief executive of a TV production company, said the commission did not believe there was no institutional racism in Britain but said the term had become ""divisive"". Racism was only one of the factors which caused disparities between ethnic groups, he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""People do have choices, they do have agency, it's not always that they're just victims of some miasmic racism that's in the air,"" he said. When setting up the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities during the Black Lives Matter protests last summer, Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""change the narrative, so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination"". But reaching a settled view on the question of racism in the UK was always going to be a struggle. Critics were concerned by the prime minister's assertion that he wanted ""to look very carefully at the real racism and discrimination that people face"". There was further unease among anti-racism groups at the reported involvement of Number 10 policy advisor Munira Mirza, because she had previously written of how institutional racism was ""a perception more than a reality"". The appointment of Tony Sewell to lead the inquiry once again disappointed anti-racism activists. One London-based organisation, Monitoring Group, considered seeking a judicial review to prevent his selection on the grounds that he had ""a longstanding record of public statements rejecting or minimising"" the impact of institutional racism in Britain. The accusation that this report is the result of a hand-picked committee, designed to say what ministers wanted to hear, will have some traction, whatever the commission and the government insist about its independence. Read more from Markhere. The commission said unemployment differences between ethnic groups had declined and the pay gap between ethnic minority workers and white workers was also falling and at its lowest level for almost a decade. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said ""institutional and structural racism exists in the UK, in both the labour market and wider society"", and said black and minority ethnic workers were far more likely ""to be in low-paid, insecure jobs"" compared to white workers. Prof Kehinde Andrews, a professor of black studies at Birmingham City University told BBC news the report was ""not a genuine attempt to understand racism in Britain"" or ""make a substantive change"". He said the fact there was a discussion over whether institutional racism existed was the problem, ""because it does exist, it clearly exists and the question should be 'how do we address this'"". Liberal Democrat equalities spokeswoman Wera Hobhouse said the report must not be used as an excuse to continue ""shameful inaction"" on issues of racial injustice. She called for an end to ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and the ""disproportionate"" use of police stop and search tactics. The commission found not enough information was given to the public about why police used stop and search, saying the focus was on drugs rather than knife offences. This video can not be played Institutional racism has become a 'catch-all phrase', Tony Sewell says In its recommendations, the commission also called for the term BAME, which stands for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic, to be dropped, calling it ""unhelpful"" and ""imprecise and often misleading"". Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a member of the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, said the report was not denying institutional racism existed but said the commission had not discovered evidence of it in the areas it had looked. Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said she ""warmly welcomed"" the report and was impressed by the analysis within the report, but added she was ""looking forward to understanding fully"" the issues that had been raised and ""what can be done"" to address them. The black British history you may not know about Six reports in four years but what action has been taken? Chancellor Rishi Sunak said progress had been made to tackle racism. ""That's not to say there aren't instances of racism that of course exist in this country,"" he told ITV. ""But if I think about the things that happened to me when I was a kid, I can't imagine those things happening to me now."" The report's 24 recommendations included: Extended school days to be phased in, starting with disadvantaged areas, to help pupils catch up on missed learning during the pandemic Children from disadvantaged backgrounds should have access to better quality careers advice in schools, funded by university outreach programmes More research is needed to examine why pupils perform well in certain communities, so this can be replicated to help all children succeed Organisations should stop funding unconscious bias training, with government and experts developing resources to help advance workplace equality SLEEP AND COVID:How do stressful situations affect our dreams?

Schools abuse helpline and safeguarding review launchedThey have been set up by the government in response to thousands of allegations from students.Family & Education,"Website Everyone's Invited has published thousands of testimonies (stock image) A helpline and immediate review into sexual abuse in schools have been set up by the government in response to thousands of allegations from students. Ofsted will look at safeguarding in both state and independent schools. The helpline will be run by the NSPCC to both support potential victims and provide advice to children and adults. ""Sexual abuse in any form is abhorrent and it is vital that these allegations are dealt with properly,"" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said. ""While the majority of schools take their safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously, I am determined to make sure the right resources and processes are in place across the education system to support any victims of abuse to come forward."" The debate about a culture of sexual abuse at schools has escalated in recent weeks after a website set up for victims to anonymously post their experiences gained more than 11,000 posts, some from children as young as nine. Many of the allegations on the website refer to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university. Wendy Mair, from the Everyone's Invited site, said they were ""proud to have started a crucial conversation"", but disappointed the education secretary had not contacted them before the announcement. ""We are encouraged to see that the government has responded and taken the first initial steps to review rape culture in all schools,"" she said, adding that she hoped the site's team will be included in carrying out the review.

She said she feels incredibly let down by what she saw as her school's ""lack of response"" to the recent discussions around women's safety. ""It's really been left to students to care for each other, often leading to major tensions within peer groups as people attempt to 'confront' certain students known for sexually inappropriate behaviour,"" she said. In June 2020, Soma Sara, who is now 22, shared her experience on Instagram of what she calls ""rape culture"". Within a week she had received and shared more than 300 anonymous responses of people with stories of ""misogyny, harassment, abuse and assault"".

PPS announces review of Storey funeral decision,"Sinn FÃ©in's leader and deputy leader attended the funeral last June, along with former leader Gerry Adams (centre) The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) has announced a review of its decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey. The funeral last June attracted 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. The actions of 24 Sinn FÃ©in politicians were examined, including Ms O'Neill. Separately, Health Minister Robin Swann urged people to stick with restrictions and not be distracted by politics. The PPS said it has received requests for a review, including one from a politician on behalf of the public. UUP MLA Doug Beattie said he had submitted that request to the PPS on Tuesday on behalf of his constituents ""who have been materially affected both financially and emotionally by the original decision not to prosecute"". Mr Storey, 64, was a senior republican figure and had formerly been the head of intelligence for the IRA in the 1990s. The attendance of many senior Sinn FÃ©in politicians at his funeral in west Belfast, at a time when strict limits on gatherings were in place, caused a political furore. The decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral led to First Minister Arlene Foster on Tuesday calling for theresignation of Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Simon Byrne. She said he had lost the confidence of the unionist community, but he has rejected calls to step down. Arlene Foster has called for Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign On Wednesday, the PPS said its review process will be carried out by a senior PPS lawyer who was not involved in taking the original decisions. ""This lawyer will be assisted by obtaining the advice of senior counsel who is independent of the PPS and was also not in any way involved in the original decisions,"" the body said. DUP MP Ian Paisley said he welcomed the review decision and that he had, on behalf of a constituent, instructed solicitors to commence a judicial review of the decision, but that has been paused until the review is completed. The Northern Ireland Assembly will be recalled on Thursday for a censure motion against Sinn FÃ©in for its members' attendance. Mrs Foster told Good Morning Ulster that it was ""folly"" to ignore unionists' concerns, and those of the wider community. ""If Simon Byrne believes that he can dig in and stay, then we will have to look at other ways to deal with these issues."" She added: ""It cannot continue as normal."" Mrs Foster said Mr Byrne had ""engaged in leading an organisation into a position where they have lost the confidence of the unionist community"". Party colleague Gordon Lyons said on Wednesday morning that it continues to be the party's position that Michelle O'Neill should also resign. The Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) and the TUV have also called on the chief constable to resign. They have questioned whether unionist representatives should remain on the policing board. Mr Byrne said he would not step down, and that such an action would undermine his predecessor. On Wednesday, Mr Byrne told the Nolan Show that police warned the organisers of Bobby Storey's funeral in advance that their plan would be a breach of Covid regulations. He also insisted that no deals were done with the organisers. ""Nobody in the PSNI did a deal or looked the other way,"" Mr Byrne said. It is understood that the Police Ombudsman is giving ""careful consideration"" to issues raised in correspondence to the office, believed to be from the DUP. This review should not be overstated - it is something that happens, if not on a routine basis, certainly on a regular basis. There is a well established internal process within the PPS whereby people who are unhappy with the original decisions can have an internal review of that decision. This isn't a new call for evidence. This is simply a fresh pair of eyes and a different mind casting their eye over the same evidence and seeing whether the original decision is one that they agree with. In my experience, it would be unusual for the original decision in these cases to be overturned. Mr Byrne said on Tuesday that enforcing the coronavirus regulations has been a ""consistently challenging and often uncomfortable role for my officers"", and that police did recommend prosecutions in the case. ""The decision not to prosecute does not change our view that what happened last summer when large numbers of people chose not to 'stay at home' at the height of a global pandemic was unnecessary, irresponsible and insensitive. It was wrong,"" he added. Meanwhile, a meeting of the Northern Ireland Policing Board will be held in private on Thursday, but the public element of the meeting has been cancelled. Mrs Foster said it was not possible to table a motion of no confidence in Mr Byrne, as 10 days notice is required. She stopped short of saying whether DUP members of the board would step down, but did not rule it out. How Bobby Storey funeral investigation unfolded Reaction to PPS' Storey funeral decision NI police chief's tenure marked by setbacks DUP MLA and board member Mervyn Storey said he would challenge the chief constable over the ""appalling"" actions of the police in relation to the funeral and seek to find out how decisions were reached. ""Any senior officer who approved of or contributed to the decision-making around this policing operation is also in an untenable position,"" he said. Ms O'Neill said in the wake of the PPS announcement on Tuesday that she wanted to once again apologise ""for the hurt that has been caused to so many, including to Bobby Storey's own family who have been thrust into the headlines at a time of immense grief"". On Wednesday, the party's North Belfast MP John Finucane, who also attended the funeral and was interviewed by the PSNI, said ""mistakes were made"" over the way the funeral was organised. He also apologised. A large number of mourners turned out for the funeral of Bobby Storey But he said there was confusion over the Covid restrictions in place at the time. ""Mistakes were made, and I think that's very clear, and there are those who will struggle to accept our apology for that and I totally understand that,"" Mr Finucane said. SDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said the recall of the assembly would provide a ""forum of accountability"". The South Belfast MLA said the motion, which does not have any binding consequences, was not ""political game play"" but was about holding Sinn FÃ©in ministers to account. Simon Byrne has made it clear that he's not for turning on this. There is a massive divide here - we know the anger that the DUP feels about this. Arlene Foster said she has written to the Police Ombudsman, she's also raised it with the secretary of state and has called for Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to get involved and carry out their own assessment. There are those today questioning why the DUP appear to be piling pressure on the chief constable rather than Sinn FÃ©in, although we know that the DUP position remains that Michelle O'Neill should have stepped down at the time. Clearly, Sinn FÃ©in isn't going to do that and the DUP feels it also has to direct its anger at others involved. All of this more widely reflects the view held within grassroots loyalism and unionism for some time now that they feel frustrated that the PSNI doesn't have their confidence in terms of how it has handled events over the last year. The motion calls for the assembly to place on record its regret that the Sinn FÃ©in representatives, who attended the funeral last June, breached political messaging and undermined efforts to prevent transmission of the virus. Health Minister Robin Swann has urged people to stick with the Covid restrictions in place. ""What I would say to the people of Northern Ireland is don't let the political distraction that has come out over this take away from the public health message,"" he said. Mr Swann said we are entering a challenging period over Easter, but we are facing a ""joint enemy"". UUP leader Steve Aiken said his party had ""real concerns"" about the PSNI's senior leadership, and would be referring the matter to the Police Ombudsman. He said attendance at the Storey funeral had undermined the health message, but added that people should continue to follow Covid regulations and not be ""distracted"" from that. Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said that the party continues to have confidence in Mr Byrne. Health Minister Robin Swann urged people to stick with the Covid restrictions in place ""What we are very conscious of is the primary responsibility for what happened lies with Sinn FÃ©in and it would be perverse if we end up in the situation where the agencies who had to handle the situation are being held to account rather than those who were primarily responsible for what unfolded last June."" TUV leader Jim Allister has backed calls for Mr Byrne to resign, and said the decision not to prosecute had ""trashed"" Covid regulations. He added that the recall motion would keep a ""spotlight on those who were the lawbreakers and got away with it and those at the same time who were the lawmakers"".

Schools abuse helpline and safeguarding review launchedThey have been set up by the government in response to thousands of allegations from students.,"Website Everyone's Invited has published thousands of testimonies (stock image) A helpline and immediate review into sexual abuse in schools have been set up by the government in response to thousands of allegations from students. Ofsted will look at safeguarding in both state and independent schools. The helpline will be run by the NSPCC to both support potential victims and provide advice to children and adults. ""Sexual abuse in any form is abhorrent and it is vital that these allegations are dealt with properly,"" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said. ""While the majority of schools take their safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously, I am determined to make sure the right resources and processes are in place across the education system to support any victims of abuse to come forward."" The debate about a culture of sexual abuse at schools has escalated in recent weeks after a website set up for victims to anonymously post their experiences gained more than 11,000 posts, some from children as young as nine. Many of the allegations on the website refer to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university. Wendy Mair, from the Everyone's Invited site, said they were ""proud to have started a crucial conversation"", but disappointed the education secretary had not contacted them before the announcement.

Breaking|Breaking newsWales' pubs could reopen outdoors on 26 AprilOutdoor hospitality can reopen in Wales on 26 April if Covid rates stay low.Wales politics,"Pubs and restaurant owners had been keen to know when they could reopen Pubs, restaurants and hotels in Wales may reopen indoors in time for the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. First Minister Mark Drakeford has set out a series of dates for easing lockdown, stretching into the next month. Under the plans two households could meet indoors from 10 May, if Covid cases remained low. Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK andCommon Travel Area,externalmay go ahead from 12 April. Restaurants and bars could reopen outdoors from 26 April and from 3 May, outdoor wedding receptions with up to 30 people may be permitted. But the changes could depend on the results ofthe Senedd election on 6 May, and whether the Welsh Labour leader is returned to power. The Welsh Conservatives' own plans would seemost rules on social contact scrapped by 17 May. Both the Tories and Plaid Cymru called forgyms to reopen now, while Plaid said the Senedd should be recalled to discuss more economic help for businesses. Under the Welsh plans gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities will also be able to reopen from 10 May. This will include individual or one-to-one training, but not exercise classes. Spring Bank Holiday Monday is 31 May, but the Welsh government has not specified an actual date for reopening hospitality indoors. It said after 17 May it would ""consider enabling indoor hospitality and remaining visitor accommodation to reopen in advance of the Spring Bank Holiday"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Delay to reopening gyms in Wales 'irresponsible' Cultural and sport events may welcome crowds back Only six people from two households will be able to meet in reopened beer gardens and should still socially distance. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the public emergency is not over. He toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""You see in the pattern a continuation of the step-by-step approach we've taken in Wales, doing the outdoor activities first because it's safer to be outdoors. ""But for the first time in the timetable we are now able to set out the first re-openings of indoor activities as well."" He added: ""The presence of the virus in Wales is the lowest in the United Kingdom, the rate of vaccination in Wales is the highest in the United Kingdom. ""On Saturday, we will complete the vaccination offerto everybody in the top nine priority groups, again the first country in the UK to get to that milestone."" Provided cases remain low, the following things will be permitted: Monday, 12 April Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK and Common Travel Area, dependant on restrictions where you are intending to travel to All non-essential retail and close contact services, like beauty salons, allowed to reopen Monday, 26 April Outdoor hospitality, including cafes, pubs and restaurants Outdoor attractions, including funfairs and theme parks End of 22:00 BST alcohol sale limit in shops Monday, 3 May Organised outdoor activities for up to 30 people Outdoor wedding receptions attended by no more than 30 people Monday, 10 May People will be allowed to form extended households again, allowing two households to meet and have contact indoors Gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities can reopen. Individual and one-to-one training will be allowed, but not exercise classes Monday, 17 May Children's indoor activities Community centres Organised indoor activities for adults, limited to a maximum of 15 people. This includes exercise classes Beyond that date, ministers would consider reopening indoor pubs and restaurants, and remaining visitor accommodation ahead of the Spring Bank Holiday. Lucy Hywel says throwing away stock has been painful Tracy Lawler, who owns The Dressing Room Boutique in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, said she cannot wait to reopen on 12 April. She said because her shop is ""is small and intimate I can keep it really ultra clean after each person has entered"". ""I'm probably one of the safest public places for people to come in and the government is saying to me that I can't open up [yet]â¦ very frustrating."" Lucy Hywel, who owns That's Lovely That giftshop in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, was also looking forward to reopening, but said: ""We're hurt and we're still hurting. ""I myself have thrown out loads of food, thousands of pounds worth of stock, even last week, stock I thought I may have sold in the lead up to Easter got chucked away and that pain is there every time you do something like that."" Victoria Hallimi says the past few months have been really tough Victoria Hallimi, who owns Victoria's Driving School in Swansea, gave her last lesson on 13 December but can now reopen on 12 April. She said: ""My phone was going a bit crazy last night as soon as the announcement was made. ""I was up until about 11, 11:30 last night scheduling everybody in."" She said the past few months had been ""really tough"" and her husband had been doing a lot of overtime to make up for her not being able to work. ""He can relax now,"" she added. Kelly John has not paid herself a wage since January Kelly John, owner of KMW Beauty in Maesteg, Bridgend county, said she has not paid herself a wage since January to ensure she had enough money in her business account to buy supplies when she was allowed to reopen. ""Luckily my husband is working, otherwise I wouldn't have a house,"" the mother-of-two said. ""But being an independent woman, it is really hard. I can't do anything - it's Easter this weekend and I haven't bought anything."" Meanwhile, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective, which represents more than 400 Welsh hospitality firms, said it welcomed the move but ""continues to press for certainty and support"" about funding to support them while they remain closed. The plans will move Wales into the ""alert level three,external"" stage of the government's control plan by 17 May. While parts of Wales' lockdown have eased quicker than elsewhere in the UK, the Welsh government had been reluctant to set out a full schedule for when different sectors would reopen. Friday's announcement is the most detailed list of dates given by the government since the winter lockdown began to be eased. It does not go as far as England's tentative plans to scrap social contact restrictions by 21 June, although Mark Drakeford has previously said that's""very optimistic"". Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new ""indicative dates"" were are there ""to help businesses plan and prepare"". ""We have to remember that the pandemic isn't over - it's more important than ever that we continue to work together to keep this terrible virus under control so that we can go on unlocking Wales."" What can I do now... and what comes next? Some sectors like cinemas and theatres have not been given a date to reopen in Wales. Following criticism of his plans for gyms and leisure centres, Mr Drakeford said the sector will be the first able to reopen indoors. Pubs will be able to open outdoors two weeks after England. The first minister said he had considered bringing that forward, but ""the advice was very clear that that was not advisable on public health grounds"". First Minister Mark Drakeford has criticised Boris Johnson's roadmap out of lockdown in England as being optimistic The Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Mr Drakeford's roadmap was ""very late in the day"". He said it was ""unfortunate"" that further funding had not been made available to hospitality sector - and said outdoor hospitality should be opening in line with England on 12 April. Mr Davies told Wales Today: ""What's really dumbfounding is that despite his mental health minister's assurances that gyms will be one of the first facilities to open, they are now not going to open until May."" Plaid Cymru Leader Adam Price said he would go faster on reopening gyms and indoor hospitality. ""We've also been calling for a much more accelerated timetable in terms of reopening gyms, because of their importance in terms of mental and physical well being. So I think it's disappointing to see that being delayed. ""There are dangers of course in moving too fast but there's an equal danger of being over cautious"". Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds said: ""Now that more and more of Wales is opening up and life is slowly returning to normal, it's time to put our recovery first. ""I want to see support for those individuals who will lose their jobs when furlough ends, those who are likely to lose their homes when the ban on evictions is lifted and those whose mental health has suffered as a result of this pandemic."" A UKIP spokesman said: ""With the success of the vaccine rollout, lockdowns no longer have any major impact on case numbers. ""The Welsh economy must be reopened now. Not in a month's time. This apathetic timeline will be the final nail in the coffin for many businesses that have been just about clinging on."" What are the stats in my area? The road out of the Welsh lockdown - key data to watch for The announcement comes as latest figures show admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 caseshit a record low- it stands at a daily seven-day average of 19. Covid hospital admissions are the lowest since the pandemic began with 17 confirmed and suspected Covid patients on Wednesday, with none at all in Swansea Bay hospitals.

'One who causes fear' dinosaur found in ArgentinaThe animal had horns and a large skull making it a fearsome predator around 85 million years ago.,"An artist's impression of Llukalkan aliocranianus Scientists in southern Argentina have found the skull of a large meat-eating dinosaur named ""one who causes fear"" in the local Mapuche language. The horned Llukalkan aliocranianus was around 5 metres (16 feet) long and roamed South America 85 million years ago. Researchers found remains nearby of another carnivorous dinosaur, something they said was highly unusual. The findings from Patagonia were published on Tuesday. Like the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Llukalkan dinosaur was two-legged with very short arms, but was medium-sized compared to the giant T. rex. It also had short horns and tiny fingers. It was estimated to weigh between one and five tonnes, slightly lighter than an adult African elephant. It was probably a fearsome predator, with a large skull and a strong bite, according to the research published in theJournal of Vertebrate Paleontology.,external The findings suggest it had better hearing than other dinosaurs in the abelisaurids family which likely made it a better hunter, Federico Gianechini, a palaeontologist at the National University of San Luis Argentina told Reuters news agency. It lived on earth during the Cretaceous period, the last era before dinosaurs were wiped out. Close to Llukalkhan's skull, scientist found the fossilised remains of a slightly larger meat-eating dinosaur called Viavenator exxoni. Tyrannosaurus species named 'Reaper of Death' found in Canada Boy, 12, discovers rare dinosaur skeleton New dinosaur discovered in Australia Mr Gianechini said it is very unusual to find two abelisaurids living close together at the same time. ""Llukalkan was a little smaller than Viavenator, although, if they lived together, they surely shared the same ecological niche and fed on the same prey, so they would have competed with each other and - why not - even eaten each other,"" he told Reuters. A series of important dinosaur discoveries have been made in Argentina in recent decades. In 2014 the remains of a dinosaur that weighed around the same as 14 elephants were found - it was thought to be the biggest ever discovered.

Deliveroo shares tumble on stock market debutDeliveroo shares close well below their expected price after big investors' attitude to company soured.BusinessComments,"Deliveroo shares have plummeted on its stock market debut after a number of major UK investors expressed concerns about its gig economy worker model. Shares in the food delivery business had been offered to investors at 390p each, but closed 14% lower at 284p per share, having fallen 30% initially. The company had initially hoped for a share price of up to 460p. But in recent weeks a number ofhigh-profile fund managers saidthey would not be buying the shares. The Deliveroo share sale is London's biggest stock market launch for a decade and the sharp fall on its first day of trading is a blow to the UK's ambitions to persuade more big tech companies to list in the UK. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said earlier this month that the listing of the Amazon-backed company was a ""true British tech success story"" that could clear the way for more initial public offerings by fast-growing technology firms. When ITV political editor Robert Peston asked on Wednesday whether he was embarrassed by the plunge in Deliveroo shares,Mr Sunak said: ""Gosh, no... share prices go up, share prices go down."" Mr Sunak cited Facebook's mixed start after its initial public offering in 2012, and its subsequent success. But some analysts were not so complimentary. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said: ""Deliveroo has gone from hero to zero as the much-hyped stock market debut falls flat on its face. ""Initially there was a lot of fanfare about the Amazon-backed company making its shares available to the public, including the ability for customers to buy stock. Sadly, the narrative took a turn for the worst when multiple fund managers came out and said they wouldn't back the business due to concerns about working practices."" Deliveroo, which has not yet made a profit, said on Monday it had chosen to ""price responsibly"" and sell its shares at the bottom of its planned price range at 390p due to ""volatile"" market conditions. Some of the UK's biggest investment fund managers, including Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, charity fund manager CCLA, Legal and General Investment Management and M&G said recently they would not buy shares in Deliveroo, citing concerns over including the working conditions of its riders and lack of investor power. This was supposed to be a landmark day for Deliveroo, the wider UK tech sector and the London Stock Exchange. A British business founded just eight years ago had shown it could grow and prosper here without falling into overseas hands and by choosing London rather than New York for its stock market debut, setting an example for others to follow. But the sharp fall this morning in shares - already priced at the conservative end of the planned range - showed that faith in Deliveroo's prospects was somewhat shaky. It was as if investors had suddenly woken up to something which should have been obvious all along - Deliveroo might have grown rapidly during the pandemic but it is still racking up big losses in what is a competitive food delivery market, Then there's the question of whether the company might have to improve pay and conditions for its delivery drivers following Uber's defeat before the Supreme Court. However loudly Deliveroo insisted that the Uber ruling had no relevance to its business, some investors weren't so sure, worrying that the path to profitability might be even tougher. As the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said, pointing at Facebook, a shaky debut does not mean the shares won't soar in the longer term. Then again, Facebook didn't have to compete with Uber Eats and Just Eat in a market that looks a far more challenging place to make money than online advertising. Founder Will Shu will have shares that give him 20-times the voting power of other investors. Chief executive Will Shu said he was ""very proud"" that Deliveroo was listing in London. ""In this next phase of our journey as a public company we will continue to invest in the innovations that help restaurants and grocers to grow their businesses, to bring customers more choice than ever before, and to provide riders with more work,"" he added. Deliveroo's self-employed drivers have seen a boom in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic, bringing food from restaurants to housebound customers. Initially, Deliveroo hoped to see that value as high as Â£8.8bn, based on a share price of 390-460p. It scaled that back to Â£7.6bn, but the share price drop wiped Â£2.28bn off that. The firm is making a portion of its stock available for customers, with delivery riders and restaurant partners also able to buy shares. Deliveroo is selling just over one-fifth of the group, while institutional investing trading started on Wednesday, the general public can start trading in its shares from 7 April. Private companies, as a way of raising cash, can start a process to list on a stock exchange. In an initial public offering (IPO) companies offer shares to investors before listing. The price of the shares is typically set by investment banks hired by the company to run the process. But once the shares start to be publicly traded, prices are set by supply and demand. The value of the shares, multiplied by how many there are, gives the market value of the company. Deliveroo's chief executive, Will Shu, founded the business in 2013 Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the biggest concern from investors was about worker rights: ""The flexible employee model of Deliveroo's riders is a huge pillar of the group's plans for success. ""If forced to offer more traditional employee benefits, like company pension contributions, Deliveroo's already thin margins would struggle to climb, and the road to profitability would look very tough indeed."" She said it was difficult to value the firm as it had yet to turn a profit. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said that ""even pricing the initial public offering at the bottom of the range, Deliveroo was demanding too high a price tag for a loss-making delivery platform in a very competitive space with a questionable path to profitability. ""The books were covered, it was just plain mis-priced."" Have you bought Deliveroo shares? Get in touch by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"PwC says start when you like, leave when you like","From now on if you work for PriceWaterhouseCooper you'll be able to work from home a couple of days a week and start as early or late as you like. This summer you can knock off early on Fridays too. Following the pandemic the accountancy giant is offering its staff much more control over their working pattern. PwC chairman Kevin Ellis said he hoped this would make flexible working ""the norm rather than the exception"". ""We want our people to feel trusted and empowered,"" Mr Ellis said. Sunak: 'People may quit if made to work from home' 'People are tired of working from home' Nationwide tells 13,000 staff to 'work anywhere' A year of working from home and juggling childcare when schools were closed and other responsibilities mounted, has prompted many businesses to look again at the traditional working week. The building society Nationwide has told its staff they can choose whether to work at home or in the office. Oil giant BP has told office staff they can spend two days a week working from home and several banks are examining hybrid home-office arrangements. But PwC is the first of the big four accountancy firms to announce their post-pandemic strategy. Goldman Sachs' chief executive made clear he saw working from home during the pandemic as an ""aberration"" saying young employees at the investment bank needed direct contact and mentorship that you could only get in the office. But Mr Ellis said PwC wanted to retain a mix of working from home and the office. ""Without conscious planning now there's a risk we lose the best bits of these new ways of working when the economy opens up again,"" he said. ""The future of work is changing at such a pace we have to evolve continually how we do things to meet the needs of our people and our clients."" The pandemic has highlighted many advantages to working from home, the time and expense saved commuting, not having to wear tights or a tie, and a better work-life balance, including spending more time with the children. But for many the appeal of the zoom-in-a-tracksuit meeting is fading, compared to the idea of water-cooler moments and after-work drinks. They look forward to being back in the work environment, and free from the demands of the children. Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently suggested that employees might ""vote with their feet"" if they were required to work from home full time. He praised the ""the spontaneity, the team building, the culture that you create in a firm or an organisation from people actually spending physical time together"". There are the knock-on economic impacts of office life too. City centres full of office workers help support the livelihoods of sandwich sellers, retailers, cleaners and transport workers. The Canary Wharf financial complex in London currently only has about 6,000 going into work. Pre-pandemic it was 100,000 and the area is packed with shuttered wine bars and restaurants. Canary Wharf's head of strategy, Howard Dawber, claims people are missing office life, grabbing a coffee, lunch with colleagues and other aspects of city centre life. In fact only around a fifth of UK workers want to work from home entirely, and around the same proportion want to work only in the office, according to arecent survey carried out on behalf of the World Economic Forum,external. They point out that workplaces that operate a ""mixed mode"" will have to be aware it may have an impact on who gets promoted, with knock on implications for diversity, especially for women. PwC expect their staff will want the best of both worlds, and will adopt a ""blended working"" approach, spending around half of their working hours either in the office or at clients' workplaces. There is an assumption that the majority of people will condense their working week and finish at lunchtime on a Friday during July and August, PwC said. The new policies will be phased in as lockdown restrictions ease and its 22,000 staff return to the office. Four-day week: 'I don't waste holidays on chores' 'I was working 72 hours a week - it was cult-like' Goldman Sachs managers paid for hampers for staff Nationwide tells 13,000 staff to 'work anywhere' 'People are tired of working from home' City firms look to cut office space amid pandemic Accounting scandals spark governance reforms Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Black British history you may not know,"These children are lining up in Brixton, south London, to see Queen Mary open Lambeth Town Hall in 1938 ""We have existed in Britain and been pioneers, inventors, icons. And then colonialism happened, and that has shaped the experiences of black people - but that is not all we are."" These are the words of Lavinya Stennett, founder of The Black Curriculum, an organisation which teaches black British history in schools - and is campaigning for Education Secretary Gavin Williamson to make it compulsory. The death of George Floyd in America has inspired thousands of people in Britain to demand justice, marching through the streets of our biggest cities. Black Lives Matter protesters here insist thatthe UK ""is not innocent"". But some commentators have questioned whether racism exists in Britain, and to what extent. George The Poet, who was questioned about this on Newsnight, believes a lack of education about black British history - and the British Empire - plays a part in racism in the UK and our discussions about it.

The transatlantic slave trade and the US civil rights movement are largely the only black history taught in UK schools, normally in October when we celebrate Black History Month. ""lf you're omitting different histories and narratives, you're saying that these people aren't part of this country, this nation, this heritage - or they're not important enough to be taught as common knowledge,"" says Melody Triumph, policy specialist at The Black Curriculum. These are just a few episodes of black British history we weren't taught in school. Research from the University of Reading in 2010 showed a British-Roman woman in York, whose remains were found in 1901, had African ancestry Some might think the first black people in Britain arrived from Britain's colonies - the countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia that Britain ruled over, in some cases for centuries - after World War 2. But that's not true, says Lavinya from The Black Curriculum. ""We know that black people were in Britain since Roman times - and there's specific examples."" The Ivory Bangle Lady is the name given to remains discovered in York in 1901 which are now on display in the York Museum. Archaeological analysis reveals that although she was born in Roman Britain, she's likely to be of North African descent. The remains have been dated to the second half of the 4th Century. She was found with jet and elephant ivory bracelets, earrings, pendants, beads, a blue glass jug and a glass mirror. In other words, she wasn't poor. ""It puts into question assumptions that black people have never been aspirationally wealthy or had any kind of wealth,"" Lavinya says. John Blanke can be seen on a roll from the 1500s at the National Archives During the Tudor period there werehundreds of black migrantsliving in England. For those of us a bit rusty on our Tudor dates, we're talking about the 1500s. John Blanke, an African trumpeter, was one of them. His face can be seen inscribed into a 60ft long roll depicting the prestigious Westminster Tournament of 1511 -an elaborate party,externalwhich Henry VIII put on to celebrate the birth of a son. There's even a letter from John Blanke to Henry VIII asking for a pay rise. ""He petitioned for 8p a day. I don't know what the conversion is today, but that showed he knew his worth,"" Lavinya says. Portrait of Queen Charlotte by Johan Joseph Zoffany She was a princess from Germany who became a British Queen after marrying King George III - and many historians believe Queen Charlotte had African ancestry. They married in 1761 and Charlotte was the mother of two British monarchs - George IV and William IV. It's been argued that despite coming from Germany, Queen Charlotte was descended from a black branch of the Portuguese royal family. King Afonso III of Portugal conquered the city of Faro from the Moors - Muslims from North Africa who lived in modern-day Spain and Portugal during the Middle Ages - in the 13th Century. Afonso was thought to have had three children with the city governor's daughter. One of their sons, Martim Afonso Chichorro, is also said to have married into a family with black ethnicity. He and his wife, Ines Lourenco de Sousa de Valadares, founded the Portuguese house of Sousa-Chichorro, which had many descendants, including Queen Charlotte. Queen Charlotte's great granddaughter? Queen Victoria. This video can not be played Many streets in Glasgow city centre are named after slave-owning plantation owners. Queen Charlotte, whether she had African ancestry or not, joined the Royal Family in the century when Britain started slave-trading - whichmade it vastly wealthy. ""A lot of the time, we start with black history in London - it's London-centric. But a lot of Glasgow's wealth actually comes from the tobacco, the sugar, the cotton that was created and sustained by enslaved people in Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados,"" Lavinya says. Many of Glasgow's prominent city centre streets are named after 18th Century slave owners who made fortunes from plantations. ""You're told that black people were slaves, but you're not told the fruits of their labour are actually the streets we walk on."" This video can not be played A new play, written and performed by Paterson Joseph, tells the story of Britain's first black voter. Lavinya says teaching slavery is important but you need to ""contextualise it"". ""Talk about who gained from it, the people not only in the colonies but also here in the UK."" That also means teaching about the ""black people in Scotland who were part of the abolition of the slave trade"". ""All you hear about is William Wilberforce"" - a British politician whocampaigned to abolish slavery- Lavinya says. This video can not be played David Matthews tells the story of his great-uncle who fought in World War One. When we talk about Caribbean migration into England we often think about theWindrush generation, who arrived in Britain between 1948 and 1971. ""But black people were actually brought over from Jamaica to fight in World War One,"" says Lavinya. Her great-uncle came to England at the age of 17 to help the war effort, settling in London afterwards. But she says her uncle was ""one of the lucky ones""- because he wasn't sent back after the war. When soldiers returned to the UK after WW1 there was a jobs shortage and a lack of opportunities. ""White people made the link that they were not getting jobs because of the black people"" - and violence towards black communities followed. They're known as the 1919 race riots in Glasgow, Liverpool, Cardiff and other seaports across Britain, during which three people were killed and hundreds injured. Charles Wotten, a black serviceman, was killed in the race riots But there were economic consequences too. Many black serviceman and workers found themselves without jobs after a ""colour bar"" was introduced in many industries, with white workers, often backed by unions, refusing to work alongside black people. Lots of black men were sent back to the countries they had lived in before the war. Poverty and a lack of jobs were a big factor in the riots, butaccording to researcher Jamie Baker, there was also a fear that black men and white women were starting families. ""It fits into the hyper-sexualisation of black men. White men felt threatened because they felt that black men were taking their women,"" Lavinya says. A newspaper cutting shows students marching in Bristol in protest against a ""colour bar"" on the buses After WW2 black people from the Caribbean and Africa, and people from India, were asked to come to Britain to help rebuild the country. They were put to work in the NHS and other public sector roles, like driving buses. But in Bristol the Omnibus Company, run by the council, refused to employ black and Asian drivers, which eventually led to a boycott of buses across the whole city. ""But it wasn't as easy as that,"" Lavinya says. At the time it was not illegal to discriminate based on race - the first Race Relations Act was passed in 1965, but didn't include legislation about employment or housing until 1968. Paul Stephenson, Roy Hackett and Guy Bailey were the brains behind the boycott and Paul drew inspiration from the bus boycott in the US, started whenRosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white passenger when the bus was at capacity, for what they did in Bristol. Guy Bailey, Roy Hackett and Paul Stephenson with a 1960s-era Bristol bus Hackett organised blockades and sit-down protests to prevent buses getting through the city centre. ""White women taking their kids to school or going to work would ask us what it was about,"" hetold the BBC. ""Later they came and joined us."" Students showed support too and it was backed by the local MP Tony Benn as well as Harold Wilson, who became Labour leader a year later. On the same day Martin Luther King Jr delivered his famous ""I have a dream"" speech after marching on Washington DC - 28 August 1963 - pressure had built enough over the summer that the Bristol Omnibus Company announced a change in policy. By mid-September Bristol had its first non-white bus conductor - Raghbir Singh, an Indian-born Sikh who'd lived in Bristol since 1959 - and further black and Asian crews followed. Paul Stephenson, Guy Bailey and Roy Hackett all received OBEs for their action.

Schools abuse helpline and review launchedWatchdog Ofsted will also review school safeguarding policies after many reports of sexual harassment.Family & Education,"Website Everyone's Invited has published thousands of testimonies (stock image) A helpline and immediate review into sexual abuse in schools have been set up by the government in response to thousands of allegations from students. Ofsted will look at safeguarding in both state and independent schools. The helpline will be run by the NSPCC to both support potential victims and provide advice to children and adults. ""Sexual abuse in any form is abhorrent and it is vital that these allegations are dealt with properly,"" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said. ""While the majority of schools take their safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously, I am determined to make sure the right resources and processes are in place across the education system to support any victims of abuse to come forward."" The debate about a culture of sexual abuse at schools has escalated in recent weeks after a website set up for victims to anonymously post their experiences gained more than 11,000 posts, some from children as young as nine. Many of the allegations on the website refer to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university. Wendy Mair, from the Everyone's Invited site, said they were ""proud to have started a crucial conversation"", but disappointed the education secretary had not contacted them before the announcement. ""We are encouraged to see that the government has responded and taken the first initial steps to review rape culture in all schools,"" she said, adding that she hoped the site's team will be included in carrying out the review. ""The testimonies being shared through Everyone's Invited are extremely upsetting, and underline the urgent need to tackle violence against girls,"" said NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless. ""This is a watershed moment thanks to those who have found the courage to speak out."" Sex abuse claims 'not limited to private schools' School abuse: 'Raped girl ignored by teachers' The helpline will be open from 09:00 GMT on Thursday to offer support and advice to children and adults who are victims of sexual abuse in schools. This includes how to contact the police and report crimes, if they wish to, while parents and professionals can also get in touch. Students have contacted the BBC criticising what they see as their school's failure to tackle incidents or acknowledge the wider issues. Sarah, who is 18 and goes to a state school in London, said she had been ""sexually harassed on numerous occasions"" by students at a neighbouring private school. She said she feels incredibly let down by what she saw as her school's ""lack of response"" to the recent discussions around women's safety. ""It's really been left to students to care for each other, often leading to major tensions within peer groups as people attempt to 'confront' certain students known for sexually inappropriate behaviour,"" she said. In June 2020, Soma Sara, who is now 22, shared her experience on Instagram of what she calls ""rape culture"". Within a week she had received and shared more than 300 anonymous responses of people with stories of ""misogyny, harassment, abuse and assault"". The Everyone's Invited,externalwebsite now carries thousands of victims' testimonies, often from schools and universities. Experiences range from being drugged and raped at parties to explicit images being shared over messaging platforms. Another sixth former, from Kent, suggested there had been ""lots of sexual assault allegations"" made at her school, but that these had been played down. ""Before lockdown two we tried talking to the school and that has totally been ignored, and because of their 'prestigious' image they've been telling girls to keep quiet and to think of the accused's mental health,"" she said. Last week, pupils at Highgate School in North Londonwalked out of classesin protest at a perceived ""rape culture"", following the publication of accounts of alleged abuse. One male ex-pupiltold BBC Newsnightthat girls were ""hounded"" for naked selfies at the school. The school's governing body said it was ""truly sorry"" and had commissioned an external review. Ofsted will begin an immediate review of safeguarding policies in state and private schools, to determine whether guidance for schools around sexual harassment needs to be improved. It will conclude by the end of May More than half of young women had been sexually harassed at their school, college or university,polling of 1,000 young women,externalaged 14-21 last autumn suggested. One in five said they had received unwanted sexual comments and 8% had been groped, according to the figures from girls' rights charity Plan International UK. Conservative MP Maria Miller, former chairwoman of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, told BBC Breakfast there was ""far more to do"" on the issue. ""If we don't tackle it in our schools we leave young people leaving school thinking that is entirely right, that they're able to either sexually harass or be on the receiving end of sexual harassment,"" she said. ""And that's why we're seeing these behaviours going to our universities, our workplaces and beyond."" Ms Miller said new mandatory relationships education in England, and a forthcoming Online Harms Bill introducing age controls on online pornography, were ""steps in the right direction"". ""There is no doubt that schools can and should play a key role in this work, but this is a problem that reaches far beyond the school gates,"" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of head teachers' union NAHT, said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the union welcomed the review and the helpline, adding: ""Robust safeguarding is the number one priority of state and independent schools."" The Report Abuse in Education helpline can be reached on 0800 136 663, on Monday to Friday 8am - 10pm, or 9am - 6pm at weekends.

"Real Housewives stars charged over fraud schemeJennifer Shah and her assistant Stuart Smith are accused of targeting ""hundreds of victims"".","Jennifer Shah appeared in court in Salt Lake City on Tuesday The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City star Jennifer Shah has been charged over fraud allegations involving ""hundreds of victims"". The TV star, 47, and her assistant Stuart Smith, 43, have been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering,the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York,externalsaid. They were arrested and appeared in Salt Lake City federal court on Tuesday. It's alleged they have been running a US-wide fraud scheme since 2012. According to prosecutors, Ms Shah and Mr Smith sold services - such as website design - which claimed to make the management of victims' businesses more efficient or profitable. They're also alleged to have offered to sell the personal information of potential victims to other members of the ""fraud ring"". Manhattan US Attorney Audrey Strauss said Ms Shah portrays herself ""as a wealthy and successful businessperson on reality television"". ""In actual reality and as alleged, the so-called business opportunities pushed on the victims by Shah, Smith, and their co-conspirators were just fraudulent schemes, motivated by greed, to steal victims' money,"" she said. Many of the alleged victims are over the age of 55. Stuart Smith (right) is Jennifer Shah's assistant The charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with telemarketing carries a maximum sentence of 30 years. Conspiracy to commit money laundering carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. Jennifer Shah is part of the main cast of the show, which airs on Bravo. The first season ended in February and the show has been renewed for a second season. Newsbeat has contacted the show and Ms Shah's representatives for comment, but they are yet to respond.

Schools abuse helpline and review launched,"Website Everyone's Invited has published thousands of testimonies (stock image) A helpline and immediate review into sexual abuse in schools have been set up by the government in response to thousands of allegations from students. Ofsted will look at safeguarding in both state and independent schools. The helpline will be run by the NSPCC to both support potential victims and provide advice to children and adults. ""Sexual abuse in any form is abhorrent and it is vital that these allegations are dealt with properly,"" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said. ""While the majority of schools take their safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously, I am determined to make sure the right resources and processes are in place across the education system to support any victims of abuse to come forward."" The debate about a culture of sexual abuse at schools has escalated in recent weeks after a website set up for victims to anonymously post their experiences gained more than 11,000 posts, some from children as young as nine. Many of the allegations on the website refer to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university. Wendy Mair, from the Everyone's Invited site, said they were ""proud to have started a crucial conversation"", but disappointed the education secretary had not contacted them before the announcement. ""We are encouraged to see that the government has responded and taken the first initial steps to review rape culture in all schools,"" she said, adding that she hoped the site's team will be included in carrying out the review. ""The testimonies being shared through Everyone's Invited are extremely upsetting, and underline the urgent need to tackle violence against girls,"" said NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless. ""This is a watershed moment thanks to those who have found the courage to speak out."" Sex abuse claims 'not limited to private schools' School abuse: 'Raped girl ignored by teachers' The helpline will be open from 09:00 GMT on Thursday to offer support and advice to children and adults who are victims of sexual abuse in schools. This includes how to contact the police and report crimes, if they wish to, while parents and professionals can also get in touch. Students have contacted the BBC criticising what they see as their school's failure to tackle incidents or acknowledge the wider issues. Sarah, who is 18 and goes to a state school in London, said she had been ""sexually harassed on numerous occasions"" by students at a neighbouring private school. She said she feels incredibly let down by what she saw as her school's ""lack of response"" to the recent discussions around women's safety. ""It's really been left to students to care for each other, often leading to major tensions within peer groups as people attempt to 'confront' certain students known for sexually inappropriate behaviour,"" she said. In June 2020, Soma Sara, who is now 22, shared her experience on Instagram of what she calls ""rape culture"". Within a week she had received and shared more than 300 anonymous responses of people with stories of ""misogyny, harassment, abuse and assault"". The Everyone's Invited,externalwebsite now carries thousands of victims' testimonies, often from schools and universities. Experiences range from being drugged and raped at parties to explicit images being shared over messaging platforms. Another sixth former, from Kent, suggested there had been ""lots of sexual assault allegations"" made at her school, but that these had been played down. ""Before lockdown two we tried talking to the school and that has totally been ignored, and because of their 'prestigious' image they've been telling girls to keep quiet and to think of the accused's mental health,"" she said. Last week, pupils at Highgate School in North Londonwalked out of classesin protest at a perceived ""rape culture"", following the publication of accounts of alleged abuse. One male ex-pupiltold BBC Newsnightthat girls were ""hounded"" for naked selfies at the school. The school's governing body said it was ""truly sorry"" and had commissioned an external review. Ofsted will begin an immediate review of safeguarding policies in state and private schools, to determine whether guidance for schools around sexual harassment needs to be improved. It will conclude by the end of May More than half of young women had been sexually harassed at their school, college or university,polling of 1,000 young women,externalaged 14-21 last autumn suggested. One in five said they had received unwanted sexual comments and 8% had been groped, according to the figures from girls' rights charity Plan International UK. Conservative MP Maria Miller, former chairwoman of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, told BBC Breakfast there was ""far more to do"" on the issue. ""If we don't tackle it in our schools we leave young people leaving school thinking that is entirely right, that they're able to either sexually harass or be on the receiving end of sexual harassment,"" she said. ""And that's why we're seeing these behaviours going to our universities, our workplaces and beyond."" Ms Miller said new mandatory relationships education in England, and a forthcoming Online Harms Bill introducing age controls on online pornography, were ""steps in the right direction"". ""There is no doubt that schools can and should play a key role in this work, but this is a problem that reaches far beyond the school gates,"" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of head teachers' union NAHT, said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the union welcomed the review and the helpline, adding: ""Robust safeguarding is the number one priority of state and independent schools."" The Report Abuse in Education helpline can be reached on 0800 136 663, on Monday to Friday 8am - 10pm, or 9am - 6pm at weekends.

Deliveroo shares drop 30% on stock market debut,"Deliveroo shares have plummeted on its stock market debut after a number of major UK investors expressed concerns about its gig economy worker model. Shares in the food delivery business had been offered to investors at 390p each, but closed 14% lower at 284p per share, having fallen 30% initially. The company had initially hoped for a share price of up to 460p. But in recent weeks a number ofhigh-profile fund managers saidthey would not be buying the shares. The Deliveroo share sale is London's biggest stock market launch for a decade and the sharp fall on its first day of trading is a blow to the UK's ambitions to persuade more big tech companies to list in the UK. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said earlier this month that the listing of the Amazon-backed company was a ""true British tech success story"" that could clear the way for more initial public offerings by fast-growing technology firms. When ITV political editor Robert Peston asked on Wednesday whether he was embarrassed by the plunge in Deliveroo shares,Mr Sunak said: ""Gosh, no... share prices go up, share prices go down."" Mr Sunak cited Facebook's mixed start after its initial public offering in 2012, and its subsequent success. But some analysts were not so complimentary. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said: ""Deliveroo has gone from hero to zero as the much-hyped stock market debut falls flat on its face. ""Initially there was a lot of fanfare about the Amazon-backed company making its shares available to the public, including the ability for customers to buy stock. Sadly, the narrative took a turn for the worst when multiple fund managers came out and said they wouldn't back the business due to concerns about working practices."" Deliveroo, which has not yet made a profit, said on Monday it had chosen to ""price responsibly"" and sell its shares at the bottom of its planned price range at 390p due to ""volatile"" market conditions. Some of the UK's biggest investment fund managers, including Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, charity fund manager CCLA, Legal and General Investment Management and M&G said recently they would not buy shares in Deliveroo, citing concerns over including the working conditions of its riders and lack of investor power. This was supposed to be a landmark day for Deliveroo, the wider UK tech sector and the London Stock Exchange. A British business founded just eight years ago had shown it could grow and prosper here without falling into overseas hands and by choosing London rather than New York for its stock market debut, setting an example for others to follow. But the sharp fall this morning in shares - already priced at the conservative end of the planned range - showed that faith in Deliveroo's prospects was somewhat shaky. It was as if investors had suddenly woken up to something which should have been obvious all along - Deliveroo might have grown rapidly during the pandemic but it is still racking up big losses in what is a competitive food delivery market, Then there's the question of whether the company might have to improve pay and conditions for its delivery drivers following Uber's defeat before the Supreme Court. However loudly Deliveroo insisted that the Uber ruling had no relevance to its business, some investors weren't so sure, worrying that the path to profitability might be even tougher. As the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said, pointing at Facebook, a shaky debut does not mean the shares won't soar in the longer term. Then again, Facebook didn't have to compete with Uber Eats and Just Eat in a market that looks a far more challenging place to make money than online advertising. Founder Will Shu will have shares that give him 20-times the voting power of other investors. Chief executive Will Shu said he was ""very proud"" that Deliveroo was listing in London. ""In this next phase of our journey as a public company we will continue to invest in the innovations that help restaurants and grocers to grow their businesses, to bring customers more choice than ever before, and to provide riders with more work,"" he added. Deliveroo's self-employed drivers have seen a boom in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic, bringing food from restaurants to housebound customers. Initially, Deliveroo hoped to see that value as high as Â£8.8bn, based on a share price of 390-460p. It scaled that back to Â£7.6bn, but the share price drop wiped Â£2.28bn off that. The firm is making a portion of its stock available for customers, with delivery riders and restaurant partners also able to buy shares. Deliveroo is selling just over one-fifth of the group, while institutional investing trading started on Wednesday, the general public can start trading in its shares from 7 April. Private companies, as a way of raising cash, can start a process to list on a stock exchange. In an initial public offering (IPO) companies offer shares to investors before listing. The price of the shares is typically set by investment banks hired by the company to run the process. But once the shares start to be publicly traded, prices are set by supply and demand. The value of the shares, multiplied by how many there are, gives the market value of the company. Deliveroo's chief executive, Will Shu, founded the business in 2013 Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the biggest concern from investors was about worker rights: ""The flexible employee model of Deliveroo's riders is a huge pillar of the group's plans for success. ""If forced to offer more traditional employee benefits, like company pension contributions, Deliveroo's already thin margins would struggle to climb, and the road to profitability would look very tough indeed."" She said it was difficult to value the firm as it had yet to turn a profit. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said that ""even pricing the initial public offering at the bottom of the range, Deliveroo was demanding too high a price tag for a loss-making delivery platform in a very competitive space with a questionable path to profitability. ""The books were covered, it was just plain mis-priced."" Have you bought Deliveroo shares? Get in touch by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"UK not rigged against minorities, race report says","Black Lives Matter protests were held across the UK last summer The UK ""no longer"" has a system rigged against people from ethnic minorities, a review set up by No 10 says. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on how people's lives turned out. It said children belonging to ethnic minorities did as well or better than white pupils, but overt racism remained, particularly online. The Runnymede Trust think tank said it felt ""let down"" by the report. The commission was set up after Black Lives Matter anti-racism protests across the country last summer - triggered by the killing of George Floyd in the US. The main findings were: Children from ethnic-minority communities did as well or better than white pupils in compulsory education, with black Caribbean pupils the only group to perform less well This success in education has ""transformed British society over the last 50 years into one offering far greater opportunities for all"" The pay gap between all ethnic minorities and the white majority population had shrunk to 2.3% overall and was barely significant for employees under 30 Diversity has increased in professions such as law and medicine But some communities continue to be ""haunted"" by historic racism, which is creating ""deep mistrust"" and could be a barrier to success Thecommission's report concluded,externalthat the UK is not yet a ""post-racial country"" - but its success in removing race-based disparity in education and, to a lesser extent, the economy, ""should be regarded as a model for other white-majority countries"". Key points: What does the race report say? The black British history you may not know about Six reports in four years but what action has been taken? A foreword to the report by chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, said: ""We no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities."" While the ""impediments and disparities do exist"", it continued, they were ""varied and ironically very few of them are directly to do with racism"". The report added that evidence had found that factors such as geography, family influence, socio-economic background, culture and religion had ""more significant impact on life chances than the existence of racism"". ""That said, we take the reality of racism seriously and we do not deny that it is a real force in the UK."" The report also said there is an ""increasingly strident form of anti-racism thinking that seeks to explain all minority disadvantage through the prism of white discrimination"" which it said diverted attention from ""the other reasons for minority success and failure"". In a statement issued after the report was published, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""right"" that ministers now consider its recommendations in detail and assess ""the implications for future government policy"". He added: ""The entirety of government remains fully committed to building a fairer Britain and taking the action needed to address disparities wherever they exist."" This video can not be played Institutional racism has become a 'catch-all phrase', Tony Sewell says Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Sewell said while there was anecdotal evidence of racism, there was no proof that there was ""institutional racism"" in Britain. ""No-one denies and no-one is saying racism doesn't exist"", he said. ""We found anecdotal evidence of this. However, evidence of actual institutional racism? No, that wasn't there, we didn't find that."" Dr Sewell added that the term ""institutional racism"" is ""sometimes wrongly applied"" as a ""sort of a catch-all phrase for micro-aggressions or acts of racial abuse"". Prof Kehinde Andrews, a professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, said the report was not a ""genuine effort to understand racism in Britain"". Prof Andrews said: ""It's complete nonsense. It goes in the face of all the actual existing evidence. This is not a genuine effort to understand racism in Britain. This is a PR move to pretend the problem doesn't exist."" Baroness Kishwer Falkner, chair of theEquality and Human Rights Commission,external, said: ""This report rightly identifies the varied causes of disparities and by making recommendations to address them gives the government the opportunity to design policy targeting the sources of inequality. ""There are a number of recommendations we can play a leading role in and we welcome the recognition that additional funding would help us carry out our important work to tackle discrimination and disadvantage."" Dr Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, said she felt ""deeply, massively let down"" by the report, and that the government did not have the confidence of black and minority ethnic communities. Asked for her view on the commission's suggestion that the UK is not institutionally racist, she said: ""Tell that to the black young mother who is four times more likely to die in childbirth than her young white neighbour, tell that to the 60% of NHS doctors and nurses who died from Covid and were black and ethnic minority workers. ""You can't tell them that, because they are dead. ""Institutionally, we are still racist, and for a government-appointed commission to look into (institutional) racism, to deny its existence is deeply, deeply worrying."" She added: ""We feel that if the best this government can do is come up with a style guide on BAME terminology, or what we should do about unconscious bias training, or extend a few school hours, then I'm afraid this government doesn't carry the confidence of black and ethnic minority communities any longer, certainly not on race."" Dr Begum also claimed the report had failed to acknowledge the ""suffering"" of black and ethnic minority communities, adding: ""All this is is a whitewash and a script that has been written to 10 Downing Street."" She also questioned the suitability of Dr Sewell and head of the Number 10 policy unit Munira Mirza, who had a role in setting the commission up - both ofwhom have questioned the existence of institutional racism previously. This video can not be played Social commentator Patrick Vernon says the report ""doesn't reflect the lives of minority Britons"". The 258-page report makes 24 recommendations which include: Extended school days to be phased in, starting with disadvantaged areas, to help pupils catch up on missed learning during the pandemic Children from disadvantaged backgrounds should have access to better quality careers advice in schools, funded by university outreach programmes More research is needed to examine why pupils perform well in certain communities, so this can be replicated to help all children succeed The acronym BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) should no longer be used because differences between groups are as important as what they have in common Organisations should stop funding unconscious bias training, with government and experts developing resources to help advance workplace equality Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the commission had ""chosen to deny the experiences of black and minority ethnic workers"" who were ""far more likely"" than white workers to be in ""low-paid, insecure jobs"". She added they have been ""far more likely to be exposed to Covid infection and far more likely to die - because they are far more likely to be in frontline roles. ""This is institutional racism. And it traps too many black and minority ethnic workers in poverty, insecurity and low pay."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he felt ""disappointed"" with what he had seen of the report's findings so far, insisting there were ""structural"" issues that needed to be addressed. Speaking on a visit to Leeds, he told reporters that whilst there was ""an acknowledgement of the problems, the issues, the challenges that face many black and minority ethnic communities"" there was also ""a reluctance to accept that that's structural"". The report had been due to be published last year but waspushed back until 2021, with the commission blaming Covid restrictions and the large number of responses from the public for the delay. The Race Disparity Audit, published by then Prime Minister Theresa May in 2017, showed inequalities between ethnicities in educational attainment, health, employment and treatment by police and the courts The 2017Lammy Reviewfound evidence of bias and discrimination against people from ethnic minority backgrounds in the justice system in England and Wales Also in 2017,the McGregor-Smith Reviewof race in the workplace found people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were still disadvantaged at work and faced lower employment rates than their white counterparts Anindependent review of the Windrush scandal, published in March, found the Home Office showed ""institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race"" SLEEP AND COVID:How do stressful situations affect our dreams?

Campaigners criticise 'deeply cynical' race report,"A government-commissioned report which found that the UK ""no longer"" had a system rigged against minorities has been accused of ignoring black and ethnic minority people's concerns. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on how people's lives turned out. Campaigners said it laid the blame for inequality on individuals and families. And Labour has accused the government of downplaying institutional racism. The commission was set up after Black Lives Matter (BLM) anti-racism protests across the country last summer - triggered by the killing of George Floyd in the US. But its report has been was met with criticism from campaigners. Jabeer Butt, chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, said: ""The report seems to go out of its way to deny that there's anything that's been the result of policies we've put in place and instead puts the blame at individuals' decisions or at family's doors."" The GMB's national officer Rehana Azam said it ""feels like a deeply cynical report"", calling it ""completely irresponsible and immoral"" and accusing it of ignoring black and ethnic minority workers' concerns. Boris Johnson said the government would consider the implications of the report's recommendations for future policy and remained ""fully committed to building a fairer Britain"". Race report risks deepening distrust and division Key points: What does the race report say? 'You can't tell victims what racism is' Thecommission's 258-page report concluded,externalthat the UK is not yet a ""post-racial country"" - but its success in removing race-based disparity in education and, to a lesser extent, the economy, ""should be regarded as a model for other white-majority countries"". In his foreword to the report chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, said while the ""impediments and disparities do exist"", it continued, they were ""varied and ironically very few of them are directly to do with racism"". Black Lives Matter UKtweeted,externalthat it was ""disappointed"" that the report overlooked disproportionality in the criminal justice system. Black people in England and Wales are nine times more likely to be imprisoned than their white peers, it said. The report thanked the ""mainly young people"" behind the BLM movement for putting the focus on race but said progress could not be achieved by ""cleaving to a fatalistic account that insists nothing has changed"". Among the main findings of the report were: Children from minority ethnic communities did as well or better than white pupils in compulsory education, with black Caribbean pupils the only group to perform less well This success in education has ""transformed British society over the last 50 years into one offering far greater opportunities for all"" The pay gap between all ethnic minorities and the white majority population had shrunk to 2.3% overall and was barely significant for employees under 30 Diversity has increased in professions such as law and medicine But some communities continue to be ""haunted"" by historic racism, which is creating ""deep mistrust"" and could be a barrier to success Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova labelled the report a ""divisive polemic"" that downplayed institutional racism. Her colleague David Lammy, who led areview on racial bias in the justice system, tweeted that Britain's black community was being ""gaslighted"" and said he was ""tired of the endless debate about whether structural racism exists with little desire to actually address it"". Institutional racism was defined in the Macpherson report,commissioned after Stephen Lawrence's murder, as ""the collective failure of an organisation to provide the appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin"". Commission member Samir Shah, chief executive of a TV production company, said the commission did not believe there was no institutional racism in Britain but said the term had become ""divisive"". Racism was only one of the factors which caused disparities between ethnic groups, he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""People do have choices, they do have agency, it's not always that they're just victims of some miasmic racism that's in the air,"" he said. When setting up the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities during the Black Lives Matter protests last summer, Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""change the narrative, so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination"". But reaching a settled view on the question of racism in the UK was always going to be a struggle. Critics were concerned by the prime minister's assertion that he wanted ""to look very carefully at the real racism and discrimination that people face"". There was further unease among anti-racism groups at the reported involvement of Number 10 policy advisor Munira Mirza, because she had previously written of how institutional racism was ""a perception more than a reality"". The appointment of Tony Sewell to lead the inquiry once again disappointed anti-racism activists. One London-based organisation, Monitoring Group, considered seeking a judicial review to prevent his selection on the grounds that he had ""a longstanding record of public statements rejecting or minimising"" the impact of institutional racism in Britain. The accusation that this report is the result of a hand-picked committee, designed to say what ministers wanted to hear, will have some traction, whatever the commission and the government insist about its independence.

The commission said unemployment differences between ethnic groups had declined and the pay gap between ethnic minority workers and white workers was also falling and at its lowest level for almost a decade. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said ""institutional and structural racism exists in the UK, in both the labour market and wider society"", and said black and minority ethnic workers were far more likely ""to be in low-paid, insecure jobs"" compared to white workers. Prof Kehinde Andrews, a professor of black studies at Birmingham City University told BBC news the report was ""not a genuine attempt to understand racism in Britain"" or ""make a substantive change"". He said the fact there was a discussion over whether institutional racism existed was the problem, ""because it does exist, it clearly exists and the question should be 'how do we address this'"". Liberal Democrat equalities spokeswoman Wera Hobhouse said the report must not be used as an excuse to continue ""shameful inaction"" on issues of racial injustice. She called for an end to ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and the ""disproportionate"" use of police stop and search tactics. The commission found not enough information was given to the public about why police used stop and search, saying the focus was on drugs rather than knife offences. This video can not be played Institutional racism has become a 'catch-all phrase', Tony Sewell says In its recommendations, the commission also called for the term BAME, which stands for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic, to be dropped, calling it ""unhelpful"" and ""imprecise and often misleading"". Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a member of the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, said the report was not denying institutional racism existed but said the commission had not discovered evidence of it in the areas it had looked. Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said she ""warmly welcomed"" the report and was impressed by the analysis within the report, but added she was ""looking forward to understanding fully"" the issues that had been raised and ""what can be done"" to address them.

""That's not to say there aren't instances of racism that of course exist in this country,"" he told ITV. ""But if I think about the things that happened to me when I was a kid, I can't imagine those things happening to me now."" The report's 24 recommendations included: Extended school days to be phased in, starting with disadvantaged areas, to help pupils catch up on missed learning during the pandemic Children from disadvantaged backgrounds should have access to better quality careers advice in schools, funded by university outreach programmes More research is needed to examine why pupils perform well in certain communities, so this can be replicated to help all children succeed Organisations should stop funding unconscious bias training, with government and experts developing resources to help advance workplace equality SLEEP AND COVID:How do stressful situations affect our dreams?

'One who causes fear' dinosaur found in Argentina,"An artist's impression of Llukalkan aliocranianus Scientists in southern Argentina have found the skull of a large meat-eating dinosaur named ""one who causes fear"" in the local Mapuche language. The horned Llukalkan aliocranianus was around 5 metres (16 feet) long and roamed South America 85 million years ago. Researchers found remains nearby of another carnivorous dinosaur, something they said was highly unusual. The findings from Patagonia were published on Tuesday. Like the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Llukalkan dinosaur was two-legged with very short arms, but was medium-sized compared to the giant T. rex. It also had short horns and tiny fingers. It was estimated to weigh between one and five tonnes, slightly lighter than an adult African elephant. It was probably a fearsome predator, with a large skull and a strong bite, according to the research published in theJournal of Vertebrate Paleontology.,external The findings suggest it had better hearing than other dinosaurs in the abelisaurids family which likely made it a better hunter, Federico Gianechini, a palaeontologist at the National University of San Luis Argentina told Reuters news agency. It lived on earth during the Cretaceous period, the last era before dinosaurs were wiped out. Close to Llukalkhan's skull, scientist found the fossilised remains of a slightly larger meat-eating dinosaur called Viavenator exxoni. Tyrannosaurus species named 'Reaper of Death' found in Canada Boy, 12, discovers rare dinosaur skeleton New dinosaur discovered in Australia Mr Gianechini said it is very unusual to find two abelisaurids living close together at the same time. ""Llukalkan was a little smaller than Viavenator, although, if they lived together, they surely shared the same ecological niche and fed on the same prey, so they would have competed with each other and - why not - even eaten each other,"" he told Reuters. A series of important dinosaur discoveries have been made in Argentina in recent decades. In 2014 the remains of a dinosaur that weighed around the same as 14 elephants were found - it was thought to be the biggest ever discovered.

"Police uncertain missing woman was onboard yachtSarm Heslop, who had been staying on a boat off the US Virgin Islands, vanished three weeks ago.Hampshire & Isle of Wight","Sarm Heslop's friends have said she had been staying aboard Siren Song, off the coast of the island of St John, for a couple of weeks Police have said they are unsure if a British woman reported missing from a yacht in the Caribbean was onboard.

Naga Munchetty: Itâs time to talk about race,"The killing of George Floyd last year triggered a national debate about racial injustice not just in the US, but in the UK, too. Naga Munchetty travelled across the UK to understand what race and racism means today. I have experienced racism. You never forget the first time you hear that painful and distressing word. I was seven, when someone I thought was a friend at school, told me we could no longer hang out. They used the P-word, making clear the reason was because of the colour of my skin The sense of shame was overwhelming. I was told I didn't belong when up until then I assumed I did. From that moment I knew I was seen as different. That first hurt never goes away. I grew up in south London. My dad was from Mauritius and my mum was from India. Both were nurses. They too received racial insults at work, including the P-word. News events last year catapulted the subject of race into many conversations people were having. Whether you attended, agreed with, or condemned the Black Lives Matter protests - I imagine a conversation in your social group or your home, took place about race, regardless of the colour of your skin. The death of George Floyd, after being restrained by US police, led to Black Lives Matter protests across the world. In the UK, thousands took to the streets in the biggest anti-racism protests for decades. In Bristol, a statue of slave trader Edward Colston, which was prominent in the city for more than 125 years, was pulled down. Protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement continued for months. Corey went along to a BLM protest in Bristol Twenty-year-old Corey, who was born and raised in Bristol, went along to a BLM protest. He's a semi-professional basketball player who told me that he doesn't ""feel that comfortable as a black man in our society"". When I asked him why, he said because he cannot show all of his personality outside his home. He has been brought up not to be too loud, or too passionate, or come across as intimidating. Since he was small, his father Vernon - who represented Great Britain at the 1988 Olympic Games and was a member of the Gospel choir which sang at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018 - told him that he needed to be more aware than his non-black friends, about how he is perceived at school or out in public. Vernon before performing with the Kingdom choir at the wedding of Meghan and Harry Corey says his dad told him that the rules were not going to be the same for him. ""The reality is we live in a time and place which like it or not, isn't equitable in terms of how races are perceived,"" Vernon explains. He never wants his son to be stereotyped as an angry black man, or as someone with a chip on their shoulder.  He acknowledges it is sad that he has to have a conversation with his son asking him not to draw attention to himself. It's not one he thinks a white father would have to have with his child. Corey understands that he and his brother Taylor can't show everything of themselves. I understand that, and I don't like the fact that I've lived by those rules too. It hurts Vernon to see that his sons have had to do the same thing. Corey doesn't feel that racism today is as bad as when his grandmother first came to the UK from Jamaica. Still, he thinks that ""things are not where they need to be"". You can watch Naga'sPanoramaprogramme on Monday 8 March at 19:00 GMT on BBC One, or afterwards on BBC iPlayer. Corey's grandmother Hermie was part of the Windrush generation, many of whom faced a hostile reception in the UK in the early 1960s. It was while working as a nurse for the NHS shortly after she arrived that she experienced blatant racism for the first time. A patient told her while she was trying to clean her, ""Don't touch me, you black creature."" She has never forgotten that. Hermie today, and as a nurse working for the NHS When I asked her if she was surprised that her grandchildren still see evidence of racism 60 years later, her resigned response was, ""It's as though nothing's changed"". She constantly reminds her grandchildren that they have to be ""twice as good as [their] white counterpart"". Many families of colour have been having these conversations - for them, it's an everyday consideration. I also met Jason, a black man born and raised in east London. He remembers his mum being chased by the National Front and shot with a pellet gun in her leg. He says she still has a scar. He tells me that the racism he experiences today is different, not as overt or blatant, but more under the surface, and no better. ""There's no way you can feel or live my life unless you have that shade of skin."" Like Vernon, he is preparing his son for life as a black male in Britain. Jason first began to talk to Ezra about how to behave outside the home, when he was just nine years old. Ezra, Frankie and Jason Jason tells Ezra, who is now 14, not to wear all-black clothing. That way it's harder for him to match a generic description and be stopped by the police. If Ezra is stopped by the police, Jason has prepared him for how to behave. Ezra tells me what he has been taught - ""Just be respectful, keep composed"". He adds that he knows he will be stopped eventually, ""because of the colour of my skin"". Jason thinks Ezra will eventually have to have similar conversations with his son when the time comes. ""Unfortunately he will,"" he tells me. When I asked Jason what he would like to see change - his answer was simple: ""Let me speak first, then judge me. Don't judge me before I speak."" Why should anyone ask for that in 2021? Jason's sister Frankie, 33, is a receptionist. She spoke to me about the kind of racism she experiences. Frankie ""I think the worst one for me is getting me confused with another black receptionist, or not even another black receptionist, but just another black colleague that doesn't even actually work in my department. ""We might not even look the same. We might not even have the same hair texture or anything like that. But we're all black. ""It is humiliating. It's horrible. It's absolutely horrible."" This type of covert racism isn't uncommon but it's difficult to prove, says Professor Kalwant Bhopal, director of the Centre for Research in Race and Education at the University of Birmingham. ""It can take the form of individuals not given eye contact. Black and minority ethnic people not even being asked their opinion. People pushing in front of you in a queue,"" she says. Despite Frankie's experiences, she also told me about how she believes it is important for the young black women she mentors to not hide their identities in order to fit in, and their lives should be celebrated not compromised. I questioned why these conversations need to take place in the 21st Century. She said: ""I may not be experiencing racism in the same [way] as my mum, I think it has changed, but it's a really slow change."" Everyday racism isn't obvious and it's hard to explain. It's like when someone asks you, ""Where are you really from?"" That's telling. It makes me feel that I'm the other, that I don't belong. If I call it out, I'm being difficult. It chips away at you. Stephen lives in Blyth, Northumberland, which is 98% white. He told me that he followed the Black Lives Matter protests and understands the raw emotions around police brutality. As I sat by the harbour with the warehouse worker and his dad John, a retired mining engineer, he said he supported the right for people to protest - but he was concerned when some elements turned violent, and caused criminal damage. He then found it difficult to carry on backing the movement. Stephen says people need to challenge the way they think John said until this year, he never thought about race, and had never had a conversation with anyone about racism other than with his son. He says that's because it's something that has never touched his life. Unemployment is 7% in Blyth, higher than the national average. John has concerns that the push for diversity after the Black Live Matter protests could impact jobs. He's worried if the government were to introduce quotas for apprenticeships that would mean ""you've got to have a certain colour skin. Is that the way forward?"" While some companies do have diversity targets, it's against the law to hire a less suitable candidate just because of the colour of their skin. Steve admits he knows people with racist views, and that makes him cringe, and sometimes upset. He says people need to challenge their thought processes - it's something he does himself. ""It's about exploring different viewpoints."" Usman helps local students with interview techniques Alum Rock is one of the most deprived parts of Birmingham. Almost 60% of those living there are of Pakistani heritage Usman works as a GP there. His grandfather arrived in the 1960s and worked as a road digger. Usman knows that his grandfather experienced racism, but believes things have moved in the right direction. ""Have they moved quick enough? No,"" he says. ""Do they need to continue to move in the right direction and faster? Yes."" He helps young people in his area by giving interview tips to some local students. ""You can accept that you may not have the same opportunities that other people have, but you can either be miserable and say, 'I'm not working from a level playing field' or you can say, 'I'm going to do something about it,' and that's why we're here to try and help."" Asian students I met in Birmingham told me they are proud of being British and of their heritage - wearing traditional clothes with pride and not embarrassed that their home lives are different from White-British students. One student, Zahnab, told me: ""I think over the years I have accepted my culture. I realise that I'm always probably going to be different. One day I might come in and smell of my mum's curry - I just embrace it."" I remember being paranoid about smelling of the curries my mum cooked when I was at school. That's something I had conveniently forgotten until I spoke to the students. I was heartened to see that they have no sense of that embarrassment. They say to me: ""My food smells good, of course my clothes may smell a bit of it, but what's to be ashamed of?"" I know what it's like to hide parts of my whole self, to play down my Asian heritage - It's difficult to acknowledge that I've done it, and hard to admit. Since I was young, I felt I needed to, so that I fitted-in more easily. The conversations I have been part of have been honest and sometimes painful. People opened up about race and racism, and voiced their fears and frustrations. It feels different to the way I've heard people talk about it before. Maybe that's a start.

Political crisis and Covid surge rock Brazil,"Jair Bolsonaro is facing the biggest crisis since he came to power on 1 January 2019 Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro is facing the biggest crisis of his presidency after the heads of the army, navy and air force all quit and the country recorded its highest daily Covid-19 death toll. The unprecedented resignation of the defence chiefs is being seen as a protest at attempts by Mr Bolsonaro to exert undue control over the military. Mr Bolsonaro's popularity has plummeted over his response to Covid-19. Nearly 314,000 people have died, with a new daily record of 3,780 on Tuesday. Worldwide, Brazil has the second highest number of total confirmed Covid cases with more than 12.6m. Only the United States has more. It is also the country with the second highest number of Covid-related deaths since the pandemic began and its daily deaths currently account for about a quarter of all coronavirus fatalities in the entire world. The high number of cases has brought the health system to the verge of collapse. In 18 of Brazil's 26 states and in the capital, Brasilia, the occupancy of intensive care units (ICU) is above 90%, according to Brazilian public health institute Fiocruz. In two states, AmapÃ¡ and Mato Grosso do Sul, ICU are completely full. The latest surge in cases and deaths has been attributed to the spread of a highly contagious variant of the virus which was first detected in Japan in travellers from the city of Manaus, in Brazil's Amazon state. What is the Brazil variant and do vaccines work against it? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Preliminary data suggests the new variant could be up to twice as transmittable as the original version of the virus. Neighbouring countries are extremely worried the new variant. Bolivia, which shares a 3,400km-long (2,100 miles) border with Brazil, announced that it would focus its Covid immunisation programme on the border areas. This video can not be played One epidemiologist in Brazil fears the country is ""becoming a threat to global public health"" Brazil's own vaccine programme has been beset by delays. So far, only 8% of its 211-million-strong population have received a first dose. According to a poll published by Datafolha in mid-March, 43% of Brazilians blame President Bolsonaro for the poor handling of the pandemic. Opponents of Mr Bolsonaro demand that he be impeached over his handling of the coronavirus crisis The far-right leader has consistently opposed lockdown measures, arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the coronavirus itself. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. While his stance made him popular with anti-lockdown protesters, his popularity is falling. In a poll conducted in mid-March, 54% of respondents said his management of the Covid crisis was ""bad"" or ""very bad"", up from 48% in January. Mr Bolsonaro was a divisive figure even before the pandemic hit and the rapid spread of Covid seems to have further hardened opinions. The Datafolha poll suggests that while the percentage of those who said they ""never trusted"" the president's words rose from 41% to 45% between January and March, those who say they ""always trust"" what has only dropped slightly from 19% to 18% in that same timeframe. However in recent days, his government has been furthered weakened by a deep political crisis. Since the pandemic began, Brazil has had no fewer than four health ministers. The latest is Marcelo Queiroga, a cardiologist, who replaced an army officer with no medical training on 16 March. But while changes in the health ministry have become almost par for the course, this week also saw the foreign minister and five other cabinet ministers leave. Foreign Minister Ernesto AraÃºjo had fallen foul of Congress, some of whose members accused him of mishandling relations with China, India and the US, which they said in turn led to Brazil not getting enough Covid vaccines from those countries. But it was Mr Bolsonaro's sacking of the defence minister, Fernando Azevedo e Silva, which caused the biggest storm so far. Mr Bolsonaro and his minister had clashed over the issue of the armed forces' loyalty, which the defence minister said should be directed to upholding the constitution rather than supporting the president personally. In a first in Brazilian history, on Tuesday the heads of the army, navy and air force all resigned together in a move signalling their opposition to the president and his sudden sacking of the defence minister's sacking. The role of the armed forces in Brazilian politics has been a contentious issue since the country's return to democracy in 1985 after 21 years of military rule. Gen Braga Netto is the new defence minister President Bolsonaro, a former army captain, caused outrage in 2019 when he organised a commemoration of the 1964 coup which brought the military to power. He also appointed active duty and retired generals to key positions in his cabinet, including the health ministry and the vice-presidency. But in recent weeks, top members of the military seem to have increasingly distanced themselves from the president, culminating in the resignation of the armed forces heads on Tuesday. Mr Bolsonaro's newly appointed minister of defence, Gen Walter Braga Netto, seems to be more closely aligned with the president. In one of his first statements he said that the 1964 coup had ""pacified the country"" and should be celebrated. Marking the coup's anniversary on 31 March, the general said that there had been a ""very real threat to peace and democracy"" and that the armed forces had confronted that threat in 1964.

Italian officer 'caught selling secrets to Russia',"Carabinieri military police arrested the two men on Tuesday night (file pic) An Italian navy officer has been arrested after being caught in the act of handing secret documents to a Russian military official, police say. The men were stopped by military police on suspicion of serious crimes relating to espionage and state security. The Russian, who reportedly worked at the Russian embassy in Italy, is expected to be expelled. The foreign ministry in Rome summoned Russia's ambassador Sergey Razov and then expelled two Russian officials. Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the pair were ""involved in this extremely serious affair"". The Italian officer was identified as a navy frigate captain working in the office of Chief of the Defence Staff. The Kremlin said it hoped the ""very positive and constructive nature of Russian-Italian relations will continue"" but Russia's foreign ministry is expected to respond to the expulsions. The carabinieri del Ros special operations group swooped on the men in Rome on Tuesday evening ""during a clandestine meeting between the two,"" a police statement said. They were ""caught immediately after the transfer of a document by the Italian officer in exchange for a sum of money"", it added. Italian media reported that the exchange had taken place in a car park and involved â¬5,000 (Â£4,250; $5,900) in cash. While the navy captain was arrested, Italian police said the Russian officer's diplomatic status was currently being assessed. Russian ambassador Sergey Razov was summoned to the Italian foreign ministry over the spying affair Italy's Corriere website reports that papers seized in the naval officer's flat suggest he may have passed on Nato secrets, thereby placing other countries' national security at risk. According to the Ansa news agency, the documents involved military communications. The Russian embassy confirmed the involvement of a military attachÃ© official but said any further comment was inappropriate. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""we don't have information about the reasons for or the circumstances of this detention"". The foreign ministry in Moscow told Ansa that it regretted the expulsions of two embassy staff and would make a further announcement on possible steps in response. It has the makings of a Cold War thriller: the Italian naval captain handing top-secret files, including Nato documents, to a Russian military attachÃ© for the princely sum of â¬5,000; the two caught red-handed as police burst in; an arrest, diplomatic expulsions; the risk of 15 years in prisonâ¦ But beyond the drama, the story will add to concerns that Italy has become somewhat of a back door for illicit Russian activity in the EU. Rome is one of the more Moscow-friendly members. In 2019, an Italian and Russian were arrested for colluding to steal trade secrets from an American aviation company. Prosecutors are investigating whether Russians tried to siphon funds to the League party of Matteo Salvini. And when the coronavirus pandemic exploded in Italy last year and the EU was slow to help, Moscow despatched supplies under the banner ""From Russia with Love"" - an operation that some here believed raised security fears given the large number of military officers sent in. Police moved in following a lengthy operation by Italy's Aisi domestic intelligence agency. Italian media are describing the incident as the most serious since the Cold War. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter thatthe UK stood in solidarity with Italy,externalin ""exposing and taking action against Russia's malign and destabilising activity that is designed to undermine our Nato ally"". 'It takes one to know one' - Putin on Biden Relations between Moscow and Nato have deteriorated since Russia seized and annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. The poisoning of leading Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, now being held in a Russian penal colony, has also led to a decline. When US President Joe Biden said this month that he considered Russia's Vladimir Putin ""a killer"", the foreign ministry in Moscow demanded an explanation and Mr Putin retorted that ""it takes one to know one"".

Police uncertain missing woman was onboard yacht,"Sarm Heslop's friends have said she had been staying aboard Siren Song, off the coast of the island of St John, for a couple of weeks Police have said they are unsure if a British woman reported missing from a yacht in the Caribbean was onboard. Sarm Heslop, 41, from Southampton, had been staying with her boyfriend, US citizen Ryan Bane, on the boat moored off St John in the US Virgin Islands. Mr Bane reported her missing from the boat at 02:30 local time on 8 March. Virgin Islands Police Department said: ""Investigators cannot confirm with certainty, if and when Ms Heslop boarded the Siren Song on March 7."" Searches around the coast of St John in the US Virgin Islands have been taking place since she vanished Miss Heslop, a former flight attendant, is known to have gone for dinner with Mr Bane on Sunday, 7 March in St John. It was understood she had returned to the yacht and gone to bed. Her possessions, including her bank cards and mobile phone, were still onboard when she vanished. Responding to reports in the media that Mr Bane had sailed away from the area, Virgin Islands Police Department (VIPD) spokesman Toby Derima said: ""To the knowledge of investigators, Mr Bane remains in the Territory."" He added: ""His whereabouts are known by law enforcement."" Friends of the former flight attendant said they were ""hugely grateful"" that UK police were involved in the probe VIPD said the investigation into Ms Heslop's disappearance was being assisted by the FBI and police in the UK, who were ""finding and interviewing witnesses"". The force added searches for Ms Heslop on St John and nearby St Thomas were ongoing. Friends of Ms Heslop in the UK said they were ""hugely grateful"" that UK police were involved. They also thanked those still scouring the island for her.

'Don't blow it' warning over sunshine gatherings,"Thousands gathered on Brighton beach on Tuesday, staying late into the night As the UK enjoyed the hottest March day in half a century, thousands gathered to enjoy the weather in outdoor spaces, prompting social distancing concerns. Parks in Birmingham and Leeds as well as Brighton beach were busy on Tuesday evening.Two parks in Nottingham are now shut after ""frightening"" scenes. Heath Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted to say ""don't blow it"" - urging people to enjoy the warm weather safely. A Birmingham resident said scenes at a city park ""looked like a festival"". Crowds gathered to enjoy the sunshine on Woodhouse Moor in Leeds People at Platt Fields Park in Fallowfield, Manchester, were seen breaching the rule of six ""When I see the pictures I do get anxious,"" Prof Sian Griffiths, a senior public health official, told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""If we're not in a household bubble we need to be two metres apart and I don't think those pictures look like that's happening."" Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen branded the scenes in Nottingham on Monday as ""frightening"" andhas now closed two of the city's parks in response. ""We regret having to take this action, since everyone has been looking forward to the chance to visit our parks, now that easing of restrictions means we can meet up to six other people outdoors,"" he said. ""Sadly, the actions of a thoughtless minority has spoilt that. We will keep the situation under review and hope to reopen parks as soon as possible."" Allow Twitter content?

In Birmingham, thousands gathered at Holders Lane playing fields, in Moseley, with taxis doing multiple drop-offs from about 20:00 BST. The BBC understands a party had been arranged earlier in the day via social media and at the time there was no police presence. A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said scenes like this in Moseley were ""not unique"" to Birmingham Flyers were also shared on social media regarding another gathering for students in the city's Cannon Hill Park, which is linked to the playing fields. West Midlands Police said officers had been sent there but ""did not need to issue any fines"". ""Officers initially found no breaches of coronavirus legislation, with people enjoying the weather in small, individual groups,"" Supt Farooq Sheikh said. ""The crowds were good-natured and engaged with officers and the park was all clear by 23:30."" This video can not be played Crowds gather to watch pair boxing Police said gatherings in Birmingham were ""small"" but locals likened Cannon Hill Park to a festival However Adam Jones, who lives nearby, said the park ""looked like a festival"" on Tuesday evening. ""While there were a fair few people in small groups respecting distancing, they were overshadowed by lots of big groups, sometimes up to 20 to 25 people, blaring music,"" the 27-year-old said. Thousands of revellers on Brighton beach danced into the night as fire performers drew large crowds as the sun went down. Some were photographed flouting the rule of six and social distancing guidelines. Merseyside Police made the decision to impose a dispersal order on Formby beach following reports of anti-social behaviour. The force said it was in response to ""youths gathering on the beach and dunes"" and would remain in place until 19:00 on Thursday. Allow Twitter content?

Essex Police also enforced a dispersal order in Leigh-on-Sea afterreports of a large group of people congregating at a seafrontand behaving anti-socially. Meanwhile in Newquay, Cornwall,more than 100 people were found gatheringand setting fires in protected sand dunes. The remnants of gatherings have also been recorded by local group Friends of Fistral Dunes, which found this fire earlier in March Newquay Community Fire Station was called overnight to dunes by Fistral beach twice this week. Multiple groups were found burning rubbish and a skip was on fire because of ""inappropriately"" discarded disposable barbecues, the station said. Fire performers drew crowds as night fell on Brighton beach Last summer when thousands flocked to Bournemouth beach, in Dorset, for one of 2020's warmest weekends, a spike in the number of coronavirus cases was predicted but never materialised. Evidence suggested crowds on the beach did not significantly spread the virus. However, Prof Griffiths said there was still a risk and people should not be complacent. Bournemouth beach was less crowded on Tuesday, as people enjoyed the sun ""If you were carrying one of the variants we'd see a different picture,"" she said. ""This is all about reducing risk - yes the risk of passing the disease on outside is much lower than if you're inside, but it's still there."" By Dr David Gregory-Kumar, BBC Midlands Today science correspondent If you've been obeying the rules then pictures of people out partying in a local park probably rub you up the wrong way. Plenty of people are ready to blame thoughtless behaviour, particularly by the young, for any rise in infection rates. The scientific truth though is that a gathering outdoors is very low risk. Scenes of Britons heading to beaches or to hills as lockdowns were lifted in the past have not been followed by more people ending up in local hospitals. Outdoors, the airborne coronavirus quickly blows away and so the danger of infection is small. While what happened yesterday in our parks is against the rules, it likely won't cause problems long term, at least as far as Covid is concerned. It's worth contrasting these outdoor parties with events like Cheltenham Races in 2020. Cheltenham may have been an outdoors event but it also went hand in hand with packed public transport, bars and pubs. Now that was an event that many suspect did cause infection rates to increase. Since Monday,two households or groups of up to six people have been able to meet outside in Englandas the stay-at-home Covid restrictions order came to an end. ""Despite today's easements,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at the time, ""everyone must continue to stick to the rules."" The government also unveiled a new slogan - Hands, Face, Space and Fresh Air - to emphasise the importance of ventilation in reducing the spread of the virus. ""It's your behaviours while you're [outside],"" Prof Griffiths said. ""We just have to think about the risk of the virus and adapt our behaviours."" Londoners gathered on Primrose Hill to enjoy Tuesday's warm weather One of the other concerns to follow the gatherings was the ""masses"" of litter left behind in parks. Rebecca Langton, a Nottingham City councillor, said rubbish left behind in the city's outdoor spaces was ""really disappointing"". This video can not be played Footage shows hundreds descend on Nottingham park as restrictions ease ""We've spent a good couple of hours this morning cleaning up masses and masses of litter,"" she said. ""We want people to get out and enjoy the parks but it's just about people being responsible."" The BBC's Tom Airey was at Woodhouse Moor, in Leeds, as the aftermath of Tuesday's crowds was laid bare and said there was ""a sea of rubbish stretching across the park's gentle slopes"". Temperatures will rise again in Leeds on Wednesday, prompting concerns of similar scenes later The first Leeds City Council workers to arrive had already filled four hay bale-sized bags of litter by 10:00, collecting glass beer bottles, crisp packets, discarded bags-for-life, used disposable barbecues and nitrous oxide canisters. This was all despite multiple 'no litter' signs along the park's tree-lined paths. ""It's really disgusting that people left their litter piled up by the bins and across the grass, and it's an issue that happens every time there's a hot day in Leeds,"" 26-year-old student Sophie Meredith said. ""Today was the worst I've ever seen it, and it's probably made worse by the fact that everyone's been cooped up for a year.""

The waste left behind at Birmingham's parks also meant the city council there had to suspend planned grass-cutting so workers could focus on removing litter.

The cost of speaking up against China,"Women who made allegations last month of rape and sexual abuse in Chinese detention camps have been harassed and smeared in the weeks since. Rights groups say the attacks are typical of an aggressive campaign by China to silence those who speak up. Qelbinur Sedik at her home in the Netherlands this week Qelbinur Sedik was making breakfast when the video call came, and the sight of her sister's name made her nervous. Many months had passed since the two had spoken. In fact, many months had passed since Sedik had spoken to any of her family in China. Sedik was in the kitchen of her temporary home in the Netherlands, where she shared a room with several other refugees, mostly from Africa. Two weeks earlier, she and three other women had spoken to the BBC for a story aboutalleged rape and torturein China's secretive detention camps in the Xinjiang region, where Sedik worked as a camp teacher. Now her sister was calling. She hit answer, but when the picture appeared it wasn't her sister on the screen, it was a policeman from her hometown in Xinjiang. ""What are you up to Qelbinur?"" he said, smiling. ""Who are you with?"" This was not the first time the officer had called from her sister's phone. This time, Sedik took a screenshot. When he heard the sound it made, the officer removed his numbered police jacket, Sedik said. She took another screenshot. In conversations with the BBC over the past few weeks, 22 people who have left Xinjiang to live abroad described a pattern of threats, harassment, and public character attacks they said were designed to deter them from speaking out about alleged human rights abuses back home. According to UN estimates, China has detained more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims in camps in Xinjiang. The Chinese state has been accused of an array of abuses there including forced labour, sterilisation, torture, rape, and genocide. China denies those charges, saying its camps are ""re-education"" facilities for combatting terrorism. Among the few who have fled Xinjiang and spoken publicly, many have received a call like the one to Sedik that morning - from a police officer or government official at their family home, or from a relative summoned to a police station. Sometimes the calls contain vague advice to consider the welfare of their family in Xinjiang, sometimes direct threats to detain and punish relatives. Others have been publicly smeared in press conferences or state media videos; or been subjected to barrages of messages or hacking attempts directed at their phones. (Last week, Facebook said that it had discovered""an extremely targeted operation""emanating from China to hack Uyghur activists abroad.) Some of those who spoke to the BBC - from the US, UK, Australia, Norway, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, and Turkey - provided screenshots of threatening WhatsApp, WeChat and Facebook messages; others described in detail what had been said in phone and video calls. Everyone described some form of detention or harassment of their family members in Xinjiang by local police or state security officials. A gate of what is officially known as a ""vocational skills education centre"" in Xinjiang When Qelbinur Sedik recounted the call from the policeman that morning, via her sister's phone, she buried her head in her hands and wept. ""He said, 'You must bear in mind that all your family and relatives are with us. You must think very carefully about that fact.' ""He stressed that several times, then he said, 'You have been living abroad for some time now, you must have a lot of friends. Can you give us their names?' When she refused, the officer put Sedik's sister on the call, she said, and her sister shouted at her, 'Shut up! You should shut up from now on!', followed by a string of insults. ""At that point I couldn't control my emotions,"" Sedik said. ""My tears flowed."" Before the officer hung up, Sedik said, he told her several times to go to the Chinese embassy so the staff there could arrange her safe passage back to China - a common instruction in these kinds of calls. ""This country opens its arms to you,"" he said. Reports of this type of intimidation are not new, but Uyghur activists say China has become more aggressive in response to growing outrage over alleged rights abuses in Xinjiang. The Chinese government has gone on the attack in public in recent weeks, directing a slew of misogynistic abuse specifically at women who have spoken up about alleged sexual assaults. At recent press conferences, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin and Xinjiang official Xu Guixiang held up pictures of women who gave first-hand accounts of sexual abuse in detention camps and called them ""liars""; said one was ""morally depraved"" and of ""inferior character""; and accused another of adultery. One woman was branded a ""bitch of bad moral quality"" by a former husband in what appeared to be a staged video put out by state media; another was called a ""scumbag"" and ""child abuser"" by a Chinese official. Wang Wenbin holds up pictures of witnesses at a press conference in Beijing last month Wang, the foreign ministry spokesman, revealed what he said were private medical records, claiming that they disproved one woman's account of having an IUD forcibly fitted. Officials have also claimed that sexually transmitted diseases were responsible for fertility problems suffered by former camp detainees, rather than violent physical abuse, and put out a range of propaganda material calling the women ""actresses"". Tursunay Ziawudun, a former camp detainee who is now in the US, was one of the women attacked at a press conference. When she watched it, she was relieved Wang had not mentioned her family, she said, but ""deeply sad"" about the rest. Ziawudun haspreviously recounted being raped and torturedduring her detention in Xinjiang in 2018. ""After all the horrors they inflicted on me, how can they be so cruel and shameless as to attack me publicly?"" she said in a phone interview after the press conference. The attacks on Ziawudun and others showed that China was ""adopting misogyny as a style of public communication,"" said James Millward, a professor of Chinese history at Georgetown University. ""We have these various women coming forward and telling very credible stories about how they've been abused,"" he said. ""And the response shows a complete tone deafness and misunderstanding of how sexual assault and sexual trauma is  being understood and treated now. Besides being horrifying, it's also completely counterproductive for the Chinese state."" The Chinese embassy in London told the BBC that China stood by its assertions that the women's accounts of rape and sexual abuse were lies, and said it was reasonable to publicise private medical records as evidence. Tursunay Ziawudun at her new home in the US last month Two other women who spoke to the BBC have been the targets of what appear to be highly staged videos, published by Chinese state media, in which their family and friends insult them and accuse them of stealing money and telling lies. According to a report published last month by the US-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, China has produced at least 22 videos in which individuals are allegedly forced to make scripted statements, often denouncing their family members as liars or thieves. Aziz Isa Elkun, a Uyghur exile in the UK, had not been able to contact his elderly mother and sister for years when he saw them in a Chinese state media video calling him a liar and a shame on the family. Elkun's crime had been to draw attention to the destruction of Uyghur cemeteries in Xinjiang, including his father's tomb. ""You could tell what they were saying was scripted, but it was still extremely painful to see my elderly mother in a Chinese propaganda film,"" Elkun said. Qelbinur Sedik is worried a similar video of her husband could be released any day, she said. He told her on the phone late last year that Chinese officials had visited him at home in Xinjiang and forced him to recite lines calling her a liar. He said he struggled so much to say the lines correctly that it took four hours to film the short clip. Qelbinur Sedik recently moved out of refugee accommodation into a small home in the Netherlands Another common form of harassment described by those who spoke to the BBC was pressure to spy on fellow Uyghurs and organisations that scrutinise China, often in return for contact with family, guarantees of relatives' safety, or access to visas or passports. A Uyghur British citizen who did not want to be named said he was harassed repeatedly by intelligence officials during and after a visit to Xinjiang and told to spy on Uyghur groups and on Amnesty International, by joining the charity as a volunteer. When he refused, he received repeated calls from his brother pleading with him to do it, he said. Jevlan Shirmemmet, who left Xinjiang to study in Turkey, gave the BBC a recording of a call he received a few weeks after posting on social media about his family's mass arrest in Xinjiang. The caller, who said he was from the Chinese embassy in Ankara, told Shirmemmet to ""write down everyone you've been in contact with since you left Xinjiang,"" and send an email ""describing your activities,"" so that ""the mainland might reconsider your family's situation"". Another Uyghur in exile in Turkey described a similar call from the same embassy. Mustafa Aksu, a 34-year-old activist in the US who said his parents had been harassed in Xinjiang, showed the BBC text and voice messages from an old school friend - now a Chinese police officer - who Aksu said was pressuring him to provide information about Uyghur activists. ""He says, 'Maybe we can co-operate. I'm sure you must miss your parents.'"" Jevlan Shirmemmet has publicly protested for the release of his mother Not everyone feels that they can refuse these requests. ""When I say no, they get my younger brother and sister to call and tell me to do it,"" said a Uyghur student in Turkey, who provided screenshots of the messages from police. ""They could send my brother and sister to a concentration camp. What choice do I have?"" she said. Some have sought to protect themselves by gradually cutting off means of contact. ""You can throw away the phone and cancel the number,"" said Abdulweli Ayup, a Uyghur linguist in Norway, ""but you cancel your number and they contact you on Facebook; you delete Facebook and they contact you by email."" Others have tried beyond hope to stay in touch. A Uyghur exile in the Netherlands said she still sends pictures and emojis to her young son and parents, four years after her number was blocked. ""Maybe one day they will see,"" she said. The BBC was not able to independently verify the identities of the people behind the calls and messages provided by various interviewees, but Uyghur rights activists say efforts to coerce Uyghurs to spy for the Chinese government are common. ""It comes as an offer first - 'You won't have any more visa problems', or 'We can help your family' - that kind of thing,"" said Rahima Mahmut, a prominent UK-based Uyghur activist. ""Later it comes as a threat,"" she said. The UK Foreign Office told the BBC it was ""closely monitoring reports that members of the Uyghur diaspora in the UK have been harassed by the Chinese authorities"", and that it had ""raised our concerns directly with the Chinese embassy in London"". The Chinese embassy in London told the BBC that the allegations in this story were ""completely untrue"" and it was ""baffling that the BBC so readily believes whatever is said by a few 'East Turkestan' elements outside China"" - using another term for the Xinjiang region. Uyghur protesters in Istanbul last month. Uyghurs in Turkey fear they could be deported to China Despite the growing public outrage over alleged abuses in Xinjiang, the number of people who have spoken publicly remains vanishingly small compared with the estimated number detained. China has been tremendously successful at silencing people through fear, said Nury Turkel, a commissioner on the US Commission on International Religious Freedom. ""Millions of people have disappeared into the camps, and yet we have only a handful of Uyghurs speaking out against the detention of their loved ones,"" Turkel said. ""Why? Because they are afraid."" Some Uyghurs who have criticised China have managed to maintain limited contact with loved ones. Ferkat Jawdat, a prominent activist in the US, speaks to his mother regularly now, after campaigning publicly for her release from detention. She is under house arrest, and her calls are monitored, but she is there on the other end of the line. It can be hard to make sense of why some Uyghurs are harassed and others are not; some allowed contact with loved ones and others not. Some have speculated that China is ""A/B testing"" - trying to work out whether fear or kindness is more efficient. For the thousands who are cut off, it can feel ruthless and arbitrary. Jawdat knows that the likelihood of seeing his mother again before she dies is diminishing, so when they speak on the phone they speak carefully. He did tell her once that Chinese state media had put out a video of her saying she was ashamed of him. She said she knew, they had come to film it a few days earlier. ""How did I look?"" she joked. Then, taking a risk, she told him she was proud of him. ""It was the unscripted version,"" he said. Uighur camp detainees allege systematic rape Who are the Uyghurs? Â© 2025 BBC.

""We regret having to take this action, since everyone has been looking forward to the chance to visit our parks, now that easing of restrictions means we can meet up to six other people outdoors,"" he said. ""Sadly, the actions of a thoughtless minority has spoilt that. We will keep the situation under review and hope to reopen parks as soon as possible."" Allow Twitter content?

In Birmingham, thousands gathered at Holders Lane playing fields, in Moseley, with taxis doing multiple drop-offs from about 20:00 BST. The BBC understands a party had been arranged earlier in the day via social media and at the time there was no police presence. A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said scenes like this in Moseley were ""not unique"" to Birmingham Flyers were also shared on social media regarding another gathering for students in the city's Cannon Hill Park, which is linked to the playing fields. West Midlands Police said officers had been sent there but ""did not need to issue any fines"". ""Officers initially found no breaches of coronavirus legislation, with people enjoying the weather in small, individual groups,"" Supt Farooq Sheikh said. ""The crowds were good-natured and engaged with officers and the park was all clear by 23:30."" This video can not be played Crowds gather to watch pair boxing Police said gatherings in Birmingham were ""small"" but locals likened Cannon Hill Park to a festival However Adam Jones, who lives nearby, said the park ""looked like a festival"" on Tuesday evening. ""While there were a fair few people in small groups respecting distancing, they were overshadowed by lots of big groups, sometimes up to 20 to 25 people, blaring music,"" the 27-year-old said. Thousands of revellers on Brighton beach danced into the night as fire performers drew large crowds as the sun went down. Some were photographed flouting the rule of six and social distancing guidelines. Merseyside Police made the decision to impose a dispersal order on Formby beach following reports of anti-social behaviour. The force said it was in response to ""youths gathering on the beach and dunes"" and would remain in place until 19:00 on Thursday. Allow Twitter content?

Essex Police also enforced a dispersal order in Leigh-on-Sea afterreports of a large group of people congregating at a seafrontand behaving anti-socially. Meanwhile in Newquay, Cornwall,more than 100 people were found gatheringand setting fires in protected sand dunes. The remnants of gatherings have also been recorded by local group Friends of Fistral Dunes, which found this fire earlier in March Newquay Community Fire Station was called overnight to dunes by Fistral beach twice this week. Multiple groups were found burning rubbish and a skip was on fire because of ""inappropriately"" discarded disposable barbecues, the station said. Fire performers drew crowds as night fell on Brighton beach Last summer when thousands flocked to Bournemouth beach, in Dorset, for one of 2020's warmest weekends, a spike in the number of coronavirus cases was predicted but never materialised. Evidence suggested crowds on the beach did not significantly spread the virus. However, Prof Griffiths said there was still a risk and people should not be complacent. Bournemouth beach was less crowded on Tuesday, as people enjoyed the sun ""If you were carrying one of the variants we'd see a different picture,"" she said. ""This is all about reducing risk - yes the risk of passing the disease on outside is much lower than if you're inside, but it's still there."" By Dr David Gregory-Kumar, BBC Midlands Today science correspondent If you've been obeying the rules then pictures of people out partying in a local park probably rub you up the wrong way. Plenty of people are ready to blame thoughtless behaviour, particularly by the young, for any rise in infection rates. The scientific truth though is that a gathering outdoors is very low risk. Scenes of Britons heading to beaches or to hills as lockdowns were lifted in the past have not been followed by more people ending up in local hospitals. Outdoors, the airborne coronavirus quickly blows away and so the danger of infection is small. While what happened yesterday in our parks is against the rules, it likely won't cause problems long term, at least as far as Covid is concerned. It's worth contrasting these outdoor parties with events like Cheltenham Races in 2020. Cheltenham may have been an outdoors event but it also went hand in hand with packed public transport, bars and pubs. Now that was an event that many suspect did cause infection rates to increase. Since Monday,two households or groups of up to six people have been able to meet outside in Englandas the stay-at-home Covid restrictions order came to an end. ""Despite today's easements,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at the time, ""everyone must continue to stick to the rules."" The government also unveiled a new slogan - Hands, Face, Space and Fresh Air - to emphasise the importance of ventilation in reducing the spread of the virus. ""It's your behaviours while you're [outside],"" Prof Griffiths said. ""We just have to think about the risk of the virus and adapt our behaviours."" Londoners gathered on Primrose Hill to enjoy Tuesday's warm weather One of the other concerns to follow the gatherings was the ""masses"" of litter left behind in parks. Rebecca Langton, a Nottingham City councillor, said rubbish left behind in the city's outdoor spaces was ""really disappointing"". This video can not be played Footage shows hundreds descend on Nottingham park as restrictions ease ""We've spent a good couple of hours this morning cleaning up masses and masses of litter,"" she said. ""We want people to get out and enjoy the parks but it's just about people being responsible."" The BBC's Tom Airey was at Woodhouse Moor, in Leeds, as the aftermath of Tuesday's crowds was laid bare and said there was ""a sea of rubbish stretching across the park's gentle slopes"". Temperatures will rise again in Leeds on Wednesday, prompting concerns of similar scenes later The first Leeds City Council workers to arrive had already filled four hay bale-sized bags of litter by 10:00, collecting glass beer bottles, crisp packets, discarded bags-for-life, used disposable barbecues and nitrous oxide canisters. This was all despite multiple 'no litter' signs along the park's tree-lined paths. ""It's really disgusting that people left their litter piled up by the bins and across the grass, and it's an issue that happens every time there's a hot day in Leeds,"" 26-year-old student Sophie Meredith said. ""Today was the worst I've ever seen it, and it's probably made worse by the fact that everyone's been cooped up for a year.""

""[Maintenance workers] have been out since 06:00 clearing up but our resources could be much better spent,"" the local authority said on Twitter.  ""Don't leave your mess, please love our parks."" The waste left behind at Birmingham's parks also meant the city council there had to suspend planned grass-cutting so workers could focus on removing litter. Council workers in Birmingham put other jobs on hold to clear up litter left in the city's parks Keep Britain Tidy said the litter was a ""disaster for our environment"" and urged people to ""take some responsibility and dispose of their rubbish correctly"".

NY hunt for man who attacked Asian American woman,"CCTV footage captured a man repeatedly kicking a 66-year-old woman in Manhattan, New York Police in the US have arrested a man suspected of attacking an Asian American woman in New York City, kicking her repeatedly in the stomach as witnesses appeared to only watch.

A few frequent flyers 'dominate air travel',"A small minority of frequent flyers dominate air travel in almost all countries with high aviation emissions, analysis suggests. In the UK, 70% of flights are made by a wealthy 15% of the population, with 57% not flying abroad at all. There are calls for a frequent flyer levy - a tax that increases the more you fly each year. Greenpeace supports the tax and also wants air miles banned because they say it encourages frequent flying. The UK government said it is reviewing aviation taxes, but insisted that a frequent flier levy would have many problems. The campaigners believe frequent flyer levies would be broadly popular because they disproportionately affect the rich, who fly the most. The UK Citizens' Assembly last year supported the principle that people who fly moreshould be taxed more. Government urged to bring in 'frequent flyer levy' Climate change 'may curb growth in flying' Research for the climate campaign group Possible says that, in the US, just 12% of people take two-thirds of flights. The government's advisory Climate Change Committeewants a levy on frequent fliers. The Possible research suggests the frequent flyer trend is mirrored in other wealthy countries. Canada: 22% of the population takes 73% of flights The Netherlands:8% of people takes 42% of flights. China:5% of households takes 40% of flights India:1% of households takes 45% of flights. Indonesia:3% of households takes 56% of flights. Alethea Warrington, from Possible, said: ""This report shows the same pattern of inequality around the world - a small minority of frequent flyers take an unfair share of the flights. ""While the poorest communities are already suffering the impacts of a warming climate, the benefits of high-carbon lifestyles are enjoyed only by the few. A lot of people travel. But only the privileged few fly often."" John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, told BBC News: ""Taxing frequent fliers is a good idea - but we also have to do something about air miles, which reward frequent fliers for flying more frequently. This is obscene during a climate crisis - and it should be stopped."" A UK Treasury spokesman told BBC News: ""We're leading the global fight on climate change and will use our hosting of COP26 (the Glasgow climate summit) later this year to galvanise global support for aviation decarbonisation. ""Frequent flyers already pay more under the current APD (Air Passenger Duty) system, but we are currently consulting on aviation tax reform and welcome views."" He said there were many drawbacks to a frequent flyer levy. These include that it would be complex to administer, could pose data processing and privacy concerns, could be difficult to impose where passengers hold multiple passports and could be a challenge for those who have an essential need to fly frequently. The government's consultation on aviation tax reform closes on 14 June. The spokesman did not comment on the proposal to make air miles programmes illegal.

Illegal gatherings warning as sun shines again,"This video can not be played Litter left after people enjoyed the sunshine in Wales just days after travel restrictions were eased Three police officers were injured when missiles were thrown and crowds dispersed at Cardiff Bay. South Wales Police said two people were arrested on suspicion of public order offences on Tuesday night and since released on bail. A second day of good weather in Wales has prompted police representatives to warn against illegal gatherings. On Tuesday as temperatures topped 21C, tourist spots saw aninflux of visitors. South Wales Police said officers intervened in an ""incident of violent disorder"" in Cardiff Bay at about 22:00 BST on Tuesday. It said a number of missiles, including bottles, were thrown at officers, three of whom suffered minor injuries. A 21-year-old man and 16-year-old boy were arrested and a knife was found. Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan Ch Insp Tony Williams said: ""The violence levelled at officers was despicable and will not be tolerated, nor will we tolerate the antisocial behaviour and criminality displayed by the minority on Tuesday evening."" He said increased patrols would be carried out in key areas. He appealed for people to ""take a sensible approach and to continue supporting the restrictions that do remain in place, in order to keep us all safe"". Crowds gathered to enjoy the sun outside the Senedd on Tuesday Cardiff Council said it took its cleaning teams three hours to clean up after the gathering in the bay A video taken on the steps of the Senedd showing the area strewn with empty bottles, carrier bags and cardboard beer boxes was latershared on Twitter,external. Cardiff council said it had taken three hours to clean up the ""unacceptable amount of litter"" in Cardiff Bay and parks. A spokesman added: ""We would ask visitors enjoying these areas to dispose of their waste responsibly and, if a bin is full, take it to an empty one or take it home with them. ""Current Covid-19 restrictions allow up to six people from two households to meet outdoors while socially distanced and we would urge visitors to Cardiff Bay and to our parks and green spaces to follow these rules and help keep Cardiff safe."" With similar temperatures on Wednesday, South Wales Police Federation (SWPF) urged people tofollow Covid rules. Six people from two households are now allowed to meet outside, including in private gardens, but mass gatherings remain illegal. Allow Twitter content?

Race 'less important in explaining disparities',"Black Lives Matter protests were held across the UK last summer The UK ""no longer"" has a system rigged against people from ethnic minorities, a review set up by No 10 says. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on how people's lives turned out. It said children belonging to ethnic minorities did as well or better than white pupils, but overt racism remained, particularly online. The Runnymede Trust think tank said it felt ""let down"" by the report. The commission was set up after Black Lives Matter anti-racism protests across the country last summer - triggered by the killing of George Floyd in the US. The main findings were: Children from ethnic-minority communities did as well or better than white pupils in compulsory education, with black Caribbean pupils the only group to perform less well This success in education has ""transformed British society over the last 50 years into one offering far greater opportunities for all"" The pay gap between all ethnic minorities and the white majority population had shrunk to 2.3% overall and was barely significant for employees under 30 Diversity has increased in professions such as law and medicine But some communities continue to be ""haunted"" by historic racism, which is creating ""deep mistrust"" and could be a barrier to success Thecommission's report concluded,externalthat the UK is not yet a ""post-racial country"" - but its success in removing race-based disparity in education and, to a lesser extent, the economy, ""should be regarded as a model for other white-majority countries"". Key points: What does the race report say? The black British history you may not know about Six reports in four years but what action has been taken? A foreword to the report by chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, said: ""We no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities."" While the ""impediments and disparities do exist"", it continued, they were ""varied and ironically very few of them are directly to do with racism"". The report added that evidence had found that factors such as geography, family influence, socio-economic background, culture and religion had ""more significant impact on life chances than the existence of racism"". ""That said, we take the reality of racism seriously and we do not deny that it is a real force in the UK."" The report also said there is an ""increasingly strident form of anti-racism thinking that seeks to explain all minority disadvantage through the prism of white discrimination"" which it said diverted attention from ""the other reasons for minority success and failure"". In a statement issued after the report was published, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""right"" that ministers now consider its recommendations in detail and assess ""the implications for future government policy"". He added: ""The entirety of government remains fully committed to building a fairer Britain and taking the action needed to address disparities wherever they exist."" This video can not be played Institutional racism has become a 'catch-all phrase', Tony Sewell says Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Sewell said while there was anecdotal evidence of racism, there was no proof that there was ""institutional racism"" in Britain. ""No-one denies and no-one is saying racism doesn't exist"", he said. ""We found anecdotal evidence of this. However, evidence of actual institutional racism? No, that wasn't there, we didn't find that."" Dr Sewell added that the term ""institutional racism"" is ""sometimes wrongly applied"" as a ""sort of a catch-all phrase for micro-aggressions or acts of racial abuse"". Prof Kehinde Andrews, a professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, said the report was not a ""genuine effort to understand racism in Britain"". Prof Andrews said: ""It's complete nonsense. It goes in the face of all the actual existing evidence. This is not a genuine effort to understand racism in Britain. This is a PR move to pretend the problem doesn't exist."" Baroness Kishwer Falkner, chair of theEquality and Human Rights Commission,external, said: ""This report rightly identifies the varied causes of disparities and by making recommendations to address them gives the government the opportunity to design policy targeting the sources of inequality. ""There are a number of recommendations we can play a leading role in and we welcome the recognition that additional funding would help us carry out our important work to tackle discrimination and disadvantage."" Dr Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, said she felt ""deeply, massively let down"" by the report, and that the government did not have the confidence of black and minority ethnic communities. Asked for her view on the commission's suggestion that the UK is not institutionally racist, she said: ""Tell that to the black young mother who is four times more likely to die in childbirth than her young white neighbour, tell that to the 60% of NHS doctors and nurses who died from Covid and were black and ethnic minority workers. ""You can't tell them that, because they are dead. ""Institutionally, we are still racist, and for a government-appointed commission to look into (institutional) racism, to deny its existence is deeply, deeply worrying."" She added: ""We feel that if the best this government can do is come up with a style guide on BAME terminology, or what we should do about unconscious bias training, or extend a few school hours, then I'm afraid this government doesn't carry the confidence of black and ethnic minority communities any longer, certainly not on race."" Dr Begum also claimed the report had failed to acknowledge the ""suffering"" of black and ethnic minority communities, adding: ""All this is is a whitewash and a script that has been written to 10 Downing Street."" She also questioned the suitability of Dr Sewell and head of the Number 10 policy unit Munira Mirza, who had a role in setting the commission up - both ofwhom have questioned the existence of institutional racism previously. This video can not be played Social commentator Patrick Vernon says the report ""doesn't reflect the lives of minority Britons"". The 258-page report makes 24 recommendations which include: Extended school days to be phased in, starting with disadvantaged areas, to help pupils catch up on missed learning during the pandemic Children from disadvantaged backgrounds should have access to better quality careers advice in schools, funded by university outreach programmes More research is needed to examine why pupils perform well in certain communities, so this can be replicated to help all children succeed The acronym BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) should no longer be used because differences between groups are as important as what they have in common Organisations should stop funding unconscious bias training, with government and experts developing resources to help advance workplace equality Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the commission had ""chosen to deny the experiences of black and minority ethnic workers"" who were ""far more likely"" than white workers to be in ""low-paid, insecure jobs"". She added they have been ""far more likely to be exposed to Covid infection and far more likely to die - because they are far more likely to be in frontline roles. ""This is institutional racism.

Who has been shielding?,"Guidance for people in England identified as being ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing? Formal advice telling them to take extra care, or ""shield"", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. Most coronavirus restrictionsare being lifted in Englandon 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else. However, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to ""think particularly carefully"" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including: limiting moments of close contact considering whether you and others have been fully vaccinated (you might want to wait until 14 days after your second dose before meeting) considering the risk if Covid levels are high in the general community meeting outside if possible ensuring inside spaces are well-ventilated washing hands regularly and avoiding face-touching continuing social distancing if that feels right for you asking friends/family to take lateral flow tests before meeting There is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Although Scotland moves toCovid protection level zero,externalon 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidkeeping the mandatory use of face coveringspast then would give ""added protection and assurance"" to people who were particularly vulnerable. From 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace. However, companies still havelegally binding health and safety responsibilities,external- and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. Some firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people. TheCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough),externalis available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. You may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons. Read theupdated government advice,external. Although the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it ""expects and recommends"" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport. You should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. TheNHS Volunteer Responders,externalprogramme is still available to offer support. Data showsCovid vaccines are highly effectivein most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection. Being double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. You should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not,book through the NHS website,externalor call 119. The most vulnerable peopleare likely to be offered booster jabs from September,external, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. You are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions. The pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The governmentrecommends several support websites,external. If you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on theNHS Shielded Patient List,external. A combination of factors can contribute toa person's risk,external, including: age (older being higher risk) ethnicity deprivation (according to postcode) weight (body mass index) underlying health issues prescribed medications Cancer patients need to take extra care High risk categories,externalinclude people: with transplanted solid organs undergoing some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy on immunosuppression drugs with heart disease who are also pregnant with severe respiratory conditions (for example: cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPD) with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency with Down's syndrome (adults) on dialysis or with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (adults) EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

'I've left home five times this year',"Within the month of September 2019 Michaela Hollywood flew across America eight times, such were the demands of a leadership programme she was on. Since coronavirus, however, she has only been able to leave her home five times. In early 2020 Michaela was scrolling through the news when she found an article about a ""weird virus in China"". As someone with health difficulties, the 30-year-old immediately started making changes to her life. ""I tried to stop touching any surfaces outside my home,"" she says. ""If I'd waited until the extremely clinically vulnerable letter had come in, who knows what would have happened."" Michaela, from Northern Ireland, has spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic and degenerative condition which weakens muscles and impacts movement. She is a full-time wheelchair-user, is unable to sit-up unaided and her breathing muscles are paralysed. Michaela went about life cautiously but continued with cinema trips and bingo with her mum - until her final night of freedom, although she didn't know that when she went out. ""It was big money night at bingo,"" she says. ""My phone started flashing to say that we had community transmission in Northern Ireland, and I knew that would be it. I decided to shield."" Michaela uses a ventilator when she sleeps to ensure her breathing remains stable It was 12 March 2020 - one day after the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic. At this point there was no guidance offered in the UK. Friends who had previously been part of Michaela's medical team suggested she take ""every precaution"". She went from jet setting across America for her work in disability rights, to trying to settle into life at home under lockdown just six months later. She lives with her parents, while her sisters, brother-in-law, nieces and nephews live in the next house along. ""I still had family around me, so I know I'm really privileged,"" she says. But the initial weeks and months of lockdown were taken up with solving problems. Michaela uses personal assistants to help with everyday tasks like washing and eating, but that became problematic when protective clothing, known as PPE, ran out because of high demand. There was one way around it. ""Two of them moved in,"" she says. ""We have a spare room, but it was full of junk. So we had a day where we emptied the room. I'm really thankful to them for making it happen."" While this newly-formed bubble solved one problem there were others. Mastering the balance between having medication stocked at home and ordering new batches in time, while allowing for delays, was tricky. And food was a headache too. Michaela's condition affects her ability to swallow and so while she can eat solid food, it needs to be soft. For the first four months, securing online deliveries without food substituted for something she might not be able to eat was near-impossible and she relied on what she had stockpiled pre-lockdown. ""I lived on beans and soup,"" she says. ""Once I was able to get on to the register as a vulnerable person it wasn't too bad."" Then there was the mundanity of lockdown everyone has faced for a year too. But for Michaela there was no possibility of a walk outside or meeting a friend, socially distanced. ""I watched Star Wars for the first time, and I am still trying to watch every episode of The Simpsons. It's all those little things that sound nothing but actually keep you busy."" Although stuck inside, technology did open up the world for some disabled people. ""There was a sense of euphoria because all of a sudden there were events we could go to - there were concerts online, access to university,"" Michaela says. ""I was looking at all these things and thinking how much better this is for our community. ""That's not saying we would choose that every time, we wouldn't, but we would certainly need it sometimes."" It wasn't being confined to the house which Michaela found most frustrating, but other people's behaviour, including those who could but refused to wear masks. ""It's not straightforward to shield when you're also physically disabled,"" she says. ""I have to bring people in from the community into my house every day - I can't stay in my room on my own."" This was one reason why her PAs moved in, so she didn't have to deal with a variety of agency staff. Michaela also implemented her own rules - she wouldn't step on ground beyond the house boundary until community transmissions stopped. Come June, that possibility arrived when Northern Ireland recorded no new cases. ""I made the most of that,"" she says. Having got a new job to support disabled people with technology, Michaela hit the shops for new work clothes and managed to get a private cinema screening of Tenet, because no one else had booked. She only had three other trips outdoors, all for medical appointments - X-rays, blood tests and her first Covid vaccination. It still felt like freedom. ""That was a period of grace for me and I still genuinely believe that it should have been two weeks for shielders to get out and have some respite,"" she says. Some European countries like Spain did implement a timetable to ensure everyone could enjoy time outside - something Michaela thinks the UK should think about next time. Non-shielders were banned from going out during certain hours to allow those shielding or the over 70s to go out safely. During the interview, Michaela's phone rings and she says she has to take it, but wants to keep me on Zoom. ""You have just witnessed the greatest moment of my life,"" she beams, looking slightly shocked as she ends the call. ""There's a drug for my condition called Risdiplam that has just become available in Northern Ireland - I can only call it liquid gold."" Risdiplam helps the body produce the protein that people with SMA are missing, which causes muscle weakness. It can halt the progression of SMA and may encourage improvements. ""For the first time ever, my speech should hopefully become clearer,"" she says. ""Wow - I might be able to lift my hand up to my mouth again. ""It's turned the worst year of my life into one of the most changing."" With Michaela's first order arriving this week it brings hope that things are getting better. In England and Wales 1 April signals the end of shielding. In Northern Ireland shielders are advised to continue taking extra precautions until further notice. ""I would need to know that community transmission has all but stopped before things change for me,"" Michaela says. But that doesn't stop her dreaming about that day. ""There is an ice cream parlour, not far from here. It's by the seaside and they do the most incredible ice cream.""

"Race 'less important in explaining disparities'Inequalities in the UK have as much to do with social class and family structure, a report says.","Black Lives Matter protests were held across the UK last summer The UK ""no longer"" has a system rigged against people from ethnic minorities, a review set up by No 10 says. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on how people's lives turned out. It said children belonging to ethnic minorities did as well or better than white pupils, but overt racism remained, particularly online. The Runnymede Trust think tank said it felt ""let down"" by the report. The commission was set up after Black Lives Matter anti-racism protests across the country last summer - triggered by the killing of George Floyd in the US. The main findings were: Children from ethnic-minority communities did as well or better than white pupils in compulsory education, with black Caribbean pupils the only group to perform less well This success in education has ""transformed British society over the last 50 years into one offering far greater opportunities for all"" The pay gap between all ethnic minorities and the white majority population had shrunk to 2.3% overall and was barely significant for employees under 30 Diversity has increased in professions such as law and medicine But some communities continue to be ""haunted"" by historic racism, which is creating ""deep mistrust"" and could be a barrier to success Thecommission's report concluded,externalthat the UK is not yet a ""post-racial country"" - but its success in removing race-based disparity in education and, to a lesser extent, the economy, ""should be regarded as a model for other white-majority countries"". Key points: What does the race report say? The black British history you may not know about Six reports in four years but what action has been taken? A foreword to the report by chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, said: ""We no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities."" While the ""impediments and disparities do exist"", it continued, they were ""varied and ironically very few of them are directly to do with racism"". The report added that evidence had found that factors such as geography, family influence, socio-economic background, culture and religion had ""more significant impact on life chances than the existence of racism"". ""That said, we take the reality of racism seriously and we do not deny that it is a real force in the UK."" The report also said there is an ""increasingly strident form of anti-racism thinking that seeks to explain all minority disadvantage through the prism of white discrimination"" which it said diverted attention from ""the other reasons for minority success and failure"". In a statement issued after the report was published, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""right"" that ministers now consider its recommendations in detail and assess ""the implications for future government policy"". He added: ""The entirety of government remains fully committed to building a fairer Britain and taking the action needed to address disparities wherever they exist."" This video can not be played Institutional racism has become a 'catch-all phrase', Tony Sewell says Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Sewell said while there was anecdotal evidence of racism, there was no proof that there was ""institutional racism"" in Britain. ""No-one denies and no-one is saying racism doesn't exist"", he said. ""We found anecdotal evidence of this. However, evidence of actual institutional racism? No, that wasn't there, we didn't find that."" Dr Sewell added that the term ""institutional racism"" is ""sometimes wrongly applied"" as a ""sort of a catch-all phrase for micro-aggressions or acts of racial abuse"". Prof Kehinde Andrews, a professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, said the report was not a ""genuine effort to understand racism in Britain"". Prof Andrews said: ""It's complete nonsense. It goes in the face of all the actual existing evidence. This is not a genuine effort to understand racism in Britain. This is a PR move to pretend the problem doesn't exist."" Baroness Kishwer Falkner, chair of theEquality and Human Rights Commission,external, said: ""This report rightly identifies the varied causes of disparities and by making recommendations to address them gives the government the opportunity to design policy targeting the sources of inequality. ""There are a number of recommendations we can play a leading role in and we welcome the recognition that additional funding would help us carry out our important work to tackle discrimination and disadvantage."" Dr Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, said she felt ""deeply, massively let down"" by the report, and that the government did not have the confidence of black and minority ethnic communities. Asked for her view on the commission's suggestion that the UK is not institutionally racist, she said: ""Tell that to the black young mother who is four times more likely to die in childbirth than her young white neighbour, tell that to the 60% of NHS doctors and nurses who died from Covid and were black and ethnic minority workers. ""You can't tell them that, because they are dead. ""Institutionally, we are still racist, and for a government-appointed commission to look into (institutional) racism, to deny its existence is deeply, deeply worrying."" She added: ""We feel that if the best this government can do is come up with a style guide on BAME terminology, or what we should do about unconscious bias training, or extend a few school hours, then I'm afraid this government doesn't carry the confidence of black and ethnic minority communities any longer, certainly not on race."" Dr Begum also claimed the report had failed to acknowledge the ""suffering"" of black and ethnic minority communities, adding: ""All this is is a whitewash and a script that has been written to 10 Downing Street."" She also questioned the suitability of Dr Sewell and head of the Number 10 policy unit Munira Mirza, who had a role in setting the commission up - both ofwhom have questioned the existence of institutional racism previously. This video can not be played Social commentator Patrick Vernon says the report ""doesn't reflect the lives of minority Britons"". The 258-page report makes 24 recommendations which include: Extended school days to be phased in, starting with disadvantaged areas, to help pupils catch up on missed learning during the pandemic Children from disadvantaged backgrounds should have access to better quality careers advice in schools, funded by university outreach programmes More research is needed to examine why pupils perform well in certain communities, so this can be replicated to help all children succeed The acronym BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) should no longer be used because differences between groups are as important as what they have in common Organisations should stop funding unconscious bias training, with government and experts developing resources to help advance workplace equality Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the commission had ""chosen to deny the experiences of black and minority ethnic workers"" who were ""far more likely"" than white workers to be in ""low-paid, insecure jobs"". She added they have been ""far more likely to be exposed to Covid infection and far more likely to die - because they are far more likely to be in frontline roles. ""This is institutional racism. And it traps too many black and minority ethnic workers in poverty, insecurity and low pay."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he felt ""disappointed"" with what he had seen of the report's findings so far, insisting there were ""structural"" issues that needed to be addressed.

The cost of speaking up against ChinaUyghurs abroad describe a pattern of harassment and intimidation they say is designed to silence them.,"Women who made allegations last month of rape and sexual abuse in Chinese detention camps have been harassed and smeared in the weeks since. Rights groups say the attacks are typical of an aggressive campaign by China to silence those who speak up. Qelbinur Sedik at her home in the Netherlands this week Qelbinur Sedik was making breakfast when the video call came, and the sight of her sister's name made her nervous. Many months had passed since the two had spoken. In fact, many months had passed since Sedik had spoken to any of her family in China. Sedik was in the kitchen of her temporary home in the Netherlands, where she shared a room with several other refugees, mostly from Africa. Two weeks earlier, she and three other women had spoken to the BBC for a story aboutalleged rape and torturein China's secretive detention camps in the Xinjiang region, where Sedik worked as a camp teacher. Now her sister was calling. She hit answer, but when the picture appeared it wasn't her sister on the screen, it was a policeman from her hometown in Xinjiang. ""What are you up to Qelbinur?"" he said, smiling. ""Who are you with?"" This was not the first time the officer had called from her sister's phone. This time, Sedik took a screenshot. When he heard the sound it made, the officer removed his numbered police jacket, Sedik said. She took another screenshot. In conversations with the BBC over the past few weeks, 22 people who have left Xinjiang to live abroad described a pattern of threats, harassment, and public character attacks they said were designed to deter them from speaking out about alleged human rights abuses back home. According to UN estimates, China has detained more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims in camps in Xinjiang. The Chinese state has been accused of an array of abuses there including forced labour, sterilisation, torture, rape, and genocide. China denies those charges, saying its camps are ""re-education"" facilities for combatting terrorism. Among the few who have fled Xinjiang and spoken publicly, many have received a call like the one to Sedik that morning - from a police officer or government official at their family home, or from a relative summoned to a police station. Sometimes the calls contain vague advice to consider the welfare of their family in Xinjiang, sometimes direct threats to detain and punish relatives. Others have been publicly smeared in press conferences or state media videos; or been subjected to barrages of messages or hacking attempts directed at their phones. (Last week, Facebook said that it had discovered""an extremely targeted operation""emanating from China to hack Uyghur activists abroad.) Some of those who spoke to the BBC - from the US, UK, Australia, Norway, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, and Turkey - provided screenshots of threatening WhatsApp, WeChat and Facebook messages; others described in detail what had been said in phone and video calls. Everyone described some form of detention or harassment of their family members in Xinjiang by local police or state security officials. A gate of what is officially known as a ""vocational skills education centre"" in Xinjiang When Qelbinur Sedik recounted the call from the policeman that morning, via her sister's phone, she buried her head in her hands and wept. ""He said, 'You must bear in mind that all your family and relatives are with us. You must think very carefully about that fact.' ""He stressed that several times, then he said, 'You have been living abroad for some time now, you must have a lot of friends. Can you give us their names?' When she refused, the officer put Sedik's sister on the call, she said, and her sister shouted at her, 'Shut up! You should shut up from now on!', followed by a string of insults. ""At that point I couldn't control my emotions,"" Sedik said. ""My tears flowed."" Before the officer hung up, Sedik said, he told her several times to go to the Chinese embassy so the staff there could arrange her safe passage back to China - a common instruction in these kinds of calls. ""This country opens its arms to you,"" he said. Reports of this type of intimidation are not new, but Uyghur activists say China has become more aggressive in response to growing outrage over alleged rights abuses in Xinjiang. The Chinese government has gone on the attack in public in recent weeks, directing a slew of misogynistic abuse specifically at women who have spoken up about alleged sexual assaults. At recent press conferences, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin and Xinjiang official Xu Guixiang held up pictures of women who gave first-hand accounts of sexual abuse in detention camps and called them ""liars""; said one was ""morally depraved"" and of ""inferior character""; and accused another of adultery. One woman was branded a ""bitch of bad moral quality"" by a former husband in what appeared to be a staged video put out by state media; another was called a ""scumbag"" and ""child abuser"" by a Chinese official. Wang Wenbin holds up pictures of witnesses at a press conference in Beijing last month Wang, the foreign ministry spokesman, revealed what he said were private medical records, claiming that they disproved one woman's account of having an IUD forcibly fitted. Officials have also claimed that sexually transmitted diseases were responsible for fertility problems suffered by former camp detainees, rather than violent physical abuse, and put out a range of propaganda material calling the women ""actresses"". Tursunay Ziawudun, a former camp detainee who is now in the US, was one of the women attacked at a press conference. When she watched it, she was relieved Wang had not mentioned her family, she said, but ""deeply sad"" about the rest. Ziawudun haspreviously recounted being raped and torturedduring her detention in Xinjiang in 2018. ""After all the horrors they inflicted on me, how can they be so cruel and shameless as to attack me publicly?"" she said in a phone interview after the press conference. The attacks on Ziawudun and others showed that China was ""adopting misogyny as a style of public communication,"" said James Millward, a professor of Chinese history at Georgetown University. ""We have these various women coming forward and telling very credible stories about how they've been abused,"" he said. ""And the response shows a complete tone deafness and misunderstanding of how sexual assault and sexual trauma is  being understood and treated now. Besides being horrifying, it's also completely counterproductive for the Chinese state."" The Chinese embassy in London told the BBC that China stood by its assertions that the women's accounts of rape and sexual abuse were lies, and said it was reasonable to publicise private medical records as evidence. Tursunay Ziawudun at her new home in the US last month Two other women who spoke to the BBC have been the targets of what appear to be highly staged videos, published by Chinese state media, in which their family and friends insult them and accuse them of stealing money and telling lies. According to a report published last month by the US-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, China has produced at least 22 videos in which individuals are allegedly forced to make scripted statements, often denouncing their family members as liars or thieves. Aziz Isa Elkun, a Uyghur exile in the UK, had not been able to contact his elderly mother and sister for years when he saw them in a Chinese state media video calling him a liar and a shame on the family. Elkun's crime had been to draw attention to the destruction of Uyghur cemeteries in Xinjiang, including his father's tomb. ""You could tell what they were saying was scripted, but it was still extremely painful to see my elderly mother in a Chinese propaganda film,"" Elkun said. Qelbinur Sedik is worried a similar video of her husband could be released any day, she said. He told her on the phone late last year that Chinese officials had visited him at home in Xinjiang and forced him to recite lines calling her a liar. He said he struggled so much to say the lines correctly that it took four hours to film the short clip. Qelbinur Sedik recently moved out of refugee accommodation into a small home in the Netherlands Another common form of harassment described by those who spoke to the BBC was pressure to spy on fellow Uyghurs and organisations that scrutinise China, often in return for contact with family, guarantees of relatives' safety, or access to visas or passports. A Uyghur British citizen who did not want to be named said he was harassed repeatedly by intelligence officials during and after a visit to Xinjiang and told to spy on Uyghur groups and on Amnesty International, by joining the charity as a volunteer. When he refused, he received repeated calls from his brother pleading with him to do it, he said. Jevlan Shirmemmet, who left Xinjiang to study in Turkey, gave the BBC a recording of a call he received a few weeks after posting on social media about his family's mass arrest in Xinjiang. The caller, who said he was from the Chinese embassy in Ankara, told Shirmemmet to ""write down everyone you've been in contact with since you left Xinjiang,"" and send an email ""describing your activities,"" so that ""the mainland might reconsider your family's situation"". Another Uyghur in exile in Turkey described a similar call from the same embassy. Mustafa Aksu, a 34-year-old activist in the US who said his parents had been harassed in Xinjiang, showed the BBC text and voice messages from an old school friend - now a Chinese police officer - who Aksu said was pressuring him to provide information about Uyghur activists. ""He says, 'Maybe we can co-operate. I'm sure you must miss your parents.'"" Jevlan Shirmemmet has publicly protested for the release of his mother Not everyone feels that they can refuse these requests. ""When I say no, they get my younger brother and sister to call and tell me to do it,"" said a Uyghur student in Turkey, who provided screenshots of the messages from police. ""They could send my brother and sister to a concentration camp. What choice do I have?"" she said. Some have sought to protect themselves by gradually cutting off means of contact. ""You can throw away the phone and cancel the number,"" said Abdulweli Ayup, a Uyghur linguist in Norway, ""but you cancel your number and they contact you on Facebook; you delete Facebook and they contact you by email."" Others have tried beyond hope to stay in touch. A Uyghur exile in the Netherlands said she still sends pictures and emojis to her young son and parents, four years after her number was blocked. ""Maybe one day they will see,"" she said. The BBC was not able to independently verify the identities of the people behind the calls and messages provided by various interviewees, but Uyghur rights activists say efforts to coerce Uyghurs to spy for the Chinese government are common. ""It comes as an offer first - 'You won't have any more visa problems', or 'We can help your family' - that kind of thing,"" said Rahima Mahmut, a prominent UK-based Uyghur activist. ""Later it comes as a threat,"" she said. The UK Foreign Office told the BBC it was ""closely monitoring reports that members of the Uyghur diaspora in the UK have been harassed by the Chinese authorities"", and that it had ""raised our concerns directly with the Chinese embassy in London"". The Chinese embassy in London told the BBC that the allegations in this story were ""completely untrue"" and it was ""baffling that the BBC so readily believes whatever is said by a few 'East Turkestan' elements outside China"" - using another term for the Xinjiang region. Uyghur protesters in Istanbul last month. Uyghurs in Turkey fear they could be deported to China Despite the growing public outrage over alleged abuses in Xinjiang, the number of people who have spoken publicly remains vanishingly small compared with the estimated number detained. China has been tremendously successful at silencing people through fear, said Nury Turkel, a commissioner on the US Commission on International Religious Freedom. ""Millions of people have disappeared into the camps, and yet we have only a handful of Uyghurs speaking out against the detention of their loved ones,"" Turkel said. ""Why? Because they are afraid."" Some Uyghurs who have criticised China have managed to maintain limited contact with loved ones. Ferkat Jawdat, a prominent activist in the US, speaks to his mother regularly now, after campaigning publicly for her release from detention. She is under house arrest, and her calls are monitored, but she is there on the other end of the line. It can be hard to make sense of why some Uyghurs are harassed and others are not; some allowed contact with loved ones and others not. Some have speculated that China is ""A/B testing"" - trying to work out whether fear or kindness is more efficient. For the thousands who are cut off, it can feel ruthless and arbitrary. Jawdat knows that the likelihood of seeing his mother again before she dies is diminishing, so when they speak on the phone they speak carefully. He did tell her once that Chinese state media had put out a video of her saying she was ashamed of him. She said she knew, they had come to film it a few days earlier. ""How did I look?"" she joked. Then, taking a risk, she told him she was proud of him. ""It was the unscripted version,"" he said. Uighur camp detainees allege systematic rape Who are the Uyghurs? Â© 2025 BBC.

Google Maps to start showing eco-friendly routes,"Google Maps will start directing drivers to routes it calculates to be the most eco-friendly based on a list of factors. The search engine said it will highlight journeys that generate the lowest carbon footprint using mainly traffic data and road inclines. Google said the feature would launch first in the US later this year ""with a global expansion on the way"". The new feature is part of its commitment to fight climate change. Tech giants grilled about fake news by US Congress Google fixes crashing Android app issues Google Nest home device tracks body activity in bed When launched, the default route on the Google Maps app will be the ""eco-friendly"" option, unless users choose to opt out of it. When alternative routes are significantly faster, Google will offer choices and let users compare estimated emissions. ""What we are seeing is for around half of routes, we are able to find an option more eco-friendly with minimal or no time-cost trade-off,"" Russell Dicker, a director of product at Google said. The search engine, owned by Alphabet, said it uses emissions data based on testing across different types of cars and road types, drawing on insights from the US government's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). Its road data factors in slopes and inclines from its own Street View cars feature along with aerial and satellite imagery. This video can not be played The Google chip that lets users make tiny hand gestures to control devices ""This is a great example of three trends coming together - the data, sustainability and consumer choice,"" said Siddharth Pathak, a partner at consultancy firm Kearney. ""It will also push those on the fence to make a deliberate choice of speed over sustainability and often cost."" From June, Google will start warning drivers about to travel through low emissions zones where some vehicles are restricted. These are common in countries such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. ""From Amsterdam to Jakarta, cities around the world have established low emission zones - areas that restrict polluting vehicles like certain diesel cars or cars with specific emissions stickers to help keep the air clean,""Google said in a blog post,external. ""To support these efforts, we're working on alerts to help drivers better understand when they'll be navigating through one of these zones."" Google Maps users will be also able to compare car, cycling, public transport and other travel options in one place instead of toggling between different sections in a new feature being launched this year.

Why was IRA man's funeral so controversial?,"A large number of mourners turned out for the funeral on Tuesday The attendance of then-Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill at the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey in June 2020 led to the biggest crisis in NI politics since devolution was restored six months prior. Ms O'Neill and other senior Sinn FÃ©in figures were widely criticised for attending the funeral, with claims they broke coronavirus guidelines. A decision was later made by the Public Prosecution Service not to prosecute anyone in connection with the funeral. Previously, Ms O'Neill apologised for the hurt caused by her actions and any undermining of the public health message, but not for her attendance, having once said she would""never apologise for attending the funeral of a friend"". But in a u-turn in May 2024, Ms O'Neillapologised for her attendance at Mr Storey's funeraland the hurt that was caused as she gave evidence to the UK Covid Inquiry. Here is how the crisis unfolded. Bobby Storey was previously chairman of Sinn FÃ©in and a close friend of Gerry Adams The north Belfast man was considered the head of intelligence of the IRA for a period from the mid-1990s - being named as such under parliamentary privilege. Security sources linked him to several major incidents,including the Â£26m Northern Bank robbery in 2004.,external More recently, he was northern chairman of Sinn FÃ©in. He spent more than 20 years in jail, beginning with internment without trial when he was 17, a year after he joined the IRA in 1972. In 1981, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for possession of a rifle following an attack on the Army. He was a close and lifelong ally of former Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams. When he was released from jail in 1994, Mr Storey was seen as a key individual in selling the peace process to republican hardliners. Mr Storey's coffin was driven from his home in west Belfast for his funeral at St Agnes' Church on the Andersonstown Road. Large numbers of people lined the route and the cortege was followed at a distance by a large number of mourners. After Requiem Mass, Mr Storey's remains were taken to Milltown Cemetery where speeches were made by senior republican figures including former Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams. His body was then taken to Roselawn Cemetery in east Belfast, where it was cremated at about 15:30. Sinn FÃ©in's leader and deputy leader attended, along with former leader Gerry Adams (centre) Ms O'Neill was part of the funeral cortege, which Sinn FÃ©in said included no more than 30 people, Critics have suggested social distancing was not maintained in crowds that lined the streets as the hearse drove by or by large groups of people who walked behind the hearse at a greater distance. Ms O'Neill also went to a Requiem Mass in St Agnes' Church in Andersonstown, which the BBC understands was attended by about 120 people. She was also criticised for posing for a photograph at Milltown cemetery, where a man had his arm around her shoulders. She subsequently said this incident took place ""in the blink of an eye"" and ""shouldn't have happened"". Critics were angry the then-deputy first minister, who appealed to the public during the pandemic to adhere to social distancing guidelines to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission, has now contravened the very rules she helped set. Immediately following the funeral, both the party and Ms O'Neill maintained they acted within the guidelines at all times and broke no rules. In statements to the Irish News and Stormont's Executive Committee, she did not apologise for any of her actions, with the exception of the photograph. Sinn FÃ©in gave her its full backing, saying she would not stand down ""under any circumstances"". Ms O'Neill later issued a statement expressing concern for families of those who had died in the pandemic whose grief would have been compounded by lockdown restrictions. ""Not being able to have their family and friends' support to help them through was hugely difficult,"" she said. ""I am also concerned that those grieving families are experiencing more hurt over recent days. I am sorry for that."" She reiterated that she had kept to the rules, adding: ""If the regulations had prevented me from attending his funeral I would have obeyed those regulations."" Her party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told RTÃ: ""I do understand that looking at the images of very busy pathways in west Belfast and taking all of that in obviously has jolted and has caused some hurt among some of those families, and for that I am very sorry. ""That certainly would never have been my intention, or Michelle's intention, or the intention of the Storey family as they laid Bobby to rest."" In September 2020,Ms O'Neill acknowledged Stormont's public health messaging was ""undermined""by the controversy. Following the announcement in March 2021 that nobody would be prosecuted in relation to the funeral, she apologised again ""for the hurt that has been caused to so many, including to Bobby Storey's own family who have been thrust into the headlines at a time of immense grief"". Giving evidence to the UK's public inquiry in May 2024, ex-Communities Minister CarÃ¡l NÃ­ ChuilÃ­naccepted she should not have attended the funeral. She said she was ""very sorry"" and acknowledged that her attendance had an impact on public confidence. Ms O'Neill also apologised at the inquiry for her attendance at Mr Storey's funeral while she was deputy first minister. ""My actions compounded the hurt, my actions also angered families I am sorry for going and I am sorry for the hurt that's been caused,"" she said. When asked by the chair Baroness Hallett if she was aware of the hurt and anger at the time, Ms O'Neill replied: ""I didn't and I ought to have."" Northern Ireland's system of government sees several parties share power in government together - at the time of the funeral these were the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Alliance. Immediately following the funeral all the other parties called for Ms O'Neill to stand aside while investigations are carried out. The Green Party and Traditional Unionist Voice, which were not part of the government, also called for Ms O'Neill to stand aside. This video can not be played Arlene Foster called for Michelle O'Neill to apologise Former First Minister Arlene Foster, then-leader of the DUP, said she could not stand beside Ms O'Neill to give out public health advice after what had happened. The two women had been at the forefront of regular press conferences to update the people of Northern Ireland on the handling of the coronavirus crisis. They did not give a joint press conference again until September, after Ms O'Neill admitted her actions had undermined the health messaging. The Public Prosecution Service took a decision on 30 March 2021not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral. Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Herron said he acknowledged the widespread public concern over attendance at the funeral. He set out a number of reasons behind the decision not to prosecute. Among these, he said was that a ""lack of clarity and coherence within the regulations and the prior engagement between organisers and the police"" would ""pose an insurmountable difficulty"" if prosecutions were brought. Mrs Foster called for then-Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign as a result, saying his position was now ""untenable"". Mr Byrne said he would not resign and added that no deals were done with the organisers of the funeral. PSNI chief constable Simon Byrne says he will not resign Lockdown regulations stated a maximum of 30 people were allowed to gather together outdoors. The regulations, as they were in place on the day of the funeral,also stated that people could leave their homes to attend the funeral of a friend,externalif no close family member or member of their household was attending. People were allowed to leave their home to ""visit a burial ground to pay respects to a member of your household or your family member of a friend"". A number of Mr Storey's family attended his funeral. The regulations said if anyone had to leave their home they should maintain a distance of at least 1m from anyone outside their household. An independent investigation was launched into Mr Storey's cremation at Roselawn Cemetery, which is run by Belfast City Council. It had been claimed that some council staff were allowed to go home early, leaving republicans largely in control of what took place. The report, published in February 2021, foundSinn FÃ©in did not pressurise the council to give his family special treatment. It also rejected suggestions there had been a ""takeover"" of Roselawn cemetery. In addition, questions were also raised over why a large crowd gathered at Milltown Cemetery in west Belfast for speeches by Sinn FÃ©in politicians when the cremation happened at Roselawn in east Belfast. Milltown Cemetery is a significant location for republicans, and contains the graves of a number of high-profile republicans, including Bobby Sands. Large crowds are a common feature at funerals of high profile republicans. During the Troubles, tens of thousands of people turned out for the funerals of IRA members who had been killed. Funerals often feature common elements, such as a piper, while the coffin is draped in the Irish flag. According to political commentator Chris Donnelly, these types of funerals ""demonstrate a commitment to pursue the cause"" of Irish unification, as well as allowing mourners to grieve and pay their respects. ""So a funeral almost is an occasion to express gratitude, renew commitment and the passing of the torch all rolled up into one,"" he said.

Stormont recalled over Bobby Storey funeral,"Sinn FÃ©in's leader and deputy leader attended the funeral last June, along with former leader Gerry Adams (centre) The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) has announced a review of its decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey. The funeral last June attracted 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. The actions of 24 Sinn FÃ©in politicians were examined, including Ms O'Neill. Separately, Health Minister Robin Swann urged people to stick with restrictions and not be distracted by politics. The PPS said it has received requests for a review, including one from a politician on behalf of the public. UUP MLA Doug Beattie said he had submitted that request to the PPS on Tuesday on behalf of his constituents ""who have been materially affected both financially and emotionally by the original decision not to prosecute"". Mr Storey, 64, was a senior republican figure and had formerly been the head of intelligence for the IRA in the 1990s. The attendance of many senior Sinn FÃ©in politicians at his funeral in west Belfast, at a time when strict limits on gatherings were in place, caused a political furore. The decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral led to First Minister Arlene Foster on Tuesday calling for theresignation of Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Simon Byrne. She said he had lost the confidence of the unionist community, but he has rejected calls to step down. Arlene Foster has called for Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign On Wednesday, the PPS said its review process will be carried out by a senior PPS lawyer who was not involved in taking the original decisions. ""This lawyer will be assisted by obtaining the advice of senior counsel who is independent of the PPS and was also not in any way involved in the original decisions,"" the body said. DUP MP Ian Paisley said he welcomed the review decision and that he had, on behalf of a constituent, instructed solicitors to commence a judicial review of the decision, but that has been paused until the review is completed. The Northern Ireland Assembly will be recalled on Thursday for a censure motion against Sinn FÃ©in for its members' attendance. Mrs Foster told Good Morning Ulster that it was ""folly"" to ignore unionists' concerns, and those of the wider community. ""If Simon Byrne believes that he can dig in and stay, then we will have to look at other ways to deal with these issues."" She added: ""It cannot continue as normal."" Mrs Foster said Mr Byrne had ""engaged in leading an organisation into a position where they have lost the confidence of the unionist community"". Party colleague Gordon Lyons said on Wednesday morning that it continues to be the party's position that Michelle O'Neill should also resign. The Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) and the TUV have also called on the chief constable to resign. They have questioned whether unionist representatives should remain on the policing board. Mr Byrne said he would not step down, and that such an action would undermine his predecessor. On Wednesday, Mr Byrne told the Nolan Show that police warned the organisers of Bobby Storey's funeral in advance that their plan would be a breach of Covid regulations. He also insisted that no deals were done with the organisers. ""Nobody in the PSNI did a deal or looked the other way,"" Mr Byrne said. It is understood that the Police Ombudsman is giving ""careful consideration"" to issues raised in correspondence to the office, believed to be from the DUP. This review should not be overstated - it is something that happens, if not on a routine basis, certainly on a regular basis. There is a well established internal process within the PPS whereby people who are unhappy with the original decisions can have an internal review of that decision. This isn't a new call for evidence. This is simply a fresh pair of eyes and a different mind casting their eye over the same evidence and seeing whether the original decision is one that they agree with. In my experience, it would be unusual for the original decision in these cases to be overturned. Mr Byrne said on Tuesday that enforcing the coronavirus regulations has been a ""consistently challenging and often uncomfortable role for my officers"", and that police did recommend prosecutions in the case. ""The decision not to prosecute does not change our view that what happened last summer when large numbers of people chose not to 'stay at home' at the height of a global pandemic was unnecessary, irresponsible and insensitive. It was wrong,"" he added. Meanwhile, a meeting of the Northern Ireland Policing Board will be held in private on Thursday, but the public element of the meeting has been cancelled. Mrs Foster said it was not possible to table a motion of no confidence in Mr Byrne, as 10 days notice is required. She stopped short of saying whether DUP members of the board would step down, but did not rule it out. How Bobby Storey funeral investigation unfolded Reaction to PPS' Storey funeral decision NI police chief's tenure marked by setbacks DUP MLA and board member Mervyn Storey said he would challenge the chief constable over the ""appalling"" actions of the police in relation to the funeral and seek to find out how decisions were reached. ""Any senior officer who approved of or contributed to the decision-making around this policing operation is also in an untenable position,"" he said. Ms O'Neill said in the wake of the PPS announcement on Tuesday that she wanted to once again apologise ""for the hurt that has been caused to so many, including to Bobby Storey's own family who have been thrust into the headlines at a time of immense grief"". On Wednesday, the party's North Belfast MP John Finucane, who also attended the funeral and was interviewed by the PSNI, said ""mistakes were made"" over the way the funeral was organised. He also apologised. A large number of mourners turned out for the funeral of Bobby Storey But he said there was confusion over the Covid restrictions in place at the time. ""Mistakes were made, and I think that's very clear, and there are those who will struggle to accept our apology for that and I totally understand that,"" Mr Finucane said. SDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said the recall of the assembly would provide a ""forum of accountability"". The South Belfast MLA said the motion, which does not have any binding consequences, was not ""political game play"" but was about holding Sinn FÃ©in ministers to account. Simon Byrne has made it clear that he's not for turning on this. There is a massive divide here - we know the anger that the DUP feels about this. Arlene Foster said she has written to the Police Ombudsman, she's also raised it with the secretary of state and has called for Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to get involved and carry out their own assessment. There are those today questioning why the DUP appear to be piling pressure on the chief constable rather than Sinn FÃ©in, although we know that the DUP position remains that Michelle O'Neill should have stepped down at the time. Clearly, Sinn FÃ©in isn't going to do that and the DUP feels it also has to direct its anger at others involved. All of this more widely reflects the view held within grassroots loyalism and unionism for some time now that they feel frustrated that the PSNI doesn't have their confidence in terms of how it has handled events over the last year. The motion calls for the assembly to place on record its regret that the Sinn FÃ©in representatives, who attended the funeral last June, breached political messaging and undermined efforts to prevent transmission of the virus. Health Minister Robin Swann has urged people to stick with the Covid restrictions in place. ""What I would say to the people of Northern Ireland is don't let the political distraction that has come out over this take away from the public health message,"" he said. Mr Swann said we are entering a challenging period over Easter, but we are facing a ""joint enemy"". UUP leader Steve Aiken said his party had ""real concerns"" about the PSNI's senior leadership, and would be referring the matter to the Police Ombudsman. He said attendance at the Storey funeral had undermined the health message, but added that people should continue to follow Covid regulations and not be ""distracted"" from that. Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said that the party continues to have confidence in Mr Byrne. Health Minister Robin Swann urged people to stick with the Covid restrictions in place ""What we are very conscious of is the primary responsibility for what happened lies with Sinn FÃ©in and it would be perverse if we end up in the situation where the agencies who had to handle the situation are being held to account rather than those who were primarily responsible for what unfolded last June."" TUV leader Jim Allister has backed calls for Mr Byrne to resign, and said the decision not to prosecute had ""trashed"" Covid regulations. He added that the recall motion would keep a ""spotlight on those who were the lawbreakers and got away with it and those at the same time who were the lawmakers"".

Brazil resignations pile pressure on Bolsonaro,"Jair Bolsonaro is facing the biggest crisis since he came to power on 1 January 2019 Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro is facing the biggest crisis of his presidency after the heads of the army, navy and air force all quit and the country recorded its highest daily Covid-19 death toll. The unprecedented resignation of the defence chiefs is being seen as a protest at attempts by Mr Bolsonaro to exert undue control over the military. Mr Bolsonaro's popularity has plummeted over his response to Covid-19. Nearly 314,000 people have died, with a new daily record of 3,780 on Tuesday. Worldwide, Brazil has the second highest number of total confirmed Covid cases with more than 12.6m. Only the United States has more. It is also the country with the second highest number of Covid-related deaths since the pandemic began and its daily deaths currently account for about a quarter of all coronavirus fatalities in the entire world. The high number of cases has brought the health system to the verge of collapse. In 18 of Brazil's 26 states and in the capital, Brasilia, the occupancy of intensive care units (ICU) is above 90%, according to Brazilian public health institute Fiocruz. In two states, AmapÃ¡ and Mato Grosso do Sul, ICU are completely full. The latest surge in cases and deaths has been attributed to the spread of a highly contagious variant of the virus which was first detected in Japan in travellers from the city of Manaus, in Brazil's Amazon state. What is the Brazil variant and do vaccines work against it? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Preliminary data suggests the new variant could be up to twice as transmittable as the original version of the virus. Neighbouring countries are extremely worried the new variant. Bolivia, which shares a 3,400km-long (2,100 miles) border with Brazil, announced that it would focus its Covid immunisation programme on the border areas. This video can not be played One epidemiologist in Brazil fears the country is ""becoming a threat to global public health"" Brazil's own vaccine programme has been beset by delays. So far, only 8% of its 211-million-strong population have received a first dose. According to a poll published by Datafolha in mid-March, 43% of Brazilians blame President Bolsonaro for the poor handling of the pandemic. Opponents of Mr Bolsonaro demand that he be impeached over his handling of the coronavirus crisis The far-right leader has consistently opposed lockdown measures, arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the coronavirus itself. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. While his stance made him popular with anti-lockdown protesters, his popularity is falling. In a poll conducted in mid-March, 54% of respondents said his management of the Covid crisis was ""bad"" or ""very bad"", up from 48% in January. Mr Bolsonaro was a divisive figure even before the pandemic hit and the rapid spread of Covid seems to have further hardened opinions. The Datafolha poll suggests that while the percentage of those who said they ""never trusted"" the president's words rose from 41% to 45% between January and March, those who say they ""always trust"" what has only dropped slightly from 19% to 18% in that same timeframe. However in recent days, his government has been furthered weakened by a deep political crisis. Since the pandemic began, Brazil has had no fewer than four health ministers. The latest is Marcelo Queiroga, a cardiologist, who replaced an army officer with no medical training on 16 March. But while changes in the health ministry have become almost par for the course, this week also saw the foreign minister and five other cabinet ministers leave. Foreign Minister Ernesto AraÃºjo had fallen foul of Congress, some of whose members accused him of mishandling relations with China, India and the US, which they said in turn led to Brazil not getting enough Covid vaccines from those countries. But it was Mr Bolsonaro's sacking of the defence minister, Fernando Azevedo e Silva, which caused the biggest storm so far. Mr Bolsonaro and his minister had clashed over the issue of the armed forces' loyalty, which the defence minister said should be directed to upholding the constitution rather than supporting the president personally. In a first in Brazilian history, on Tuesday the heads of the army, navy and air force all resigned together in a move signalling their opposition to the president and his sudden sacking of the defence minister's sacking. The role of the armed forces in Brazilian politics has been a contentious issue since the country's return to democracy in 1985 after 21 years of military rule. Gen Braga Netto is the new defence minister President Bolsonaro, a former army captain, caused outrage in 2019 when he organised a commemoration of the 1964 coup which brought the military to power. He also appointed active duty and retired generals to key positions in his cabinet, including the health ministry and the vice-presidency. But in recent weeks, top members of the military seem to have increasingly distanced themselves from the president, culminating in the resignation of the armed forces heads on Tuesday. Mr Bolsonaro's newly appointed minister of defence, Gen Walter Braga Netto, seems to be more closely aligned with the president. In one of his first statements he said that the 1964 coup had ""pacified the country"" and should be celebrated. Marking the coup's anniversary on 31 March, the general said that there had been a ""very real threat to peace and democracy"" and that the armed forces had confronted that threat in 1964.

The black British history you may not know about,"These children are lining up in Brixton, south London, to see Queen Mary open Lambeth Town Hall in 1938 ""We have existed in Britain and been pioneers, inventors, icons. And then colonialism happened, and that has shaped the experiences of black people - but that is not all we are."" These are the words of Lavinya Stennett, founder of The Black Curriculum, an organisation which teaches black British history in schools - and is campaigning for Education Secretary Gavin Williamson to make it compulsory. The death of George Floyd in America has inspired thousands of people in Britain to demand justice, marching through the streets of our biggest cities. Black Lives Matter protesters here insist thatthe UK ""is not innocent"". But some commentators have questioned whether racism exists in Britain, and to what extent. George The Poet, who was questioned about this on Newsnight, believes a lack of education about black British history - and the British Empire - plays a part in racism in the UK and our discussions about it.

The transatlantic slave trade and the US civil rights movement are largely the only black history taught in UK schools, normally in October when we celebrate Black History Month. ""lf you're omitting different histories and narratives, you're saying that these people aren't part of this country, this nation, this heritage - or they're not important enough to be taught as common knowledge,"" says Melody Triumph, policy specialist at The Black Curriculum. These are just a few episodes of black British history we weren't taught in school. Research from the University of Reading in 2010 showed a British-Roman woman in York, whose remains were found in 1901, had African ancestry Some might think the first black people in Britain arrived from Britain's colonies - the countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia that Britain ruled over, in some cases for centuries - after World War 2. But that's not true, says Lavinya from The Black Curriculum. ""We know that black people were in Britain since Roman times - and there's specific examples."" The Ivory Bangle Lady is the name given to remains discovered in York in 1901 which are now on display in the York Museum. Archaeological analysis reveals that although she was born in Roman Britain, she's likely to be of North African descent. The remains have been dated to the second half of the 4th Century. She was found with jet and elephant ivory bracelets, earrings, pendants, beads, a blue glass jug and a glass mirror. In other words, she wasn't poor. ""It puts into question assumptions that black people have never been aspirationally wealthy or had any kind of wealth,"" Lavinya says. John Blanke can be seen on a roll from the 1500s at the National Archives During the Tudor period there werehundreds of black migrantsliving in England. For those of us a bit rusty on our Tudor dates, we're talking about the 1500s. John Blanke, an African trumpeter, was one of them. His face can be seen inscribed into a 60ft long roll depicting the prestigious Westminster Tournament of 1511 -an elaborate party,externalwhich Henry VIII put on to celebrate the birth of a son. There's even a letter from John Blanke to Henry VIII asking for a pay rise. ""He petitioned for 8p a day. I don't know what the conversion is today, but that showed he knew his worth,"" Lavinya says. Portrait of Queen Charlotte by Johan Joseph Zoffany She was a princess from Germany who became a British Queen after marrying King George III - and many historians believe Queen Charlotte had African ancestry. They married in 1761 and Charlotte was the mother of two British monarchs - George IV and William IV. It's been argued that despite coming from Germany, Queen Charlotte was descended from a black branch of the Portuguese royal family. King Afonso III of Portugal conquered the city of Faro from the Moors - Muslims from North Africa who lived in modern-day Spain and Portugal during the Middle Ages - in the 13th Century. Afonso was thought to have had three children with the city governor's daughter. One of their sons, Martim Afonso Chichorro, is also said to have married into a family with black ethnicity. He and his wife, Ines Lourenco de Sousa de Valadares, founded the Portuguese house of Sousa-Chichorro, which had many descendants, including Queen Charlotte. Queen Charlotte's great granddaughter? Queen Victoria. This video can not be played Many streets in Glasgow city centre are named after slave-owning plantation owners. Queen Charlotte, whether she had African ancestry or not, joined the Royal Family in the century when Britain started slave-trading - whichmade it vastly wealthy. ""A lot of the time, we start with black history in London - it's London-centric. But a lot of Glasgow's wealth actually comes from the tobacco, the sugar, the cotton that was created and sustained by enslaved people in Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados,"" Lavinya says. Many of Glasgow's prominent city centre streets are named after 18th Century slave owners who made fortunes from plantations. ""You're told that black people were slaves, but you're not told the fruits of their labour are actually the streets we walk on."" This video can not be played A new play, written and performed by Paterson Joseph, tells the story of Britain's first black voter. Lavinya says teaching slavery is important but you need to ""contextualise it"". ""Talk about who gained from it, the people not only in the colonies but also here in the UK."" That also means teaching about the ""black people in Scotland who were part of the abolition of the slave trade"". ""All you hear about is William Wilberforce"" - a British politician whocampaigned to abolish slavery- Lavinya says. This video can not be played David Matthews tells the story of his great-uncle who fought in World War One. When we talk about Caribbean migration into England we often think about theWindrush generation, who arrived in Britain between 1948 and 1971. ""But black people were actually brought over from Jamaica to fight in World War One,"" says Lavinya. Her great-uncle came to England at the age of 17 to help the war effort, settling in London afterwards. But she says her uncle was ""one of the lucky ones""- because he wasn't sent back after the war. When soldiers returned to the UK after WW1 there was a jobs shortage and a lack of opportunities. ""White people made the link that they were not getting jobs because of the black people"" - and violence towards black communities followed. They're known as the 1919 race riots in Glasgow, Liverpool, Cardiff and other seaports across Britain, during which three people were killed and hundreds injured. Charles Wotten, a black serviceman, was killed in the race riots But there were economic consequences too. Many black serviceman and workers found themselves without jobs after a ""colour bar"" was introduced in many industries, with white workers, often backed by unions, refusing to work alongside black people. Lots of black men were sent back to the countries they had lived in before the war. Poverty and a lack of jobs were a big factor in the riots, butaccording to researcher Jamie Baker, there was also a fear that black men and white women were starting families. ""It fits into the hyper-sexualisation of black men. White men felt threatened because they felt that black men were taking their women,"" Lavinya says. A newspaper cutting shows students marching in Bristol in protest against a ""colour bar"" on the buses After WW2 black people from the Caribbean and Africa, and people from India, were asked to come to Britain to help rebuild the country. They were put to work in the NHS and other public sector roles, like driving buses. But in Bristol the Omnibus Company, run by the council, refused to employ black and Asian drivers, which eventually led to a boycott of buses across the whole city. ""But it wasn't as easy as that,"" Lavinya says. At the time it was not illegal to discriminate based on race - the first Race Relations Act was passed in 1965, but didn't include legislation about employment or housing until 1968. Paul Stephenson, Roy Hackett and Guy Bailey were the brains behind the boycott and Paul drew inspiration from the bus boycott in the US, started whenRosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white passenger when the bus was at capacity, for what they did in Bristol. Guy Bailey, Roy Hackett and Paul Stephenson with a 1960s-era Bristol bus Hackett organised blockades and sit-down protests to prevent buses getting through the city centre. ""White women taking their kids to school or going to work would ask us what it was about,"" hetold the BBC. ""Later they came and joined us."" Students showed support too and it was backed by the local MP Tony Benn as well as Harold Wilson, who became Labour leader a year later. On the same day Martin Luther King Jr delivered his famous ""I have a dream"" speech after marching on Washington DC - 28 August 1963 - pressure had built enough over the summer that the Bristol Omnibus Company announced a change in policy. By mid-September Bristol had its first non-white bus conductor - Raghbir Singh, an Indian-born Sikh who'd lived in Bristol since 1959 - and further black and Asian crews followed. Paul Stephenson, Guy Bailey and Roy Hackett all received OBEs for their action.

UK 'risks falling behind' EU on workersâ rights,"The UK is at a ""real risk"" of falling behind the EU when it comes to workers' rights, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) says. The union body said the EU had ""various initiatives"" in the pipeline which would improve standards once they became law. But it said the UK had no similar legislation on the way. The government said in protecting workers' rights the UK already ""goes further than the EU in many areas"". The TUC's call comes three months after a new post-Brexit trade deal came into force between the UK and EU. Both sides have committed not to lower labour standards in a way that impacts trade or investment - but that does not mean they have to match each other. Nonetheless, the TUC said the UK had already failed to implement directives it agreed to while still a member of the EU, including: A work-life balance directive, which gives fathers the right to day-one paid paternity leave and gives all workers the right to request flexible work And a transparent and predictable working conditions directive, which gives workers compensation for cancelled shifts, predictability of hours for zero hours contracts, and a right to free mandatory training. It said further initiatives were being considered by the EU that could improve conditions for ""platform workers"" and give employees the right to ""digitally disconnect"" outside working hours. The bloc is also looking at ways to make employers accountable for the rights of workers in their supply chains. More investors shun Deliveroo over workers' rights Review of workers' employment rights scrapped TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said that ""as a bare minimum, the government must keep the pace with the EU on rights"". ""Just three months after the UK-EU deal came into force, we're already at real risk of losing ground to the EU on workers' rights. ""Again and again, Boris Johnson promised that his government would protect and enhance workers' rights. It's high time the prime minister lived up to his word."" A spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the UK offered workers ""generous holiday pay and high standards for workplace safety"". BEIS cited as examples that the UK annual leave entitlement of 5.6 weeks compared favourably with the four weeks required in the EU. The UK allows parents to share paid parental leave, which the EU does not, BEIS said. It also said the UK had one of the highest minimum wage rates in Europe. ""We have a strong record of protecting and enhancing workers' rights and are committed to going further to make the UK the best place in the world to work,"" the spokesperson said. However, Ms O'Grady noted the government had promised to introduce a new employment bill to improve people's rights at work in 2019 but was yet to bring it before Parliament. She said the bill could ""end exploitative work practices like zero-hours contracts, once and for all"". In January, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng scrapped a planned review of workers' rights amid fears it would lead to an erosion of job protections, such as the 48-hour week, holiday entitlements and overtime pay. At the time, Mr Kwarteng stressed the government had never intended to water down standards and if anything wanted to raise them. The government said an employment bill designed to enhance workers' rights would be brought forward ""when parliamentary time allows"".

A few frequent flyers 'dominate air travel'A small minority of frequent flyers dominates air travel in countries with high aviation emissions.,"A small minority of frequent flyers dominate air travel in almost all countries with high aviation emissions, analysis suggests. In the UK, 70% of flights are made by a wealthy 15% of the population, with 57% not flying abroad at all. There are calls for a frequent flyer levy - a tax that increases the more you fly each year. Greenpeace supports the tax and also wants air miles banned because they say it encourages frequent flying. The UK government said it is reviewing aviation taxes, but insisted that a frequent flier levy would have many problems. The campaigners believe frequent flyer levies would be broadly popular because they disproportionately affect the rich, who fly the most. The UK Citizens' Assembly last year supported the principle that people who fly moreshould be taxed more. Government urged to bring in 'frequent flyer levy' Climate change 'may curb growth in flying' Research for the climate campaign group Possible says that, in the US, just 12% of people take two-thirds of flights. The government's advisory Climate Change Committeewants a levy on frequent fliers. The Possible research suggests the frequent flyer trend is mirrored in other wealthy countries. Canada: 22% of the population takes 73% of flights The Netherlands:8% of people takes 42% of flights. China:5% of households takes 40% of flights India:1% of households takes 45% of flights. Indonesia:3% of households takes 56% of flights. Alethea Warrington, from Possible, said: ""This report shows the same pattern of inequality around the world - a small minority of frequent flyers take an unfair share of the flights. ""While the poorest communities are already suffering the impacts of a warming climate, the benefits of high-carbon lifestyles are enjoyed only by the few. A lot of people travel. But only the privileged few fly often."" John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, told BBC News: ""Taxing frequent fliers is a good idea - but we also have to do something about air miles, which reward frequent fliers for flying more frequently. This is obscene during a climate crisis - and it should be stopped."" A UK Treasury spokesman told BBC News: ""We're leading the global fight on climate change and will use our hosting of COP26 (the Glasgow climate summit) later this year to galvanise global support for aviation decarbonisation. ""Frequent flyers already pay more under the current APD (Air Passenger Duty) system, but we are currently consulting on aviation tax reform and welcome views."" He said there were many drawbacks to a frequent flyer levy. These include that it would be complex to administer, could pose data processing and privacy concerns, could be difficult to impose where passengers hold multiple passports and could be a challenge for those who have an essential need to fly frequently. The government's consultation on aviation tax reform closes on 14 June. The spokesman did not comment on the proposal to make air miles programmes illegal.

China absent from key UK climate meeting,"COP26 President Alok Sharma will host today's climate and development meeting A critical meeting on climate change, organised by the UK, appears to be the latest victim of an ongoing row with China. Ministers from around 35 countries are due to participate in today's summit on climate and development. But while the US, EU, India and others are taking part, China is notable by its absence. The UK says that China was invited to the event but is not participating. Relations between the UK and Chinahave deteriorated in recent weeksafter angry exchanges about human rights. Why are people not doing more about climate change? The people under threat from Uganda's melting glacier Consumers pose 'growing threat' to tropical forests Just a few days ago China imposed sanctions on nine UK citizens - including five MPs- for spreading what it called ""lies and disinformation"" about the country. The move came inretaliation for measurestaken by the UK government and others over human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority group. China has created a sprawling network of detention camps for minorities in the Xinjiang region Today'sclimate and development summit,externalis being described by the UK as a ""key moment"" in the run up toCOP26 in Glasgow later this year. A list of invitees was published two weeks ago including China. But when the final list of participants was circulated, they were absent. A UK COP26 spokesman said China had been invited, adding: ""We look forward to working with them on climate change issues in this critical year ahead of COP26."" When pressed on the reasons for the non-participation, no further comment was forthcoming. With major emitters such as the US, EU and India taking part, it would be expected that China would play a leading role in this type of event. Not only is it the world's biggest carbon emitter but it also likes to portray itself as a key ally for developing countries. ""To have the ministerial taking place without China is far from ideal,"" said Richard Black, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. ""China is a major lender, trading partner and diplomatic presence across much of the developing world, and will of course be a hugely important power broker for COP26."" ""As John Kerry recently said, the logical approach of western nations is to carve out a constructive place to engage with China on climate change amid the very real differences on other issues. However, it's not yet clear if Chinese leaders will be prepared to go along with this - and the UK, as COP26 hosts, has a very tricky diplomatic path to steer."" Hosted by COP26 President Alok Sharma and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, today's meeting is seen as an important platform for the countries that are most vulnerable to rising temperatures. The gathering will hear from ministers and representatives of international institutions and much of the focus will be on climate finance and debt relief. The question is critical for vulnerable nations. Ministers from several threatened island states and poor countries will take part in the meeting, and they will likely make the point that while they contribute little to the causes of climate change they are already feeling the effects. Vulnerable countries like the Philippines say they need support from richer nations to cope with climate change A report published recently by African finance ministers indicated that some countries are now spending up to 10% of their GDP adapting to the impacts of rising temperatures. The event is also facing criticism from environmental groups who are angry about the UK's decision late last year to cut overseas development assistance from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5%. ""Cuts to the overseas aid budget risk not only undermining the UK's reputation for progressive development action, but also the chances of the UK presidency delivering a successful outcome to COP26,"" said Andrew Norton from the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""The aid cuts undermine the UK's ability to ask other countries to step up, as well as reducing the resources available for climate action in poorer countries.""

Labour questions ex-adviser's No 10 business cardThe party wants an inquiry into the influence of Lex Greensill under David Cameron's government.,"David Cameron was prime minister from 2010 to 2016 Labour says it has obtained an old business card that described financier Lex Greensill as a ""senior adviser"" in David Cameron's office. The card includes a Downing Street email address, and what appears to be a direct line landline telephone number. The party said it raised ""further serious questions"" about Mr Greensill's influence under the ex-PM. The government has said Mr Greensill's role was unpaid and ""approved in the normal manner"". The Sunday Times has reported that he was given ""privileged access"" to Whitehall when he worked as an unpaid adviser under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. Neither Mr Greensill nor Mr Cameron has commented on the matter. Labour calls for watchdog to probe Greensill role Minister defends Cameron as 'a man of integrity' Liberty Steel nationalisation 'an option' Ex-PM Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC News Channel that unpaid advisers offered Whitehall departments ""fantastic expertise and experience, completely free of charge"". He added that, if Mr Greensill had had a government business card showing an official email account, these would have been ""signed off by civil servants at the time"". Labour says the business card was handed to a figure in industry in the summer of 2012 by Mr Greensill, after he started the advisory role on business financing. The Sunday Times reported that during his time in the role, he had promoted a government-backed loans scheme to speed up payments to pharmacists. The company he founded, Greensill Capital, later went on to provide funds for the scheme. In 2018 - two years after he had stood down as prime minister - Mr Cameron became an adviser to the firm. Labour has called for an urgent inquiry in to the matter and it wants the Committee on Standards In Public Life to look into the extent of the access to government offered to Mr Greensill under the coalition. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""The public have a right to know what happened here . We need a full, transparent and thorough investigation"". The committee has said it does not investigate individual cases, but it is looking more widely at issues of lobbying and transparency. Labour has also asked the committee to examine Mr Cameron's reported role in lobbying the government on behalf of Greensill Capital after the firm employed him as an adviser. The Financial Times has previously reported that Mr Cameron unsuccessfully tried to increase the firm's involvement in a scheme offering government-backed loans to Covid-hit companies. Greensill wasaccredited to supply lending,externalunder the government's Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, before it filed for insolvency earlier this month. Last week, Mr Cameron wascleared by a lobbying watchdog, after it concluded his work for the company did not require declaration on the register of consultant lobbyists. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""Lex Greensill acted as a Supply Chain Finance Adviser from 2012 to 2015 and as a Crown Representative for three years from 2013. ""His appointment was approved in the normal manner and he was not paid for either role.""
