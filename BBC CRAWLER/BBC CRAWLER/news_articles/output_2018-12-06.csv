YouTube deletes cheating videos after BBC probe,"This video can not be played YouTubers have been ignoring the site's ban on essay-writing adverts YouTube has deleted thousands of videos promoting academic cheating in the last week after a BBC Trending investigation. The videos all advertised essay-writing services, which can lead to serious penalties for students. Facebook and Google have been asked by a regulator to stop making money from adverts for these companies. All the social media companies say they are taking steps to discourage dishonest behaviour. Seven months afterthe BBC first exposedYouTube stars selling cheating on their channels, the companies which promise essays written to order are back, and are being promoted across social platforms. YouTube has removed thousands of videos in the last few days after we sent them more than 850 examples that breached the platform's rules. Facebook has also removed advertising for several essay-writing services that the BBC identified this week. YouTube stars paid to sell cheating Reality Check: Knowledge for sale? YouTube removes videos selling cheating Some ads urged A-level students to use Facebook Messenger place an order to get their assignments written for them in less than five hours. Facebook has removed essay mill ads flagged to it by the BBC While essay-writing services are not illegal, using them to cheat can result in students facing severe penalties - from being zero graded to being thrown out of university. EduBirdie, the Ukrainian company we exposed in May, is not alone. The BBC Trending investigation has found 13 other essay sites - some owned by Boosta, the parent company of EduBirdie - which have been using social media stars to promote their services. Luis Mercado has promoted five different essay-writing sites on his channel To Catch a Cheater Some YouTube channels are promoting multiple essay companies. The most prolific appears to be To Catch a Cheater, which has advertised EduBirdie and four other sites in dozens of videos. Channel host Luis Mercado declined to comment. After the BBC's initial investigation, EduBirdie continued to pay YouTubers to promote its services, using tactics designed to avoid detection. These include not publishing a link to the company's website alongside videos that contain the adverts. And in some videos, creators wear EduBirdie logo T-shirts without revealing their relationship to the company. Michaela Mendez wears the branded clothing in several new videos, including one in which she unboxes an award from YouTube. She refused to tell the BBC if she had been paid by EduBirdie, but said she did not condone plagiarism. Michaela Mendez wore the EduBirdie logo in a video in which she unboxes a YouTube award Nick Turgeon, an 18-year-old YouTuber based in the UK, was sponsored by EduBirdie to make two slime videos that appeal to young children. They are among the thousands now removed by the platform, and Nick says he regrets taking the company's money. ""It's morally wrong, and I'm not sad they've been deleted. I think it was awful they asked me, not knowing their intention, to promote them to such a young and gullible audience,"" he says. Nick Turgeon says he is glad YouTube deleted his EduBirdie ads EduBirdie told the BBC that it doesn't tell YouTubers what to say and that its essays are intended as a reference guide. It described its service as ""bringing the age-old industry of ghost writing into the digital era"". But the regulator responsible for upholding the standard and reputation of degrees across the UK is so concerned it has written to YouTube asking it to commit to stop allowing promotion of what are known as ""essay mills"". The Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) has also formally written to Google and Facebook to suggest they stop taking advertising revenue from essay-writing companies. Douglas Blackstock, the chief executive, told the BBC: ""These large platforms should cut off the publicity for these websites. It's just morally wrong."" ""What worries me is that companies might take action to get the BBC off their back or to get us off their back for a few months and then they lose attention. They need to be vigilant. This is a global problem,"" Mr Blackstock says. EduBirdie is also increasingly advertising on Snapchat, where videos disappear after 24 hours, to encourage students to pay somebody to write their work for them. Snapchat ads like this one by Edwin Burgos disappear after a day ""Why would you want to do your own work?"" asks US star Edwin Burgos, in one of several Snapchat ads in which he encourages viewers to swipe up to load the EduBirdie website. In another ad repeatedly posted by American influencer Mikey Barone, he attempts to persuade fans that they won't get into trouble because ""EduBirdie is not cheating."" He then urges viewers to buy EduBirdie essays. ""You don't even have to write it, you could just sit and wait for them to finish,"" he says. Neither Burgos or Barone responded to requests for comment. Many of the transactions for the essay-writing companies are processed through PayPal. The QAA has also called on PayPal to stop processing payments for essay-writing companies. PayPal told the BBC it was looking into the matter. Google has been allowing essay mills to buy advertising space on search results pages, even though its own policesspecifically ban,externalthe promotion of this type of company. YouTube, which has a long-standing ban on adverts for essay-writing companies, told the BBC earlier this year that it would work to help creators better understand they ""must not promote dishonest activity"". 'One in seven' paying for uni essays However, the BBC has discovered that since then, more than 100 popular channels have posted new videos containing new EduBirdie ads. Around a fifth of them were also promoting the company before May. B Lou and Zik Asiegbu are among those who have resumed promoting EduBirdie. Their Zias music reaction channel has 2.8 million subscribers. In one recent video, Asiegbu lifts his sweatshirt to reveal an EduBirdie T-shirt before he and B Lou recommend that students use the company. A new EduBirdie advert by the Zias channel is among thousands removed by YouTube Asiegbu, who also advertises EduBirdie on his personal social media accounts, claimed that the video ""was a parody and we were not actually promoting EduBirdie"". B Lou has also included EduBirdie ads in several new videos on his Lou Wop channel. He did not respond to requests for comment. They have been joined by new YouTubers like the British channel Dan osi. In one ad, the two hosts of the channel tell viewers: ""They write your essays for you. I don't see what's wrong with that."" The channel told the BBC that its promotion of EduBirdie in four videos had been ""a mistake"". Another Youtube channel that has advertised the company is Cody & Zoe, whose two hosts have more than six million followers on the lip-synching app TikTok. On their joint channel, the two 17-year-olds jointly recommend EduBirdie to their fans. In the advert, the couple agree they could personally benefit from using the website. Cody & Zoe have a large school-age audience In one unsolicited sponsorship offer seen by the BBC, the company asked a YouTuber to promote the company with this message: ""If you are in school or college and writing essays is killing you, there is EduBirdie.com where you can hire super smart nerds to custom write your papers for you."" EduBirdie sent the offer to Joe Andrews - whose BluMaan style channel has more than 1.3 million subscribers. He told the BBC: ""It was really simple to me, I wasn't going to take on a sponsorship that was clearly promoting cheating. ""It's crazy to me that so many YouTubers have already promoted this company. Not only is it morally wrong, it can get your audience in serious trouble with university and it can even get the YouTuber in trouble by YouTube taking down their video."" Joe Andrews says fellow YouTubers who do EduBirdie ads are betraying the trust of their fans He agreed to help the BBC's research by expressing interest in EduBirdie's offer, and followed up by asking the company if his videos would be deleted if he was caught advertising EduBirdie. EduBirdie responded that ""everything will be ok"" if the video page didn't include a link to the EduBirdie website and if subtitles were turned off during the EduBirdie advert. ""We released hundreds of video like that,"" a company representative wrote. For students, the consequences of handing in work that someone else has done can be life changing. It is known as academic misconduct and can lead to qualifications being cancelled, or students being asked to leave university. The Students Union at Coventry University has been campaigning with the slogan #DefeatTheCheat to raise awareness about academic cheating among fellow students. The union's vice president for education, Adedoyinsola Adebanjo, said this year that several Coventry students were blackmailed for up to Â£5,000 after using an essay-writing service. But he's also worried it could undermine the qualifications of hard-working students. ""Imagine if you get a first class, I get a first class, but what if you've paid [an essay mill]?"" The QAA and others argue that social media companies have a moral responsibility to discourage the promotion of academic dishonesty. A YouTube spokesperson said: ""We don't allow ads for services that enable dishonest behaviour, such as essay-writing and any videos with paid promotions of these services will be removed from the platform. We work hard to combat this kind of abuse, but we know there's more work to be done."" Snapchat told us they expect everyone, including influencers, to stick to their guidelines, which prohibit ""deceptive practices and illegal activities."" The platform said users should flag content breaking its rules, but it didn't say if it would take action against the accounts identified by BBC Trending. Facebook says it reviews all adverts prior to publication ""to make sure that they meet our Advertising Policies"". But after the BBC found several adverts for the Grademiners and EduBirdie companies, it removed the pages and associated ads. In a statement Facebook thanked the BBC and said: ""We don't allow pages and ads which promote academic cheating on Facebook."" It urged users to report accounts or content that breached its rules. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We have been clear that these services are a black market for students, they exploit vulnerable young people and attempt to undermine the quality of our degrees. ""We welcome the action that was taken by YouTube to remove videos promoting cheating in response to the BBC's investigation, and we expect this to continue.""

Eiffel Tower to close amid riot fears,"The violence of the ""gilets jaunes"" protests has shocked France Tourist sites in Paris are to close on Saturday amid fears of further street violence from ""yellow vest"" anti-government protests. Across France, 89,000 police officers will be on duty and armoured vehicles will be deployed in the capital, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced. Police have urged shops and restaurants on Paris's Champs-Elysees to shut and some museums will also be closed. Paris endured some of the worst rioting in decades last Saturday. The government has said it is scrapping unpopular fuel tax increases in its budget - the original trigger for the protests. But broader discontent with the government has spread and protests have erupted over other issues. An official with the interior ministry told AFP news agency authorities were braced for ""significant violence"" on Saturday, with activists from both the far right and far left planning to converge on the capital. In an interview with TV channel TF1, Mr Philippe said 8,000 police would be deployed in Paris as well as a dozen armoured vehicles. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Will you be affected by the closures? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external He repeated an appeal for calm but added: ""We are facing people who are not here to protest, but to smash and we want to have the means to not give them a free rein."" Earlier, Mr Philippe suggested further concessions to protesters, telling the Senate that the government was open to new measures to help the lowest-paid workers. The operator of the Eiffel Tower said the threat of violent protests on Saturday made it impossible to ensure ""adequate security conditions"". City authorities say they are stepping up protection for famous landmarks after the Arc de Triomphe was damaged last week. Culture Minister Franck Riester said the Louvre and Orsay museums, opera houses and the Grand Palais complex were among sites that would be closed. Police secured the Trocadero place near the Eiffel Tower during last week's demonstrations ""We cannot take the risk when we know the threat,"" he told RTL radio. Police have asked stores and restaurants along the Champs-Elysees and other major shopping streets to stay closed and to remove any outdoor items such as tables and chairs. A series of football matches have also been postponed on Saturday. They include those between Paris and Montpellier, Monaco and Nice, Toulouse and Lyon, and Saint-Etienne and Marseille. On Thursday young people took to the streets, protesting over education reforms. More than 140 people were arrested when a protest outside a school in Mantes-la-Jolie to the west of Paris ended in clashes with police. Pictures of the arrests, in which the students are made to kneel and put their hands behind their heads, sparked outrage on social media. Allow Twitter content?

The town's police chief told Le Monde newspaper that those arrested were suspected of taking part in an ""armed gathering"", adding thatofficers had wanted to break up a situation that was getting ""out-of-control."",external Dozens of other schools were blockaded in cities including Marseille, Nantes and Paris. Students have been angered by President Emmanuel Macron's plans to change the end-of-school exam, known as the baccalaureate, which is required for entrance to university. Critics fear the reforms will limit opportunity and breed inequality. Students at Saint-ExupÃ©ry high school in Mantes-la-Jolie were detained by police The ""gilets jaunes"" protesters, so-called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law, initially complained at a sharp increase in diesel taxes. Mr Macron said his motivation for the increase was environmental, but protesters accused him of being out of touch. The government later scrapped the plan but the yellow vest protesters were not placated. Last week, the movement - despite a lack of central leadership - issued more than 40 demands to government. Among them were a minimum pension, widespread changes to the tax system, and a reduction in the retirement age. The protest movement has gained momentum via social media, encompassing a whole range of participants from the anarchist far left to the nationalist far right, and moderates in between.

No politics in Huawei arrest - Trudeau,"Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of the company's founder Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government had no involvement in the arrest of a top executive from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, was detained at Vancouver airport on a US extradition request. China has demanded her release, calling the arrest a human rights violation. The charges have not been made public. Huawei said it was ""not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng"". She faces a bail hearing on Friday. The arrest comes at a sensitive time for US-China relations. The nations are locked in a trade war that has seen both impose duties on billions of dollars of one another's goods. Ms Meng was detained on Saturday, the same day US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping met at the G20 summit in Argentina and laterreached a temporary truce in their trade battle. Huawei arrest a 'hostage' in a new tech war A quick guide to the US-China trade war But the arrest has angered China and threatens to inflame tensions with the US. Earlier reports suggested that Ms Meng's arrest could be related to a US investigation into a possible violation of sanctions against Iran. US National Security Adviser John Bolton declined to comment on this when questioned by journalists. Instead he said that - generally speaking - he had ""enormous concerns"" over Chinese firms' business practices and their possible operations as ""arms"" of the government. Ms Meng is the company's chief financial officer and the founder's daughter. Ms Meng was detained while transferring between flights in Vancouver Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker after Samsung. Should we worry about Huawei? Why has the UK not blocked Huawei? The details of the charges against Ms Meng remain unknown after she sought a publication ban, which was granted by the Canadian judge. Her arrest was not revealed by the Canadian authorities until Wednesday, the day when she had her first court appearance. Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Mr Trudeau said his government was told about the arrest a few days beforehand, but it did not play a role. ""I can assure everyone that we are a country [with] an independent judiciary,"" he said. Some Western governments fear Beijing will gain access to fifth-generation (5G) mobile and other communications networks through Huawei and expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control. US lawmakers have repeatedly accused the company of being a threat to US national security. Japan is expected to ban government use of products made by Huawei and ZTE, local media reported on Friday, over cybersecurity concerns. It would follow moves byNew Zealand and Australia to block Huawei. Without making specific reference to Huawei, US Security Adviser Mr Bolton said his country had ""enormous concerns for years"" about the practice of Chinese firms ""to use stolen American intellectual property, to engage in forced technology transfers, and to be used as arms of the Chinese government's objectives in terms of information technology in particular"". By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent It is hard to overstate the symbolism and significance of this event. Huawei is the crown jewel of Chinese tech and Ms Meng is effectively its princess. Even though it's still not clear what the charges against her are, this is not simply a case about the arrest of one woman, or just one company. This arrest could materially damage the relationship between the US and China at possibly one of the most sensitive times between the two countries in their long and torrid history. The gloves are off. Things have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. Read more from Karishma A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters: ""The detention without giving any reason violates a person's human rights."" ""We have made solemn representations to Canada and the US, demanding that both parties immediately clarify the reasons for the detention, and immediately release the detainee to protect the person's legal rights."" In a statement, Huawei said it had complied with ""all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU."" The company also said in a letter to suppliers: ""We believe it is unreasonable of the US government to use these sorts of approaches to exert pressure on a business entity. They are against the spirit of free economy and fair competition."" Huawei arrest a 'hostage' in a new tech war US-China trade war in 300 words Should we worry about Huawei?

Afghanistan's 'Little Messi' flees home,"Murtaza Ahmadi with a signed Messi shirt, which was sent to him after being photographed in a homemade version A young Afghan boy who became famous online for his devotion to footballer Lionel Messi has been forced to flee his home for the second time. Murtaza Ahmadi, now aged seven, went viral in 2016 after being photographed wearing a homemade Messi shirt, fashioned out of a plastic bag. He later met his hero in Qatar. His family say they have now abandoned their home in Afghanistan, after receiving threats from the Taliban. They were living in the south-eastern Ghazni province - which militants have been targeting - and have escaped to the capital, Kabul. They previously sought short-term refuge in Pakistanin 2016, but returned when they ran out of money, according to the AFP news agency. Murtaza was five years old when he wore a plastic-bag shirt in the white-and-blue colours of the Argentine national team, which Messi captains. It had the player's number 10 drawn on the front with a marker pen. This video can not be played A photo of five-year-old Murtaza Ahmadi wearing a homemade Lionel Messi shirt went viral After a photo was shared widely on social networks, people called for him to be found so Messi could respond. When the boy's name was released, the player sent him a package - including a signed shirt - via the children's charity Unicef, for which he works as an ambassador. Murtaza was later invited to meet Messi when the Barcelona star played a friendly in Doha in late 2016. The young fan walked out on to the pitch with his idol. However, his family say they fear the fame has made him a Taliban target. ""Local strongmen were calling and saying, 'You have become rich, pay the money you have received from Messi or we will take your son',"" his mother, Shafiqa, told AFP. BBC reporter's terrifying days amid Taliban assault Who are the Taliban? Key Taliban commander killed in US strike She said they were not able to take any of their belongings - including the precious shirt - when they left their home in the middle of the night after hearing gunshots. Murtaza, his parents and his four brothers are living in one room in a shared Kabul apartment Murtaza's family are part of the Shia-denominated Hazara ethnic group, which has been targeted by the Sunni Taliban. The Ghazni area remains under state control, but it is considered to be of strategic importance in the conflict between the government and the Taliban. The hard-line Islamic group launched a major assault on the area in August and renewed their efforts in November, forcing thousands of locals to flee. Hundreds of people - civilians, soldiers, and insurgents - were killed in the outbreak of violence. Murtaza's 17-year-old brother, Humayoon, told Efe news agency that they had not been able to send him to school for the past two years and they do not let him play in the street. ""I miss Messi,"" Murtaza said, when AFP found him in Kabul. He said he hopes to meet him again one day. ""When I meet him, I will say, 'Salaam' and 'How are you?' Then he will reply saying thank you and be safe, and I will go with him to the pitch where he will play and I will watch him.""

Lance Armstrong says Uber money saved family,"Lance Armstrong invested in Uber during his comeback to cycling after initially retiring in 2005 Lance Armstrong says an early investment in Uber has ""saved"" his family after paying out $111m (Â£86.8m) in legal fees and settlements. The American, 47, was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles andbanned from cycling for lifein 2012 beforeadmitting to using performance-enhancing drugs. He says he gave $100,000 (Â£78,212) to a venture capital fund that invested in the ride-hailing app in 2010. ""It's saved our family,"" he told CNBC. In April, Armstrong agreed to pay $5m (Â£3.9m) to the US government tosettle a long-running lawsuitthat could have cost him $100m (Â£78m) in damages. However, he said he felt he did not ""get off scot free"" as other settlements and legal fees meant he had to pay $111m in total. Armstrong, who has five children, did not say how much he had earned from his Uber investment but added it was ""too good to be true"". He said Uber, which was founded in 2009, was valued at $3.7m (Â£2.9m) when he invested. The company wasvalued at $72bn (Â£56bn) this yearand istargeting a valuation of $120bn (Â£94bn) in 2019.,external When asked if he had earned ""10, 20, 30, 40 or $50m"", Armstrong replied: ""It's one of those."" He added that he did not even know he was investing in Uber when he gave the money to associate and entrepreneur Chris Sacca, who started Lowercase Capital in 2010. This video can not be played Armstrong on drugs, history and the future Armstrong retired after winning seven straight Tour titles from 1999 to 2005, finishing third in his comeback in 2009 before retiring again in 2011. The US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) subsequently found Armstrong had led ""the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen"", with the Texan admitting in 2013 he had used drugs throughout his career. Yet Armstrong said it was how he conducted himself and not just the fact he cheated that led to his downfall. ""Most people have enough history and knowledge to know everybody did it [doping],"" he said. ""That isn't the issue for people - the issue is how aggressively I defended myself, being litigious, going after people."" Armstrong agreed a settlement with The Sunday Times in 2013 having previously been paid to settle a libel case in 2004 after the newspaper alleged he had cheated. ""Whether or not I would do it all over again - what I would rather do is go back and win seven in a row against everybody else that's drinking water and eating bread,"" he said. ""Even if I did all that [doping] but I was a gentleman and I had class and dignity and treated people with respect, they would've let me off. ""Nobody would've come after me. I insist that it was the way I acted that was my undoing.""

JK Rowling's former PA was 'good liar',"JK Rowling hired Amanda Donaldson to help organise her business and personal matters. The former personal assistant of JK Rowling has been described as a ""good liar"" by the author's husband. Dr Neil Murray made the comment during a civil case at Airdrie Sheriff Court against Amanda Donaldson. Ms Donaldson is accused of fraudulently using the Harry Potter creator's credit card to fund spending sprees that included buying Â£3,629 of luxury cosmetics from Molton Brown. The 35-year-old, from Coatbridge, in Lanarkshire, denies the claims. Dr Murray said Amanda Donaldson had been employed to help organise his wife's business and personal matters. He said she was suspended and later dismissed in 2017 over alleged unauthorised spending that also included Â£2,139 in stationery shop goods from Paper Tiger and more than Â£1,800 spent at Starbucks and Costa. His wife claims Ms Donaldson wrongly benefited to a total value of nearly Â£24,000 Dr Murray said the biggest concern was over cash withdrawals of Â£400 and Â£250 in December 2016 that Ms Donaldson claimed were for a Christmas lunch deposit. Chartered accountant Steven Simou had earlier told the court that he had contacted the restaurant involved and found no deposit had been requested or taken off the final bill. Dr Neil Murray said he was ""really taken"" by how good a liar Ms Donaldson was. Dr Murray said he had then challenged Ms Donaldson in ""an astonishing encounter"". He said: ""Amanda had always adopted a lively, slightly bubbly, a bit scatty demeanour. ""I thought she might be emotional or run about the office looking for bits of paper, but what I found was a completely different personality. ""She shut down, was calm and basically lied. At the end of the encounter I was really taken at how good a liar she was."" The author's husband said there was a small staff of four full-time and two part-time workers who shared an office with Ms Donaldson in Edinburgh. Asked by JK Rowling's solicitor, Kirsteen MacDonald, if there was any reason for the Â£3,629 spend at Molton Brown, Dr Murray said: ""Well not for the office, it doesn't make sense. ""I think the vast majority was purchased by Amanda for Amanda."" JK Rowling was named Companion of Honour by the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 2017 Dr Murray said there was ""no question"" about what the credit card was meant to be used for. ""This was a business card to facilitate my wife's business life,"" he told the court. He added: ""I heard from office staff there was an occasion Amanda was out socially with staff and they bought pizza. ""Amanda offered to pay for the group and took out the business credit card. I was told she said 'don't worry, Neil doesn't check this card'."" Accountant Steven Simou earlier told the court that a safe, which Ms Donaldson had access to, was found to be missing more than Â£7,700 after she was suspended. The accountant said he had analysed the credit card account after a concern was raised by another member of staff. He said: ""I was just quite shocked to see so many expenses there, clearly not of a business nature."" He added: ""Certain expenses stood out more than others - Costa, Starbucks, bakeries, Boots and other high street shops you wouldn't normally associate with a business spend."" Cross-examined by Amanda Donaldson's lawyer, Mr Simou acknowledged that he did not know what instructions she had been given for using the card.

Forensics error drug-drive cases quashed,"Police chiefs said the cases were dropped after a ""most serious breach"" of forensic science standards At least 40 motorists convicted of drug-driving offences have been cleared after evidence of manipulation was found in the forensic testing process. The motorists were banned from driving and in some cases fined, but their convictions have since been overturned. About 10,500 test results are being reviewed after alleged manipulation of data at Randox Testing Services. The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) described it as a ""most serious breach"" of forensic science standards. A further 50 drug-driving cases have been dropped as a result of the alleged data manipulation at the firm's Manchester laboratory. Randox has issueda statement,externalrevealing it had acted as ""whistleblower"" after discovering manipulation by its own staff in January 2017. Police suspended all contractswith Randox, used by 42 of the UK's police forces, in November last year. Greater Manchester Police hasarrested two men, aged 47 and 31, who worked at one of its laboratories. They were arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Six others have been interviewed under caution, with one remaining under investigation as part of what Justice Minister Lucy Frazier described last month as an ""expansive"" criminal inquiry. Hudgell Solicitors are representing 35 people who have already had their convictions quashed, and others who are pursuing civil cases seeking damages. Andrew Petherbridge, the firm's head of civil liberties, said: ""This is a national scandal which has had a devastating impact on the lives of the many people we are representing. ""People have lost their driving licences, and as a result lost their employment, struggled to pay bills such as mortgages and rents, and some have been unable to travel to see their families and children."" Scaffolder Luke Pearson, 26, from Manchester, was breathalysed and performed a road side drugs test for Greater Manchester Police after an accident in November 2016. He tested positive for being over the drug-drive limit, and being an occasional cannabis user, accepted a 12 month ban and a fine of Â£480. His conviction was overturned in February in light of the Randox investigation. ""It was devastating to me,"" he said. ""I needed to travel to sites as part of my job as a scaffolder as we worked across the country, so as a result of me being banned I lost my job. ""I'd even been offered a job as a foreman for a company and they were prepared to give me a company car to travel around sites, but of course that opportunity was lost when I was banned."" Mr Pearson said that it put ""a strain on life and on my relationship with my girlfriend"" as he ""struggled with bills and rent"". He added that he trusted ""police and the legal system to look after you and do the right thing"" and said the situation ""takes away that trust."" Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent The scale of the operation to review the 10,500 Randox cases is unprecedented. It began in January 2017 and is likely to continue until the end of 2019. Randox, which is paying for samples to be re-tested by other laboratories, estimates it will cost the firm Â£2.5m. Police are also likely to incur costs because of delays to other cases, while motorists whose careers and livelihoods have been affected after being wrongly banned from driving may sue for compensation. But the most significant impact of this disturbing affair may be on public confidence in forensic science: can we be sure that the test results we almost take for granted are accurate? In total, up to 2,700 cases have been re-analysed so far and two drug-driving cases that resulted in road deaths were referred to the Court of Appeal. Both convictions were upheld but one motorist's sentence was reduced. Killer drug-drivers' conviction quash bid Drug-driving cases dropped over forensics Two other non-fatal cases involving drug-driving have also been sent to the Court of Appeal. One conviction was quashed and the other has yet to be decided. Ch Con James Vaughan, NPCC lead on forensics, said he could not remember a forensic science failure ""of this magnitude"". He said re-testing was taking longer than expected because there was a ""chronic shortage"" of scientific expertise and accredited laboratories, leading to delays in providing toxicology analysis in unrelated cases of sexual offence and rape.

Armstrong says Uber money saved family,"Lance Armstrong invested in Uber during his comeback to cycling after initially retiring in 2005 Lance Armstrong says an early investment in Uber has ""saved"" his family after paying out $111m (Â£86.8m) in legal fees and settlements. The American, 47, was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles andbanned from cycling for lifein 2012 beforeadmitting to using performance-enhancing drugs. He says he gave $100,000 (Â£78,212) to a venture capital fund that invested in the ride-hailing app in 2010. ""It's saved our family,"" he told CNBC. In April, Armstrong agreed to pay $5m (Â£3.9m) to the US government tosettle a long-running lawsuitthat could have cost him $100m (Â£78m) in damages. However, he said he felt he did not ""get off scot free"" as other settlements and legal fees meant he had to pay $111m in total. Armstrong, who has five children, did not say how much he had earned from his Uber investment but added it was ""too good to be true"". He said Uber, which was founded in 2009, was valued at $3.7m (Â£2.9m) when he invested. The company wasvalued at $72bn (Â£56bn) this yearand istargeting a valuation of $120bn (Â£94bn) in 2019.,external When asked if he had earned ""10, 20, 30, 40 or $50m"", Armstrong replied: ""It's one of those."" He added that he did not even know he was investing in Uber when he gave the money to associate and entrepreneur Chris Sacca, who started Lowercase Capital in 2010. This video can not be played Armstrong on drugs, history and the future Armstrong retired after winning seven straight Tour titles from 1999 to 2005, finishing third in his comeback in 2009 before retiring again in 2011.

Yet Armstrong said it was how he conducted himself and not just the fact he cheated that led to his downfall. ""Most people have enough history and knowledge to know everybody did it [doping],"" he said. ""That isn't the issue for people - the issue is how aggressively I defended myself, being litigious, going after people."" Armstrong agreed a settlement with The Sunday Times in 2013 having previously been paid to settle a libel case in 2004 after the newspaper alleged he had cheated. ""Whether or not I would do it all over again - what I would rather do is go back and win seven in a row against everybody else that's drinking water and eating bread,"" he said.

Xanax addiction rises sharply in childrenExperts say young people are finding anti-anxiety drugs online with no idea of their strength.Health,"Xanax slows down the functions of the brain, but serious side-effects can occur The number of children being treated for addiction to tranquilisers has doubled in a year, to more than 300, according to Public Health England. The drug Xanax, and copies of it, accounted for the sharpest rise - from eight children receiving treatment in 2016-17 to 53 in 2017-18. Ambulance services around the country have also reported a growing problem. In 2017-18, more than 15,500 children had help for substance misuse, 88% for cannabis. The total number receiving treatment was 5% down on the previous year, Xanax is the brand name for the drug alprazolam, a benzodiazepine prescribed for anxiety or panic attacks. But many of the pills taken by children are copies bought online, with no indication of their strength or whether they have been adulterated. UK Addiction Treatment group psychiatrist Dr Durrani says: ""Benzos work by literally slowing down the functions of the brain, acting as a leveller in times of high stress, over-excitement or anxiety. ""Serious side-effects can occur, including slurring words or even total blackouts. ""We're seeing more and more people admitting themselves after becoming addicted to benzos. ""In most cases, their misuse stemmed from using the drug recreationally at parties and mixing it with alcohol, which proves a toxic combination."" Children as young as 11 abusing Xanax drug The Xanax drug users 'dicing with death' Teens 'buying Xanax on social media' The North East Ambulance Service, which provided the most comprehensive details to a BBC Freedom of Information request sent to six ambulance services, said thatin 2017 it had attended 240 callouts for Xanax abuse by children, two of which had been for 11-year-olds. Drugs, alcohol and tobacco director Rosanna O'Connor says: ""Despite fewer under-18s asking for help with drug and alcohol problems, it remains a significant issue andthe latest data,externalshows an increasing number of young people needing treatment for benzodiazepines. ""However, there is limited evidence and data for these drugs, so we do not have a clear picture of changes in use. ""Benzodiazepines are risky when taken without medical supervision and mixing them with alcohol or other drugs increases the risk of harm, particularly when mixed with other sedatives."" The PHE report also says: the number of children receiving treatment for ecstasy addiction rose by 18% over the same period 46% of the 15,583 children being treated for substance misuse are being helped with alcohol issues The Xanax drug users 'dicing with death' Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Trudeau: No political aim in Huawei arrest,"Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of the company's founder Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government had no involvement in the arrest of a top executive from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, was detained at Vancouver airport on a US extradition request. China has demanded her release, calling the arrest a human rights violation. The charges have not been made public. Huawei said it was ""not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng"". She faces a bail hearing on Friday. The arrest comes at a sensitive time for US-China relations. The nations are locked in a trade war that has seen both impose duties on billions of dollars of one another's goods. Ms Meng was detained on Saturday, the same day US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping met at the G20 summit in Argentina and laterreached a temporary truce in their trade battle. Huawei arrest a 'hostage' in a new tech war A quick guide to the US-China trade war But the arrest has angered China and threatens to inflame tensions with the US. Earlier reports suggested that Ms Meng's arrest could be related to a US investigation into a possible violation of sanctions against Iran. US National Security Adviser John Bolton declined to comment on this when questioned by journalists. Instead he said that - generally speaking - he had ""enormous concerns"" over Chinese firms' business practices and their possible operations as ""arms"" of the government. Ms Meng is the company's chief financial officer and the founder's daughter. Ms Meng was detained while transferring between flights in Vancouver Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker after Samsung. Should we worry about Huawei? Why has the UK not blocked Huawei? The details of the charges against Ms Meng remain unknown after she sought a publication ban, which was granted by the Canadian judge. Her arrest was not revealed by the Canadian authorities until Wednesday, the day when she had her first court appearance. Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Mr Trudeau said his government was told about the arrest a few days beforehand, but it did not play a role. ""I can assure everyone that we are a country [with] an independent judiciary,"" he said. Some Western governments fear Beijing will gain access to fifth-generation (5G) mobile and other communications networks through Huawei and expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control. US lawmakers have repeatedly accused the company of being a threat to US national security. Japan is expected to ban government use of products made by Huawei and ZTE, local media reported on Friday, over cybersecurity concerns. It would follow moves byNew Zealand and Australia to block Huawei. Without making specific reference to Huawei, US Security Adviser Mr Bolton said his country had ""enormous concerns for years"" about the practice of Chinese firms ""to use stolen American intellectual property, to engage in forced technology transfers, and to be used as arms of the Chinese government's objectives in terms of information technology in particular"". By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent It is hard to overstate the symbolism and significance of this event. Huawei is the crown jewel of Chinese tech and Ms Meng is effectively its princess. Even though it's still not clear what the charges against her are, this is not simply a case about the arrest of one woman, or just one company. This arrest could materially damage the relationship between the US and China at possibly one of the most sensitive times between the two countries in their long and torrid history. The gloves are off. Things have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. Read more from Karishma A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters: ""The detention without giving any reason violates a person's human rights."" ""We have made solemn representations to Canada and the US, demanding that both parties immediately clarify the reasons for the detention, and immediately release the detainee to protect the person's legal rights."" In a statement, Huawei said it had complied with ""all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU."" The company also said in a letter to suppliers: ""We believe it is unreasonable of the US government to use these sorts of approaches to exert pressure on a business entity. They are against the spirit of free economy and fair competition."" Huawei arrest a 'hostage' in a new tech war US-China trade war in 300 words Should we worry about Huawei?

Senior Tory suggests vote could be delayed,"This video can not be played Newsnight: Sir Graham Brady 'would welcome' Brexit vote being deferred A senior Tory MP says he would welcome a delay in next week's Commons Brexit vote, if it would help address concerns over the controversial backstop. But Tory backbench chairman Sir Graham Brady said getting ""clarity"" on the issue was more important than ""timing"". It comes after reports that Theresa May was being urged to postpone the vote,,externalwhich she is widely expected to lose. Dismissing those reports, a No 10 spokesman said: ""The vote will take place on Tuesday as planned."" The withdrawal deal negotiated between the UK and EU has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by the UK Parliament if it is to come into force. Parliament Live: Text updates as MPs debate Brexit May 'looking at MPs' role' over backstop Laura Kuenssberg:  Tinkering to win? MPs will decide whether to accept it next Tuesday, but dozens of Tory MPs are expected to reject it, as are the DUP MPs, whose support keeps Mrs May's government in power. Many MPs have expressed concerns about the backstop mechanism, which is designed to stop the return of a physical border on the island of Ireland. It would mean Northern Ireland staying aligned to some EU rules, which many MPs say is unacceptable. The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop without EU agreement. Mrs May suggested MPs could be ""given a role"" in deciding whether to activate the backstop - but told the BBC there could be no deal with the EU without it. This video can not be played The PM tells Radio 4's Today programme that the backstop would be part of any deal But the Telegraph reported that the prime minister was being urged to delay the vote by ministers. Asked if the PM should delay the vote, Sir Graham, who chairs the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, told the BBC's Newsnight: ""I think the most important thing is to have clarity about how we might remove ourselves from a backstop, Northern Ireland protocol situation if we were to enter into one in the future. ""It's having the answer to that question of substance that is most important, not the timing. ""So if that question can be answered in the course of the next few days, then all well and good. ""If it can't then I certainly would welcome the vote being deferred until such time as we can answer that question."" This video can not be played Remainer Tory warns over US-style 'partisan bitterness' if deal rejected On Thursday, the Labour former prime minister Tony Blair, speaking at a journalists' lunch in Parliament, said the prime minister was facing the prospect of ""hitting a brick wall at speed"" on Tuesday. Asked if she should pull the 11 December vote, Mr Blair said: ""Personally, I don't see what the point is in going down to a huge defeat."" On Thursday, Mrs May suggested MPs could be ""given a role"" in deciding whether to activate the backstop - but told the BBC there could be no deal with the EU without it. One possible option would see Parliament having a role in deciding whether to extend the transition period or enter the backstop arrangement, if no trade deal has been reached by the end of December 2020. The transition period is due to kick-in when the UK leaves the EU on 29 March. It can only be extended once for ""up to one or two years"" - but if the two sides have still not agreed a deal by the end of that second period, then the backstop will apply. On Thursday night a Tory backbench amendment was laid down to the vote motion that would require the government to ""consider the views of the devolved administrations"" and would mean MPs would have to ""approve"" the government's approach on the transition period and the backstop in March 2020, a year after Brexit.

This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs What Theresa May sketched out on Thursday was the idea of allowing MPs to choose when and if they want to go into the controversial backstop - the insurance policy against a hard border on the island of Ireland. Clearly, to try to get some angry Brexiteers to change their minds, the PM is trying to give a sense that they might have more of a say. They could, as the agreement already suggests, just extend the ""transition period"", giving the two sides longer to come up with a free trade deal that would mean the dreaded backstop is never used. It's not surprising that MPs would have a vote on that. But No 10 clearly hopes it will give some grumpy MPs a sense that they will have more of a say, introducing another layer of decision-making so that the backstop can be avoided. Read more from Laura here The prime minister's suggestion that changes could be made to the backstop to give MPs a role were rejected by Tory MPs on both sides of the debate, who said it was ""cosmetic"" and unlikely to be effective. However, the PM did gain one supporter whenEastbourne MP Stephen Lloyd announced he was quitting the Liberal Democrat group in the Commons to vote for her deal. Conservative Sir Nicholas Soames has alsospoken up for the PM, on the third day of debate about it in the Commons, which is focusing on the economic impact. Ministers are arguing that Mrs May's deal creates a unique partnership with the EU, while Labour insists it will make people poorer. In anarticle in the Guardian,external, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said it represented a ""monumental and damaging failure for our country"" and represented ""a worst of all worlds deal, that works for nobody, whether they voted leave or remain"".

Leicester helicopter rotor controls failed,"(L-R): Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Kaveporn Punpare, Nusara Suknamai, Izabela Roza Lechowicz and Eric Swaffer were killed in the crash The helicopter which crashed killing Leicester City's chairman and four others spun out of control after a mechanism became disconnected, investigators said. An Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) report found cockpit pedals had disconnected from the tail rotor. This caused the AW169 aircraft to turn uncontrollably to the right before it crashed near the King Power Stadium. The AAIB said its inquiries into the 27 October crash were ongoing. This video can not be played Footage showed the helicopter taking off moments before the crash Leicester City chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, two members of his staff - Nusara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare - and pilots Eric Swaffer and Izabela Roza Lechowicz were killed in the crash. A public memorial for Mr Swaffer and Ms Lechowicz - who police said was a passenger at the time of the crash - is taking place at Guildford Cathedral on Thursday. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands An inspection at the crash site found parts of a mechanism linking the pilot's pedals to the tail rotor had become disconnected and there was a ""build-up of black grease"" on one component. The failure of the system led to the pitch of the tail rotor blades being changed ""until they reached the physical limit of their travel"". The report stated: ""The initiating cause and exact sequence of the failure that resulted in the loss of tail rotor control is being investigated as a priority."" Widely shared video footage of the helicopter's last flight, taken from inside the King Power Stadium, shows the AgustaWestland AW169 climbing normally for about 40 seconds before it pauses and goes into a downward spin. The aircraft reached an altitude of approximately 430ft then crashed to the ground. It was rapidly engulfed in a post-impact fire and all five people on board were killed. Following the crash, the European Aviation Safety Agency ordered safety checks to be carried out on the tail rotors of AW169s and similar models. A public memorial for pilots Eric Swaffer and Izabela Roza Lechowicz has been held in Surrey At the memorial service for the pilots in Guildford, Ms Lechowicz's sister Kate paid tribute to the pair saying ""they were just an incredible couple and amazing pilots"". ""[They were] always there for their family and friends, ready to fly across the globe to be with us or anyone who would need it,"" she said. She said both had been excited at the prospect of becoming aunt and uncle to her son, who is now 18 days old. She said: ""I wish you could meet each other. We have already applied for his passport, as you wished, so he can fly before he walks. ""You have touched the lives of every single person you have met...

ITV scraps plans for Brexit TV debate,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn were expected to take part in a TV debate on Sunday ITV has scrapped its plans to hold a Brexit debate between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn this Sunday. The channel said it had invited both parties to appear on the programme two days ahead of the meaningful vote on Mrs May's withdrawal agreement. But an ITV spokeswoman has now said it will ""not go ahead"". On Tuesday, the BBC dropped its plan for a debate show featuring the pair the same evening. The party leaders had disagreed over their preferred format and channel. Channel 4 has announced it will hold a debate on Sunday featuring neither Mrs May or Mr Corbyn, but ""four high profile politicians"" - one backing the PM's deal, one behind a softer Brexit, one for a harder Brexit and one supporting the People's Vote. It has not confirmed who the politicians will be. Senior Tory suggests Brexit vote could be delayed Can backstop 'fiddling' win over Brexiteers? Brexit: A really simple guide The prime minster challenged the Labour leader to a televised debate last week after she started a campaign to encourage MPs to back her Brexit deal in a Commons vote on Tuesday 11 December. Mr Corbyn accepted the challenge, but a row ensued between the parties regarding the format. Mrs May accepted the offer of the BBC, who had wanted to include ""a range of voices"" in the programme, including members of other political parties, as well as a head-to-head between the leaders. But Labour said the proposed format was a ""mish-mash, with a lopsided panel of other politicians and public figures"" taking part. The party instead favoured ITV's offer of a straight head-to-head debate - but this offer has now been withdrawn. A spokeswoman for the channel said: ""ITV invited the prime minister and leader of the opposition to appear in an ITV programme this Sunday evening, and we have been clear that it is up to those invited to decide whether they want to accept the invitation. ""ITV is developing its plans for covering the build up and reaction to the crucial Commons vote next Tuesday, and a range of voices and opinions will be represented on the subject of Brexit in our output."" Labour has blamed the cancellation on Mrs May ""running scared"" of debating Mr Corbyn, saying he would ""relish the opportunity to debate her - and that remains the case"". A spokesman said: ""Labour believed the head-to-head offer from ITV was the most straightforward format. ""A head-to-head would give viewers the greatest clarity and allow both speakers to get into detail. He added: ""The prime minister has refused to join Jeremy in a head-to-head debate. Her team tried to confuse people with a convoluted format. ""But the British public will see this for what it is - Theresa May unable to face real scrutiny over her crumbling deal."" The BBC has contacted Downing Street for comment but has not yet received a response. ITV's political editor, Robert Peston, appeared to take a swipe at Mrs May on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

The news comes as a senior Tory suggested Tuesday's vote on the deal could be delayed. Sir Graham Brady - who chairs the party's backbench group, the 1922 committee - told BBC's Newsnight that the House needed ""clairty"" on the deal, and if that did not come in the next few days, he would ""welcome the vote being deferred"". Earlier, there were reports that members of Theresa May's cabinet were encouraging her to put back the vote, which she is expected to lose. Dozens of Tory MPs are expected to reject it, as are the DUP MPs, whose support keeps Mrs May's government in power. But a No 10 spokesman dismissed the reports, saying: ""The vote will take place on Tuesday as planned."" This video can not be played Newsnight: Sir Graham Brady 'would welcome' Brexit vote being deferred Many of the criticisms focus on the inclusion of a Northern Irish ""backstop"" in the deal - designed to stop the return of a physical border on the island of Ireland. It would mean Northern Ireland staying aligned to some EU rules, which many MPs say is unacceptable. The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop without EU agreement.

"Afghanistan's 'Little Messi' flees homeThe Taliban has reportedly threatened the boy, who went viral for making a football shirt out of a bag.Asia","Murtaza Ahmadi with a signed Messi shirt, which was sent to him after being photographed in a homemade version A young Afghan boy who became famous online for his devotion to footballer Lionel Messi has been forced to flee his home for the second time. Murtaza Ahmadi, now aged seven, went viral in 2016 after being photographed wearing a homemade Messi shirt, fashioned out of a plastic bag. He later met his hero in Qatar. His family say they have now abandoned their home in Afghanistan, after receiving threats from the Taliban. They were living in the south-eastern Ghazni province - which militants have been targeting - and have escaped to the capital, Kabul. They previously sought short-term refuge in Pakistanin 2016, but returned when they ran out of money, according to the AFP news agency. Murtaza was five years old when he wore a plastic-bag shirt in the white-and-blue colours of the Argentine national team, which Messi captains. It had the player's number 10 drawn on the front with a marker pen. This video can not be played A photo of five-year-old Murtaza Ahmadi wearing a homemade Lionel Messi shirt went viral After a photo was shared widely on social networks, people called for him to be found so Messi could respond. When the boy's name was released, the player sent him a package - including a signed shirt - via the children's charity Unicef, for which he works as an ambassador. Murtaza was later invited to meet Messi when the Barcelona star played a friendly in Doha in late 2016. The young fan walked out on to the pitch with his idol. However, his family say they fear the fame has made him a Taliban target. ""Local strongmen were calling and saying, 'You have become rich, pay the money you have received from Messi or we will take your son',"" his mother, Shafiqa, told AFP. BBC reporter's terrifying days amid Taliban assault Who are the Taliban? Key Taliban commander killed in US strike She said they were not able to take any of their belongings - including the precious shirt - when they left their home in the middle of the night after hearing gunshots. Murtaza, his parents and his four brothers are living in one room in a shared Kabul apartment Murtaza's family are part of the Shia-denominated Hazara ethnic group, which has been targeted by the Sunni Taliban. The Ghazni area remains under state control, but it is considered to be of strategic importance in the conflict between the government and the Taliban. The hard-line Islamic group launched a major assault on the area in August and renewed their efforts in November, forcing thousands of locals to flee. Hundreds of people - civilians, soldiers, and insurgents - were killed in the outbreak of violence. Murtaza's 17-year-old brother, Humayoon, told Efe news agency that they had not been able to send him to school for the past two years and they do not let him play in the street. ""I miss Messi,"" Murtaza said, when AFP found him in Kabul. He said he hopes to meet him again one day. ""When I meet him, I will say, 'Salaam' and 'How are you?' Then he will reply saying thank you and be safe, and I will go with him to the pitch where he will play and I will watch him.""

"Lawrence suspect admits drugs chargeJamie Acourt, a suspect in the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence, had been extradited from Spain.London","Jamie Acourt was never convicted of any offence relating to Stephen Lawrence's death A suspect in the 1993 racist murder of Stephen Lawrence has pleaded guilty to conspiring to supply ""huge quantities"" of cannabis resin. Jamie Acourt, 42, had previously denied the charge but changed his plea on thesecond day of his trial at Kingston Crown Court. Acourt, originally from Eltham, south-east London, was extradited from Spain where he was living until his arrest in May. He is due to be sentenced on Friday. Acourt was never convicted of the racist attack on Mr Lawrence and has always denied any involvement. Jurors had been told of the allegation against him and warned they should consider him solely on the trial's evidence. Acourt was arrested by armed officers as he left a gym in Barcelona on 4 May The basis of his plea was that it was agreed with the prosecution he was involved in the conspiracy to supply between 1 January 2014 and 2 May 2015 only. His 43-year-old brother Neil Acourt has already been jailed for more than six years over the drugs plot. Prosecutors believe both were ringleaders and they enlisted family members to the scheme that saw drugs transported between London and South Shields, Tyne and Wear. Acourt fled the country after police raided a home he lived in with his partner and their two children in Bexley, south-east London, in February 2016. He was arrested as he left a gym in Barcelona on 4 May and extradited back to Britain. Jailing him, judge Recorder Paul Clements said the plot would ""have kept the people of the Newcastle area in spliffs for many a long day"". It involved dozens of 600-mile round trips from London to South Shields, driving drugs up and bringing back cash. A total of seven men have now been convicted or found guilty over the conspiracy. They include the stepfather of Acourt's partner, Lee Birks, 57, of Orpington, south-east London, and Neil Acourt's 65-year-old father-in-law Jack Vose, of Bexley, south-east London. In 2012, Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted at the Old Bailey of murdering Mr Lawrence and jailed for life.

"Johnson apologises to MPs over paymentsThe ex-foreign secretary says sorry to MPs for failing to declare on time earnings of ÃÂ£52,000.UK Politics","This video can not be played Johnson offers 'full and unreserved apology' Boris Johnson has made a ""full and unreserved"" apology to MPs for failing to declare more than Â£52,000 in income. The former foreign secretary was ordered to apologise by the Committee on Standards over late declaration of book royalty payments. He made a brief statement to the Commons ahead of the latest debate on Theresa May's EU deal. Speaker John Bercow thanked him for his ""prompt"" response and said that was the end of the matter. Parliament's Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone had earlier ruled that the breaches were ""neither inadvertent nor minor"". She referred the case to the Committee on Standards to decide on a punishment for Mr Johnson. Boris Johnson under fire over newspaper role Johnson's Â£14,000 Saudi visit revealed MPs are required to declare payments for any work carried out in addition to their duties as an MP, in the Register of Members' Interests. Ms Stone found that Mr Johnson's registrations were late on four separate occasions, involving nine payments, ""which suggested a lack of attention to, or regard for, the House's requirements"". ""The committee concluded that Mr Johnson breached the rules of the House by failing to register remuneration within the required timetable on nine occasions,""the committee said in a report.,external ""In considering the appropriate sanction, it took into account what it considered to be aggravating and mitigating factors, and recommended that Mr Johnson make an apology to the House on a point of order."" The late declarations included a series of rights and royalty payments from Bulgaria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, France and the US for books ""already written"" by Mr Johnson. The committee said aggravating factors in calling for Mr Johnson to apologise included the size of the sums involved and the number of breaches. As a long-standing MP who had been a senior minister, he ""could be expected to set an example within the House"", it added. Mr Johnson responded ""promptly and helpfully"" when the issue was raised with him, apologised to the Commissioner and put in place ""effective measures to ensure that no further breach occurs"", the committee added. Making his apology, Mr Johnson told MPs the payments were ""mainly unexpected foreign royalties, which I am very sorry to say were recorded late on the register of Members' interests"". He added that he was ""grateful to the committee for recognising that there was no intention to mislead the House and that I had been completely transparent"".

Xanax: Addiction rises sharply in children,"Xanax slows down the functions of the brain, but serious side-effects can occur The number of children being treated for addiction to tranquilisers has doubled in a year, to more than 300, according to Public Health England. The drug Xanax, and copies of it, accounted for the sharpest rise - from eight children receiving treatment in 2016-17 to 53 in 2017-18.

The total number receiving treatment was 5% down on the previous year, Xanax is the brand name for the drug alprazolam, a benzodiazepine prescribed for anxiety or panic attacks. But many of the pills taken by children are copies bought online, with no indication of their strength or whether they have been adulterated. UK Addiction Treatment group psychiatrist Dr Durrani says: ""Benzos work by literally slowing down the functions of the brain, acting as a leveller in times of high stress, over-excitement or anxiety. ""Serious side-effects can occur, including slurring words or even total blackouts. ""We're seeing more and more people admitting themselves after becoming addicted to benzos. ""In most cases, their misuse stemmed from using the drug recreationally at parties and mixing it with alcohol, which proves a toxic combination."" Children as young as 11 abusing Xanax drug The Xanax drug users 'dicing with death' Teens 'buying Xanax on social media' The North East Ambulance Service, which provided the most comprehensive details to a BBC Freedom of Information request sent to six ambulance services, said thatin 2017 it had attended 240 callouts for Xanax abuse by children, two of which had been for 11-year-olds. Drugs, alcohol and tobacco director Rosanna O'Connor says: ""Despite fewer under-18s asking for help with drug and alcohol problems, it remains a significant issue andthe latest data,externalshows an increasing number of young people needing treatment for benzodiazepines. ""However, there is limited evidence and data for these drugs, so we do not have a clear picture of changes in use. ""Benzodiazepines are risky when taken without medical supervision and mixing them with alcohol or other drugs increases the risk of harm, particularly when mixed with other sedatives.""

Bradley Cooper is also nominated for his direction of and performance in the musical remake. Olivia Colman is also up for a best actress award for The Favourite, for which Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are also recognised. Rosamund Pike is nominated for best actress in a film drama, alongside Lady Gaga, for her role in A Private War. Colman, meanwhile, will compete for the best actress in a film musical or comedy award with Emily Blunt, shortlisted for playing the title role in Mary Poppins Returns. Golden Globes: 2019 nominations in full Constance Wu is first Asian woman nominated in decades Blunt said she was ""blown away and over the moon"" to receive her sixth Golden Globe nomination, adding that she was ""delighted in playing every aspect of this extraordinary and iconic character."" ""The entire experience working on it was spellbinding and that's largely to do with the incomparable [director] Rob Marshall who took on this project with great love, depth and courage in his heart."" Weisz also expressed gratitude, saying she was ""proud to be nominated alongside such a brilliant group of actresses, including my incredible co-star Emma"". ""And all hail our nominated Queen Olivia!"" she continued. ""These honours are a testament to the brilliance of our director Yorgos Lanthimos.""

Other British talents in the running include Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw, nominated for their roles in BBC political drama A Very English Scandal. There are also TV nominations for Benedict Cumberbatch (for Patrick Melrose), Westworld's Thandie Newton and Sacha Baron Cohen, in contention for his satirical series Who is America?. By entertainment correspondent, Lizo Mzimba It's important to note that the 95 or so journalists of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association who vote for the Golden Globes are a very different body of people to the 8,200 film professionals of the Academy who vote in the Oscars. There's actually only one person who votes in both - actress turned journalist Lisa Lu, who plays the family matriarch in Crazy Rich Asians. So a good showing in the Golden Globes doesn't necessarily mean that Oscar glory is sure to follow. But it's wrong to say the Globes don't exert some influence. Right now DVDs and Blu-rays of awards contenders are piling up in the homes and offices of members of the Academy. Films that have been shut out today - like Mary, Queen of Scots and the Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic On the Basis of Sex - may well sink down the priorities pile of some voters. The good showing of movies like Vice, meanwhile, will no doubt see it rise closer to the top. The timing of the awards ceremony in January is crucial. The morning after the Globes are handed out, a week of Academy Awards voting begins. So a win at the Golden Globes might be the final decider for voters deciding which films to put on their Oscar nominations ballot. Bodyguard star Richard Madden is up for best actor in a TV drama for his role in the BBC One thriller, which is up for best TV drama. His fellow nominees include Welshman Matthew Rhys, who is shortlisted for the second time for his work in spy saga The Americans. Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw as they appeared in A Very English Scandal Vice, a satirical biopic of former US vice-president Dick Cheney, has the most nominations in all, with six citations including one for lead actor Christian Bale. A Star is Born, The Favourite and Green Book have five nominations each, while Mary Poppins Returns and Spike Lee's Black Klansman have four apiece. Comic book blockbuster Black Panther, Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody and If Beale Street Could Talk, the latest film from Moonlight director Barry Jenkins, will compete with A Star is Born and Black Klansman for the best film drama prize. Vice, The Favourite and Mary Poppins Returns are joined in the best film musical or comedy category by Green Book and Crazy Rich Asians. Rami Malek is nominated alongside Cooper for playing Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. Rami Malek was widely praised for his performance as Queen frontman Mercury The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story has the most TV nominations, getting four mentions in all. Former Glee star Darren Criss said it was ""insane"" and ""an honour,external"" to receive one of those nominations for playing the Italian fashion designer's killer. Sandra Oh - nominated herself for Killing Eve - and Brooklyn Nine-Nine's Andy Samberg will co-host the 76th Golden Globe Awards, to be held in Los Angeles on 6 January. At 84, Alan Arkin - up for best supporting actor in a series, limited series or TV movie for Netflix comedy The Kominsky Method - is the oldest nominated actor. The youngest is 15-year-old Elsie Fisher, whose performance as an insecure teenager in Eighth Grade sees her up for best actress in a film musical or comedy.

"Lena Dunham 'sorry' for defending writerThe Girls star says speaking up for Murray Miller out of ""blind faith"" was ""a terrible mistake"".Entertainment & Arts","Dunham said she had ""internalised the dominant male agenda that asks us to defend it no matter what"" TV actress and writer Lena Dunham has said publicly defending a writer on her show Girls after he was accused of rape was ""a terrible mistake"". Writing in The Hollywood Reporter,external, Dunham apologised for speaking up for Murray Miller out of ""blind faith"". She originally spoke about it last November after Miller was accused of assaulting an actress when she was 17. Miller has always denied the ""outrageous"" allegations, and in August prosecutors decided not to charge him. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office didn't pursue a prosecution because of the expiry of the statute of limitations and ""inconsistencies and the delay in reporting"",The Wrap reported in August,external. Murray Miller's lawyer said he had ""overwhelming evidence"" to prove his innocence Dunham, writing as guest editor of The Hollywood Reporter's Women in Hollywood edition, explained why she originally said she had ""insider knowledge"" that made her believe the accusation was false. ""When someone I knew, someone I had loved as a brother, was accused, I did something inexcusable: I publicly spoke up in his defence,"" she wrote. ""There are few acts I could ever regret more in this life. I didn't have the 'insider information' I claimed but rather blind faith in a story that kept slipping and changing and revealed itself to mean nothing at all."" She added: ""It's painful to realise that, while I thought I was self-aware, I had actually internalised the dominant male agenda that asks us to defend it no matter what, protect it no matter what, baby it no matter what."" Dunham felt a fierce backlash last year after publishing her original statement, which was written jointly with her fellow Girls showrunner Jenni Konner. She then apologised, saying it was ""absolutely the wrong time to come forward with such a statement"". At the time, Mr Miller's lawyer, Don Walerstein, said his client ""categorically and vehemently denies"" the allegations. He also said his legal team had ""overwhelming evidence directly contradicting these false and offensive claims"".

May 'looking at MPs' role over backstop',"This video can not be played The PM tells Radio 4's Today programme that the backstop would be part of any deal Theresa May says she ""is talking to colleagues"" about their concerns over the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" ahead of a crucial vote on her EU deal. She suggested MPs could be ""given a role"" in deciding whether to activate the backstop, which is designed to stop the return of a physical border. But she told the BBC there could be no deal with the EU without it. No 10 has said the Commons vote will go ahead on Tuesday, despite claims it could be delayed to avoid defeat. However, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbench MPs, Sir Graham Brady, told BBC Newsnight on Thursday that he ""would welcome the vote being deferred"" until there was ""clarity"" on the backstop issue. Parliament Live: Text updates as MPs debate Brexit Senior Tory suggests vote could be delayed Brexit: Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU And in another development, the European Court of Justice said it would deliver a ruling on Monday on whether the UK could unilaterally cancel Brexit by reversing Article 50 - the day before the MPs' crunch vote. This video can not be played Newsnight: Sir Graham Brady 'would welcome' Brexit vote being deferred The government is considering an amendment to next Tuesday's vote motion that would give Parliament more say over the backstop. One possible option would see Parliament having a role in deciding whether to extend the transition period or enter the backstop arrangement, if no trade deal has been reached by the end of December 2020. The transition period is due to kick-in when the UK leaves the EU on 29 March. It can only be extended once for ""up to one or two years"" - but if the two sides have still not agreed a deal by the end of that second period, then the backstop will apply. DUP will vote down deal but back Tories Reality Check: Legal advice on the Brexit deal This would mean Northern Ireland staying aligned to some EU rules, which many MPs say is unacceptable. The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop arrangement without EU agreement. Another option being explored with MPs, the BBC understands, is giving Parliament an annual vote on whether to stay in the backstop, once it has been activated, or to pursue other alternatives. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said discussions were ""very fluid"" and no decision had been reached in government about which option to choose. Downing Street has said there is no plan to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. This video can not be played Theresa May rejected suggestions that the UK should vote in a further referendum Mrs May told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had not given up on winning the vote on her Brexit deal - negotiated over the past 18 months or so - despite dozens of her own MPs and all opposition parties being against it. She said she recognised concerns about the Northern Ireland border backstop keeping the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. And she conceded the UK would have ""no unilateral right"" to pull out of the backstop under her EU withdrawal agreement - but she said the UK would have a choice over whether or not to enter into it. ""The backstop is something nobody wants to go into in the first place, and we will be working to make sure that we don't go into it,"" she said. ""If we get to the point where it might be needed, we have a choice as to what we do, so we don't even have to go into the backstop at that point."" She suggested Parliament could be ""given a role"" in deciding whether to enter the backstop and how the UK would get out of it. ""I recognise there are concerns from colleagues about the role of Parliament, about the sovereignty of the UK in relation to that issue, so I am talking to colleagues about how we can look at Parliament having a role in going into that and, if you like, coming out of that,"" she told Today. She again ruled out a further referendum and rejected alternative Brexit plans suggested by different factions of her party. ""None of the other arrangements that people have put forward fully deliver on the referendum. This deal delivers on the referendum,"" she said. This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor What Theresa May sketched out on Thursday was the idea of allowing MPs to choose when and if they want to go into the controversial ""backstop"" - the insurance policy against a hard border on the island of Ireland. Clearly, to try to get some angry Brexiteers to change their minds, the PM is trying to give a sense that they might have more of a say. They could, as the agreement already suggests, just extend the ""transition period"", giving the two sides longer to come up with a free trade deal that would mean the dreaded backstop is never used. It's not surprising that MPs would have a vote on that. But Number 10 clearly hopes it will give some grumpy MPs a sense that they will have more of a say, introducing another layer of decision-making so that the backstop can be avoided. Read more from Laura here But reacting to the latest proposals, Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said that if MPs passed the EU withdrawal agreement they would not be able to change the backstop because it would be part of a ""standalone international treaty"". So MPs would be limited to saying ""should we ask for an extension or should we let ourselves go in"". Fellow Brexiteer Suella Braverman, who quit the government over Mrs May's deal, said the PM's proposals were a ""red herring"" that would be ""ineffective"". And remain supporter Phillip Lee, who also quit as a minister over the deal and now backs a further referendum, dismissed the PM's ""cosmetic concessions"". ""It's clear that none of the big Brexit questions will be solved by this withdrawal agreement, and that the Brexit on offer is much worse than the deal we've already got in the EU,"" he said. The prime minister's support has grown by one, however, after Eastbourne MP Stephen Lloyd quit the Liberal Democrat group in the Commons to vote for her deal. Lloyd quits Lib Dem MPs' group over Brexit Conservative Sir Nicholas Soames has also spoken up for the PM's deal, on the the third day of debate about it in the Commons, which is focusing on the economic impact. This video can not be played Remainer Tory warns over US-style 'partisan bitterness' if deal rejected Ministers are arguing Mrs May's deal creates a unique partnership with the EU, while Labour insists it will make people poorer. The Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which keeps Mrs May's government in power, has said it would support the government in a confidence motion if the deal was thrown out on Tuesday. Sammy Wilson, the DUP's Brexit spokesman, told Today: ""Our grievance with the government has been that the government made a promise to us and to the people of Northern Ireland that Brexit would be delivered for the whole of the United Kingdom, and provided there is nothing introduced to break that promise, we have no reason to have no confidence in the government."" But he added the DUP could still withdraw support for the government at a future date.

Drakeford set to be WalesÃ¢ÂÂ first minister,"Mark Drakeford defeated Vaughan Gething and Eluned Morgan in the contest Mark Drakeford is set to become Wales' next first minister after winning the Welsh Labour leadership election. The pro-Corbyn finance secretary, who secured 53.9% of the vote after the count went to a second round, pledged to make Wales ""a beacon of hope in a darkening world"". He is expected to replace Carwyn Jones at the helm of the Welsh Government when he stands down next week. Vaughan Gething came second with 41.4% of the vote. Eluned Morgan was third. Deputy Welsh Labour leader Carolyn Harris revealed the election result at the Cardiff Principality Stadium on Thursday, after a contest that lasted eight months. The result as it happened Who is Mark Drakeford? Carmarthen-born academic Mr Drakeford, 64, has pledged toextend the smoking ban to town and city centres, andgive the parents of newborn babies a bundle of essential items. Around 175,000 people had the right to vote - including around 25,000 party members and others who are part of affiliated trade unions. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford pledged a brighter future for Wales in his acceptance speech Once confirmed, Mr Drakeford will take the helm of the Welsh Government, which has responsibility for health, education, transport and some taxation. As well as dealing with the Welsh response to Brexit, Mr Drakeford will be faced with whether to reshuffle his ministers, and whether to go ahead with building the M4 relief road south of Newport. By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor Mr Drakeford is congratulated by supporters after his election on Thursday Mark Drakeford is the ultimate government insider - an adviser to the late former first minister Rhodri Morgan before succeeding him as the AM for Cardiff West and holding a variety of senior positions at cabinet level. But while he is well known in political circles, many voters have never heard of him. This will be a challenge for him. He was always the front runner, but this result is closer than many people expected. He had the bulk of the support from Labour's big institutions, including Momentum - which has swelled the ranks of Welsh Labour members in the last couple of years. This result is not the resounding victory many predicted. One senior Labour figure and Drakeford supporter whispered to me: ""That was close."" Another said: ""A win's a win"". ""Who can remember what Carwyn's margin of victory was nine years ago?"" More from Felicity Mark Drakeford (L) has described the late Rhodri Morgan (R) as his mentor Mr Jones announced in April he would step down by the end of 2018 - he has been in the job for nine years. The Welsh Labour leader-elect told BBC Wales the party was going through a ""healing process"" after a turbulent twelve months following the death of Carl Sargeant. The former communities ministerwas found deadin November 2017 days after Mr Jones sacked him from his cabinet. Mr Drakeford said: ""The [leadership] election is part of that healing process."" He said he would work to give Wales a ""future which works for the many in our society and not simply for a privileged few"". In his acceptance speech he paid tribute to the defeated candidates, saying the ""richness of ideas"" they contributed in the campaign would make Welsh Labour ""a stronger party with a greater reservoir of commitment and strength"". Mr Drakeford said the ultimate aim was to have ""a Labour government in Westminster working with a Labour government in Wales"". ""Our most radical and successful days lie ahead of us"", he added.

""I know Mark will relentlessly fight for the interests of the Welsh people and stand up to the Tories' chronic underinvestment in Wales compared to other parts of the UK, particularly London,"" he added.

Mr Jones will tender his resignation to the Queen next Tuesday. Before the result Mr Jones said it had been the ""greatest honour of my life"" to be first minister. He said Welsh Labour ""will never stop until we see more justice, more fairness, more opportunity and more equality"". Voters in the election were able to vote for a first and second preference candidate. In the first round, Mark Drakeford won 46.9% of the vote, versus 30.8% for Vaughan Gething and 22.3% Eluned Morgan. After Eluned Morgan came third in the first round, the second preference votes of those who supported her were redistributed. As a result, Mark Drakeford got 53.9% while Vaughan Gething received 41.4%. Just over half - 53.1% - of the circa 25,000 party members voted in the Welsh Labour leadership election. A total of 5.67% of the around 150,000 members of affiliated groups including trade unions, voted. Carwyn Jones said it had been the ""greatest honour"" of his life to be first minister Carwyn Jones resigns next Tuesday by emailing the Queen The resignation takes effect when she replies The assembly will seek nominations for first minister the following Wednesday AMs will back their preference in a roll-call vote, with the Welsh Government majority set to install Mark Drakeford Under the rules of the assembly Mr Drakeford must be confirmed by AMs. This is expected to take place next week. Plaid Cymru and Welsh Conservatives are expected to nominate their own leaders - Adam Price and Paul Davies - for the role during the same vote. It will be a major shock if either of those bids are successful, with the Labour government holding a majority in the Senedd. Secretary of State for Wales, Tory MP Alun Cairns, welcomed Mr Drakeford saying he looked forward to working closely with him ""to secure a stronger economy in communities right across Wales"". Leader of the Welsh Conservatives in Cardiff Bay, Paul Davies, gave qualified congratulations, saying Mr Drakeford ""has a huge task ahead of him in solving the problems our nation is experiencing after decades of failure from successive Labour-led governments"". ""While Mark Drakeford has a mandate to lead from the Labour Party, he has no mandate to lead from the Welsh people; only a Welsh Assembly election will provide an opportunity for the public to endorse, or otherwise, his plans,"" he added. A Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said the ""mountain of issues"" Mr Drakeford faces ""is great and it is a mountain largely of his own making"". ""He was part of a Labour administration that has left us with an economy that still bounces across the bottom of league tables and public services crying out for help.""

Johnson apologises to MPs over payments,"This video can not be played Johnson offers 'full and unreserved apology' Boris Johnson has made a ""full and unreserved"" apology to MPs for failing to declare more than Â£52,000 in income. The former foreign secretary was ordered to apologise by the Committee on Standards over late declaration of book royalty payments. He made a brief statement to the Commons ahead of the latest debate on Theresa May's EU deal. Speaker John Bercow thanked him for his ""prompt"" response and said that was the end of the matter. Parliament's Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone had earlier ruled that the breaches were ""neither inadvertent nor minor"". She referred the case to the Committee on Standards to decide on a punishment for Mr Johnson. Boris Johnson under fire over newspaper role Johnson's Â£14,000 Saudi visit revealed MPs are required to declare payments for any work carried out in addition to their duties as an MP, in the Register of Members' Interests. Ms Stone found that Mr Johnson's registrations were late on four separate occasions, involving nine payments, ""which suggested a lack of attention to, or regard for, the House's requirements"". ""The committee concluded that Mr Johnson breached the rules of the House by failing to register remuneration within the required timetable on nine occasions,""the committee said in a report.,external ""In considering the appropriate sanction, it took into account what it considered to be aggravating and mitigating factors, and recommended that Mr Johnson make an apology to the House on a point of order."" The late declarations included a series of rights and royalty payments from Bulgaria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, France and the US for books ""already written"" by Mr Johnson. The committee said aggravating factors in calling for Mr Johnson to apologise included the size of the sums involved and the number of breaches. As a long-standing MP who had been a senior minister, he ""could be expected to set an example within the House"", it added. Mr Johnson responded ""promptly and helpfully"" when the issue was raised with him, apologised to the Commissioner and put in place ""effective measures to ensure that no further breach occurs"", the committee added. Making his apology, Mr Johnson told MPs the payments were ""mainly unexpected foreign royalties, which I am very sorry to say were recorded late on the register of Members' interests"". He added that he was ""grateful to the committee for recognising that there was no intention to mislead the House and that I had been completely transparent"".

Lawrence suspect admits drugs charge,"Jamie Acourt was never convicted of any offence relating to Stephen Lawrence's death A suspect in the 1993 racist murder of Stephen Lawrence has pleaded guilty to conspiring to supply ""huge quantities"" of cannabis resin. Jamie Acourt, 42, had previously denied the charge but changed his plea on thesecond day of his trial at Kingston Crown Court. Acourt, originally from Eltham, south-east London, was extradited from Spain where he was living until his arrest in May. He is due to be sentenced on Friday. Acourt was never convicted of the racist attack on Mr Lawrence and has always denied any involvement. Jurors had been told of the allegation against him and warned they should consider him solely on the trial's evidence. Acourt was arrested by armed officers as he left a gym in Barcelona on 4 May The basis of his plea was that it was agreed with the prosecution he was involved in the conspiracy to supply between 1 January 2014 and 2 May 2015 only. His 43-year-old brother Neil Acourt has already been jailed for more than six years over the drugs plot. Prosecutors believe both were ringleaders and they enlisted family members to the scheme that saw drugs transported between London and South Shields, Tyne and Wear. Acourt fled the country after police raided a home he lived in with his partner and their two children in Bexley, south-east London, in February 2016. He was arrested as he left a gym in Barcelona on 4 May and extradited back to Britain. Jailing him, judge Recorder Paul Clements said the plot would ""have kept the people of the Newcastle area in spliffs for many a long day"". It involved dozens of 600-mile round trips from London to South Shields, driving drugs up and bringing back cash. A total of seven men have now been convicted or found guilty over the conspiracy. They include the stepfather of Acourt's partner, Lee Birks, 57, of Orpington, south-east London, and Neil Acourt's 65-year-old father-in-law Jack Vose, of Bexley, south-east London. In 2012, Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted at the Old Bailey of murdering Mr Lawrence and jailed for life.

US dad makes 'bully' girl walk to school,"This was the second time his daughter had been reprimanded for bullying on the bus, the father said An Ohio father who made his daughter walk five miles (8km) to school as punishment for bullying has provoked a debate on parenting. After 10-year-old Kirsten was suspended for three days from the school bus for a second-time bullying offence, Matt Cox decided to teach her a life lesson. He made her trudge to school on a cold day while he followed behind in a car. The video of the father's punishment has garnered over 15m views on Facebook and thousands of comments.

In the viral clip, Mr Cox's daughter is seen walking alongside a road, carrying a backpack and school supplies, in 2C (36F) temperatures. Mr Cox follows behind her in his car in the town of Swanton, offering commentary on entitlement and bullying. ""Bullying is unacceptable,"" he said. ""This is my small way of trying to stop it in my household."" Mr Cox added that many children feel entitled to privileges like being taken to school in the morning by car or bus. ""I know a lot of you parents are not going to agree with this and that's alright,"" he says. ""I am doing what I feel is right to teach my daughter a lesson and to stop her from bullying."" 'I have a nose a mouth and can smile again' Should we stop listening to these Christmas songs? 'We're not pretending to be black' Why this arm caused outrage in Australia In a Facebook update shared on Wednesday, Mr Cox said his daughter had taken his words to heart. According toWTVG News,external, Mr Cox broke up Kirsten's walk over her three-day school bus suspension this week. The 10-year-old told WTVG she herself had been bullied and now knows to be kind. Children point finger at adults over bullying Schoolboy walks miles to fight off bullies Many of the 63,000 comments that have since popped up on his video have been positive, with parents of bullies and bullied alike thanking Mr Cox for his parenting. ""As the grandparent of an autistic boy who has been the victim of neighbourhood bullies, I applaud you! Too many parents do nothing,"" read one reply. Read another: ""Wish more parents took the time to hold their children accountable for unacceptable behaviour."" However, others pointed out that by shaming her with the punishment video, the girl was arguably being bullied by her father. ""Humiliate her by putting her on Facebook being punished. Irony,"" one user commented. ""Ok but wait, is she bullying other kids or did you stop to hear her explanation?"" said another. ""Was she reacting to being bullied and just got caught? If public shaming is your idea of punishment no wonder she's acting out."" Prof Dorothy Espelage of the University of Florida, a psychology researcher and expert on youth bullying, told the BBC it is far more common for parents of bullies to not admit their child is in the wrong. ""So in some ways, this father is doing the right thing of admitting and accepting his daughter's behaviour,"" she said. Prof Espelage says that children are less likely to act out if behaviours have consequences, but she would suggest a different approach than walking in the cold. ""I, like many of the folks who commented on the video, would like to know more about the bullying, the origins."" We asked BBC readers to tell us what they thought of Mr Cox's parenting strategy. Here's what they had to say: ""I admire this father for his action. It's not just the bullying he is addressing, it's the fact that kids nowadays think they are being owed privileges.""- Claudia Grotkamp ""Awful. Any parent that betrays their child's privacy so they can get their moment of fame and pat on the back is appalling. This isn't about his daughter, it's about getting people to say how good a parent he is. Poor girl.""- Lucy Wardle ""It's good to see that some parents still control their children instead of the other way round.""- Jenny Heffernon ""Some people may think that this punishment of a bully is hypocritical, as it seems like bullying itself. The hypocrisy lies with those who would let bullies go unpunished when a dose of their own medicine is the very best cure.""- D West ""Good measure! My son was bullied too. Too many parents cop out and blame their school for not bringing up their children right.""- Rasmus Langaard ""There has to be ongoing conversations about bullying and the impact it has,"" Prof Espelage added. ""This type of punishment is short-term and will not address the culture in the school or on the bus that is lending itself to bullying."" Mr Cox toldNews 5 Cleveland,externalthat he had shown Kirsten and his two other children the video and people's comments on it. They ""seem to show a great deal of empathy towards some of the sad stories that I read with them,"" Mr Cox said. He added that he hoped parents would ""start holding their kids accountable"".

Lena Dunham 'sorry' for defending writer,"Dunham said she had ""internalised the dominant male agenda that asks us to defend it no matter what"" TV actress and writer Lena Dunham has said publicly defending a writer on her show Girls after he was accused of rape was ""a terrible mistake"". Writing in The Hollywood Reporter,external, Dunham apologised for speaking up for Murray Miller out of ""blind faith"". She originally spoke about it last November after Miller was accused of assaulting an actress when she was 17. Miller has always denied the ""outrageous"" allegations, and in August prosecutors decided not to charge him. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office didn't pursue a prosecution because of the expiry of the statute of limitations and ""inconsistencies and the delay in reporting"",The Wrap reported in August,external. Murray Miller's lawyer said he had ""overwhelming evidence"" to prove his innocence Dunham, writing as guest editor of The Hollywood Reporter's Women in Hollywood edition, explained why she originally said she had ""insider knowledge"" that made her believe the accusation was false. ""When someone I knew, someone I had loved as a brother, was accused, I did something inexcusable: I publicly spoke up in his defence,"" she wrote. ""There are few acts I could ever regret more in this life. I didn't have the 'insider information' I claimed but rather blind faith in a story that kept slipping and changing and revealed itself to mean nothing at all."" She added: ""It's painful to realise that, while I thought I was self-aware, I had actually internalised the dominant male agenda that asks us to defend it no matter what, protect it no matter what, baby it no matter what."" Dunham felt a fierce backlash last year after publishing her original statement, which was written jointly with her fellow Girls showrunner Jenni Konner. She then apologised, saying it was ""absolutely the wrong time to come forward with such a statement"". At the time, Mr Miller's lawyer, Don Walerstein, said his client ""categorically and vehemently denies"" the allegations. He also said his legal team had ""overwhelming evidence directly contradicting these false and offensive claims"".

US inmate chooses electric chair death,"The electric chair has gradually been replaced as the main method of execution An inmate in the US state of Tennessee has been executed by electric chair after arguing that a lethal injection would involve suffering. David Earl Miller, who spent 36 years on death row, was the latest of an increasing number of inmates attempting to avoid lethal injection following several botched executions. Another Tennessee inmate, Edmund Zagorski, was electrocuted last month. Lethal injection is the state's main method of execution. However, Tennessee inmates on death row whose crimes were committed before 1999 are allowed to choose electrocution instead. The woman who watched 300 executions Life and Death Row: How the lethal injection kills Prior to Zagorski's execution, the electric chair had not been used since 2013. Miller was pronounced dead at 19:25 local time on Thursday (01:25 GMT Friday) at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville. Tennessee department of correction spokesman Tylee Tracer said that Miller's last words were: ""Beats being on death row."" Miller was found guilty of killing a 23-year-old mentally ill woman in 1981. In court, bothMiller and Zagorski had cited the August execution of Billy Ray Irick,external, who turned purple and took 20 minutes to die, AP reported. Zagorski's execution was the second time the state's electric chair had been used since 1960. Miller, 61, and Zagorski, 63, argued that the midazolam-based lethal injection used by Tennessee would lead to a prolonged and painful death. It follows a series of executions using different combinations of drug where prisoners have appeared to suffer. The US constitution bans cruel and unusual punishments. Tennessee electrocuted Edmund Zagorski last month In September a doctor told a court in Tennessee thatIrick felt pain akin to torture during his execution,external, The Tennessean newspaper reported. Dr David Lubarsky argued that the midazolam sedated Irick but did not prevent him from feeling the effects of the other two drugs injected as part of the execution. Proponents of lethal injection argue that the process is painless. Miller was also one of four death row inmates who brought a federal case,externalasking Tennessee to use a firing squad instead of either lethal injection or electrocution, the Tennessean reported. In neighbouring Alabama,more than 50 inmates have chosen to be killed in the nitrogen gas chamber,externalrather than be given a lethal injection after being given the option earlier this year, Vox reported. Electrocution is no longer the main method of execution in any US state. Courts in Georgia and Nebraska have said the electric chair is unconstitutional. This video can not be played The five ways the US executes - in 45 secs However, Miller was told he could not argue that the electric chair was unconstitutional because he himself had chosen it, AP reported. Hanging was the most common form of capital punishment in the US until the 1890s. Then, the electric chair became the most widespread method. In 1982, the first execution by lethal injection was carried out by the state of Texas, after which it gradually replaced the electric chair across the nation.

No end in sight for O2 data outage,"Mobile operator O2 has said its data networks have been restored after a day of disruption for smartphone users. A statement on its website,external, published early on Friday, said the 4G network was working again, having been affected from about 05:30 GMT on Thursday. It said the slower 3G data service had been reinstated on Thursday evening. But some users told the BBC they were still having issues with texting and urged O2 to fix the glitches. ""I have a Tesco mobile [which uses the O2 network] - any texts I send say 'not sent. Tap to try again',"" wrote Lesley. ""Each tap brings the same message! But I find the person I've sent it to actually has received it!"" Another user Steve wrote: ""No, it's most definitely not fixed as there are numerous error messages sending texts as well as duplicated sendings."" Can I claim compensation from O2? An O2 spokeswoman said: ""A small proportion of customers have reported issues sending text messages. We can see that the vast majority are being sent and received successfully and our technical teams are investigating. ""Our 3G and 4G data services are performing as normal."" Earlier, O2 and mobile network equipment supplier Ericsson issued a joint apology to the millions of customers hit by disruption to its data services. O2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users. Services such as bus timetable information were also affected, while many businesses faced disruption. Ericsson UK boss Marielle Lindgren said the ""faulty software"" that had caused the issues was being decommissioned. In a joint statement, O2 boss Mark Evans said: ""I want to let our customers know how sorry I am for the impact our network data issue has had on them, and reassure them that our teams, together with Ericsson, are doing everything we can. ""We fully appreciate it's been a poor experience and we are really sorry."" Ericsson said there had been network disruption for customers in multiple countries. Customers of O2 will be able to claim for any out-of-pocket expenses that resulted from being without their phone, according to consumer expert Helen Dewdney. Ms Dewdney, who writes a blog calledThe Complaining Cow,external, said users should be able to claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states that services should be carried out with reasonable skill and care. That means customers would be able to claim a refund for what they would pay on a contract for the time they were without the use of the phone. They could also claim consequential loss due to breach of contract, for example, if they incurred bank charges because they were unable to move their money, or the cost of having to use a payphone. This must be a genuine loss which can be proved with evidence. So, a taxi driver might be able to prove they lost out on fares owing to the shutdown, but other workers trying to claim a lost day of employment would struggle. Ms Dewdney suggested phone users calculated their losses, and wrote to O2 with the evidence. They should state what they wanted as redress and mention the Consumer Rights Act 2015. If they felt the response was unsatisfactory, it could be referred to Ombudsman Services: Communications of which O2 is a member. The customer would need to ask for a deadlock letter or wait eight weeks from the beginning of the complaint. Ericsson president BÃ¶rje Ekholm gave more detail about the cause of the disruption. He said ""an initial root cause analysis"" had indicated that the ""main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers"". The company was carrying out ""a complete and comprehensive root cause analysis"", he added. Japan's Softbank network was also affected by the outages, which meant services on Y!Mobile were disrupted. Network down: how people are coping without a signal O2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT. The company said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some O2 customers said they could not make calls or send texts either. The outage had knock-on effects for other services that use the O2 network, including Transport for London's electronic timetable service at bus stops, which stopped working. Tom Morrod at market research firm IHS Markit said data was increasingly important to consumers, with half of UK mobile users prioritising internet connectivity above calls and texts. ""As well as the inconvenience to consumers and the associated frustration, having a major network out of action creates productivity challenges for businesses. ""Many businesses will have employees commuting or out in the field that have lost work time,"" he said. O2 customers Mischa Bittar, Omeran Amirat and Luke Stagg have all suffered disruption On Thursday, several O2 customers described the effects the outage was having. Allison Rose-Mannall, from Norwich, is an insulin-dependent diabetic who relies on her mobile and was unable to get to a landline. ""I'm disabled ... I'm in a wheelchair,"" she told the BBC. ""So having no data but also no calls as well means I can't contact anyone if I have a fall or if I need anything."" Lynsey Greavesruns a company in Doncaster providing home visits to the elderly and vulnerable. Her 130 staff all rely on O2 phones to access rotas, schedules, names and addresses. She called in extra office staff to give out the information for each visit over the phone. ""There are nine of us trying to sort it now,"" she said. ""It's been a nightmare."" Luke Staggruns a plumbing business and depends on his phone, but he couldn't get through to customers or use his sat nav. ""That's a whole day wasted,"" he said. ""I'll be seeking to recoup my losses, especially as a business customer."" Mischa Bittaris also a plumber. He said he had been ""unable to contact any of my engineers or customers via email, unable to use our mobile systems to contact any engineers at all, so everyone's just had to down tools today"". ""A lot of money lost and the first thing I know about it is via the BBC website, no contact from O2 at all, disappointing,"" he added. Omeran Amiratsaid he had been a loyal O2 customer for a long time. He said he had bids on eBay on Thursday morning but he could not do them because the O2 network was down. ""It's Christmas, the budget's tight for me, there were presents I was supposed to be buying for my daughter and my son on eBay today. They've gone now."" He said he had lost the bids and ""O2 are responsible"".

Police drop drug-testing firm,"Most of the 10,000 cases that could be affected involved traffic offences Police have suspended all contracts with a drug-testing company amid allegations of data manipulation. Randox Testing Services (RTS) in Manchester was investigated aftertwo scientists were arrestedon suspicion of tampering with data. Police minister Nick Hurd understands the RTS is no longer working for the National Police Chiefs' Council. He said the firm was ""co-operating"" in retesting samples after the probe led to a review of more than 10,000 cases. The council said forensic tests across 42 police forces, including rapes and murders, were being considered possibly unreliable and needed re-examining. Mr Hurd told MPs: ""The police have suspended all contracts as I understand it with Randox. ""Randox are co-operating with us fully on the priority, which is to identify the priority cases [and] get the retesting done as quickly as possible."" A data anomaly in a drug-driving case was reported to RTS earlier this year He also said the cases of alleged wrongdoing could go back to 2010. Five people have also been interviewed under caution by Greater Manchester Police over the alleged manipulation by individuals working at an RTS site. The alleged misconduct emerged earlier this year when a data anomaly in a drug-driving case was reported to RTS. Potential data manipulation at a separate facility, Trimega Laboratories, isalso being investigated. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott claimed the ""scandal"" ""flowed directly"" from the decision to privatise the industry.

Here is a selection of some of the difficulties people have experienced when they were unable to use the service. Peter says that the outage shows how reliant we are on technology Peter Wilson, from West Drayton, realised the importance of mobile technology when his partner collapsed in central London. ""Libby collapsed in the branch of a well-known coffee chain when she was on her way to work,"" Peter told the BBC. The couple were eventually able to make contact via wi-fi and the emergency 999 number. Thankfully, Libby is now recovering but he says:  ""It made this morning very stressful and at a critical moment it provided clear evidence about how reliant we are on data and phone networks."" The 02 data outage meant that Greg was late for work and also had to abandon his bike Greg Ashworth, a senior insurance clerk in Blackpool, received a notification in the morning telling him there was no service on his network. To make matters worse, Greg told the BBC his motorbike also broke down on his way to work. Not only was he unable to phone his employer to say he was running late, he could not get through to the breakdown company. There was a limited service later on so he was eventually able to contact his manager and a taxi firm. ""The downside was I've had to abandon my motorbike."" Lynsey Greaves, who works for a domiciliary care agency in Doncaster, where electronic care monitoring is used, told the BBC carers were unable to see their rotas because of the outage. They were also unable to log in to service users' calls, see maps or send messages. ""It brought our company to a halt. Nightmare. What was their plan B?""

Drug-drive cases dropped,"Most of the 10,000 cases that could be affected involved traffic offences Around 50 drug-driving prosecutions have been dropped because original test results may have been ""manipulated"". More than 10,000 cases, including violent crime, may have been affected, police chiefs said. They probed Randox Testing Services in Manchester after two men were arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in February. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was ""the biggest forensic science scandal in the UK for decades"". Lawyers for two people convicted over road deaths are now seeking to take their cases to the Court of Appeal. Concerns have also been raised about thousands of drug test results relied on by the civil courts to determine child custody issues and employment cases. Whilst 1,500 retests will be carried out by the end of the year, thousands more will have to take place in 2018 to check the results. However, not all samples will be able to be re-tested as some are no longer viable because of their quality or quantity. James Vaughan, from the NPCC, said this was the situation for many of the 50 cases dropped that were due to go to trial. Not every court was sympathetic to requests for proceedings to be adjourned, which in turn led to more cases being dropped, he added. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Most of the 10,000 cases that could be affected involved traffic offences The scale of the re-testing that will now have to take place, together with a dearth of suitably-qualified experts, is such that police reckon it will be three years before all the re-testing is completed. I think that's a conservative estimate - it does not include the re-testing that may have to be done in non-criminal cases. The impact on an overstretched criminal justice system, where there are already delays in examining forensic evidence, can't be under-estimated; neither can the effect this will all have on public confidence. It will also doubtless raise questions about the decision to close down the government-owned Forensic Science Service in 2012, though private companies already played a big part in scientific testing before then. A total of 42 police forces across the country sent data to the laboratory for testing. Of the 10,000 cases that could have been affected, 75% were traffic offences, such as drug driving, the National Police Chiefs' Council said. Other cases included violent crime, sexual offences and unexplained deaths. So far, re-tests on samples involved in sexual offence cases, violence or homicide have showed no change. Potential data manipulation at a different facility, Trimega Laboratories, is also being investigated by Greater Manchester Police, said the NPCC. In these incidents, child protection and family court cases could be affected. Nick Hurd, the minister for policing, fire and criminal justice, said all tests carried out by Trimega between 2010 and 2014were currently being treated as ""potentially unreliable"",external. He also said due to ""poor record-keeping practices"", it may not be possible to identify all the customers affected. The Forensic Services Regulator said it had asked all major centres to carry out an audit of their cases to look at whether the issue was more widespread, but no evidence was uncovered. Gillian Tully, from the regulator, said: ""If there was large-scale manipulation going on across the board, I do expect it would have been found during that audit."" Nick Freeman, a solicitor who has defended clients who were inaccurately tested for drugs by Randox, said: ""It's absolutely imperative that the public have total confidence in a thoroughly reliable forensic science service, because we need to be sure that the results that are produced are 100% accurate. ""If they're not, innocent people are going to lose their children, be incarcerated, have their lives destroyed, on the basis of an entirely false premise."" Mr Hurd added: ""The government recognises the seriousness of this issue and the potential impact on public confidence in the use of forensic science within the justice system. ""The senior judiciary are aware and government officials are working with the police to monitor the scale of the issue, as information emerges.""

Police make three Ã¢ÂÂneo-NaziÃ¢ÂÂ terror arrests,"Police investigating extreme right-wing activity in the UK have arrested three men on suspicion of terrorism offences. Those arrested are a 17-year-old from London, a 21-year-old from Bath and an 18-year-old from Portsmouth. The BBC understands the investigation relates to alleged activity by a neo-Nazi group called the Sonnenkrieg Division. Searches are ongoing at four properties in Bath, London, Portsmouth and Leeds, officers said. Police said the arrests, made by officers from the North East Counter Terrorism Unit, were part of a planned operation. The three men are being interviewed in police stations in London and Bath. The 21-year-old was arrested on suspicion of possessing material useful to someone preparing an act of terrorism and conspiracy to inspire racial or religious hatred. The 17-year-old was arrested on suspicion of encouraging terrorism, dissemination of terrorist publications, and conspiracy to inspire racial or religious hatred. The 18-year-old was arrested on suspicion of encouraging terrorism and dissemination of terrorist publications.

Jamie Acourt pleads guilty to drugs charge,"Jamie Acourt was never convicted of any offence relating to Stephen Lawrence's death A suspect in the 1993 racist murder of Stephen Lawrence has pleaded guilty to conspiring to supply ""huge quantities"" of cannabis resin. Jamie Acourt, 42, had previously denied the charge but changed his plea on thesecond day of his trial at Kingston Crown Court. Acourt, originally from Eltham, south-east London, was extradited from Spain where he was living until his arrest in May. He is due to be sentenced on Friday. Acourt was never convicted of the racist attack on Mr Lawrence and has always denied any involvement. Jurors had been told of the allegation against him and warned they should consider him solely on the trial's evidence. Acourt was arrested by armed officers as he left a gym in Barcelona on 4 May The basis of his plea was that it was agreed with the prosecution he was involved in the conspiracy to supply between 1 January 2014 and 2 May 2015 only. His 43-year-old brother Neil Acourt has already been jailed for more than six years over the drugs plot. Prosecutors believe both were ringleaders and they enlisted family members to the scheme that saw drugs transported between London and South Shields, Tyne and Wear. Acourt fled the country after police raided a home he lived in with his partner and their two children in Bexley, south-east London, in February 2016. He was arrested as he left a gym in Barcelona on 4 May and extradited back to Britain. Jailing him, judge Recorder Paul Clements said the plot would ""have kept the people of the Newcastle area in spliffs for many a long day"". It involved dozens of 600-mile round trips from London to South Shields, driving drugs up and bringing back cash. A total of seven men have now been convicted or found guilty over the conspiracy. They include the stepfather of Acourt's partner, Lee Birks, 57, of Orpington, south-east London, and Neil Acourt's 65-year-old father-in-law Jack Vose, of Bexley, south-east London. In 2012, Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted at the Old Bailey of murdering Mr Lawrence and jailed for life.

"Huawei arrest is rights abuse, says China","Meng Wanzhou was detained while transferring between flights in Vancouver China is demanding the release of telecoms giant Huawei's chief financial officer, who has been detained in Canada. Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the company's founder, could face extradition to the US. She was arrested in Vancouver on 1 December, but the news was not made public at her request. The charges remain unknown but the US has been probing Huawei over possible violation of sanctions against Iran. China says her detention is possibly a rights abuse. Ms Meng has sought a publication ban on the details of the arrest, which has been granted by the courts. Huawei said it was ""not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng"". Should we worry about Huawei? Why hasn't the UK blocked Huawei? Huawei in the crosshairs of a trade war Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker after Samsung. European shares hit a two-year low and indexes across Asia dropped sharplyfollowing the arrest, which analysts said revived worries over the US-China trade war. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters: ""The detention without giving any reason violates a person's human rights."" ""We have made solemn representations to Canada and the US, demanding that both parties immediately clarify the reasons for the detention, and immediately release the detainee to protect the person's legal rights."" Beijing has itself frequently been accused by rights groups of rights abuses including unexplained detentions. A quick guide to the US-China trade war Human rights: What is China accused of? Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world However, concerns the arrest would affect the 90-day tariff truce negotiated between the two nations at the G20 have not yet materialised. China announced in a regular press briefing on Thursday that it would ""immediately"" implement the measures agreed. It also coincides with moves to restrict the use of Huawei technology in Western countries. The US, Australia and New Zealand have blocked the use of the Chinese firm's equipment in infrastructure for new faster 5G mobile networks. Canada's ministry of justice said a bail hearing for Ms Meng had been set for Friday. By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia Business Correspondent It is hard to overstate the symbolism and significance of this event. Huawei is the crown jewel of Chinese tech and Ms Meng is effectively its princess. Even though it's still not clear what the charges against her are, this is not simply a case about the arrest of one woman, or just one company. This arrest could materially damage the relationship between the US and China at possibly one of the most sensitive times between the two countries in their long and torrid history. The gloves are off. Things have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. Read more from Karishma US media reported that Huawei is under investigation for potential violations of US sanctions against Iran. One report in the New York Times saidthe US commerce and treasury departments had subpoenaed the firm,externalover suspected violation of sanctions against both Iran and North Korea. US lawmakers have repeatedly accused the company of being a threat to US national security, arguing that its technology could be used for spying by the Chinese government. Meanwhile, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said on Thursday that he had known in advance about Ms Meng's arrest. He told National Public Radio that he didn't know if President Donald Trump had also been aware. In a statement, Huawei said it had complied with ""all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU."" The arrest is a top trending topic on Chinese social media, BBC Monitoring says, with many users criticising the US and Canada for what they call ""low"" and ""bullying"" tactics. Some Western governments fear Beijing will gain access to fifth-generation (5G) mobile and other communications networks through Huawei and expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control. Meng Wanzhou was pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a 2014 investment event in Moscow The US has brought a number of legal cases against Chinese technology firms, with accusations such as cyber-security theft and violations of Iran sanctions. Donald Trump last month reinstated all the US sanctions on Iranthat had been removed under a 2015 nuclear deal. Mr Trump had been fiercely opposed to the deal, which saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Should we worry about Huawei?

LiveMPs continue debate on Brexit deal4 minutes ago4 minutes ago Green: Brexit deal 'needs to aim at uniting the country'Green: Brexit deal 'needs to aim at uniting the country'4 minutes ago Lloyd quits Lib Dem MPs' group over BrexitLloyd quits Lib Dem MPs' group over Brexit9 minutes ago Lib Dem MP resigns party whipLib Dem MP resigns party whip,"MPs continued debating the government's Brexit deal, ahead of vote next Tuesday Thursday's debate focused on the economic impact of the agreement Commons business began with questions to Brexit ministers House of Lords also debated the Brexit deal this afternoon Sophie Morris, Ryan Brown and Robbie Hawkins The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Brexit officially happened on 31 January but the UK is now in a transition period until the end of 2020. Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. Members of Parliament (MPs) will vote next week on the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated. Sir Graham Brady ""would welcome"" a delay in the Brexit vote if it would help resolve MPs' concerns. House of CommonsParliament That's it for our coverage today, as MPs complete their third day of debate on the withdrawal agreement. Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire is now introducing his adjournment debate on the illegal trade in seahorses in the UK. MPs are due to continue their debate on the Brexit deal on Monday afternoon. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament International Trade Secretary Liam Fox says the ""status quo has never been on offer"" as the EU ""wants an ever closer union"". ""We have to find a compromise that makes this workable,"" he says, adding: ""the withdrawal agreement achieves just that, and is the only deal on the table"". DUP MP Ian Paisley intervenes to says the ""gallows are being built"" for the deal ahead of Tuesday's planned vote - and asks if there have been discussions about delaying it. Liam Fox replies says ministers will ""continue to make the case"" for the deal, but adds: ""the government will want to talk to members, of course it will want to look to ways to give a reassurance"". He says ""I understand why MPs have concerns about the backstop, but it is clear that it is there to be a temporary measure"". Liam Fox says Labour is ""playing politics at a time of great national decision-making"", and their Brexit policy is ""ill-researched and delusional"". He says that by agreeing to hold to the referendum, Parliament ""sub-contracted its sovereignty"" to voters, and MPs must now ""live up to our side of the bargain"".  Allow Twitter content?

Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Winding up the debate for Labour, shadow international trade minister Barry Gardiner says the government has ""tried to exclude Parliament from the process at all stages"". ""This is a deal that members on all sides now believe is not in the best interest of the country,"" he says. Mr Gardiner says the UK will be ""much poorer than we otherwise would be"" under the government's agreement. He calls on Liam Fox to be ""yet more flexible still"" on the next steps for Brexit, and ""recall his own words"" given to a Sunday newspaper in 2012. Back then, he says, Mr Fox called for the UK to renegotiate a ""new relationship"" with the EU, based on ""an economic partnership involving a customs union and the single market in goods and services"". ""The secretary of state may not like it, but it sounds an awful lot like Labour party policy to me"", he adds. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Like other MPs today, the DUP's Jim Shannon picks up on the proposed 'backstop' plan for the Irish border in the government's deal. He says there is ""no legal form for leaving this international treaty without consent"", adding that this is ""not acceptable"". He says the people of Northern Ireland must stand up for themselves and he has ""a mistrust for the government at this time"". ""The government have voted for Northern Ireland to become a voiceless victim of the UK,"" he concludes. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Next up this evening is Labour MP Karen Lee - who was a Remainer in 2016 but her constituency of Lincoln voted to leave. She ""sincerely believes"" there is a Brexit deal that will benefit her constituents, she says. ""But this deal will not protect jobs, workplace rights or environmental standards, and it will inhibit business by failing to ensure frictionless trade"", she adds. ""We can renegotiate with the EU - or better still, hold a general election"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Vicky Ford - who used to be member of the European Parliament and voted Remain - says MPs need to respect the vote to leave. ""A second referendum would be even more divisive and no more decisive,"" she adds. Ms Ford says leaving the EU with no deal poses ""a huge risk"" and the withdrawal agreement helps real businesses remain secure and offers time to develop a future framework. She calls Labour's plan of ""a close relationship with the single market without being in it"" a ""fantasy land"". Ms Ford says the backstop plan is not a ""practical risk"", as remaining in the arrangement permanently ""is not in the EU's interest"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Andrew Bowie says many of his colleagues on the Conservative benches are still ""struggling to come to a conclusion"" on which way they will vote. He adds that he voted to leave the EU ""and supports the deal"". Mr Bowie says he backs the agreement ""as it is the best for business, his constituents and Scotland"". ""I believe this deal is better than what we have now,"" he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman says the deal provides no certainty and there is no guarantee that a better one could be negotiated. Leaving without a deal on the other hand is not an option, she adds. The only other option is that MPs go back to the people and tell them the truth that ""we cannot leave the club and expect to keep all the benefits"". ""That is mission impossible"", she says. ""It is time for a people's vote"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Lee Rowley says ""we are arguing over commas in this deal, when whole paragraphs of it do not work"", and for this reason he will not be backing the deal. ""I did not come to this place to make people poorer,"" he says. ""I cannot go back to my constituents and say this deal gives them Brexit - it does not"". He says he disagrees with the deal as it is ""a failure of nerve and ambition"", and calls for it to be stopped. Mr Rowley calls on the government ""to move the UK out of its shadow"" and ""get Brexit back on track"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi says the Brexitlegal advicepublished this week shows Northern Ireland ""has been sold out"". The Brexit process has been ""blurred, botched and bungled from the very start"", he adds. Mr Singh Dhesi says the prime minister is ""not up to the task"" and ""has created division and discord"". The Conservatives must ""stand aside"" to allow a general election, he concludes. House of LordsParliament The debate on the government's Brexit deal has ended - and business in the House of Lords for today comes to an end. Peers will resume the debate on Monday. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of LordsParliament Wrapping up the Lords debate, Tory peer Lord Horam says the referendum result was ""a wake up call"". He says the withdrawal agreement is ""surprisingly good in the circumstances"", but Brexit is not the answer to the ""fundamental social problems"" that triggered the vote to leave. He does not expect the agreement to win Parliament's approval, he says, warning that if the decision is to be returned to the people the Remain side must do better. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate Conservative MP Maggie Throup says she will be supporting the government's Brexit deal next week ""if it stays the same"". She says another referendum would be ""undemocratic"". She calls for MPs to ""end the political games, and reflect on what the consequences of rejecting this deal will be"". ""This deal is in the public interest,"" she says. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Giles Watling, who voted Remain, says he was re-elected in his leave-voting constituency because his party pledged to ""deliver on their wishes"". The government's Brexit deal ""does tick so many of the boxes"", he says - but he adds that he still has ""serious concerns"" about the backstop. ""What has been the point of the last two years of uncertainty and pain"" he asks, if the UK is ""still under the dominion the European Court of Justice"". ""Best endeavours"" to negotiate a future relationship deal are ""not cast iron"", he concludes. Â© 2025 BBC.

Data problems hit O2 mobile network,"Mobile operator O2 has said its data networks have been restored after a day of disruption for smartphone users. A statement on its website,external, published early on Friday, said the 4G network was working again, having been affected from about 05:30 GMT on Thursday. It said the slower 3G data service had been reinstated on Thursday evening. But some users told the BBC they were still having issues with texting and urged O2 to fix the glitches. ""I have a Tesco mobile [which uses the O2 network] - any texts I send say 'not sent. Tap to try again',"" wrote Lesley. ""Each tap brings the same message! But I find the person I've sent it to actually has received it!"" Another user Steve wrote: ""No, it's most definitely not fixed as there are numerous error messages sending texts as well as duplicated sendings."" Can I claim compensation from O2? An O2 spokeswoman said: ""A small proportion of customers have reported issues sending text messages. We can see that the vast majority are being sent and received successfully and our technical teams are investigating. ""Our 3G and 4G data services are performing as normal."" Earlier, O2 and mobile network equipment supplier Ericsson issued a joint apology to the millions of customers hit by disruption to its data services. O2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users. Services such as bus timetable information were also affected, while many businesses faced disruption. Ericsson UK boss Marielle Lindgren said the ""faulty software"" that had caused the issues was being decommissioned. In a joint statement, O2 boss Mark Evans said: ""I want to let our customers know how sorry I am for the impact our network data issue has had on them, and reassure them that our teams, together with Ericsson, are doing everything we can. ""We fully appreciate it's been a poor experience and we are really sorry."" Ericsson said there had been network disruption for customers in multiple countries. Customers of O2 will be able to claim for any out-of-pocket expenses that resulted from being without their phone, according to consumer expert Helen Dewdney. Ms Dewdney, who writes a blog calledThe Complaining Cow,external, said users should be able to claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states that services should be carried out with reasonable skill and care. That means customers would be able to claim a refund for what they would pay on a contract for the time they were without the use of the phone. They could also claim consequential loss due to breach of contract, for example, if they incurred bank charges because they were unable to move their money, or the cost of having to use a payphone. This must be a genuine loss which can be proved with evidence. So, a taxi driver might be able to prove they lost out on fares owing to the shutdown, but other workers trying to claim a lost day of employment would struggle. Ms Dewdney suggested phone users calculated their losses, and wrote to O2 with the evidence. They should state what they wanted as redress and mention the Consumer Rights Act 2015. If they felt the response was unsatisfactory, it could be referred to Ombudsman Services: Communications of which O2 is a member. The customer would need to ask for a deadlock letter or wait eight weeks from the beginning of the complaint. Ericsson president BÃ¶rje Ekholm gave more detail about the cause of the disruption. He said ""an initial root cause analysis"" had indicated that the ""main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers"". The company was carrying out ""a complete and comprehensive root cause analysis"", he added. Japan's Softbank network was also affected by the outages, which meant services on Y!Mobile were disrupted. Network down: how people are coping without a signal O2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT. The company said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some O2 customers said they could not make calls or send texts either. The outage had knock-on effects for other services that use the O2 network, including Transport for London's electronic timetable service at bus stops, which stopped working. Tom Morrod at market research firm IHS Markit said data was increasingly important to consumers, with half of UK mobile users prioritising internet connectivity above calls and texts. ""As well as the inconvenience to consumers and the associated frustration, having a major network out of action creates productivity challenges for businesses. ""Many businesses will have employees commuting or out in the field that have lost work time,"" he said. O2 customers Mischa Bittar, Omeran Amirat and Luke Stagg have all suffered disruption On Thursday, several O2 customers described the effects the outage was having.

Six post-Brexit vote scenarios,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

French government fears 'major violence',"The scene on Thursday in Nantes, as school students protested against education reforms The French government says it fears ""major violence"" in Paris on Saturday as the national ""yellow vests"" protest movement shows little sign of easing. The Eiffel Tower is to close along with many shops, restaurants and museums and thousands more police will be on duty. The government said it was scrapping the fuel tax increases in its budget - the original spark for the protests. But broader discontent with the government has spread, and protests have erupted over several other issues. On Thursday young people took to the streets, protesting over educational reforms. More than 140 people were arrested when a protest outside a school in Mantes-la-Jolie in Yvelines ended in clashes with police. Dozens of other schools were blockaded in cities including Marseille, Nantes and Paris. Students have been angered by President Emmanuel Macron's plans to change the end-of-school exam, known as the baccalaureate, which is required for entrance to university. Critics fear the reforms will limit opportunity and breed inequality. Meanwhile, Saturday's planned rally of the yellow vests looks set to go ahead. Recent protests have turned violent, causing millions of euros in damage. Students at Saint-Exupery high school in Mantes-la-Jolie were detained by police Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe said that ""exceptional means"" would be used on Saturday. He said 89,000 police officers would be on duty across France and armoured vehicles would be deployed in the capital - the first time since 1968. Confirming that the fuel tax had been abandoned, he told senators that the calm of most protesters around the country contrasted with the ""extreme violence"" seen in Paris. ""Unlike others, I'm not seeking to apportion blame for this anger,"" he said. As mayor of the northern port of Le Havre he said he had felt local anger rise every year, after every election. ""It's been muted for a long time, because it's been silenced for a long time, by shame, sometimes by pride."" Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Ball in Macron's court after violent protests The protest on Saturday 1 December descended into the worst rioting seen in decades, with hundreds of injuries and arrests. The government says extremists hijacked the protests and incited violence. French health minister AgnÃ¨s Buzyn, speaking to RTL Radio on Thursday morning, said: ""There is a concern about this violence, and some who do not want to find a solution."" The government is considering mobilising the military to protect important national monuments, French broadcaster BFMTV reported, after the world-famous Arc de Triomphe was damaged last week. Police advised stores and restaurants on the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es to shut for the day. A series of football matches have also been postponed. They include those between Paris and Montpellier, Monaco and Nice, Toulouse and Lyon, and Saint-Etienne and Marseille. The yellow vests protests have moved beyond the initial anger over fuel taxes. Last week, the movement - despite a lack of central leadership - issued more than 40 demands to government. Among them were a minimum pension, widespread changes to the tax system, and a reduction in the retirement age. The government has already acknowledged some of the concerns, suggesting it may review the ""wealth tax"" it abolished after taking power. An analysis of its original budget plans for 2018-2019 showed it benefitted the very wealthy rather than the very poor. Other groups, bolstered by the success of the national movement, have also begun separate actions. One police union, Vigi, called for a strike of its administrative staff working in the interior ministry for Saturday - saying that without the support of such staff, riot police would be immobilised. Two road transport unions, the CGT and FO, have called for a strike among its 700,000 members on Sunday, Le Monde reported. Drivers have been affected by changes to overtime payments, the unions say, which affect the purchasing power of its members.

Forensic lab error drug offences quashed,"Police chiefs said the cases were dropped after a ""most serious breach"" of forensic science standards At least 40 motorists convicted of drug-driving offences have been cleared after evidence of manipulation was found in the forensic testing process. The motorists were banned from driving and in some cases fined, but their convictions have since been overturned. About 10,500 test results are being reviewed after alleged manipulation of data at Randox Testing Services. The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) described it as a ""most serious breach"" of forensic science standards. A further 50 drug-driving cases have been dropped as a result of the alleged data manipulation at the firm's Manchester laboratory. Randox has issueda statement,externalrevealing it had acted as ""whistleblower"" after discovering manipulation by its own staff in January 2017. Police suspended all contractswith Randox, used by 42 of the UK's police forces, in November last year. Greater Manchester Police hasarrested two men, aged 47 and 31, who worked at one of its laboratories. They were arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Six others have been interviewed under caution, with one remaining under investigation as part of what Justice Minister Lucy Frazier described last month as an ""expansive"" criminal inquiry. Hudgell Solicitors are representing 35 people who have already had their convictions quashed, and others who are pursuing civil cases seeking damages. Andrew Petherbridge, the firm's head of civil liberties, said: ""This is a national scandal which has had a devastating impact on the lives of the many people we are representing. ""People have lost their driving licences, and as a result lost their employment, struggled to pay bills such as mortgages and rents, and some have been unable to travel to see their families and children."" Scaffolder Luke Pearson, 26, from Manchester, was breathalysed and performed a road side drugs test for Greater Manchester Police after an accident in November 2016. He tested positive for being over the drug-drive limit, and being an occasional cannabis user, accepted a 12 month ban and a fine of Â£480. His conviction was overturned in February in light of the Randox investigation. ""It was devastating to me,"" he said. ""I needed to travel to sites as part of my job as a scaffolder as we worked across the country, so as a result of me being banned I lost my job. ""I'd even been offered a job as a foreman for a company and they were prepared to give me a company car to travel around sites, but of course that opportunity was lost when I was banned."" Mr Pearson said that it put ""a strain on life and on my relationship with my girlfriend"" as he ""struggled with bills and rent"". He added that he trusted ""police and the legal system to look after you and do the right thing"" and said the situation ""takes away that trust."" Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent The scale of the operation to review the 10,500 Randox cases is unprecedented. It began in January 2017 and is likely to continue until the end of 2019. Randox, which is paying for samples to be re-tested by other laboratories, estimates it will cost the firm Â£2.5m. Police are also likely to incur costs because of delays to other cases, while motorists whose careers and livelihoods have been affected after being wrongly banned from driving may sue for compensation. But the most significant impact of this disturbing affair may be on public confidence in forensic science: can we be sure that the test results we almost take for granted are accurate? In total, up to 2,700 cases have been re-analysed so far and two drug-driving cases that resulted in road deaths were referred to the Court of Appeal. Both convictions were upheld but one motorist's sentence was reduced. Killer drug-drivers' conviction quash bid Drug-driving cases dropped over forensics Two other non-fatal cases involving drug-driving have also been sent to the Court of Appeal. One conviction was quashed and the other has yet to be decided. Ch Con James Vaughan, NPCC lead on forensics, said he could not remember a forensic science failure ""of this magnitude"". He said re-testing was taking longer than expected because there was a ""chronic shortage"" of scientific expertise and accredited laboratories, leading to delays in providing toxicology analysis in unrelated cases of sexual offence and rape.

"May 'looking at MPs' role over backstop'Theresa May tells the BBC she is ""talking to colleagues"" about their concerns over her Brexit deal.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played The PM tells Radio 4's Today programme that the backstop would be part of any deal Theresa May says she ""is talking to colleagues"" about their concerns over the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" ahead of a crucial vote on her EU deal. She suggested MPs could be ""given a role"" in deciding whether to activate the backstop, which is designed to stop the return of a physical border. But she told the BBC there could be no deal with the EU without it. No 10 has said the Commons vote will go ahead on Tuesday, despite claims it could be delayed to avoid defeat. However, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbench MPs, Sir Graham Brady, told BBC Newsnight on Thursday that he ""would welcome the vote being deferred"" until there was ""clarity"" on the backstop issue. Parliament Live: Text updates as MPs debate Brexit Senior Tory suggests vote could be delayed Brexit: Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU And in another development, the European Court of Justice said it would deliver a ruling on Monday on whether the UK could unilaterally cancel Brexit by reversing Article 50 - the day before the MPs' crunch vote. This video can not be played Newsnight: Sir Graham Brady 'would welcome' Brexit vote being deferred The government is considering an amendment to next Tuesday's vote motion that would give Parliament more say over the backstop. One possible option would see Parliament having a role in deciding whether to extend the transition period or enter the backstop arrangement, if no trade deal has been reached by the end of December 2020. The transition period is due to kick-in when the UK leaves the EU on 29 March. It can only be extended once for ""up to one or two years"" - but if the two sides have still not agreed a deal by the end of that second period, then the backstop will apply. DUP will vote down deal but back Tories Reality Check: Legal advice on the Brexit deal This would mean Northern Ireland staying aligned to some EU rules, which many MPs say is unacceptable. The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop arrangement without EU agreement. Another option being explored with MPs, the BBC understands, is giving Parliament an annual vote on whether to stay in the backstop, once it has been activated, or to pursue other alternatives. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said discussions were ""very fluid"" and no decision had been reached in government about which option to choose. Downing Street has said there is no plan to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. This video can not be played Theresa May rejected suggestions that the UK should vote in a further referendum Mrs May told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had not given up on winning the vote on her Brexit deal - negotiated over the past 18 months or so - despite dozens of her own MPs and all opposition parties being against it. She said she recognised concerns about the Northern Ireland border backstop keeping the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. And she conceded the UK would have ""no unilateral right"" to pull out of the backstop under her EU withdrawal agreement - but she said the UK would have a choice over whether or not to enter into it. ""The backstop is something nobody wants to go into in the first place, and we will be working to make sure that we don't go into it,"" she said. ""If we get to the point where it might be needed, we have a choice as to what we do, so we don't even have to go into the backstop at that point."" She suggested Parliament could be ""given a role"" in deciding whether to enter the backstop and how the UK would get out of it. ""I recognise there are concerns from colleagues about the role of Parliament, about the sovereignty of the UK in relation to that issue, so I am talking to colleagues about how we can look at Parliament having a role in going into that and, if you like, coming out of that,"" she told Today. She again ruled out a further referendum and rejected alternative Brexit plans suggested by different factions of her party. ""None of the other arrangements that people have put forward fully deliver on the referendum. This deal delivers on the referendum,"" she said. This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor What Theresa May sketched out on Thursday was the idea of allowing MPs to choose when and if they want to go into the controversial ""backstop"" - the insurance policy against a hard border on the island of Ireland. Clearly, to try to get some angry Brexiteers to change their minds, the PM is trying to give a sense that they might have more of a say. They could, as the agreement already suggests, just extend the ""transition period"", giving the two sides longer to come up with a free trade deal that would mean the dreaded backstop is never used. It's not surprising that MPs would have a vote on that. But Number 10 clearly hopes it will give some grumpy MPs a sense that they will have more of a say, introducing another layer of decision-making so that the backstop can be avoided. Read more from Laura here But reacting to the latest proposals, Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said that if MPs passed the EU withdrawal agreement they would not be able to change the backstop because it would be part of a ""standalone international treaty"". So MPs would be limited to saying ""should we ask for an extension or should we let ourselves go in"". Fellow Brexiteer Suella Braverman, who quit the government over Mrs May's deal, said the PM's proposals were a ""red herring"" that would be ""ineffective"". And remain supporter Phillip Lee, who also quit as a minister over the deal and now backs a further referendum, dismissed the PM's ""cosmetic concessions"". ""It's clear that none of the big Brexit questions will be solved by this withdrawal agreement, and that the Brexit on offer is much worse than the deal we've already got in the EU,"" he said. The prime minister's support has grown by one, however, after Eastbourne MP Stephen Lloyd quit the Liberal Democrat group in the Commons to vote for her deal. Lloyd quits Lib Dem MPs' group over Brexit Conservative Sir Nicholas Soames has also spoken up for the PM's deal, on the the third day of debate about it in the Commons, which is focusing on the economic impact. This video can not be played Remainer Tory warns over US-style 'partisan bitterness' if deal rejected Ministers are arguing Mrs May's deal creates a unique partnership with the EU, while Labour insists it will make people poorer. The Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which keeps Mrs May's government in power, has said it would support the government in a confidence motion if the deal was thrown out on Tuesday. Sammy Wilson, the DUP's Brexit spokesman, told Today: ""Our grievance with the government has been that the government made a promise to us and to the people of Northern Ireland that Brexit would be delivered for the whole of the United Kingdom, and provided there is nothing introduced to break that promise, we have no reason to have no confidence in the government."" But he added the DUP could still withdraw support for the government at a future date.

Tesco directors acquitted in fraud trial,"Chris Bush (left) and John Scouler (right) have been acquitted Two former Tesco directors have been acquitted of charges of fraud and false accounting after the judge dismissed their case due to lack of evidence. Chris Bush, former UK managing director, and John Scouler, former UK food commercial director, were accused of manipulating figures that resulted in Tesco's profits being overstated. In autumn 2014, Tesco said that profits had been overstated by about Â£250m. Both Mr Bush and Mr Scouler had denied the charges. After their acquittal, Mr Bush said: ""While I am delighted that my innocence has finally been established, it is troubling that Mr Scouler and I were ever charged. ""I am now looking forward to getting home and spending Christmas with my family."" It was alleged the pair were aware that income was being wrongly included in the company's financial records to meet targets and make Tesco look financially healthier than it was. Mr Scouler, 50, from High Wycombe and Mr Bush, 52, of St Albans each denied one count of fraud and another of false accounting. At the time they had benefits packages with Tesco of more than Â£1m each. Tesco found that its profits had been overstated due to early recognition of payments from suppliers whose goods were sold in its stores, as well as delays in charging costs. The defendants had been on trial for eight weeks at Southwark Crown Court. A first trial had been abandoned in February, shortly before the jury was due to retire to consider its verdict. A third defendant, Carl Rogberg, 51, a former Tesco UK finance director, was not included in the retrial, with the SFO saying it was now considering whether to pursue a retrial of Mr Rogberg. The acquittal came after trial judge Sir John Royce dismissed the case brought by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), halting the trial after the prosecution presented its case. ""I concluded in certain crucial areas the prosecution case was so weak it should not be left for a jury's consideration,"" Judge Royce said. The SFO tried to have the decision overturned at Court of Appeal on Wednesday, but was unsuccessful and the men were cleared by Court of Appeal judges. Richard Sallybanks, partner at BCL Solicitors representing John Scouler, said: ""We are delighted that Mr Scouler leaves court today knowing that the judge, having heard the entirety of the prosecution evidence, reached the firm conclusion that he had no case to answer. ""That decision was obviously correct yet the SFO chose to pursue an appeal which was rejected yesterday."" Ross Dixon, partner at Hickman and Rose, and solicitor for Mr Bush, said: ""The trial judge heard from 30 witnesses and considered thousands of pages of written evidence; he reached the firm conclusion that there was no case for the defendants to answer. ""The Court of Appeal has now affirmed that decision and refused the SFO permission to appeal. Quite how the SFO managed to so fundamentally misunderstand the effect of its own evidence demands an answer."" The trial jury was discharged and exempted from jury service for 20 years. By Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent It's one thing for a jury to deliver not guilty verdicts in a multimillion pound fraud trial. But for a judge to call a halt to the proceedings after hearing the prosecution's case is far more unusual. This outcome now raises more questions than answers. And it's the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) that is under the spotlight for its handling of this case.

New Welsh Labour leader to be announced,"Three candidates (left to right) are in the running - Eluned Morgan, Vaughan Gething and Mark Drakeford The new leader of Welsh Labour - and the person set to become Wales' next first minister - will be announced shortly. Three candidates - Eluned Morgan, Vaughan Gething and Mark Drakeford - are hoping to replace Carwyn Jones, who stands down next week. Labour officials will reveal the election result in Cardiff. It follows a year in Welsh politics marked by the death of former minister Carl Sargeant. Mr Sargeant wasfound deadin November 2017, days after the first minister sacked him from his cabinet over allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards women. Mr Jones said he had been through the ""darkest of times""when he announced his intention to quitin April. Welsh Labour's mystery runners? Brexit, Corbyn and the race to be FM The leader who lost his grip Carwyn Jones quits About 175,000 people - about 25,000 party members and 150,000 members of affiliated groups including trade unions - have been able to take part in the Labour poll, which closed last Monday. The winner will be Welsh Labour leader-elect until Carwyn Jones resigns next week, and will become the next first minister after confirmation by the assembly on Wednesday. They will lead the Welsh Government, which has responsibility for health, education, local government, transport and some taxes in Wales, among other areas of policy. At the conclusion of the contest, all four party groups represented in the Welsh assembly - including the Welsh Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and UKIP - will have changed leader during 2018. By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor Carywn Jones announced his intention to stand down in April This has felt like a long leadership contest. Carwyn Jones's announcement of his departure was precipitated by the death of his former cabinet minister. By now, Carwyn Jones had hoped the trilogy of inquiries he set in motion in the wake of Mr Sargeant's death would have been completed. In fact the most important, into how he handled the sacking, is yet to start. The winner of today's contest will need to heal Welsh Labour of the divisions that emerged from the tragedy of Mr Sargeant's death - divisions which can only have been deepened by last week's inquest, which itself is yet to conclude. And if that wasn't enough, the winner takes over at a time of unprecedented change. They will have new powers over income tax. They will face an imminent Brexit and the chaos of the power struggle at Westminster. And then there's the M4 relief road. No pressure then. Mark Drakeford was a professor at Cardiff University before joining the assembly Mark Drakeford had been considered the front-runner in the contest, having won nominations from 16 assembly members. Born in Carmarthen, the finance secretary has been a key part of Labour's government in Cardiff for years - serving as a special advisor under the previous first minister Rhodri Morgan before becoming an AM in 2011, and a cabinet minister in 2013. An academic and a probation officer before full-time politics, the republican Cardiff West AM has the support of the Welsh version of the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Labour faction Momentum - known as Welsh Labour Grassroots. Thought to be a sceptic on the proposed M4 Relief Road upgrade, his pledges include extending the smoking ban to outdoor areas of cafes and restaurants. Vaughan Gething, seen campaigning with Eddie Izzard, has been highly critical of Mark Drakeford Cardiff South and Penarth AM Vaughan Gething was the second candidate to get enough support to run. Less likely to see eye-to-eye with the politics of UK leader Jeremy Corbyn, at 44 the health secretary is the youngest candidate. Mr Gething, who was born in Zambia, has been a vocally critic of Mr Drakeford throughout the campaign, accusing him of having an""awful"" tone on the subject of Brexit. The candidate said Mr Drakeford was""reckless"" for invoking the memory of nuclear power plant disastersin a conversation about plans for a new Wylfa power plant. He has vowed to ensure school children that receive free school meals are fed outside of school terms, and pay for tuition fees for children leaving care. Eluned Morgan got onto the ballot after a row about the lack of a woman candidate Eluned Morgan squeezed on to the ballot after a row about a lack of women candidates,thanks to a nomination from Carwyn Jones. The Cardiff-born vicar's daughter previously served as an MEP after she was elected to the European Parliament at the age of 27, in 1999 - she was the youngest at the time. Ms Morgan, who serves as a regional assembly member for Mid and West Wales, has promisedfree fitness trackers for secondary school children, supports the idea of aUniversal Basic Income, and has saidunemployed peoplecould be given Â£1,000 to start their own business if she becomes first minister. Ms Morgan is a baroness - having represented Labour on the front bench in the House of Lords - and has vowed to relinquish the title if she wins. Carwyn Jones's final First Minister's Questions will to take place in the assembly on Tuesday. He will tender his resignation to the Queen via e-mail later that afternoon. That comes into effect whenever the palace replies. It is not known how quickly Her Majesty will reply. It is planned that the winner of the Welsh Labour leadership contest will be nominated on Wednesday. Both Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives will back their own leaders to be the next first minister - but the efforts are highly unlikely to succeed. The Labour-led Welsh Government has an assembly majority, thanks to the support of Liberal Democrat Kirsty Williams and independent AM Lord Elis-Thomas. Welsh Labour's mystery runners?

Police arrest three on terrorism charges,"Police investigating extreme right-wing activity in the UK have arrested three men on suspicion of terrorism offences. Those arrested are a 17-year-old from London, a 21-year-old from Bath and an 18-year-old from Portsmouth. The BBC understands the investigation relates to alleged activity by a neo-Nazi group called the Sonnenkrieg Division. Searches are ongoing at four properties in Bath, London, Portsmouth and Leeds, officers said. Police said the arrests, made by officers from the North East Counter Terrorism Unit, were part of a planned operation. The three men are being interviewed in police stations in London and Bath. The 21-year-old was arrested on suspicion of possessing material useful to someone preparing an act of terrorism and conspiracy to inspire racial or religious hatred. The 17-year-old was arrested on suspicion of encouraging terrorism, dissemination of terrorist publications, and conspiracy to inspire racial or religious hatred. The 18-year-old was arrested on suspicion of encouraging terrorism and dissemination of terrorist publications.

One in three children 'not active enough',"One in three children in England does fewer than 30 minutes of physical activity a day - half the amount recommended by government guidelines,a report by Sport England suggests.,external Girls are less likely to be as active as boys, with 13 to 16-year-olds the least active age group. The online survey of 130,000 five to 16-year-olds found children from poorer families did least exercise. Sports Minister Mims Davies said the figures were ""simply unacceptable"". ""We know that an active child is a happier child and efforts must be stepped up to encourage young people to live healthy, active lives,"" she said. Guidelines from the chief medical officer say that children and young people should take part in sport and physical activity for at least 60 minutes every day. This should be made up of 30 minutes activity during the school day and 30 minutes outside school. This video can not be played How a charity is getting London's young people active through rowing But the 2017-18 survey suggests only 28% of children achieve that amount in school - and only 22% after school. Being active includes sporting activities, active play, walking, fitness activities, dance and using a scooter. Pupils at Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney, London, are learning to row through a programme run by London Youth Rowing to open up the sport to more young people. ""It's a really good stress reliever, especially when there are exams,"" says one pupil. ""You find things out about yourself you didn't know were there,"" says another. Rowing coach Oliver James believes a culture of sport can be created. ""It becomes an expectation that doing sport is just something that young people do,"" he says. The survey also found: one in six children was active for 60 minutes every day one in four was active across the week, but didn't do 60 minutes every day one in three did less than an average of 30 minutes a day children aged nine to 12 were the most active every day 20% of boys and 14% of girls were active every day the gap between girls' and boys' activity levels widens from the end of primary school There is evidence that ethnic background and family earnings also have an impact on activity levels. Twice as many children from well-off families can swim unaided by the end of primary school, compared to those from the poorest families Girls from Asian and black backgrounds are less active than children from other communities while 86% of children from the highest-earning families can swim 25m unaided, compared to only 42% from families earning the least. The type of activities children do changes as they get older. Playing tag or climbing in a playground are popular among younger age groups, but this gives way to team sports which become the most popular activity by years 7-8 at school. Severe obesity hits poor primaries harder Children 'becoming weaker and less fit' Older children 'exercise less' Twenty million Britons 'physically inactive' Lack of exercise puts one in four at risk Tim Hollingsworth, chief executive at Sport England, said he wanted to see a national focus on the health and wellbeing of children. ""Parents, schools, the sport and leisure industry and government all have a role to play in addressing and increasing childhood activity. This research is the first of its kind anywhere in the world and is a big wake-up call for all of us. ""We all care about the health and wellbeing of our children. These results tell us that what is currently being done to support them is not enough and change is required."" He said listening to young people and what they want was the best starting point. Dr Alison Tedstone, head of diet, obesity and physical activity at Public Health England said: ""Physical activity is crucial for good physical and mental health of children and young people - this work is a timely reminder for everyone to do more to help them be more active.""

FTSE 100 sinks to two-year low,"US markets stabilised on Thursday after steep falls earlier in the day spurred by fears about US-China trade tensions and global growth. The Dow Jones index closed down about 0.3% while the S&P 500 slipped less than 0.2%. The tech-focused Nasdaq even ventured into positive territory, ending 0.4% higher. The rebound followed sharp falls in Europe and extended the sharp market swings seen in recent weeks. In London the FTSE 100 tumbled 3.2%, or more than 200 points, to close at about 6,700 - its lowest level in two years. Falls on European markets were even steeper, with Paris and Frankfurt both shedding almost 3.5%. Oil prices also sank, withBrent crudemore than 2% lower. Analysts said the arrest of Chinese telecoms giantHuawei's chief financial officerin Canada had revived worries over the US's trade war with China. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei index shed 1.9%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 2.5%. On the FTSE 100, worst-hit sectors included miners, oil companies, carmakers and tech stocks, with mining firms Antofagasta and Glencore among the biggest losers. The concerns about trade tensions, oil prices and slowing growth sparked losses at US financial, energy and materials companies early in the day, sending all three major US indexes more than 2% lower. But sentiment later swung in the other direction. Analysts at Oxford Economics said markets had become ""overly gloomy"". IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde also said in a CNBC interview that worries about recession were ""a little bit overdone"", although uncertainty was causing increased volatility. The US stock market is having another ugly day. Coming up with culprits for the most recent panic isn't hard. Investors fear the trade war between China and the US will escalate. They worry America's central bank will raise interest rates too far. And they're concerned about Britain's exit from the European Union. All factors that could hurt company profits. The tougher question to answer is where the market is headed. Will it keep going down or bounce back? Many on Wall Street are describing the recent stock turbulence as a market correction - defined as a drop of at least 10% from a recent high. How long it lasts depends on what investors perceive are the prospects for global economic growth. And right now the psychology of the markets appears fragile. Shares in mining companies were among the worst hit Oil prices fell on Thursday as traders waited for news from the meeting of Opec oil-producing nations in Vienna, with some member states keen to agree on a production cut to drive up prices. Members tentatively agreed to cut output but were waiting for a commitment from Russia, which is not in the cartel, before making any firm decisions, according to insiders. Investors were also reacting to new US trade deficit figures, measuring the difference between imports and exports of goods and services. That gap increased to $55.5bn in October, the highest level in a decade, as major markets including China, the European Union and Mexico purchased fewer US products. All three markets have hit US goods with new import duties in retaliation for tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer had ""reignited fears that trade reconciliation between the US and China may not be forthcoming any time soon"". ""The market is spooked by the damage a continuing trade war could do to global economic prospects, and that's hitting share prices in the UK and overseas.

Gambling firms agree TV advertising ban,"Britain's biggest gambling companies have voluntarily agreed to a ""whistle-to-whistle"" television advertising ban. The Remote Gambling Association (RGA), which includes Bet365, Ladbrokes and Paddy Power, has struck a deal to stop adverts during live sports broadcasts. It follows political pressure about the amount of betting advertising on TV. More than 90 minutes of adverts were shown during the football World Cup and anti-gambling campaigners say sport's use of adverts ""normalises"" betting. There are also fears it contributes to the rise in the amount of problem gamblers - with a Gambling Commission report suggesting 430,000 Britons can be described as such - and helps fuel under-age gambling. The deal follows extensive talks between firms - also including SkyBet, Betfred, Betfair, Stan James, Gala Coral and William Hill - to ensure no adverts will be broadcast for a defined period before and after a game is broadcast. BBC Three: Does football have a gambling problem? 5 live Investigates: Betting links found on football clubs' junior fan pages Why are sports betting adverts 'dangerous'? The proposal is similar to those made by the Labour party and, importantly, will include any game that starts prior to the 9pm watershed but ends after that time. The RGA has previously said it was""very mindful of public concerns"". Horse racing will be exempt from the restrictions - given the commercial importance of gambling on its viability - but all other sports will be included. However, it is the impact on football where the ban will be felt the most, especially given the financial value of the sport to both the gambling companies and broadcasters. Nearly 60% of clubs in England's top two divisions have gambling companies as shirt sponsors. Final ratification is needed from the Industry Group for Responsible Gambling (IGRG) before the ban comes into force. It is understood that there will be a meeting next week to rubber stamp the proposals. The intention will be to introduce the ban for the start of the 2019-20 season. On Thursday, the RGA said: ""The Gambling Industry Code for Socially Responsible Advertising is reviewed annually, and several options are currently being considered as the basis for possible enhancements in 2019. ""However, nothing has yet been finalised."" Tom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said he was ""delighted"" by the move as the number of adverts during live sports had ""clearly reached crisis levels"". He added: ""There was clear public support for these restrictions and I'm glad that the Remote Gambling Association has taken its responsibilities seriously and listened."" Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Jeremy Wright MP, said it was a ""welcome move"". ""Gambling firms banning advertising on TV during live sport is a welcome move and I am pleased that the sector is stepping up and responding to public concerns,"" he said. ""It is vital children and vulnerable people are protected from the threat of gambling related harm.  Companies must be socially responsible."" Sarah Hanratty, chief executive of the Senet Group - the industry's responsible gambling body, funded by the four largest UK gambling companies - said: ""It has been clear for some time now that the volume and density of advertising and sponsorship messaging from gambling companies around live sport has become unsustainable. ""This is a welcome move from the leading industry operators who are taking the initiative to respond to public concern."" Matt Zarb-Cousin is a spokesperson for Fairer Gambling, a not-for-profit entity campaigning to reduce gambling-related harm and crime. It is long overdue, there has been a huge amount of pressure on the sector over the volume of advertising which has increased exponentially year on year. But for it to be truly effective, it should also include shirt and league sponsorship and digital advertising around a pitch. It is better that there are going to be no ads during live sporting events but that falls some way short of being effective. If the whistle-to-whistle TV advertising ban is justified then the other things are as well. I think it is worth bearing in mind that it is the broadcasters that have been most resistant to the clampdown on advertising. I think the writing is on the wall. If they hadn't done this, the government would have acted anyway, perhaps next year. There is no legislation in the pipeline but the strength of feeling cross-party and in both houses suggests that it is unsustainable. Marc Etches is the chief executive of GambleAware, a leading charity committed to minimising gambling-related harm. We have been saying for a long time now that gambling is being increasingly normalised for children. They are growing up in a very different world than their parents, one where technology and the internet are ever present. So while we welcome this move by betting companies, it is important to pay attention to analysis that shows the marketing spend online is five times the amount spent on television. The fact that it is reported that one in eight 11 to 16 year olds are following gambling companies on social media is very concerning. Bill Wilson, BBC Business reporter Investors have been betting on Thursday that gambling firms' earnings will be hit by the ban. William Hill, Paddy Power, Betfair and GVC (formerly Ladbrokes Coral) have all been in the red on the stock market on Thursday. Football and gambling have been inextricably linked for nearly a century, since the launch of the football pools in 1923. That connection has grown as the sport has become more commercialised, with many teams featuring gambling firms on the front of their shirts. Clubs have their own gambling partners, and allow fans to bet on matches within their stadiums. But with problem gambling increasingly in the spotlight - look at the recent furore over fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) - there has been growing disquiet about the seemingly relentless association of football with gambling. With concerns among politicians and psychologists about the potential effect on the vulnerable, including children, it seems gambling firms have decided to take positive action of their own, rather than risk waiting and being pushed, as was the case with FOBTs.

New homes 'crumbling due to weak mortar',"This video can not be played Vincent Fascione says he will never buy a new build-home again Hundreds of new properties have been built using weak mortar that does not meet recommended industry standards, the Victoria Derbyshire show has found. There are reports of homes with the fault on at least 13 estates in the UK. The full extent of the industry-wide problem is hard to measure as some homeowners have been asked to sign gagging orders to claim compensation. The industry says mortar performance is a complex issue and can be affected by a number of factors. One of those homes was owned by Vincent Fascione, 70. He says he was watching football on TV one evening in 2016 when he heard a loud cracking noise from the external walls of his house. The next morning, he found a sand-like substance all over his front path and driveway. Photographs and video from the time appear to show growing cracks in the mortar holding his bricks together. Mr Fascione, from Coatbridge outside Glasgow, bought his semi-detached property in 2012 for Â£112,500. He complained to the homebuilder, Taylor Wimpey, and to the NHBC, the industry body that signs off and provides the warranty for most new-build houses. Under NHBC guidelines, mortar in most areas of the UK should be made of one part cement to 5.5 parts sand. In severe weather areas such as Coatbridge, there should be even more cement in the mix to make it stronger and more durable. Mr Fascione says the mortar problem has been ""a disaster"" for him Laboratory tests on samples taken from parts of Mr Fascione's home showed the amount of sand was almost three times higher than recommended. ""I'm the guy who retired and decided to buy a new-build house,"" he said. ""I'll never buy a new-build house again - never. It's just been disastrous for me."" After 18 months of complaints, the NHBC bought back Mr Fascione's home at the market rate and he is living in alternative accommodation. The organisation said it had done so because the performance of the company it had employed to repair the property had not been good enough and ""in consideration of Mr Fascione's personal circumstances"", not because of the original issue with the mortar. The Victoria Derbyshire Programme has heard about new build properties in at least 13 estates from Scotland to Sussex, built by different companies, with what appears to be a similar problem. Retired construction manager Phil Waller blogs about new homes In one single estate in the Scottish borders, it is thought Taylor Wimpey has agreed to replace the mortar in more than 90 separate properties. The homebuilder says an assessment by engineers found ""no structural issues"" with the homes. ""This is both widespread and serious,"" says Phil Waller, a retired construction manager who hasblogged about the problem.,external ""It cannot be explained away by the industry as a few isolated cases."" Exactly why the weaker building material may have been used is unclear. In some cases, the housebuilder may have simply used the wrong type of mortar. In other cases, errors may have been made mixing and laying the material on site. Some construction experts also blame the switch to a new type of factory-mixed mortar, which might pass a different strength test in the laboratory but not always be strong enough in the real world. Steve Turner, from the Home Builders Federation, said builders ""generally have their mortar provided by large accredited suppliers... [who] have clear quality assurance and testing processes to ensure mixes are delivered as required. He added that there were ""very few instances we're aware of where defective mortar has been used"". ""And in those instances where it has been used, there's an obligation on the builder to fix the issues."" He added that having spoken to ""a number of builders in the past week, most have had no issues with mortar whatsoever - [and with] those that have, it's on a very limited number of sites"". Faced with what could be an expensive repair bill, many homeowners have been told by their own solicitors not to go public until the issue is resolved. In some cases, customers have ultimately had their houses bought back by either the homebuilder or the NHBC. In others, it appears repairs have been made and compensation paid as part of a deal that involves the signing of a non-disclosure agreement or gagging clause. One homeowner in the north-west of England told the programme: ""The only comment I can make is no comment. I'd like to speak out but at the end of the day I have to protect my investment."" A gagging clause may stop the property owner talking not only to the media but also to neighbours in the estate who may be facing similar problems. Example of suspect mortar from a second estate in Scotland ""It's going on, it's just not being talked about,"" says Mr Waller. ""Non-disclosure agreements should be banned full stop. If it's all covered up, more victims are likely to be drawn into the net and make the same mistakes."" An NHBC spokesman said it included a confidentiality clause in a ""small number of rare circumstances"" but declined to disclose the number. He added: ""We work with builders to help them improve the construction quality of the homes they build.  However, it is the builder who is ultimately responsible for the quality of the new homes they build."" Taylor Wimpey apologised to Mr Fascione for the issues experienced with his home. A spokesman said: ""We are committed to delivering excellent quality homes and achieving high levels of customer satisfaction. On those occasions where issues do arise, we endeavour to resolve those issues as soon as practically possible.""

LiveMPs debate Brexit deal,"MPs continued debating the government's Brexit deal, ahead of vote next Tuesday Thursday's debate focused on the economic impact of the agreement Commons business began with questions to Brexit ministers House of Lords also debated the Brexit deal this afternoon Sophie Morris, Ryan Brown and Robbie Hawkins The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Brexit officially happened on 31 January but the UK is now in a transition period until the end of 2020. Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. Members of Parliament (MPs) will vote next week on the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated. Sir Graham Brady ""would welcome"" a delay in the Brexit vote if it would help resolve MPs' concerns. House of CommonsParliament That's it for our coverage today, as MPs complete their third day of debate on the withdrawal agreement. Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire is now introducing his adjournment debate on the illegal trade in seahorses in the UK. MPs are due to continue their debate on the Brexit deal on Monday afternoon. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament International Trade Secretary Liam Fox says the ""status quo has never been on offer"" as the EU ""wants an ever closer union"". ""We have to find a compromise that makes this workable,"" he says, adding: ""the withdrawal agreement achieves just that, and is the only deal on the table"". DUP MP Ian Paisley intervenes to says the ""gallows are being built"" for the deal ahead of Tuesday's planned vote - and asks if there have been discussions about delaying it. Liam Fox replies says ministers will ""continue to make the case"" for the deal, but adds: ""the government will want to talk to members, of course it will want to look to ways to give a reassurance"". He says ""I understand why MPs have concerns about the backstop, but it is clear that it is there to be a temporary measure"". Liam Fox says Labour is ""playing politics at a time of great national decision-making"", and their Brexit policy is ""ill-researched and delusional"". He says that by agreeing to hold to the referendum, Parliament ""sub-contracted its sovereignty"" to voters, and MPs must now ""live up to our side of the bargain"".  Allow Twitter content?

Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Winding up the debate for Labour, shadow international trade minister Barry Gardiner says the government has ""tried to exclude Parliament from the process at all stages"". ""This is a deal that members on all sides now believe is not in the best interest of the country,"" he says. Mr Gardiner says the UK will be ""much poorer than we otherwise would be"" under the government's agreement. He calls on Liam Fox to be ""yet more flexible still"" on the next steps for Brexit, and ""recall his own words"" given to a Sunday newspaper in 2012. Back then, he says, Mr Fox called for the UK to renegotiate a ""new relationship"" with the EU, based on ""an economic partnership involving a customs union and the single market in goods and services"". ""The secretary of state may not like it, but it sounds an awful lot like Labour party policy to me"", he adds. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Like other MPs today, the DUP's Jim Shannon picks up on the proposed 'backstop' plan for the Irish border in the government's deal. He says there is ""no legal form for leaving this international treaty without consent"", adding that this is ""not acceptable"". He says the people of Northern Ireland must stand up for themselves and he has ""a mistrust for the government at this time"". ""The government have voted for Northern Ireland to become a voiceless victim of the UK,"" he concludes. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Next up this evening is Labour MP Karen Lee - who was a Remainer in 2016 but her constituency of Lincoln voted to leave. She ""sincerely believes"" there is a Brexit deal that will benefit her constituents, she says. ""But this deal will not protect jobs, workplace rights or environmental standards, and it will inhibit business by failing to ensure frictionless trade"", she adds. ""We can renegotiate with the EU - or better still, hold a general election"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Vicky Ford - who used to be member of the European Parliament and voted Remain - says MPs need to respect the vote to leave. ""A second referendum would be even more divisive and no more decisive,"" she adds. Ms Ford says leaving the EU with no deal poses ""a huge risk"" and the withdrawal agreement helps real businesses remain secure and offers time to develop a future framework. She calls Labour's plan of ""a close relationship with the single market without being in it"" a ""fantasy land"". Ms Ford says the backstop plan is not a ""practical risk"", as remaining in the arrangement permanently ""is not in the EU's interest"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Andrew Bowie says many of his colleagues on the Conservative benches are still ""struggling to come to a conclusion"" on which way they will vote. He adds that he voted to leave the EU ""and supports the deal"". Mr Bowie says he backs the agreement ""as it is the best for business, his constituents and Scotland"". ""I believe this deal is better than what we have now,"" he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman says the deal provides no certainty and there is no guarantee that a better one could be negotiated. Leaving without a deal on the other hand is not an option, she adds. The only other option is that MPs go back to the people and tell them the truth that ""we cannot leave the club and expect to keep all the benefits"". ""That is mission impossible"", she says. ""It is time for a people's vote"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Lee Rowley says ""we are arguing over commas in this deal, when whole paragraphs of it do not work"", and for this reason he will not be backing the deal. ""I did not come to this place to make people poorer,"" he says. ""I cannot go back to my constituents and say this deal gives them Brexit - it does not"". He says he disagrees with the deal as it is ""a failure of nerve and ambition"", and calls for it to be stopped. Mr Rowley calls on the government ""to move the UK out of its shadow"" and ""get Brexit back on track"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi says the Brexitlegal advicepublished this week shows Northern Ireland ""has been sold out"". The Brexit process has been ""blurred, botched and bungled from the very start"", he adds. Mr Singh Dhesi says the prime minister is ""not up to the task"" and ""has created division and discord"". The Conservatives must ""stand aside"" to allow a general election, he concludes. House of LordsParliament The debate on the government's Brexit deal has ended - and business in the House of Lords for today comes to an end. Peers will resume the debate on Monday. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of LordsParliament Wrapping up the Lords debate, Tory peer Lord Horam says the referendum result was ""a wake up call"". He says the withdrawal agreement is ""surprisingly good in the circumstances"", but Brexit is not the answer to the ""fundamental social problems"" that triggered the vote to leave. He does not expect the agreement to win Parliament's approval, he says, warning that if the decision is to be returned to the people the Remain side must do better. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate Conservative MP Maggie Throup says she will be supporting the government's Brexit deal next week ""if it stays the same"". She says another referendum would be ""undemocratic"". She calls for MPs to ""end the political games, and reflect on what the consequences of rejecting this deal will be"". ""This deal is in the public interest,"" she says. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Giles Watling, who voted Remain, says he was re-elected in his leave-voting constituency because his party pledged to ""deliver on their wishes"". The government's Brexit deal ""does tick so many of the boxes"", he says - but he adds that he still has ""serious concerns"" about the backstop. ""What has been the point of the last two years of uncertainty and pain"" he asks, if the UK is ""still under the dominion the European Court of Justice"". ""Best endeavours"" to negotiate a future relationship deal are ""not cast iron"", he concludes. Â© 2025 BBC.

The NHS patients who are 'abused and ignored',"This video can not be played Two people describe their experience of being sectioned under the Mental Health Act New rights should be given to severely ill mental health patients detained in hospital to stop abuse and neglect of this vulnerable group, a review says. The 1983 Mental Health Act is outdated and needs an overhaul, sectioning is being misused and does not properly protect patients' rights, it says. The independent review - ordered by the government - heard from patients who had suffered during their detentions. The prime minister said the injustices were unacceptable and promised action. Kate King, 56, spent seven years in and out of hospitals in East Anglia after being admitted in 2004 following a period of post-natal depression. She said her detention probably saved her life as she had been really struggling following the birth of her two children but her experience, in a variety of units, had been ""awful"" at times. ""I was abused and ignored. I lost my voice,"" she said. She said she had experienced other patients being aggressive and swearing at her, with one even stalking her. But she also complained about her treatment at the hands of staff. ""I was restrained face down on a mattress. One nurse even told me I should kill myself,"" she said. ""When I tried to object or complain, I was not listened to. There was good care too - I remember once being taken go-karting. But my experiences left me anxious and suicidal."" One in four young women has mental illness Does the UK have much to shout about on World Mental Health Day? 'Unlawful' cell detentions revealed Mrs King formed part of the working group put together to review the way the Mental Health Act worked. It included mental health professionals, academics and patients. The 18-month review recommended a number of changes, including: new rights for patients to legally challenge their treatment more frequent opportunities to challenge detention legally binding advanced care plans so patients could express how they wanted to be treated if they were sectioned a requirement for doctors to record when and why they chose to ignore patient requests an end to police cells being used as a place of safety and less frequent use of police cars to transport patients the right to choose a ""nominated person"" to have control of a patient's care if they were sectioned - at the moment it automatically goes to their nearest relative Professor Sir Simon Wessely, who chaired the review, said it was time to bring the act up to date. ""It was written when people with a mental health problem were something to be afraid of. But the way we think about mental health and illness has changed dramatically, so now they are more likely to be seen as people to be helped. ""The act needs to help them more - to make it easier for people to express their choices and preferences about how they want to be treated and harder for them to be ignored."" He added black and ethnic minorities along with people with learning disabilities and autism appeared to be particularly ill-served by the act as they had higher rates of detention. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Simon said BME groups had higher rates of mental illness ""probably because of early experiences of discrimination and exclusion"". He also said it was important to note that such groups were more likely to be perceived as a risk. The act deals with patients who are detained in hospital. Every year about 1.8 million patients receive mental health treatment - but only one in 20 of these is treated in hospital. About half of those are admitted voluntarily, with nearly 50,000 detained against their will for their own protection or the protection of others. The numbers being detained have been rising - up by 40% in the past 10 years. Sir Simon said there is no one reason for the increase but added that it is partly down to society becoming more ""risk averse"" but also because there are fewer alternatives to detention. The rise in population will account for a small proportion of the rise but beyond that there is concern the act may be being misused. There have been reports of dementia patients being detained, while black and ethnic minority patients are much more likely to be sectioned. As well as reducing the number of detentions, the review group wants to see a reduction in the use of compulsory treatment orders whereby patients are released from hospital under supervision. They say public safety will not be put at risk. But they acknowledge the changes will require greater investment in community services, particularly crisis care to stop people deteriorating to such an extent that they need hospital treatment. The recommendations relate to England and Wales only. The review team said Scotland had already started making some of these changes, while Northern Ireland has agreed to review its own laws. Mental health charities are overwhelmingly supportive of the recommendations. Mind chief executive Paul Farmer said the legislation was outdated, with thousands of people every year having to endure ""poor treatment"". Mark Winstanley, of Rethink Mental Illness, said the charity had ""long campaigned"" for reform of the act. ""Countless people have told us how they felt disrespected and lost all control of their care while treated under the act,"" he said. And even doctors acknowledged change was needed. Royal College of Psychiatrists president Prof Wendy Burn said detention was clearly ""incredibly stressful"" for patients and there needed to be a focus on improving their experiences. Prime Minister Theresa May said the review would be used to make changes to the legislation. ""The disparity in our mental health services is one of the burning injustices this country faces that we must put right,"" she said. ""For decades, it has somehow been accepted that if you have a mental illness you will not receive the same access to treatment as if you have a physical ailment. Well, that is not acceptable.""

'Alarming' attitudes on rape in survey,"This video can not be played A woman describes being raped by her partner while she slept An ""alarming"" proportion of adults in Great Britain remain confused about what constitutes rape, campaigners say. A third of peoplesurveyed for the End Violence Against Women,externalcoalition said there had to be physical violence for sexual activity to count as rape. A third of males and 21% of females said it would not usually be considered rape if a woman had flirted on a date. EVAW said the responses of the 3,922 people surveyed shows that ""myths about rape are still very common"". The law is unequivocal - rape is sex without consent - but many people appear unable to identify that certain behaviour amount to an offence, it added. 'It was right to report rape' Do people understand what rape is? Rape cases tipped against victims, says MP EVAW said younger respondents to the survey held views that are ""more closely aligned to the law"". It said the vast majority of reports to police are about rape within relationships. But pollsters for YouGov found more than a third of over-65s do not regard non-consensual sex in marriage or a relationship as rape, compared with 16% of people aged 16 to 24. And 42% of over 65s said if sexual activity continues after a woman changes her mind it is not rape, compared with 22% of the 25-49s. The survey, carried out online in September, also found: 6% of people say it is not rape if a woman is very drunk or asleep, with a further 5% saying they are unsure of the law on this Stealthing - removing a condom without a partner's consent - is not understood as rape, with 19% of people thinking this is never rape, and 21% think that this would not normally be rape 11% of respondents believe the more sexual partners a woman has, the less harm she will experience from a rape Figures published in September in theCrown Prosecution Service's Violence Against Women And Girls,externalreport highlighted a 23.1% fall in the number of defendants charged with rape in England and Wales in 2017-2018, compared with the previous year, and a conviction rate of 36%. Rachel Krys, EVAW co-director, added: ""These figures are alarming because they show that a huge proportion of UK adults, who make up juries in rape trials, are still very unclear about what rape is. ""Confusion and myths about rape are still very common and this could explain why it's hard for juries to make fair decisions if they don't understand or agree with our laws on rape."" EVAW added the #MeToo campaign had shone the spotlight on sexual attacks and harassment by public figures - but also on the fact that people still have different understandings of what rape and sexual violence is. Rape cases tipped against victims, says MP Rape conviction levels lowest for young men 'It was right to report rape even though my attacker was cleared' 'I couldn't get support after my rape' Rape victim policy change criticised Do people understand what rape is?

Investor visas halted over money laundering,"This video can not be played The European Commission says it is closely monitoring citizenship for sale programmes in the EU Ministers are halting a ""gold-plated"" visa scheme offering foreign investors a fast-track to settling in the UK, as part of a crackdown on financial crime. Tier 1 investor visas were introduced in 2008 to encourage rich people from outside the EU to invest in the UK. A Â£2m investment bought a visa and indefinite leave to remain after five years. But concerns were raised the scheme was being used to launder money. Its suspension will end after an audit process is introduced, ministers say. ""We will not tolerate people who do not play by the rules and seek to abuse the system,"" said Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes, announcing the suspension would come into effect at midnight on Friday. ""That is why I am bringing forward these new measures which will make sure that only genuine investors, who intend to support UK businesses, can benefit from our immigration system."" Reality Check: Who's allowed an investor visa? Are golden visas losing their sparkle? The number of grantedTier 1 investor visas,externalpeaked in 2014 (1,172). Last year the figure stood at 350, with the highest numbers going to Chinese and Russian investors. The scheme previously required that applicants had a UK bank account and were of ""good character"". From next year, independent, regulated auditors will assess applicants' financial and business interests and check they have had control of the funds for at least two years, the Home Office said. Successful candidates have been eligible for visas lasting three years and four months, with two-year extensions available. In 2011, the government hoped to attract the ""brightest and best"" by allowing investors to bring forward the date at which they could apply for settled status. Spending Â£10m in the UK cut the wait to just two years. However, three years later, theMigration Advisory Committee,externalsaid the scheme brought little economic benefit for British citizens because most applicants were buying gilts to qualify - so were effectively loaning the government money, rather than investing in the UK. The Home Office said in future there will be a provision for pooled investments, supported by the government, to back projects with a ""clear economic benefit to the UK"" such as supporting small and medium-sized businesses.

Student rents 'up by a third in six years',"This video can not be played Two students in Leeds pay very different levels for accommodation The average price of student accommodation in the UK has jumped by nearly a third in six years, a survey has suggested. The increase has been driven by the standard of accommodation shifting steadily upmarket, research by student housing charity Unipol and the National Union of Students (NUS) found. But the NUS warned it had created a ""real affordability problem"". The government said it had increased support for students' living costs. The Accommodation Costs Survey 2018 found that in 2011 the average rental bill took up 58% of the maximum student loan, now it is 73%. It showed that the top end of the market, studio flats made up 4% of student accommodation in 2012, but now they account for 9%. Fewer people are now living in traditional student digs with shared bathrooms and kitchens. They now account for just 17% of the total, down from 24% six years ago. The report said half of student bed spaces were provided by the private sector, up from 39% in 2012. The other half are owned by educational institutions. Self-catered en-suite accommodation now accounts for the lion's share of student accommodation in both these sectors, at 58% of total rooms, a rise of 2% since 2012. This had pushed the average price of accommodation up by a third over the six years, according to the survey. The average annual student rental bill is now Â£6,366. In London the average is Â£8,875 and for the rest of the UK Â£5,928. It is not just the private sector which has been increasing prices. In Yorkshire and the Humber the average price for university-owned halls is now more than the private sector equivalent. Priya Bharshini, Sam Hardy and Olivia Woolhouse (L-R) are paying for high-end accommodation Olivia Woolhouse said she could not believe her eyes when she visited her first year student accommodation in Leeds: ""I was like, they're having me on, it's a film set."" While the 24-hour concierge and complimentary breakfast give the feel of a dream hotel, the bill each month is certainly real. Studio flats in the private sector-owned IconInc building, where she lives, are rented for up to Â£450 a week, depending on which apartment the student chooses. For Olivia, her rent takes up about 70% of her full student loan, which she says feels like a is worth it as so much is laid on. ""Normally you get a pot of money for your rent and a pot of money for going out and different experiences, and in here it's all in one. We're doing a chocolate masterclass today, everything's here for me."" These halls, like many high-end purpose-built student blocks, have an on-site gym, a sauna and steam room to de-stress in, breakfast is complimentary and there's a cinema room. Every bedroom is an en-suite studio flat, and there are big communal sitting rooms and kitchens where your mess is cleaned up by professional staff. Like Olivia, Sam Hardy said having a job was the only way he could afford to live in such plush accommodation. ""My student loan pays for this place, and my other living costs are totally covered by the job I have."" A big driving force behind the rise in high-end accommodation has come from international students. Priya Bharshini is a postgraduate student from India. She said traditional student halls just didn't meet her criteria. ""I wanted my privacy, I wanted a silent place to work, but where I can come out and hang out with people."" Victoria Tolmie-Loverseed, assistant chief executive of Unipol Student Homes, said that while it was positive that student housing standards had improved, it was important that students on middle and lower incomes were not priced out. ""It's not a bad thing that accommodation is nice and getting nicer, but it's also getting more and more expensive. Eventually affordability for the majority of students will be a real issue."" NUS vice president of welfare Eva Crossan Jory, said: ""The increasing cost of accommodation has created a real affordability problem for students. Rent continues to rise above measures of inflation, but also in proportion to the already inadequate student loan package."" There was a ""responsibility upon the government to consider not just the financial burden of these costs, but how they present a barrier to accessing education for those from disadvantaged backgrounds"", she added. The Department for Education said: ""We have increased support for full-time students' living costs by 3.2% for the current academic year. ""Disadvantaged students starting their courses this year have access to the largest ever amounts of cash-in-hand support for their living costs.""

Huawei finance chief arrested in Canada,"Meng Wanzhou was detained while transferring between flights in Vancouver The daughter of the founder of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has been arrested in Canada and faces extradition to the United States. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and deputy chair, was arrested in Vancouver on 1 December. Details of the arrest have not been released but the US has been investigating Huawei over possible violation of sanctions against Iran. China's embassy in Canada protested at the arrest and demanded her release. Huawei said it had little information about the charges and was ""not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng"". Why hasn't the UK blocked Huawei? A quick guide to the US-China trade war The arrest comes at a sensitive time for US-China relations. The nations are engaged in a trade war that has seen both impose duties of billions of dollars on one another's goods. The arrest will not help the 90-day tariff truce the nations agreed after President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met at the G20. It also coincides with moves to restrict the use of Huawei technology in Western countries. The US, Australia and New Zealand have blocked the use of the Chinese firm's equipment in infrastructure for new faster 5G mobile networks. The UK has not blocked firms from using Huawei, although BT, which dominates the UK's telecoms network,said this weekit would not use the Chinese firm's equipment in its ""core"" 5G infrastructure. Canada's ministry of justice confirmed the date and place of Ms Meng's arrest and added: ""She is sought for extradition by the United States, and a bail hearing has been set for Friday."" It said it could not say more as Ms Meng had sought a ban on the publication of details and this had been ordered by the courts. A spokesman for the US justice department in the Eastern District of New York - which Huawei said had brought the charges - declined to comment. US media have reported that Huawei is under investigation for potential violations of US sanctions against Iran. Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world One report in the New York Times said the US commerce and treasury departments had subpoenaed the firm over suspected violation of sanctions against both Iran and North Korea. US lawmakers have repeatedly accused the company of being a threat to US national security, arguing that its technology could be used for spying by the Chinese government. Reacting to the arrest, US Senator Ben Sasse told Associated Press that China was aggressively engaged in undermining US national security interests, often ""using private sector entities"". ""Americans are grateful that our Canadian partners have arrested the chief financial officer,"" he added. Huawei said Ms Meng, the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, was detained while transferring between flights. In a statement, it said it had complied with ""all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU. ""The company believes the Canadian and US legal systems will ultimately reach a just conclusion."" A statement from the Chinese embassy in Canada,externalwas far angrier. It said that Canada, at the request of the US, had arrested a Chinese citizen ""not violating any American or Canadian law"". ""The Chinese side has lodged stern representations with the US and Canadian side, and urged them to immediately correct the wrongdoing and restore the personal freedom of Ms Meng Wanzhou."" The company is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker after Samsung. Some Western governments fear Beijing will gain access to fifth-generation (5G) mobile and other communications networks through Huawei and expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control. Huawei offices in New Zealand, one of the nations citing national security concerns Security concerns recently ledBT to bar Huawei equipment from the heart of the 5G networkit is rolling out in the UK. New Zealand has blocked Huawei equipment over national security concerns, afterAustralia imposed a similar banon both Huawei and fellow communications firm ZTE. The US has brought a number of legal cases against Chinese technology firms, with accusations such as cyber-security theft and violations of Iran sanctions. Earlier this year, it barred US companies from exporting to ZTE, effectively shutting down the firm. The US later replaced the ban with a fine and governance changes. The US has alsorestricted US firms from selling parts to Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jinhua. Donald Trump last month reinstated all the US sanctions on Iranthat had been removed under a 2015 nuclear deal. Trump re-imposes Iran sanctions: Now what? Iran nuclear deal: Key details Mr Trump had been fiercely opposed to the deal, which saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The re-imposed sanctions hit oil exports, shipping and banks - indeed all core parts of Iran's economy. Although there are some waivers, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the US will ""aggressively"" target any firm or organisation ""evading our sanctions"".

DUP oppose deal but back Tories,"The Democratic Unionists will back Theresa May's government in any vote of no confidence should her Brexit deal be rejected, its Westminster leader says. Nigel Dodds told ITV his party would vote against the deal, but it would be ""illogical"" to vote out the government. Labour has said it will immediately press for a confidence vote if the deal is voted down next Tuesday. If successful, the move could trigger a general election if no alternative government is formed in 14 days. At a meeting of Tory backbenchers on Wednesday evening, Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith appealed for civility in internal party arguments over Brexit. Government sources said the whip's office was ""looking at all options"" to secure the support of the Commons. The vote on the withdrawal deal and the declaration on future relations will take place on 11 December. Live: MPs debate Brexit deal Brexit advice warns of border 'stalemate' Mr Dodds told ITV's Robert Peston: ""Clearly if [the deal] is defeated, it would be somewhat illogical - having achieved our aim trying to get to a better deal - it would be illogical then to turn around the next day and say 'let's vote the government out'. ""I think then we start on a process to try to get a better deal."" Following a meeting of Conservative members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group in Westminster - attended by leading DUP figures - its chair Jacob Rees-Mogg said there was a risk of the DUP withholding its support for the government if Parliament approved the PM's deal on the terms of leaving the EU. The DUP currently has a parliamentary pact with the Conservatives, known as a confidence and supply agreement, in which it effectively props up Mrs May's government by supporting it in key votes. But Mr Dodds reiterated that the deal ""is with the Conservative Party, not with Theresa May or any particular politician"". The party's 10 MPs are expected to vote against the withdrawal deal amid anger over a proposed customs arrangement between the UK and the EU. They say it will see Northern Ireland separated economically and politically from England, Scotland and Wales. Speaking earlier during a debate on the Brexit deal in the Commons, DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Mrs May had ""broken promises"" made to her party to protect the constitutional integrity of the UK and if the deal went through it would create ""further tensions"". Mrs May is struggling to muster sufficient support to get her deal through, with Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP all opposed and scores of Tory MPs saying they cannot support it. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the tally of potential Tory rebels was rising and backbenchers who have held private meetings with the prime minister were not emerging convinced.

Key bits of Brexit legal advice,"The government has been forced to publish the legal advice given to Prime Minister Theresa May by the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox on the proposed backstop plan, which aims to avoid a hard  border in Ireland under all circumstances. The backstop, or guarantee, appears in a ""Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland"", which forms part of the UK's Withdrawal Agreement with the EU. It would only come into effect if a UK-EU trade agreement keeping the border open is not ready by the end of a post-Brexit transition period. Much of the advice given by the attorney general is not new, but it isset out in black and white,externalfor the first time. Here are some excerpts from the six-page document. This is a reminder that Northern Ireland would be more deeply entwined in the EU's customs rules and procedures than the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland would retain full membership of the EU customs union, while Great Britain would be in a separate customs union with the EU. The outcome of this complex arrangement is that the whole of the United Kingdom would be in a single customs territory with the EU. That means there would be no tariffs on goods passing between anywhere in the UK and the EU, but declarations would have to be made (not involving any kind of border checks) for goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. It is a carefully crafted fudge, in other words, with which no-one is entirely happy. This section spells out clearly the implications of Northern Ireland remaining in the EU's single market for goods while the rest of the UK does not. Again, there are no surprises here, but the attorney general emphasises that, for regulatory purposes, Great Britain would be treated as a third (or separate) country by Northern Ireland. That means that for goods crossing the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland (but not in the other direction) regulatory checks would have to take place. The EU has conceded that many of them (on things like product standards) could take place online or away from ports or airports. But that is not the case for checks on food and animal produce. There are already checks on live animals arriving  in Northern Ireland from Great Britain, but this would be a much broader system of controls. This point is already clear in the text of the Withdrawal Agreement, but the attorney general is giving a legal opinion about international law: everyone says the backstop is intended to be temporary, but it could - in theory - remain in place indefinitely ""unless or until"" another permanent agreement takes its place. This is only one of several ways in which many supporters of Brexit fear a trap, although it is quite clear that the EU is equally uncomfortable with many aspects of the backstop. Please upgrade your browser The attorney general sets out at some length why the EU does not like the backstop either. It raises awkward legal questions about the UK (a country that will no longer be part of the EU) being responsible for protecting one of the borders of the EU single market. It could also, he suggests, provoke complaints (legal or otherwise) from Irish companies, which might argue that the EU is giving rival companies in Northern Ireland the competitive advantage of full access to both the EU and UK markets. And it complicates the EU's ability to strike future trade deals around the world, because the EU would not be able to define the extent of its customs territory precisely. It is likely to be important for the EU, the attorney general says, that the backstop can be presented as ""a temporary arrangement with a clear and early end"". As if there was not already enough concern being expressed about the backstop and the lack of a UK right to leave it unilaterally, this will add fuel to the fire. It suggests that the language used in the protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement might allow the EU to suggest that the UK-wide part of the backstop should be abandoned, while keeping Northern Ireland closely tied to the EU. But the lack of a unilateral exit clause cuts both ways. If the UK cannot bring the backstop to an end without the EU's approval, then similarly the UK would have to agree to the EU ending it. It has been designed deliberately to concentrate minds on a permanent alternative solution. In the end, as the attorney general points out, this is a highly political construction. But the prospect of the UK being unable to leave a temporary customs union without a subsequent agreement on the Irish border makes many people extremely uncomfortable. This gets to the heart of the problem. The EU believes the only way for the Irish border to remain as open as it is now is for either Northern Ireland or the whole of the UK to stay in the customs union and the single market. And it says it is still waiting for the UK to come up with a credible alternative plan. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external Brexit Basics: Customs union.

Rescue mission for US Marine aircraft,"One of the two planes involved in the incident was a KC-130 refuelling tanker (like the one seen in this archive picture) A big search and rescue operation is continuing in Japan for five missing US Marines after two aircraft with seven crew collided and crashed into the sea. One Marine was rescued and was ""in fair condition"", while another one ""has been declared deceased"",Marines officials said in a statement.,external The planes involved were a KC-130 and an F/A-18 based at Iwakuni near Hiroshima, south-western Japan. US media say they crashed during a mid-air refuelling exercise. The Marine Corps has not officially confirmed this, describing the incident as a ""mishap"". US apologises to Japan over accidents Japanese Defence Minister Takeshi Iwaya said Japanese aircraft and three vessels were taking part in the rescue operation. The US 7th Fleet is supporting the operation, with navy aircraft being deployed. US aircraft and Japanese vessels are searching the area A Marines statement said: ""We are thankful for the Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force's efforts as they immediately responded in the search and rescue operation."" The Marines Corps tweeted that the incident occurred at about 02:00 local time on Thursday (17:00 GMT Wednesday). The first Marine was rescued about four hours later, Japanese officials said, while the second was found 10 hours after the collision. They said one of them was from the fighter jet. There were five personnel on the C-130 and two on the F-18. Japan said the search operation would continue overnight, Japan's NHK World reports. It quoted the head of Japan's Self-Defence Forces, Katsutoshi Kawano, as saying that search teams had spotted debris floating in the sea.

O2 investigating network data problems,"Mobile operator O2 has said its data networks have been restored after a day of disruption for smartphone users. A statement on its website,external, published early on Friday, said the 4G network was working again, having been affected from about 05:30 GMT on Thursday. It said the slower 3G data service had been reinstated on Thursday evening. But some users told the BBC they were still having issues with texting and urged O2 to fix the glitches. ""I have a Tesco mobile [which uses the O2 network] - any texts I send say 'not sent. Tap to try again',"" wrote Lesley. ""Each tap brings the same message! But I find the person I've sent it to actually has received it!"" Another user Steve wrote: ""No, it's most definitely not fixed as there are numerous error messages sending texts as well as duplicated sendings."" Can I claim compensation from O2? An O2 spokeswoman said: ""A small proportion of customers have reported issues sending text messages. We can see that the vast majority are being sent and received successfully and our technical teams are investigating. ""Our 3G and 4G data services are performing as normal."" Earlier, O2 and mobile network equipment supplier Ericsson issued a joint apology to the millions of customers hit by disruption to its data services. O2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users. Services such as bus timetable information were also affected, while many businesses faced disruption. Ericsson UK boss Marielle Lindgren said the ""faulty software"" that had caused the issues was being decommissioned. In a joint statement, O2 boss Mark Evans said: ""I want to let our customers know how sorry I am for the impact our network data issue has had on them, and reassure them that our teams, together with Ericsson, are doing everything we can. ""We fully appreciate it's been a poor experience and we are really sorry."" Ericsson said there had been network disruption for customers in multiple countries. Customers of O2 will be able to claim for any out-of-pocket expenses that resulted from being without their phone, according to consumer expert Helen Dewdney. Ms Dewdney, who writes a blog calledThe Complaining Cow,external, said users should be able to claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states that services should be carried out with reasonable skill and care. That means customers would be able to claim a refund for what they would pay on a contract for the time they were without the use of the phone. They could also claim consequential loss due to breach of contract, for example, if they incurred bank charges because they were unable to move their money, or the cost of having to use a payphone. This must be a genuine loss which can be proved with evidence. So, a taxi driver might be able to prove they lost out on fares owing to the shutdown, but other workers trying to claim a lost day of employment would struggle. Ms Dewdney suggested phone users calculated their losses, and wrote to O2 with the evidence. They should state what they wanted as redress and mention the Consumer Rights Act 2015. If they felt the response was unsatisfactory, it could be referred to Ombudsman Services: Communications of which O2 is a member. The customer would need to ask for a deadlock letter or wait eight weeks from the beginning of the complaint. Ericsson president BÃ¶rje Ekholm gave more detail about the cause of the disruption. He said ""an initial root cause analysis"" had indicated that the ""main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers"". The company was carrying out ""a complete and comprehensive root cause analysis"", he added. Japan's Softbank network was also affected by the outages, which meant services on Y!Mobile were disrupted. Network down: how people are coping without a signal O2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT. The company said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some O2 customers said they could not make calls or send texts either. The outage had knock-on effects for other services that use the O2 network, including Transport for London's electronic timetable service at bus stops, which stopped working. Tom Morrod at market research firm IHS Markit said data was increasingly important to consumers, with half of UK mobile users prioritising internet connectivity above calls and texts. ""As well as the inconvenience to consumers and the associated frustration, having a major network out of action creates productivity challenges for businesses. ""Many businesses will have employees commuting or out in the field that have lost work time,"" he said. O2 customers Mischa Bittar, Omeran Amirat and Luke Stagg have all suffered disruption On Thursday, several O2 customers described the effects the outage was having. Allison Rose-Mannall, from Norwich, is an insulin-dependent diabetic who relies on her mobile and was unable to get to a landline. ""I'm disabled ... I'm in a wheelchair,"" she told the BBC. ""So having no data but also no calls as well means I can't contact anyone if I have a fall or if I need anything.""

The Marines Corps tweeted that the incident occurred at about 02:00 local time on Thursday (17:00 GMT Wednesday). The first Marine was rescued about four hours later, Japanese officials said, while the second was found 10 hours after the collision. They said one of them was from the fighter jet. There were five personnel on the C-130 and two on the F-18. Japan said the search operation would continue overnight, Japan's NHK World reports.

May: My deal delivers on referendum,"This video can not be played The PM tells Radio 4's Today programme that the backstop would be part of any deal Theresa May says she ""is talking to colleagues"" about their concerns over the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" ahead of a crucial vote on her EU deal. She suggested MPs could be ""given a role"" in deciding whether to activate the backstop, which is designed to stop the return of a physical border. But she told the BBC there could be no deal with the EU without it. No 10 has said the Commons vote will go ahead on Tuesday, despite claims it could be delayed to avoid defeat. However, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbench MPs, Sir Graham Brady, told BBC Newsnight on Thursday that he ""would welcome the vote being deferred"" until there was ""clarity"" on the backstop issue. Parliament Live: Text updates as MPs debate Brexit Senior Tory suggests vote could be delayed Brexit: Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU And in another development, the European Court of Justice said it would deliver a ruling on Monday on whether the UK could unilaterally cancel Brexit by reversing Article 50 - the day before the MPs' crunch vote. This video can not be played Newsnight: Sir Graham Brady 'would welcome' Brexit vote being deferred The government is considering an amendment to next Tuesday's vote motion that would give Parliament more say over the backstop. One possible option would see Parliament having a role in deciding whether to extend the transition period or enter the backstop arrangement, if no trade deal has been reached by the end of December 2020. The transition period is due to kick-in when the UK leaves the EU on 29 March. It can only be extended once for ""up to one or two years"" - but if the two sides have still not agreed a deal by the end of that second period, then the backstop will apply. DUP will vote down deal but back Tories Reality Check: Legal advice on the Brexit deal This would mean Northern Ireland staying aligned to some EU rules, which many MPs say is unacceptable. The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop arrangement without EU agreement. Another option being explored with MPs, the BBC understands, is giving Parliament an annual vote on whether to stay in the backstop, once it has been activated, or to pursue other alternatives. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said discussions were ""very fluid"" and no decision had been reached in government about which option to choose. Downing Street has said there is no plan to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. This video can not be played Theresa May rejected suggestions that the UK should vote in a further referendum Mrs May told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had not given up on winning the vote on her Brexit deal - negotiated over the past 18 months or so - despite dozens of her own MPs and all opposition parties being against it. She said she recognised concerns about the Northern Ireland border backstop keeping the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. And she conceded the UK would have ""no unilateral right"" to pull out of the backstop under her EU withdrawal agreement - but she said the UK would have a choice over whether or not to enter into it. ""The backstop is something nobody wants to go into in the first place, and we will be working to make sure that we don't go into it,"" she said. ""If we get to the point where it might be needed, we have a choice as to what we do, so we don't even have to go into the backstop at that point."" She suggested Parliament could be ""given a role"" in deciding whether to enter the backstop and how the UK would get out of it. ""I recognise there are concerns from colleagues about the role of Parliament, about the sovereignty of the UK in relation to that issue, so I am talking to colleagues about how we can look at Parliament having a role in going into that and, if you like, coming out of that,"" she told Today. She again ruled out a further referendum and rejected alternative Brexit plans suggested by different factions of her party. ""None of the other arrangements that people have put forward fully deliver on the referendum. This deal delivers on the referendum,"" she said. This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor What Theresa May sketched out on Thursday was the idea of allowing MPs to choose when and if they want to go into the controversial ""backstop"" - the insurance policy against a hard border on the island of Ireland. Clearly, to try to get some angry Brexiteers to change their minds, the PM is trying to give a sense that they might have more of a say. They could, as the agreement already suggests, just extend the ""transition period"", giving the two sides longer to come up with a free trade deal that would mean the dreaded backstop is never used. It's not surprising that MPs would have a vote on that. But Number 10 clearly hopes it will give some grumpy MPs a sense that they will have more of a say, introducing another layer of decision-making so that the backstop can be avoided. Read more from Laura here But reacting to the latest proposals, Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said that if MPs passed the EU withdrawal agreement they would not be able to change the backstop because it would be part of a ""standalone international treaty"". So MPs would be limited to saying ""should we ask for an extension or should we let ourselves go in"". Fellow Brexiteer Suella Braverman, who quit the government over Mrs May's deal, said the PM's proposals were a ""red herring"" that would be ""ineffective"". And remain supporter Phillip Lee, who also quit as a minister over the deal and now backs a further referendum, dismissed the PM's ""cosmetic concessions"". ""It's clear that none of the big Brexit questions will be solved by this withdrawal agreement, and that the Brexit on offer is much worse than the deal we've already got in the EU,"" he said. The prime minister's support has grown by one, however, after Eastbourne MP Stephen Lloyd quit the Liberal Democrat group in the Commons to vote for her deal. Lloyd quits Lib Dem MPs' group over Brexit Conservative Sir Nicholas Soames has also spoken up for the PM's deal, on the the third day of debate about it in the Commons, which is focusing on the economic impact. This video can not be played Remainer Tory warns over US-style 'partisan bitterness' if deal rejected Ministers are arguing Mrs May's deal creates a unique partnership with the EU, while Labour insists it will make people poorer. The Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which keeps Mrs May's government in power, has said it would support the government in a confidence motion if the deal was thrown out on Tuesday. Sammy Wilson, the DUP's Brexit spokesman, told Today: ""Our grievance with the government has been that the government made a promise to us and to the people of Northern Ireland that Brexit would be delivered for the whole of the United Kingdom, and provided there is nothing introduced to break that promise, we have no reason to have no confidence in the government."" But he added the DUP could still withdraw support for the government at a future date.

Gambling adverts 'in 95% of TV matches',"Some 95% of TV advertising breaks during live UK football matches feature at least one gambling advert, the Victoria Derbyshire show has found. One in five of the commercials broadcast across 25 matches were for betting firms, rising to more than one in three in some games. The government is considering whether new restrictions are needed, with a report expected as early as this week. The industry says the adverts have ""limited impact"" on gambling rates. Under an agreement with the industry commercials can only be shown after the 21:00 watershed except in sporting events. The research looked at 25 games involving British teams broadcast this season, from the build-up through to the post-match chat on BT Sport, Sky Sports and ITV. In these matches there was a total of  1,324 commercials and sponsorship indents, and of these, 272 were for gambling. For some games the rate of gambling adverts was even higher - in Everton's match against Apollon Limassol on 28 September on BT Sport, 40% of the adverts and sponsorship indents were for betting, with 18 adverts for five firms. In Sky Sports' coverage of Scotland's 3-0 defeat by Slovakia on 11 October, 37% of the commercials were betting-related, with 19 gambling adverts for eight different firms. This video can not be played Matt says he has been gambling since he was a teenager. Meanwhile, the one women's football match which was broadcast contained no adverts for gambling. In 2007, the then Labour government relaxed the rules around gambling advertising, letting high street and online betting firms show TV commercials for the first time. In 2016, betting firms spent Â£150m a year on TV adverts. A single advert for Premiership football is thought to cost about Â£35,000. Matt Zarb-Cousin, from the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said: ""We are concerned about the effects of children and young people being exposed to gambling advertising due to the pre-watershed exemption for live sporting events. The government has an opportunity to address this in the forthcoming review."" Earlier this year, Australia banned all gambling adverts in live sport before the watershed, while Belgium has recently done the same. Last month, the Local Government Association called for greater restrictions. It said it was concerned the volume of gambling advertising was undermining the government's aim for socially responsible growth in the sector. It highlighted that the adverts in live matches were screened to millions of viewers including children, while half of Premier League and Championship football teams were sponsored by betting companies. A recent study by Goldsmiths University found more than 250 separate gaming adverts on screen during the BBC's Match of the Day programme. These were mostly on shirts, hoardings and post-match interviews. Greater restrictions on advertising are expected in a major review of the sector, which could be released by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport this week or early next month. The government said it ""expects the gambling sector to protect players"", but added ""clearly more work is needed"". Clive Hawkswood, chief executive of the Remote Gambling Association, which represents the online gambling industry, said the evidence on the effect of the adverts was ""far from conclusive"". ""The reality is, gambling is normalised in this society and if you look at why, it was probably the introduction of the National Lottery, it changed the perception,"" he said.

Reality Check: Is the watershed still relevant?,"The Church of England has said gambling advertisements should be banned before the 21:00 watershed. But with our changing TV viewing habits, is the watershed still relevant? People aren't watching television in the way they used to. The Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (Barb), which publishes TV viewing figures, produces ""timeshift viewing figures"" showing the hours of programming watched after the time they were broadcast are on the rise. In theory, this means young people are more likely to be watching post-watershed programmes at any time of day, which could make the idea of a pre-watershed restriction less effective. But in the case of gambling advertisements in particular, a pre-watershed ban could reduce the amount of betting ads children see on television. This is partly because because a voluntary code in the industry means that before the watershed, nearly all televised commercials for gambling products and services are confined to broadcast sports events. And gambling companies make the most of televised sport -BBC research last year found that 95% of British football matches on TV featured at least one gambling commercial during ad breaks. People are also more likely to watch sports live than other types of programme. Barb found that major sporting events significantly reduced the overall amount of ""timeshifted"" TV being watched - for example, in the summer of 2016 during the Euro football tournament and the Olympics, there was an ""evident dip"" in the figures. Although children and teenagers are spending more time than they used to online and on mobile phones, they still manage to fit in a lot of television. More than 90% of 12- to 15-year-olds watch TV for 14.5 hours a week,according to Ofcom's most recent survey of young people's media use,external. This is in addition to about 21 hours spent online and 18 hours on a mobile each week. AGambling Commission report,externalfrom December 2017 indicated 80% of 11- to 16-year-olds had seen gambling advertisements on television, and 39% had seen them more than once a week. This suggests a restriction on gambling ads during sporting events broadcast before the watershed could reduce young people's exposure to them. But there's no guarantee that companies won't then compensate by pouring money into betting ads elsewhere. After a ban on advertising junk food during children's programmes came into force, Ofcom estimated the amount of advertising for unhealthy food children were viewing during those programmes fell. Reality Check: How much of a problem is problem gambling? Children 'bombarded by junk food' ads 'Remove gambling ads appealing to children' But researchers at Newcastle University in 2012 did some detailed analysis of all individual foods advertised and found that children were in fact being exposed to as much advertising for unhealthy food after the ban as they were before it, because they were viewing more advertisements for food and drink during programmes not specifically targeted at children. It seems that brands were instead putting their money into advertising during family-friendly programmes that weren't explicitly for children but nevertheless attracted a young audience. Since 2007, gambling companies have been banned from advertising in media that is specifically for children or young people, including on YouTube channels and gaming sites. But already, 70% of young people say they have seen gambling adverts on social media, and two-thirds have seen them on other websites. So it's possible that under any pre-watershed ban, gambling companies would compensate for the lost commercial opportunities by focusing more of their marketing resources on online advertising.

"The NHS patients who are 'abused and ignored'A review says mental health laws are outdated, sectioning is misused, and patients need new rights.","This video can not be played Two people describe their experience of being sectioned under the Mental Health Act New rights should be given to severely ill mental health patients detained in hospital to stop abuse and neglect of this vulnerable group, a review says. The 1983 Mental Health Act is outdated and needs an overhaul, sectioning is being misused and does not properly protect patients' rights, it says. The independent review - ordered by the government - heard from patients who had suffered during their detentions. The prime minister said the injustices were unacceptable and promised action. Kate King, 56, spent seven years in and out of hospitals in East Anglia after being admitted in 2004 following a period of post-natal depression. She said her detention probably saved her life as she had been really struggling following the birth of her two children but her experience, in a variety of units, had been ""awful"" at times. ""I was abused and ignored. I lost my voice,"" she said. She said she had experienced other patients being aggressive and swearing at her, with one even stalking her. But she also complained about her treatment at the hands of staff. ""I was restrained face down on a mattress. One nurse even told me I should kill myself,"" she said. ""When I tried to object or complain, I was not listened to. There was good care too - I remember once being taken go-karting. But my experiences left me anxious and suicidal."" One in four young women has mental illness Does the UK have much to shout about on World Mental Health Day? 'Unlawful' cell detentions revealed Mrs King formed part of the working group put together to review the way the Mental Health Act worked. It included mental health professionals, academics and patients. The 18-month review recommended a number of changes, including: new rights for patients to legally challenge their treatment more frequent opportunities to challenge detention legally binding advanced care plans so patients could express how they wanted to be treated if they were sectioned a requirement for doctors to record when and why they chose to ignore patient requests an end to police cells being used as a place of safety and less frequent use of police cars to transport patients the right to choose a ""nominated person"" to have control of a patient's care if they were sectioned - at the moment it automatically goes to their nearest relative Professor Sir Simon Wessely, who chaired the review, said it was time to bring the act up to date. ""It was written when people with a mental health problem were something to be afraid of. But the way we think about mental health and illness has changed dramatically, so now they are more likely to be seen as people to be helped. ""The act needs to help them more - to make it easier for people to express their choices and preferences about how they want to be treated and harder for them to be ignored."" He added black and ethnic minorities along with people with learning disabilities and autism appeared to be particularly ill-served by the act as they had higher rates of detention. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Simon said BME groups had higher rates of mental illness ""probably because of early experiences of discrimination and exclusion"". He also said it was important to note that such groups were more likely to be perceived as a risk. The act deals with patients who are detained in hospital. Every year about 1.8 million patients receive mental health treatment - but only one in 20 of these is treated in hospital. About half of those are admitted voluntarily, with nearly 50,000 detained against their will for their own protection or the protection of others. The numbers being detained have been rising - up by 40% in the past 10 years. Sir Simon said there is no one reason for the increase but added that it is partly down to society becoming more ""risk averse"" but also because there are fewer alternatives to detention. The rise in population will account for a small proportion of the rise but beyond that there is concern the act may be being misused. There have been reports of dementia patients being detained, while black and ethnic minority patients are much more likely to be sectioned. As well as reducing the number of detentions, the review group wants to see a reduction in the use of compulsory treatment orders whereby patients are released from hospital under supervision. They say public safety will not be put at risk. But they acknowledge the changes will require greater investment in community services, particularly crisis care to stop people deteriorating to such an extent that they need hospital treatment. The recommendations relate to England and Wales only. The review team said Scotland had already started making some of these changes, while Northern Ireland has agreed to review its own laws. Mental health charities are overwhelmingly supportive of the recommendations. Mind chief executive Paul Farmer said the legislation was outdated, with thousands of people every year having to endure ""poor treatment"". Mark Winstanley, of Rethink Mental Illness, said the charity had ""long campaigned"" for reform of the act. ""Countless people have told us how they felt disrespected and lost all control of their care while treated under the act,"" he said. And even doctors acknowledged change was needed. Royal College of Psychiatrists president Prof Wendy Burn said detention was clearly ""incredibly stressful"" for patients and there needed to be a focus on improving their experiences. Prime Minister Theresa May said the review would be used to make changes to the legislation. ""The disparity in our mental health services is one of the burning injustices this country faces that we must put right,"" she said. ""For decades, it has somehow been accepted that if you have a mental illness you will not receive the same access to treatment as if you have a physical ailment. Well, that is not acceptable.""

But she told the BBC there could be no deal with the EU without it. No 10 has said the Commons vote will go ahead on Tuesday, despite claims it could be delayed to avoid defeat. However, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbench MPs, Sir Graham Brady, told BBC Newsnight on Thursday that he ""would welcome the vote being deferred"" until there was ""clarity"" on the backstop issue. Parliament Live: Text updates as MPs debate Brexit Senior Tory suggests vote could be delayed Brexit: Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU And in another development, the European Court of Justice said it would deliver a ruling on Monday on whether the UK could unilaterally cancel Brexit by reversing Article 50 - the day before the MPs' crunch vote. This video can not be played Newsnight: Sir Graham Brady 'would welcome' Brexit vote being deferred The government is considering an amendment to next Tuesday's vote motion that would give Parliament more say over the backstop. One possible option would see Parliament having a role in deciding whether to extend the transition period or enter the backstop arrangement, if no trade deal has been reached by the end of December 2020. The transition period is due to kick-in when the UK leaves the EU on 29 March. It can only be extended once for ""up to one or two years"" - but if the two sides have still not agreed a deal by the end of that second period, then the backstop will apply. DUP will vote down deal but back Tories Reality Check: Legal advice on the Brexit deal This would mean Northern Ireland staying aligned to some EU rules, which many MPs say is unacceptable. The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop arrangement without EU agreement. Another option being explored with MPs, the BBC understands, is giving Parliament an annual vote on whether to stay in the backstop, once it has been activated, or to pursue other alternatives. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said discussions were ""very fluid"" and no decision had been reached in government about which option to choose. Downing Street has said there is no plan to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. This video can not be played Theresa May rejected suggestions that the UK should vote in a further referendum Mrs May told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had not given up on winning the vote on her Brexit deal - negotiated over the past 18 months or so - despite dozens of her own MPs and all opposition parties being against it. She said she recognised concerns about the Northern Ireland border backstop keeping the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. And she conceded the UK would have ""no unilateral right"" to pull out of the backstop under her EU withdrawal agreement - but she said the UK would have a choice over whether or not to enter into it. ""The backstop is something nobody wants to go into in the first place, and we will be working to make sure that we don't go into it,"" she said. ""If we get to the point where it might be needed, we have a choice as to what we do, so we don't even have to go into the backstop at that point."" She suggested Parliament could be ""given a role"" in deciding whether to enter the backstop and how the UK would get out of it. ""I recognise there are concerns from colleagues about the role of Parliament, about the sovereignty of the UK in relation to that issue, so I am talking to colleagues about how we can look at Parliament having a role in going into that and, if you like, coming out of that,"" she told Today. She again ruled out a further referendum and rejected alternative Brexit plans suggested by different factions of her party. ""None of the other arrangements that people have put forward fully deliver on the referendum. This deal delivers on the referendum,"" she said. This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor What Theresa May sketched out on Thursday was the idea of allowing MPs to choose when and if they want to go into the controversial ""backstop"" - the insurance policy against a hard border on the island of Ireland. Clearly, to try to get some angry Brexiteers to change their minds, the PM is trying to give a sense that they might have more of a say. They could, as the agreement already suggests, just extend the ""transition period"", giving the two sides longer to come up with a free trade deal that would mean the dreaded backstop is never used. It's not surprising that MPs would have a vote on that. But Number 10 clearly hopes it will give some grumpy MPs a sense that they will have more of a say, introducing another layer of decision-making so that the backstop can be avoided. Read more from Laura here But reacting to the latest proposals, Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said that if MPs passed the EU withdrawal agreement they would not be able to change the backstop because it would be part of a ""standalone international treaty"". So MPs would be limited to saying ""should we ask for an extension or should we let ourselves go in"". Fellow Brexiteer Suella Braverman, who quit the government over Mrs May's deal, said the PM's proposals were a ""red herring"" that would be ""ineffective"". And remain supporter Phillip Lee, who also quit as a minister over the deal and now backs a further referendum, dismissed the PM's ""cosmetic concessions"". ""It's clear that none of the big Brexit questions will be solved by this withdrawal agreement, and that the Brexit on offer is much worse than the deal we've already got in the EU,"" he said. The prime minister's support has grown by one, however, after Eastbourne MP Stephen Lloyd quit the Liberal Democrat group in the Commons to vote for her deal. Lloyd quits Lib Dem MPs' group over Brexit Conservative Sir Nicholas Soames has also spoken up for the PM's deal, on the the third day of debate about it in the Commons, which is focusing on the economic impact. This video can not be played Remainer Tory warns over US-style 'partisan bitterness' if deal rejected Ministers are arguing Mrs May's deal creates a unique partnership with the EU, while Labour insists it will make people poorer. The Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which keeps Mrs May's government in power, has said it would support the government in a confidence motion if the deal was thrown out on Tuesday. Sammy Wilson, the DUP's Brexit spokesman, told Today: ""Our grievance with the government has been that the government made a promise to us and to the people of Northern Ireland that Brexit would be delivered for the whole of the United Kingdom, and provided there is nothing introduced to break that promise, we have no reason to have no confidence in the government."" But he added the DUP could still withdraw support for the government at a future date.

"Data problems hit O2 mobile networkThe service has problems with data and 4G services, say thousands of customers via social media.Business","Mobile operator O2 has said its data networks have been restored after a day of disruption for smartphone users. A statement on its website,external, published early on Friday, said the 4G network was working again, having been affected from about 05:30 GMT on Thursday. It said the slower 3G data service had been reinstated on Thursday evening. But some users told the BBC they were still having issues with texting and urged O2 to fix the glitches. ""I have a Tesco mobile [which uses the O2 network] - any texts I send say 'not sent. Tap to try again',"" wrote Lesley. ""Each tap brings the same message! But I find the person I've sent it to actually has received it!"" Another user Steve wrote: ""No, it's most definitely not fixed as there are numerous error messages sending texts as well as duplicated sendings."" Can I claim compensation from O2? An O2 spokeswoman said: ""A small proportion of customers have reported issues sending text messages. We can see that the vast majority are being sent and received successfully and our technical teams are investigating. ""Our 3G and 4G data services are performing as normal."" Earlier, O2 and mobile network equipment supplier Ericsson issued a joint apology to the millions of customers hit by disruption to its data services. O2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users. Services such as bus timetable information were also affected, while many businesses faced disruption. Ericsson UK boss Marielle Lindgren said the ""faulty software"" that had caused the issues was being decommissioned. In a joint statement, O2 boss Mark Evans said: ""I want to let our customers know how sorry I am for the impact our network data issue has had on them, and reassure them that our teams, together with Ericsson, are doing everything we can. ""We fully appreciate it's been a poor experience and we are really sorry."" Ericsson said there had been network disruption for customers in multiple countries. Customers of O2 will be able to claim for any out-of-pocket expenses that resulted from being without their phone, according to consumer expert Helen Dewdney. Ms Dewdney, who writes a blog calledThe Complaining Cow,external, said users should be able to claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states that services should be carried out with reasonable skill and care. That means customers would be able to claim a refund for what they would pay on a contract for the time they were without the use of the phone. They could also claim consequential loss due to breach of contract, for example, if they incurred bank charges because they were unable to move their money, or the cost of having to use a payphone. This must be a genuine loss which can be proved with evidence. So, a taxi driver might be able to prove they lost out on fares owing to the shutdown, but other workers trying to claim a lost day of employment would struggle. Ms Dewdney suggested phone users calculated their losses, and wrote to O2 with the evidence. They should state what they wanted as redress and mention the Consumer Rights Act 2015. If they felt the response was unsatisfactory, it could be referred to Ombudsman Services: Communications of which O2 is a member. The customer would need to ask for a deadlock letter or wait eight weeks from the beginning of the complaint. Ericsson president BÃ¶rje Ekholm gave more detail about the cause of the disruption. He said ""an initial root cause analysis"" had indicated that the ""main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers"". The company was carrying out ""a complete and comprehensive root cause analysis"", he added. Japan's Softbank network was also affected by the outages, which meant services on Y!Mobile were disrupted. Network down: how people are coping without a signal O2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT. The company said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some O2 customers said they could not make calls or send texts either. The outage had knock-on effects for other services that use the O2 network, including Transport for London's electronic timetable service at bus stops, which stopped working. Tom Morrod at market research firm IHS Markit said data was increasingly important to consumers, with half of UK mobile users prioritising internet connectivity above calls and texts. ""As well as the inconvenience to consumers and the associated frustration, having a major network out of action creates productivity challenges for businesses. ""Many businesses will have employees commuting or out in the field that have lost work time,"" he said. O2 customers Mischa Bittar, Omeran Amirat and Luke Stagg have all suffered disruption On Thursday, several O2 customers described the effects the outage was having. Allison Rose-Mannall, from Norwich, is an insulin-dependent diabetic who relies on her mobile and was unable to get to a landline. ""I'm disabled ... I'm in a wheelchair,"" she told the BBC. ""So having no data but also no calls as well means I can't contact anyone if I have a fall or if I need anything."" Lynsey Greavesruns a company in Doncaster providing home visits to the elderly and vulnerable. Her 130 staff all rely on O2 phones to access rotas, schedules, names and addresses. She called in extra office staff to give out the information for each visit over the phone. ""There are nine of us trying to sort it now,"" she said. ""It's been a nightmare."" Luke Staggruns a plumbing business and depends on his phone, but he couldn't get through to customers or use his sat nav. ""That's a whole day wasted,"" he said. ""I'll be seeking to recoup my losses, especially as a business customer."" Mischa Bittaris also a plumber. He said he had been ""unable to contact any of my engineers or customers via email, unable to use our mobile systems to contact any engineers at all, so everyone's just had to down tools today"". ""A lot of money lost and the first thing I know about it is via the BBC website, no contact from O2 at all, disappointing,"" he added. Omeran Amiratsaid he had been a loyal O2 customer for a long time. He said he had bids on eBay on Thursday morning but he could not do them because the O2 network was down. ""It's Christmas, the budget's tight for me, there were presents I was supposed to be buying for my daughter and my son on eBay today. They've gone now."" He said he had lost the bids and ""O2 are responsible"".

"Warming made UK heatwave 30 times more likelyRising global temperatures have massively boosted the chances of summer heatwaves in the UK, says a study.Science & Environment","The heat wave experienced across the UK in the summer of 2018 could become commonplace Climate change has significantly boosted the chances of having summer heatwaves in the UK. A Met Office study says that the record-breaking heat seen in 2018 was made about 30 times more likely because of emissions from human activity. Without warming the odds of a UK heatwave in any given year were less than half a percent. But a changing climate means this has risen to 12%, or about once every eight years. Greenhouse gas levels at new record high 'Trump effect' limits action on climate Climate change: Where we are in seven charts The blazing summer of 2018 was the joint warmest for the UK, It tied with 1976, 2003 and 2006 for being the highest since records began in 1910. The steep temperatures that sustained across most parts of the UK, peaked on July 27 when 35.6C was recorded at Felsham in Suffolk. Now researchers have analysed the observed data using climate models that can simulate the world with or without the impact of fossil fuel emissions. Announcing their findings at global climate talks in Katowice, Poland, UK Met Office researchers said that the impact of global warming on the hot summer were significant. ""Climate change has made the heatwave we had this summer much more likely, about 30 times more likely than it would have been had we not changed our climate through our emissions of greenhouse gases,"" said Prof Peter Stott, from the Met Office who carried out the analysis. ""If we look back over many centuries, we can see that the summer like 2018 was a very rare event before the industrial revolution when we started pumping out greenhouse gases into the atmosphere."" 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The researchers say that in a world without warming the chances of having a heatwave are around 0.4% every year. Climate change has tipped the odds significantly to around 12% every year. The historical record, they argue, strengthens their case. ""We have observational information in England going right back to 1659 and if you look at the period before we really started to affect our climate there was only one summer in 1826 that was warmer than 2018, in that whole 200 years of data there was only one year as warm as this, so that really bears out what we are saying. Aprevious analysis carried out earlier this yearby the World Weather Attribution group estimated that climate change had made the chances of a scorching summer twice as likely. So why does the Met Office study say that the impact of rising temperatures on the chances of such a warm event happening are far higher? ""Our study looked at the chances of having such high temperatures throughout the summer in the UK,"" said Prof Stott. ""If you focus on a particular few days at the peak of the heatwave over a broader area, as the other study did, then the chances are lower."" ""But whichever way you look at it, there's a very clear fingerprint of human activity on the atmosphere."" A number of recent studies have underlined the scale of the impacts that the burning of fossil fuels are having on the climate. Concentrations of carbon emissions reached a new record high this year according to a study from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Just yesterday, the Global Carbon Project showed that CO2 emissions in 2018 were projected to rise almost 3%, much to the concern of researchers. While some people might argue that having very hot summers in the UK around once every eight years would be a good thing, Prof Stott said it was not a positive development. ""For many elderly vulnerable people this summer was not good news"" he told BBC News. ""It's the impacts on health, on agriculture, on transport, there are a lot of negative effects that we are just not used to.""

Mental health report in charts,"Nearly one in four young women has some form of mental illness, a new NHS report has found. LGBT teens are also much more at risk. Thefindings are based on a survey,externalof more than 9,000 young people in England, the first update of the report in 13 years. Overall, among children aged five to 15, one in nine had a mental health disorder, up from one in 10 in the previous study. Young women aged 17 to 19 are more than twice as likely to be struggling as young men the same age, with anxiety and depression the most common disorders. Girls are more likely to struggle with mental health as they reach young adulthood. For boys, meanwhile, the prevalence of mental illness doesn't change much among the age groups surveyed, even decreasing slightly among older teens. Among primary-aged children, boys are nearly twice as likely to have some form of mental disorder, with some kind of behavioural disorder being the most common. Mental health: One in four young women struggling Child mental health referrals up 26% in five years, says report When it feels like no-one is listening Of young women aged 17 to 19 with some kind of mental illness, more than half reported that they had self-harmed or attempted suicide. Just over one in three young men with a mental illness reported the same. The rate of girls who have self-harmed jumps from under a third among those aged 11 to 16, to more than half among older teens. The NHS report also looked at sexual identity and mental health. Among teenagers aged 14 to 19, those who aren't heterosexual are more than 2.5 times as likely to have some kind of mental illness. The 2017 survey looked at pre-school children for the first time. It found that overall, 5.5% of children aged between two and four were experiencing a mental disorder. Children were only counted if they met criteria for a diagnosable disorder, rather than episodes of ""the terrible twos"" behaviour which are common among this age group. There were higher rates for boys than for girls, particularly among behavioural disorders. The report found a link between poverty and poor mental health. Children and young people living in households with the lowest income levels were more than twice as likely to have a disorder as those in the highest income households. The effect was even more pronounced among households where a parent was receiving benefits related to low income or disability. Almost a third (31.8%) of children and young people with a parent receiving disability benefits had a mental disorder. White British children are much more likely to be struggling, as the report found that they were nearly three times as likely to have some form of disorder as black and Asian children. Black and Asian girls are much more likely than boys within the same group to report mental health issues. Among White British children, rates are the same for boys and girls. The survey was conducted in English and the report's authors noted that this may have an effect on responses among some ethnic minority groups but not enough to override the findings.

A million children 'in Dickensian poverty',"More hard up people are relying on food banks A million children under the age of 10, in England and Scotland, are facing ""Dickensian"" levels of poverty as they prepare for Christmas, a charity says. Action for Children drew on government figures for the number of low-income families with children of that age that are experiencing material deprivation. The charity also highlights a 30% rise in the demand for financial advice over the past three years. The government said since 2010, 300,000 fewer children were living in poverty. The charity will be running unofficial food banks over the Christmas period for families it says lack fresh food, suitable clothes and, in some cases, money to pay for heating. It blames the ""double blow"" of government austerity and problems with the introduction of universal credit. Chief executive Julie Bentley said: ""While the government tells us austerity is at an end, every day at Action for Children we see first-hand the impossible choices that families living in practically Dickensian levels of poverty have to make."" Parents of four, Paul and Donna Maund, from near Norwich, said the family had to rely on benefits to cover the weekly basics, despite Paul working full time in a sandwich shop. Donna said: ""It won't be long before we'll have to start using food banks, as I've noticed prices going up and up. ""By finding the bargains at discount supermarkets, I've worked hard to get my weekly food bill for the whole family down to Â£45 - but the only way we can afford Christmas dinner and all the treats for the kids this year is by going to my parents. ""Finding the money for our oil heating is the worst. ""I always have to borrow the money from my dad and then pay him back every week. ""I've only just paid for one refill and it looks like at this rate I'm going to run out again just before Christmas."" Ms Bentley said: ""Our youngest children should be waking up in a warm bed after a visit from Santa on Christmas morning - but the shocking truth is that in 2018 many will be cold and hungry in the fifth richest country of the world. ""No parent should be forced to face the appalling choice between 'eating or heating' at Christmas - but this is the reality for far too many in the UK today."" The charity is calling for the chancellor to end the freeze on children's benefits so that rising prices do not push more families into poverty. A government official said it wanted every child to have the very best chances in life. ""There are now one million fewer people living in absolute poverty since 2010, including 300,000 children.

Investor visas halted over money-laundering,"This video can not be played The European Commission says it is closely monitoring citizenship for sale programmes in the EU Ministers are halting a ""gold-plated"" visa scheme offering foreign investors a fast-track to settling in the UK, as part of a crackdown on financial crime. Tier 1 investor visas were introduced in 2008 to encourage rich people from outside the EU to invest in the UK. A Â£2m investment bought a visa and indefinite leave to remain after five years. But concerns were raised the scheme was being used to launder money. Its suspension will end after an audit process is introduced, ministers say. ""We will not tolerate people who do not play by the rules and seek to abuse the system,"" said Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes, announcing the suspension would come into effect at midnight on Friday. ""That is why I am bringing forward these new measures which will make sure that only genuine investors, who intend to support UK businesses, can benefit from our immigration system."" Reality Check: Who's allowed an investor visa? Are golden visas losing their sparkle? The number of grantedTier 1 investor visas,externalpeaked in 2014 (1,172). Last year the figure stood at 350, with the highest numbers going to Chinese and Russian investors. The scheme previously required that applicants had a UK bank account and were of ""good character"". From next year, independent, regulated auditors will assess applicants' financial and business interests and check they have had control of the funds for at least two years, the Home Office said. Successful candidates have been eligible for visas lasting three years and four months, with two-year extensions available. In 2011, the government hoped to attract the ""brightest and best"" by allowing investors to bring forward the date at which they could apply for settled status. Spending Â£10m in the UK cut the wait to just two years. However, three years later, theMigration Advisory Committee,externalsaid the scheme brought little economic benefit for British citizens because most applicants were buying gilts to qualify - so were effectively loaning the government money, rather than investing in the UK. The Home Office said in future there will be a provision for pooled investments, supported by the government, to back projects with a ""clear economic benefit to the UK"" such as supporting small and medium-sized businesses.

Two men arrested over school gates murder,"This video can not be played CCTV footage of the gunman before and after the shooting has been released by police Police investigating the murder of a man outside a west Belfast school have arrested two men, aged 49 and 51. Jim Donegan, 43, was shot in his car as he waited for his 13-year-old son near St Mary's Grammar School on Tuesday. The arrests on Wednesday evening came after police carried out searches in west Belfast. On Wednesday afternoon, police released CCTV footage of the gunman before and after the shooting. Det Ch Insp Peter Montgomery described the murder as a ""barbaric assassination"". Jim Donegan was shot dead as he waited to pick his son up from school CCTV footage shows the gunman walking to the scene and later running from it. The victim was a husband, a brother, a father to two sons and a stepfather, said Det Ch Insp Montgomery of the Police Servivce of Northern Ireland (PSNI). ""Hundreds of children were pouring out of the three schools in the Glen Road area of west Belfast at the time - many of them witnessing the assassination of the father of two,"" he said. ""Jim's son was spared from this thankfully but only by a few seconds. ""Mums, dads, grandparents, young siblings and people in the community also saw the brutal slaying. ""The callous actions of the gunman will have catastrophic psychological effects on them all."" This video can not be played ""We took our coats off and put them round the car"" Det Ch Insp Montgomery said the gunman walked past the children and fired eight times. That was ""utter madness"" as, in the circumstances, there could easily have been a ricochet resulting in multiple deaths. The shooter was wearing a hi-vis yellow jacket with ""Security"" printed on the back and was carrying a dark bag. Police believe the gun was in the bag. He walked from a lane, past parents and children. After the murder, he ran back up Glen Road and along the lane on to Clonelly Avenue. Police want to speak to anyone who saw the victim's red Porsche shortly before the shooting The detective thanked people in the community who had helped them and appealed for more information or dashcam footage. Speaking on Wednesday morning, the school's interim principal Fiona Crookes saidpupils ""had to walk past the scene"" of the shooting. St Mary's Grammar was closed on Wednesday. Mrs Crookes told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme: ""Our primary concern at that stage was that they wouldn't see what we had to see."" Mr Donegan's son soon became ""our priority"" as he walked down the lane to meet his father, she added. Pupils will be offered counselling when the school reopens on Thursday.

"Warming made heatwave 30 times more likelyRising global temperatures have massively boosted the chances of summer heatwaves in the UK, says a study.Science & Environment","The heat wave experienced across the UK in the summer of 2018 could become commonplace Climate change has significantly boosted the chances of having summer heatwaves in the UK. A Met Office study says that the record-breaking heat seen in 2018 was made about 30 times more likely because of emissions from human activity. Without warming the odds of a UK heatwave in any given year were less than half a percent. But a changing climate means this has risen to 12%, or about once every eight years. Greenhouse gas levels at new record high 'Trump effect' limits action on climate Climate change: Where we are in seven charts The blazing summer of 2018 was the joint warmest for the UK, It tied with 1976, 2003 and 2006 for being the highest since records began in 1910. The steep temperatures that sustained across most parts of the UK, peaked on July 27 when 35.6C was recorded at Felsham in Suffolk. Now researchers have analysed the observed data using climate models that can simulate the world with or without the impact of fossil fuel emissions. Announcing their findings at global climate talks in Katowice, Poland, UK Met Office researchers said that the impact of global warming on the hot summer were significant. ""Climate change has made the heatwave we had this summer much more likely, about 30 times more likely than it would have been had we not changed our climate through our emissions of greenhouse gases,"" said Prof Peter Stott, from the Met Office who carried out the analysis. ""If we look back over many centuries, we can see that the summer like 2018 was a very rare event before the industrial revolution when we started pumping out greenhouse gases into the atmosphere."" 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The researchers say that in a world without warming the chances of having a heatwave are around 0.4% every year. Climate change has tipped the odds significantly to around 12% every year. The historical record, they argue, strengthens their case. ""We have observational information in England going right back to 1659 and if you look at the period before we really started to affect our climate there was only one summer in 1826 that was warmer than 2018, in that whole 200 years of data there was only one year as warm as this, so that really bears out what we are saying. Aprevious analysis carried out earlier this yearby the World Weather Attribution group estimated that climate change had made the chances of a scorching summer twice as likely. So why does the Met Office study say that the impact of rising temperatures on the chances of such a warm event happening are far higher? ""Our study looked at the chances of having such high temperatures throughout the summer in the UK,"" said Prof Stott. ""If you focus on a particular few days at the peak of the heatwave over a broader area, as the other study did, then the chances are lower."" ""But whichever way you look at it, there's a very clear fingerprint of human activity on the atmosphere."" A number of recent studies have underlined the scale of the impacts that the burning of fossil fuels are having on the climate. Concentrations of carbon emissions reached a new record high this year according to a study from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Just yesterday, the Global Carbon Project showed that CO2 emissions in 2018 were projected to rise almost 3%, much to the concern of researchers. While some people might argue that having very hot summers in the UK around once every eight years would be a good thing, Prof Stott said it was not a positive development. ""For many elderly vulnerable people this summer was not good news"" he told BBC News. ""It's the impacts on health, on agriculture, on transport, there are a lot of negative effects that we are just not used to.""

Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell and Kristin Scott Thomas will star in a new short film, penned by Richard Curtis. One Red Nose Day and a Wedding follows the same characters as the 1994 film, more than two decades later. ""We're all definitely older - I suspect no wiser,"" said Curtis. ""It's been really enjoyable working out what's happened to all the characters."" He added: ""Now they get back together for the fifth wedding, where, as usual, not everything will go as planned.""

Youth mental health report in charts,"Nearly one in four young women has some form of mental illness, a new NHS report has found. LGBT teens are also much more at risk. Thefindings are based on a survey,externalof more than 9,000 young people in England, the first update of the report in 13 years. Overall, among children aged five to 15, one in nine had a mental health disorder, up from one in 10 in the previous study. Young women aged 17 to 19 are more than twice as likely to be struggling as young men the same age, with anxiety and depression the most common disorders. Girls are more likely to struggle with mental health as they reach young adulthood. For boys, meanwhile, the prevalence of mental illness doesn't change much among the age groups surveyed, even decreasing slightly among older teens. Among primary-aged children, boys are nearly twice as likely to have some form of mental disorder, with some kind of behavioural disorder being the most common. Mental health: One in four young women struggling Child mental health referrals up 26% in five years, says report When it feels like no-one is listening Of young women aged 17 to 19 with some kind of mental illness, more than half reported that they had self-harmed or attempted suicide. Just over one in three young men with a mental illness reported the same. The rate of girls who have self-harmed jumps from under a third among those aged 11 to 16, to more than half among older teens. The NHS report also looked at sexual identity and mental health. Among teenagers aged 14 to 19, those who aren't heterosexual are more than 2.5 times as likely to have some kind of mental illness. The 2017 survey looked at pre-school children for the first time. It found that overall, 5.5% of children aged between two and four were experiencing a mental disorder. Children were only counted if they met criteria for a diagnosable disorder, rather than episodes of ""the terrible twos"" behaviour which are common among this age group. There were higher rates for boys than for girls, particularly among behavioural disorders. The report found a link between poverty and poor mental health. Children and young people living in households with the lowest income levels were more than twice as likely to have a disorder as those in the highest income households. The effect was even more pronounced among households where a parent was receiving benefits related to low income or disability. Almost a third (31.8%) of children and young people with a parent receiving disability benefits had a mental disorder. White British children are much more likely to be struggling, as the report found that they were nearly three times as likely to have some form of disorder as black and Asian children. Black and Asian girls are much more likely than boys within the same group to report mental health issues. Among White British children, rates are the same for boys and girls. The survey was conducted in English and the report's authors noted that this may have an effect on responses among some ethnic minority groups but not enough to override the findings.

Mr Ellery was told the divorced mother of three left work at BBC Radio Shropshire at about 17:00 BST and was found in the loft of her home by her stepfather, Lee Holyoake, three hours later. The inquest was told he had arranged to fix her cooker and had to borrow a neighbour's ladder to get into the property through a bedroom window.
