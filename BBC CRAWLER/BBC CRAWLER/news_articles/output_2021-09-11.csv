TUC warns of job losses if UK misses green targets,"Up to 660,000 jobs could be at risk if the UK fails to reach its net-zero target as quickly as other nations, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) has warned. The government has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035. But the TUC fears many jobs could be moved offshore to countries offering superior green infrastructure and support for decarbonisation. The union body is calling for an Â£85bn green recovery package to create 1.2 million green jobs. TUC research from June shows the UK is currently ranked second last among G7 economies for its investment in green infrastructure and jobs. However, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) says the TUC's claims are untrue and that it does not recognise their methodology. The government is currently considering the recommendations of an independent report into the future of green jobs, a BEIS spokeswoman stressed. ""In recent months we've secured record investment in wind power, published a world-leading Hydrogen Strategy, pledged Â£1bn in funding to support the development of carbon capture and launched a landmark North Sea Transition Deal - the first G7 nation to do so - that will protect our environment, generate huge investment and create and support thousands of jobs,"" she added. Government to speed up UK climate change target Carry on flying, says government green plan Ministers 'should urge public to eat less meat' The TUC says steel industry jobs are at great risk are jobs because their manufacturing process is dependent on burning coal at high temperatures. Other nations such as Sweden are already bringing to market new technologies that enable steel production without using coal. SSAB showed off the world's first fossil-free steel plate in August and signed a deal with Mercedes-Benz in September In August, Hybrit, a joint venture between Swedish firms SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall, made its first delivery of green steel using hydrogen from the electrolysis of water with renewable electricity, while another firm H2 Green Steel is planning to open a hydrogen plant in 2024. SSAB has a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to introduce fossil-free steel into vehicle production as soon as possible. The German carmaker wants its entire car fleet to be carbon-neutral across the supply chain by 2039. The TUC's analysis suggests the jobs at risk include: 26,900 jobs in iron and steel 41,000 jobs in glass and ceramics 63,200 jobs in chemicals 18,000 jobs in textiles 79,000 jobs in rubber and plastics 15,500 jobs in paper, pulp and printing 7,800 jobs in refineries 7,400 jobs in wood products 900 jobs in cement and lime The UK's green recovery investment is currently a quarter of France, a fifth of Canada, and 6% of the US, it says. According to TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady, the clock is ticking for the UK: ""Thatcher devastated Britain's industrial heartlands with the loss of industry and jobs. Boris Johnson is on the brink of doing more of the same."" She said that unless the government urgently scales up investment in green tech and industry, the UK could risk losing hundreds of thousands of jobs to competing nations. Industry body the CBI agrees, although it thinks the UK has already ""made excellent strides"" in cutting emissions from the power sector. ""Now is the time to back up this progress with concrete policies and programmes,"" said the CBI's decarbonisation director Tom Thackray. ""CBI analysis suggests that spending in areas like electric vehicles and energy efficiency could create 250,000 net new jobs by 2030, but the window of opportunity to realise this is shrinking by the day."" Steel plant worker Alan Coombs is concerned that no plans for new green technologies have yet been set out Alan Coombs, 56, is a Community trade union representative at the Port Talbot steelworks, the UK's largest steel production plant with around 4,000 workers. He has worked at the plant for 40 years. ""Companies overseas are already setting target dates for green steel, but the UK isn't even putting our toe in the water,"" he told the BBC. ""We've got to have a strategy of what it looks like - how we actually make the steel going forward."" He says he can't see how any firm will be able to deliver new technologies without government support, because it will be expensive. But most of all he thinks speed is needed: ""We need to determine what it looks like for us and get on with it - because, environmentally, I think most every industry realises it's got to change. ""We are not part of the debates, so you can imagine - people are [like], 'Where am I going to be working? What's going to happen to the plant that I work on... and what is the future going to look like?"" Critiquing the TUC's analysis, Prof Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), points out that the UK has ""made significant progress since 1990"" on cutting carbon emissions. Prof Jagjit Chadha says the government needs to formulate a long-term green economic strategy, together with the private sector ""In the UK, we're almost halfway towards our target, as of last year, in part helped perversely by the Covid crisis,"" he said. He is not certain it is possible to tell whether the UK has lost its competitiveness in international trade, particularly since other countries generate more pollution than us. He also says that only ""a very small fraction of people"" - 2-3% of the labour force - is directly affected by the UK falling behind other nations in net-zero targets. But he sees it as inevitable that all industries will eventually have to go green and he wants government plans ""that promote the rotation of the economy away from one that's emitting carbon emissions to one which isn't."" When the UK was part of the EU, it was given about Â£7bn from the European Investment Bank per annum, which then led to Â£20bn in investment a year - the government will need to find investment to replace that. ""If we think about that happening over the next 10 years, we're then talking about public and private investment public together, probably in the region of Â£200bn,"" he said. Unions and bosses aren't always on the same page, but when it comes to carving out a green future, they are broadly at one. Revolutions are rarely bloodless. The transition to a net-zero economy will inevitably have some impact on traditional jobs, especially in polluting industries. That's spelt out in the government'sGreen Jobs Taskforce report,externalfrom July. So it's a delicate time. The extent of the impact will depend on the policy decisions we make now and whether sectors like the steel industry can be persuaded that there is a tasty enough ""carrot"" to go green, in the form of incentivising demand for a greener product perhaps or extra funding. And whether the ""stick"" - in the form of any policy to push firms to net-zero - won't be used too aggressively. It's a difficult path for the government to tread. The UK has a legally binding commitment to reduce pollution by 2050. However this will come at a massive financial cost, at a time when the pandemic has left the UK with high levels of public debt. With all that in mind, the government will set out more information on how the move to net-zero will happen and how it will be paid for, in its Net Zero Strategy, launched ahead of the COP26 summit at the end of October.

Accordion tangos light up Last Night of the Proms,"Ksenija Sidorova is the first accordion player to be a soloist at the Last Night of the Proms It may have been her first visit to the BBC Proms, but accordion player Ksenija Sidorova stole the show at the Last Night concert. Expressive and passionate, the Latvian musician's performance of Astor Piazzolla's Libertango brought a packed Royal Albert Hall to its feet. It came halfway through a diverse concert that also paid tribute to the victims of the 9/11 terror attacks. Conductor Sakari Oramo said the night reflected the ""healing power of music"". ""Due to the worldwide Covid pandemic, live music-making was stopped across the world for many months - and in some places it still is,"" he said. ""Music that is core to human expression went silent. The bond between audiences and performers was broken."" Noting that, elsewhere in the world, people's freedom to make and enjoy music was currently being ""threatened and denied"", Oramo concluded that it was ""very special for us all to be here for the Last Night Of The Proms again, with an audience, to celebrate the healing and uplifting power of music"". Conductor Sakari Oramo was helming his 28th Prom - and fifth Last Night The Prommers, bedecked in crowns, bow ties, bowler hats and a mixture of EU and union flags, were typically enthusiastic, especially after missing out on the 2020 season. They bobbed up and down to the Sailor's Hornpipe and sang Land Of Hope And Glory at the top of their lungs- the lyrics performed in full following avery public row over their possible exclusionlast year. And when Oramo paid tribute to Sir Henry Wood, the founder conductor of the Proms back in 1895, one audience member pointed to Wood's statue at the back of the hall and shouted, ""He's behind you!"" The concert opened with a new commission, Mother, by Iranian-American composer Gity Razaz. A restless symphonic piece with an extensive percussion section, it depicted the healing power of nature amid the chaos of modern life. Listen to the Last Night on BBC Sounds Proms conductor: 'We're going to play our hearts out' Proms to bring back audiences and Rule, Britannia! Speaking ahead of the premiere, Razaz said she hoped to capture ""the exquisite majesty of our natural world"" in a way that ""propels us to take more serious, proactive steps towards protecting our planet"". The programme also included a heart-breaking new arrangement of Barber's Adagio For Strings, marking the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Allow Twitter content?

The adagio was performed at the Last Night in 2001, just four days after the atrocity, with American conductor Leonard Slatkin on the podium. He asked the audience not to applaud at the end. Instead, they held aloft candles. Jonathan Manners' new arrangement was suitably sombre and haunting, incorporating Barber's 1961 choral setting of the Latin text Agnus Dei: ""Lamb Of God that takest away the sins of the world have mercy upon us [and] grant us peace"". The programme also included a recently rediscovered piece by Florence Price - the first African-American woman to have a symphony performed by a major US orchestra - and Ravel's lament for the victims of World War One, Le tombeau de Couperin. Australian tenor Stuart Skelton brought some levity with a spirited performance of Iain Farrington's I Still Call Australia Home, delivered in an eye-catching black sequinned jacket. Later, he led the audience in the traditional chorus of Rule, Britannia! wearing a full Aussie cricket outfit. Stuart Skelton in his full cricketing gear, as he performs Rule, Britannia! Skelton also indulged in his love of Wagner, performing the poignant Wesendonck Lieder with a rich subtlety, before letting rip on the passionate Prize Song, from The Mastersingers of Nuremberg. The 53-year-old, who was also making his debut at the Last Night, said he was still pinching himself after being invited. ""To be considered in that pantheon? You never expect that one. It's one of those bucket list, dreams come true,"" he told the BBC. ""It's like a wrap party for the world's most prestigious music festival."" He evencame up with a bespoke cocktail,externalto celebrate the occasion. Sidorova started playing accordion at the age of six For all his charm, accordion virtuoso Sidorova was the indisputable highlight of the night, introducing the Last Night to two mildly revolutionary elements- the accordion and the tango. She first took the stage in the first half, playing Franck Angelis' ChiquilÃ­n de BachÃ­n (Little Boy at BachÃ­n), a saccharine story of a six-year-old boy who sells flowers outside a cheap restaurant in the heart of Buenos Aires's theatre district. Sat on a piano stool, sporting some impressively voluminous sleeves, Sidorova imbued the piece with a nostalgic quality, deftly swerving maudlin sentimentality. But it was her second-half performance of Libertango - a staple of Strictly Come Dancing - that really showcased her captivating and witty playing style, as she traded riffs back-and-forth with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Viewers and prommers alike lapped up the performance. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The pomp and ceremony of the Last Night - described by Rob Rinder on BBC Radio Three as an ""upmarket stag do"" - marked the end of a triumphant six-week Proms season. Coming a year after the festival was reduced to a two-week, socially-distanced skeleton, this year's event welcomed 2,000 musicians, 30 orchestras and, crucially, tens of thousands of fans. Highlights included the highly-anticipatedconcert debut of John Wilson's Sinfonia of London, who played a soul-stirring and charismatic programme that included Strauss, Ravel and Korngold's filmic Symphony in F sharp major. Chineke - the UK's only black and ethnically diverse orchestra - celebrated diversity in composers as well as performers, playing pieces by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Fela Sowande andFlorence Price. The Aurora orchestra played Igor Stravinsky's 1945 suite from The Firebird from memory (as is their tradition); while the prodigiously talented Kanneh-Mason family joined forces to perform an updated version of Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns's much-loved suite The Carnival of the Animals.

One of the most emotionally-charged concerts was delivered by The Proms Festival Orchestra -  an ensemble of leading freelance players who were specially assembled to acknowledge the difficulties they faced during the pandemic.

Abortion drama wins top prize at Venice festival,"The winning film was directed by Audrey Diwan A film about illegal abortions in 1960s France has won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival. Audrey Diwan's Happening (L'ÃvÃ©nement) is about a woman seeking a termination to continue studying. ""I did this movie with anger, with desire, with my belly, my guts, my heart and my head,"" Diwan said as she accepted the award. The film comes after controversial new laws banning abortion after six weeks were introduced in Texas. What Texas women make of six-week abortion ban The 78th edition of the world's oldest film festival wrapped up on Saturday night, with international celebrities flocking to Venice's red carpet. The ceremony was a stark contrast to last year's event, when guests had to wear masks during screenings and around half of the seats on the Lido waterfront were left empty due to the coronavirus pandemic. The winning film, Happening, is based on an autobiographical novel by Annie Ernaux and portrays a young woman seeking a termination to be able to continue her studies, despite the risk of prison or death. The award was selected by a jury led by Parasite director Bong Joon-Ho. The second prize, the Silver Lion, was presented to Italian director Paolo Sorrentino for The Hand of God, a film about his youth in the southern city of Naples. Other women filmmakers were also honoured during Saturday's ceremony, with New Zealand's Jane Campion picking up the best director award for The Power of the Dog, starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Maggie Gyllenhaal, meanwhile, was awarded the best screenplay prize for The Lost Daughter, which features Olivia Colman. Penelope Cruz won the award for best actress for her role in Parallel Mothers, directed by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar. Best Actor went to Filipino actor John Arcilla for his role in crime thriller On the Job: The Missing 8. Last year's top prize was given to Nomadland, a US film about a widow living as a nomad after the 2008 financial crisis.

Six held in Â£160m cocaine haul off Plymouth coast,"The suspects were aboard the Kahu - a luxury Jamaican-flagged yacht sailing from the Caribbean Six men including a Briton have been arrested off the coast of Plymouth after authorities seized more than two tonnes (2,000kg) of cocaine. The British man, from Stockton-on-Tees, and five Nicaraguans were arrested on a luxury yacht on Thursday. The men, aged from 24 to 49, were held on suspicion of drug trafficking and remain in custody, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. Officers estimate the street value of the drugs is about Â£160m. The group were sailing in the Jamaican-flagged Kahu when they were intercepted 80 miles off the coast, in international waters north of Guernsey. The yacht, which had sailed from the Caribbean, was intercepted and boarded by specialist Border Force and NCA officers. The six men were intercepted 80 miles off the coast of Plymouth The arrests were made as part of an operation led by the NCA and supported by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and Border Force. Border Force's cutter Searcher and coastal patrol vessel Alert had covertly identified and monitored the yacht's movements, the NCA said. Deputy director Matt Horne said: ""There's no doubt these drugs would have been sold on into communities across the UK in such ways as county lines fuelling more crime and misery. ""Organised crime groups (OCG) are motivated by money. The deprivation of these drugs will smash a hole in the OCG's plans and ability to operate."" Mr Horne explained that the arrests of the men transporting the drugs means the crime group will have lost trusted offenders who would have been key to their operation. ""We continue to work with partners at home such as Border Force and those abroad such as the AFP to protect the public from the Class A drugs threat,"" he added.

GB's Raducanu storms to US Open titleEmma Raducanu ends Britain's 44-year wait for a women's Grand Slam singles champion as she beats Leylah Fernandez to win the US Open.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Watch the best shots as Raducanu wins US Open US Open 2021 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDate:30 August-12 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live/BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app Emma Raducanu ended Britain's 44-year wait for a women's Grand Slam singles champion as she beat Leylah Fernandez to win the US Open in the most thrilling style. The 18-year-old ended her scarcely believable run in New York with a 6-4 6-3 win over her 19-year-old Canadian opponent in a high-quality final. Raducanu threw herself to the floor in disbelief as she fired down an ace to conclude what has been the most remarkable journey. Raducanu served for the match at 5-3 but cut her leg as she went break point down, leading to a medical time-out and a clearly irritated Fernandez expressing her frustration to the match official. However, Raducanu shrugged off the delay, saving a further break point before closing out her third championship point. The two shared a warm hug before Raducanu headed up the stairs at Arthur Ashe Stadium to celebrate with her support box. Raducanu was cheered on by an emotional Virginia Wade, who was the last British woman to win a major trophy at Wimbledon in 1977. Emma Raducanu is the first qualifier to win a Grand Slam and has done so without dropping a set ""It means so much to have Virginia Wade here and also Tim Henman,"" Raducanu said in her on-court speech. ""They are British icons and for me to follow in their footsteps gave me the belief I could do it."" With the victory, Raducanu becomes: The first British female winner at the US Open since Virginia Wade in 1968 The first qualifier in the Open era to win a Slam The youngest women's Slam champion since Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon in 2004 The youngest Briton to win a Grand Slam title The first woman to win the US Open without dropping a set since Serena Williams in 2014 She will take home Â£1.8m in prize money, rise to 23 in the world rankings and will become the British number one on Monday. Raducanu will also know that she has starred in one of the biggest moments in British sporting history - and captured the imagination of the fans at home and in New York. 'I don't want to let go of the trophy' Queen leads congratulations to Raducanu Teenager's triumph crowns epic sporting year Relive Raducanu's historic US Open victory 5 Live Sport Specials: Raducanu's Fairytale of New York Astonishing. Ridiculous. Meteoric. Unbelievable. Take your pick - but no word can ever really sum up what Raducanu has achieved. Two weeks ago, Raducanu had a flight booked back to the UK, just in case she did not come through qualifying in New York. Seventeen days later, she has lifted the trophy in front of a rapturous crowd. Raducanu did not just come through qualifying: she dominated the tournament. The most games she lost in one set in her entire run in New York - five - came in the second round of qualifying. It is not just that Raducanu has kept on winning, but she has done it with such dominance. She did not drop a set en route to the final, despite meeting Olympic champion Belinda Bencic and in-form Maria Sakkari on the way. This video can not be played Emma Raducanu wins US Open - watch the winning moment In the big moments, she has held her nerve, trusting in her power and serve, even when she saw two championship points go by in the final. This is someone who, two months ago, was collecting her A-Level results. She only made her WTA main-draw debut in June. All this has happened so quickly, and yet not once has Raducanu not looked like she belongs. With all the attention on Raducanu after Wimbledon - as well as questions from some about her mental toughness - she could have easily been overwhelmed. Instead, she trusted in herself, hired a new coach in Andrew Richardson and went to America to play in the various events. No-one could have seen this coming; not the ease with which Raducanu would brush her opponents aside, or the calmness with which she would approach every match. But Raducanu always believed. And she will leave New York as the US Open champion. Emma Raducanu received an A* and A in maths and economics in her A-Levels - and then won the US Open two months later Former British number one Laura Robson on BBC Radio 5 Live:""There are so many sliding doors moments. Before Wimbledon, Emma didn't have a main draw wild card. Would she be in this position if they hadn't upgraded it? Would this happen if she hadn't had to retire from the fourth round with breathing problems? ""She played an almost perfect performance in her first Grand Slam final. You have to think there will be so many more."" Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash:""I cannot believe it. It is unheard of for a qualifier to win the US Open. Goran Ivanisevic won Wimbledon as a wildcard but he had already been to Wimbledon finals, not playing a second Grand Slam. ""She hits so cleanly. I cannot come up with a reason for this to happen. It does not make sense at all. Her performance is mindboggling."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller:""I have never seen anything like this and I suspect if I work in this business for another 20 years I won't see anything like it."" Allow Twitter content?

A full Arthur Ashe Stadium - which holds almost 24,000 people - is one of the most intimidating sights in tennis, but neither player looked fazed as they walked out on to the biggest stage of their career. Fernandez had more of the crowd support, given that she has ousted the second, third and fifth seed in New York, but there was still good support for Raducanu. The first three games lasted for 23 minutes, both players showing a devastating array of cross-court punches and fiery returns of serve, and they traded breaks as they found their footing. As she has done throughout the tournament, Raducanu dug herself out from 0-30 down several times, stepping forward, playing more aggressively and finding her first serves. That gave her the confidence to attack Fernandez's second serve and put herself on top. She closed out the first set with a forehand down the line, turning and pumping her fist towards her box before letting out a yell of ""come on!"" to the crowd as they rose to applaud. Fernandez has shown tenacity throughout the tournament and she did so here, saving three break points in her first service game to stop Raducanu taking a 2-0 lead in the second. She then found the break, adjusting to hit Raducanu's serves better, and it looked as though the momentum had swung the way of the young Canadian. However, there is a reason Raducanu has not dropped a set in New York. At the changeover she sat quietly, eyes closed, before again increasing her tempo and creating the break opportunity. She broke with the shot of the match - a stunning forehand pass, made from almost off the court, that left Fernandez stranded at the net.

What happened on 9/11?,"On Tuesday 11 September 2001, suicide attackers seized US passenger jets and crashed them into two New York skyscrapers, killing thousands of people. What unfolded that day has had profound consequences across the globe. Twenty-three years later, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two other men accused of plotting the attack - known as 9/11 - are expected to plead guilty in a military court. Four planes flying over the eastern US were seized simultaneously by small teams of hijackers. They were then used as giant, guided missiles to crash into landmark buildings in New York and Washington. Two planes hit the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York, with the second strike 17 minutes after the first. The buildings were set on fire, trapping people on the upper floors, and enveloping the city in smoke. In less than two hours, both 110-storey towers collapsed in massive clouds of dust. A third plane destroyed the western face of the Pentagon - the giant headquarters of the US military just outside the nation's capital, Washington DC. The fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. It is thought the hijackers had meant to attack Washington's Capitol Building. New Yorkers fleeing the debris from the attack In all, 2,977 people (not counting the 19 hijackers) lost their lives, most of them in New York. All 246 passengers and crew aboard the four planes were killed At the Twin Towers, 2,606 people died - at the time or later from the injuries sustained At the Pentagon, 125 people were killed The youngest victim was two-year-old Christine Lee Hanson and the oldest was 82-year-old Robert Norton, who were both passengers on planes. When the first plane struck, an estimated 17,400 people were in the towers. Nobody survived above the impact zone in the North Tower, but 18 managed to escape from the floors above the impact zone in the South Tower. Citizens of 77 different countries were among the casualties. New York City lost 441 first responders. Thousands of people were injured or later developed illnesses connected to the attacks, including firefighters who had worked in toxic debris. Emotional tributes paid to 9/11 lives lost In pictures: Silence and tears as US remembers 9/11 attacks An Islamist extremist network called al-Qaeda planned the attacks from Afghanistan. Led by Osama Bin Laden, al-Qaeda blamed the US and its allies for conflicts in the Muslim world. Nineteen people carried out the hijackings, working in three teams of five and one of four (on the plane which crashed in Pennsylvania). Each group included someone who had received pilot training. This was carried out at flying schools in the US itself. Fifteen hijackers were Saudis like Bin Laden. Two were from the United Arab Emirates, one was from Egypt and one was from Lebanon. Less than a month after the attacks, President George W Bush led an invasion of Afghanistan - supported by an international coalition - to eradicate al-Qaeda and hunt down Bin Laden. However, it was not until 2011 that US troops finally located and killed Bin Laden in neighbouring Pakistan. The moment then US President George W Bush was told about the 9/11 attacks by former White House aide Andy Card The alleged planner of the 9/11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, was arrested in Pakistan in 2003. Al-Qaeda still exists. It is strongest in Sub-Saharan Africa but even now has members inside Afghanistan. US troops left Afghanistan in 2022 after nearly 20 years, stoking fears from many that the Islamist network could make a comeback. He is considered by prosecutors to be the 9/11 mastermind, taking his hijacked planes idea to Bin Laden and later helping to recruit the pilots. Born in Kuwait, he studied engineering in the US before fighting in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Even before 9/11, the FBI were on his trail as they believed him to be behind other bombings and thwarted attacks. In 2006, three years after being captured, he was sent to the US Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and has been held there since. One reason he was not put on trial during that period was the fear that the brutal interrogation techniques used on him could have undermined the prosecution's case. Now he and two others held there have agreed to plead guilty to the murder of the 2,976 people listed in the charge sheet. In exchange they will not receive the death penalty. The other two men are Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi. Some relatives of those killed on 9/11 are deeply unhappy about the plea deal, describing it as a victory for the conspirators. The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty. Why is the US trying to stop him? How '9/11 mastermind' slipped through FBI's fingers A collection of photos of the victims of 11 September 2001, in the 9/11 museum in New York Flight safety was tightened around the world in the years following the 9/11 attacks. In the US, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created to beef up security at airports and on planes. It took more than eight months to clean up ""Ground Zero"" - the site of the fallen Twin Towers. A memorial and a museum now stands on the site, and buildings have risen up again, to a different design. The completed centrepiece - One World Trade Center, or ""Freedom Tower"" - stands even higher (1,776ft (541m) than the original North Tower, which was 1,368ft. Reconstruction at the Pentagon took just under a year, with staff back in their offices by August 2002.

From United to Disunited States - the years since 9/11,"It's almost a cliche, hackneyed even. A big event happens, and people say they will never forget where they were when they heard about this or that. But I suspect nearly everyone around the world above the age of 30 really does remember where they were when they heard about, then watched in real time, the most audacious, most dreadful terrorist attack on the United States unfold. Over the past few days, I have been talking to people not only who remember where they were, but how it upended their lives We spoke to Max Giaconne, who was 10 years old - and four days into his new school - when the teacher told him he needed to go to the principal's office. And there was his mother in tears. Max's father worked in the World Trade Center. Ann Van Hine was driving when she heard on the radio about the attack on the twin towers - and then an order calling all firemen to report for duty. She knew in that moment - with a terrible foreboding - her husband would be rushing into the Twin Towers as everyone else was trying to escape. And then I spoke to Andy. Like Max he was in an elementary school. But not as a pupil. Andy Card was President Bush's chief of staff, and had to interrupt the commander in chief as he read to schoolchildren to tell them that a second plane had hit the Twin Towers. His comments were succinct and brief: ""America is under attack,"" he told the president. Andy Card utters four words in the president's ear I remember the day vividly. As the BBC's Paris correspondent, I was reporting on attempts by Eurotunnel to curb the flow of illegal immigrants across the channel (some issues remain stubbornly familiar). We were driving from Lille to Calais for the evening news when my producer called to say we needed to find a television as something unbelievable was happening in New York. That afternoon my cameraman and I sat and edited our piece for the evening news but were unable to concentrate as we watched live the horrors unfolding across the Atlantic. A motorcycle dispatch rider went to my home in Paris to collect my passport and bring it to Calais. Who knew where we'd end up next. Some things about that day, that period I remember vividly. I remember the powerful sense of clarity it brought to so many people. What happened on 9/11? Five lessons learned (or not) since 9/11 Though the democracy we lived in might be imperfect with some dodgy, scheming politicians around - would we rather be living in societies with freedom of speech, due process, the rule of law, sexual equality, free and fair elections; or do we stand with those who would fly planes into buildings, who would stone homosexuals to death, who would deny women an education? This video can not be played Watch: Four stories of how the world reacted on 9/11 Simplistic maybe, but in a world that is made up of almost imperceptibly different shades of grey, this seemed black and white. But the other evening I watched the stunning BBC documentary 9/11: Inside The President's War Room which, incidentally, features that man Andy Card. And somehow 20 years on I had forgotten the chaos, the sheer panic, the disbelief that engulfed the US and its leadership. The rulers of the richest country in the world with the most feared military machine were cowering in bunkers, unclear what might happen next, uncertain what to do, fearful there might be a second wave of attacks. Though that is only part of the story. Alongside that there was a steely resolve; a unity of purpose. Twenty years ago Americans stood together; and most of the rest of the world stood with America. It was vividly exemplified by the Queen breaking with protocol (not something done lightly by the royal family), and ordering the Coldstream Guards to play the Star Spangled Banner during the Changing the Guard ceremony. This video can not be played Watch: The heroes of 9/11's forgotten maritime rescue mission There was iron resolve - the events of 9/11 would be avenged. Army recruitment offices would see long queues form outside their doors. Democrats and Republicans put aside their petty partisan bickering to focus on the big picture. And when George Bush stood on the rubble of the Twin Towers with a policeman's bullhorn in hand and said he had heard the American people, and the perpetrators of this crime would soon be hearing from America, he spoke for the nation. Within weeks a massive multinational force was assembled, with America spearheading, to force the Taliban - who'd allowed the al-Qaeda leaders who plotted the 9/11 attacks to set up terrorism finishing schools in the country - out of power. It was relatively straightforward militarily. I was despatched from Paris to move with a front line in Northern Afghanistan. I watched just outside Kunduz as B52 bombers flew daily sorties to dislodge the Taliban from their last remaining stronghold in the North. Ousting the Taliban was considered a global priority 20 years ago, writes the author (right) This would be the start of a series of American entanglements. And one thing they all seemed to share is a lack of long term success. The ""liberal interventionism"" championed by both President Bush and Tony Blair saw the Taliban booted out of Afghanistan, and Saddam Hussain ousted in Iraq - but what followed became known as the ""forever wars"". Messy entanglements where victory - if that is measured by a smooth functioning democracy - always bloodily out of reach. What has changed in Afghanistan in 20 years A new order begins under Taliban rule When President Obama came into power there was a different approach. In Libya the Americans would support the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, but at arm's length; with the Syrian civil war, America huffed and puffed but chose to sit that one out. In Egypt, the US supported the overthrow of President Mubarak - but when the Egyptians elected the Muslim Brotherhood to power, the Americans made clear their displeasure, and the generals moved back in. Every year, New York remembers In other words the Americans had tried invasion - it went badly. They'd tried ""intervention-lite"" - still no good. Staying outside a conflict brought criticism, and supporting the spread of democracy only worked if voters went for US friendly governments. It's a pretty unhappy tale of foreign intervention. The reasons for Donald Trump's victory in 2016 - with his proclamation of America First - are various. But one of them was certainly the growing weariness of the American people to the cost of these military entanglements. And this is the backdrop to the commemorations taking place in New York this weekend. Twenty years ago, Americans in the face of tragedy were united. Today, with relative peace and considerable prosperity they are bitterly divided. ...but for some it's too much to bear So to 2021. How incredible that to mark the 20th anniversary of 9/11 the Taliban have been forming their new government. The pre-eminent superpower seems to be suffering a crisis of confidence; and in the manner of its departure from Afghanistan ordered by Joe Biden - the Kabul debacle - a crisis of competence. How '9/11 mastermind' slipped through FBI's fingers I met Ann Van Hine in Battery Park, on the southern tip of Manhattan. She's appalled how much America has turned inwards and how Americans have turned against each other. She believes the unity shown 20 years ago is possible again today. As we sit talking, I realise that we are looking out to New York Harbour, towards the Statue of Liberty, with the stirring poem New Colossus on the plinth. ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"" Lady Liberty symbolises America opening its arms to the world. The opening of that golden door. But 20 years on the US feels a much sadder, more introspective place. PM to press Biden to delay Kabul withdrawal Biden's speech fact-checked 'Was my role in Afghan War worth it?'

'A split-second decision saved my life',"Andrew was in the South Tower when the first plane hit and was trying to descend the building when the second plane caused another explosion Twenty years ago, Andrew Cullen felt the explosion of a plane hitting the skyscraper next to him just as much as he heard it. Instinct led him to a series of actions in the following minutes which would turn out to be critical. A split-second decision over which lift button to push turned out to be the biggest decision of his life. Hitting down instead of up just moments before the second plane hit the south tower of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 ensured the Scot would be alive to re-tell his story two decades on. Born in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, Andrew was 10 when his dad got a job in Pittsburgh and moved the family to the US in 1980. At the age of 25, he moved to Manhattan to work as an analyst at investment firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBR). On 11 September, 2001, he arrived at work on the 89th floor of the South Tower. He was part of a team working on a big deal for a bank. It was a beautiful day. Andrew Cullen survived the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Centre, escaping from his office on the 89th floor of the South Tower Reliving the morning onBBC Radio's Drivetime programme, Andrew said: ""It was very clear, there wasn't a cloud in the sky, so from the 89th floor you could see forever, straight over both the Statue of Liberty as well as east over to Queens and Brooklyn. ""Usually at about 06:45, the traders and the analysts and the other sales guys start rolling in and it was really while the salesmen and traders were making their morning phone calls that we felt and heard an enormous explosion from the North Tower. ""We had no idea what it was, but the ferocity of the explosion caused our building to sort of whipsaw and being on the south east side of the building I was able to see some of the debris coming out of the side of the building."" September 11 attacks: What happened on 9/11? 9/11: Images from New York that shocked the world The heroes of the forgotten maritime rescue mission He said: ""I got out of my chair and started walking north along the trading desk, and arrived at the equity desk where Derek Sword, my colleague from Dundee was sitting. I believe he was on the phone with his brother Alan at the time trying to surmise what had happened. ""At that point myself and three colleagues made the decision to get out of the building so we headed towards the stairwell and began descending from the 89th floor down to the Sky Lobby at the 44th floor and it was at that point that the port authority instructed us to go back to our offices, so they sort of shuffled us into one of the freight elevators. ""At that point the button for 78 was lit but we decided we wanted to go down so I was the one who pounded the lobby button just a few moments before the second plane hit the tower above us."" If the lift had gone up, they would have been killed. He said: ""At that point it was chaos. I got expelled from the elevator with some colleagues. I crawled around the corner to the stairwell and maybe 30 seconds later one of my colleagues came down to the 43rd floor and we made the decision we needed to get out of the building as quickly as possible."" A wall of dust and smoke races through streets as one of the World Trade Center towers collapses. Andrew was blown behind a desk in a health club as the store fronts along Wall Street were blown in. Andrew and his colleagues still had no idea what had happened. The only logical explanation they had was that the other tower had collapsed into their tower. Now he understands that during the massive second explosion, the jet fuel came down the lift shaft and blew the lift apart. He said: ""I am not sure how many survivors there were in the elevator but I was told it had dropped at that point. So we were fairly fortunate to be on the front."" After finding a stairwell, they managed to get to the lobby where port authority officers and fire crews were trying to organise people to get them out of the building. They did not want to waste a minute so they found the east side of the building and headed into the courtyard and then over towards the street. ""Once we had seen the effect of the planes flying into the building and witnessed some people jumping out of the building, we headed to a health club we knew to get away from the scene,"" Andrew said.  ""We had only arrived there for about 10 minutes before our tower collapsed and sent the debris down Wall Street where a lot of the store fronts were blown in including the Equinox club where we were. ""We were fairly fortunate that we didn't get hit with shrapnel and other debris that was flying around. We got knocked down to the floor and we were behind a desk when it blew in over the top of us. Once the dust had settled we made our way into one of the bathrooms and grabbed wet towels and wrapped them around our faces to avoid inhaling smoke. ""Again we found the east of the building and made our way over to the East River but it was feeling our way along because it was like walking through a blackout - that's how thick the dust and debris was. When we hit the East River we found about a million other people. After 9/11: Scotland's story 9/11 anniversary: How the world reacted to terror attacks 9/11 attacks: 'I saw the world as a scary place for the first time' Andrew believes it was instinct that got him out of the tower in time. ""When you have a threat that faces you and you don't know what it is, you have a choice,"" he said. ""You either face it or you get the hell out of the situation. ""All I knew was that the explosion I felt from the first tower being hit was extremely powerful, and I didn't need to be a third of a mile up in the air.  I am deathly terrified of heights so that ironically might have saved my life."" Later in the day Andrew helped work the phones with other employees who survived and by the end of the day they had an idea of who got out and who didn't. Scot Derek Sword was one of 67 KBW employees who died Derek, his Dundee friend, was one of the 2,606 who lost their lives in the Twin Towers attack. The pair bonded over their Scottish roots on Andrew's first day in the job. They were introduced by one of KBW's CEOs John Berry who also died. The firm lost 67 employees that day. The surviving staff spent the rest of the week in and out of New York hospitals checking logs to see if any of their colleagues had survived. Andrew, now 51, is a history and economics teacher in South Carolina. He has attended a few memorial services since that day but prefers to keep a low profile. ""You manage it but you don't get over it, "" he said. ""It's a process. It is always there and it might change your life but it shouldn't stop you living it. ""It forced me to think about how I was living my life and change my path a bit, rather than following what I thought was a prescriptive path, doing things I was a bit more interested in, maybe being a bit more impetuous than I would have been.""

"Queen tells Biden 9/11 victims are in her prayersAfter sunset, 67 candles were lit to remember British victims as part of remembrance events in the UK.UK","A private service of remembrance has been held in the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square, London The Queen has sent a message to US President Biden marking 20 years since the 11 September attacks, saying her thoughts and prayers are with the victims, survivors and their families. In her message, she also paid tribute to the resilience of the communities who joined together to rebuild. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the terrorists had failed to ""shake our belief in freedom and democracy"". After sunset, 67 candles were lit to remember the British victims. Commemorations have been taking place at a memorial garden in Grosvenor Square, London, where a private service of remembrance was held earlier, organised by a support group for victims' families. Other events have been held around the world to remember the 2,977 people killed. The world remembers lives lost on 9/11 What happened on 9/11? The attacks, which were planned by al-Qaeda from Afghanistan, saw four US passenger jets seized by suicide attackers - two of which were flown into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York. Another plane crashed into the Pentagon, just outside US capital Washington DC, and a fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. Candles have been put out in the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square, London, to remember British victims People comforted each other after attending the Memorial Garden Flowers have been laid in Grosvenor Square In her message to President Biden, the Queen said: ""As we mark the 20th anniversary of the terrible attacks on September 11 2001, my thoughts and prayers, and those of my family and the entire nation, remain with the victims, survivors and families affected, as well as the first responders and rescue workers called to duty. ""My visit to the site of the World Trade Center in 2010 is held fast in my memory. ""It reminds me that as we honour those from many nations, faiths and backgrounds who lost their lives, we also pay tribute to the resilience and determination of the communities who joined together to rebuild."" And in a defiant message to mark the anniversary, the prime minister said while the terror threat remained, people refused ""to live in permanent fear"". ""That we are coming together today - in sorrow but also in faith and resolve - demonstrates the failure of terrorism."" The Queen laid a wreath at Ground Zero during her 2010 visit Events have also been taking place at Windsor Castle, where a special changing of the guard ceremony took place, during which the US national anthem was played. It was an echo of the playing of the Star Spangled Banner at Buckingham Palace 20 years ago on the day after the atrocity, as a gesture of solidarity. There was a minute's silence after the Band of the Welsh Guards performed the anthem, watched by hundreds who had gathered at the castle. British doctor saw shocking 9/11 attack from plane 'A split-second decision saved my life on 9/11' Acting US ambassador Philip T Reeker said the events were a reminder that the US had ""no closer ally and no closer friend in good times and in bad times"" than the UK. He said: ""This has shown the special relationship remains so crucial to all of us."" Mr Reeker was among those attending another event at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, organised by education charity Since 9/11 for survivors of the attacks. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson says terrorism failed to drive US and UK apart During the commemoration, the message from the PM was played, in which he said recent events in Afghanistan had only strengthened people's belief in freedom and democracy. ""Twenty years ago, September 11 2001 became, in President Roosevelt's words after Pearl Harbor, a 'date which will live in infamy',"" Mr Johnson said. ""On a crystal clear morning, terrorists attacked the United States with the simple goal of killing or maiming as many human beings as possible, and by inflicting such bloodshed in the world's greatest democracy, they tried to destroy the faith of free peoples everywhere in the open societies which terrorists despise and which we cherish."" Flowers left by Boris Johnson at the garden in Grosvenor Square, bearing a message ""in defiance of those who would have us live in fear"" Mr Johnson said that ""precisely because of the openness and tolerance of the United States"", people of almost every nationality and religion were among those murdered that day. ""But while the terrorists imposed their burden of grief and suffering, and while the threat persists today, we can now say with the perspective of 20 years that they failed to shake our belief in freedom and democracy; they failed to drive our nations apart, or cause us to abandon our values, or to live in permanent fear."" The US national anthem was played during the Changing of the Guard at Windsor Castle on Saturday A minute's silence was also held at Windsor Castle earlier Tony Blair, who was prime minister at the time, also recorded a message for the event, saying the thinking of the 9/11 terrorists was ""filled with hatred, an ideology at violent odds with a world seeking to flourish across boundaries of faith and culture"". It is as ""flawed and irrational"" today as it was 20 years ago, he said. On 11 September, 2001, Andrew Cullen - originally from Motherwell in North Lanarkshire - arrived at work on the 89th floor of the South Tower. Soon afterwards, he heard an explosion in the North Tower. ""Myself and three colleagues made the decision to get out of the building, so we headed towards the stairwell and began descending from the 89th floor down to the Sky Lobby at the 44th floor,"" he said. ""It was at that point that the port authority instructed us to go back to our offices, so they sort of shuffled us into one of the freight elevators. ""At that point the button for 78 was lit but we decided we wanted to go down, so I was the one who pounded the lobby button just a few moments before the second plane hit the tower above us."" Read the full story here Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the anniversary was about remembering and honouring those who were killed and showing ""support to our American friends as they mark this difficult time in their history"". He said the tragedy was ""still so raw"", with the consequences of the attacks ""still being felt to this day"". ""But as we mark this anniversary, I'm convinced our resolve has never been stronger,"" he said. ""We will continue to fight terror and violence, by promoting our values of justice and peace."" The Labour leader laid flowers in the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square, London London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the lives of innocent people, including the 67 Britons, would be remembered, adding: ""Our values of freedom, tolerance and respect will always, always prevail. Hate will never win."" The Archbishop of Canterbury said 20 years on it was still hard to articulate the sense of ""shock and horror"" felt around the world after the attacks - including ""the devastating loss experienced by so many people, and the fear and uncertainty that terrible day brought"". Justin Welby added: ""9/11 was a sharp reminder to us of the fragility of the privilege many of us have of living free of the threat of violence, while many in our world continue to wake to war or the fear of war."" He urged his followers to follow the example of the first responders to the Twin Towers and be willing ""to make sacrifices for the wellbeing of others"".

"Queen tells Biden 9/11 victims are in her prayersAfter sunset, 67 candles were lit to remember British victims as part of remembrance events in the UK.UKVideo 1 minute 38 secondsVideo 1 minute 38 secondsAmerica stops to remember 9/11Commemorations have taken place on the 20th anniversary of the 11 September attacks.World","A private service of remembrance has been held in the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square, London The Queen has sent a message to US President Biden marking 20 years since the 11 September attacks, saying her thoughts and prayers are with the victims, survivors and their families. In her message, she also paid tribute to the resilience of the communities who joined together to rebuild. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the terrorists had failed to ""shake our belief in freedom and democracy"". After sunset, 67 candles were lit to remember the British victims. Commemorations have been taking place at a memorial garden in Grosvenor Square, London, where a private service of remembrance was held earlier, organised by a support group for victims' families. Other events have been held around the world to remember the 2,977 people killed. The world remembers lives lost on 9/11 What happened on 9/11? The attacks, which were planned by al-Qaeda from Afghanistan, saw four US passenger jets seized by suicide attackers - two of which were flown into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York. Another plane crashed into the Pentagon, just outside US capital Washington DC, and a fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. Candles have been put out in the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square, London, to remember British victims People comforted each other after attending the Memorial Garden Flowers have been laid in Grosvenor Square In her message to President Biden, the Queen said: ""As we mark the 20th anniversary of the terrible attacks on September 11 2001, my thoughts and prayers, and those of my family and the entire nation, remain with the victims, survivors and families affected, as well as the first responders and rescue workers called to duty. ""My visit to the site of the World Trade Center in 2010 is held fast in my memory. ""It reminds me that as we honour those from many nations, faiths and backgrounds who lost their lives, we also pay tribute to the resilience and determination of the communities who joined together to rebuild."" And in a defiant message to mark the anniversary, the prime minister said while the terror threat remained, people refused ""to live in permanent fear"". ""That we are coming together today - in sorrow but also in faith and resolve - demonstrates the failure of terrorism."" The Queen laid a wreath at Ground Zero during her 2010 visit Events have also been taking place at Windsor Castle, where a special changing of the guard ceremony took place, during which the US national anthem was played. It was an echo of the playing of the Star Spangled Banner at Buckingham Palace 20 years ago on the day after the atrocity, as a gesture of solidarity. There was a minute's silence after the Band of the Welsh Guards performed the anthem, watched by hundreds who had gathered at the castle. British doctor saw shocking 9/11 attack from plane 'A split-second decision saved my life on 9/11' Acting US ambassador Philip T Reeker said the events were a reminder that the US had ""no closer ally and no closer friend in good times and in bad times"" than the UK. He said: ""This has shown the special relationship remains so crucial to all of us."" Mr Reeker was among those attending another event at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, organised by education charity Since 9/11 for survivors of the attacks. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson says terrorism failed to drive US and UK apart During the commemoration, the message from the PM was played, in which he said recent events in Afghanistan had only strengthened people's belief in freedom and democracy. ""Twenty years ago, September 11 2001 became, in President Roosevelt's words after Pearl Harbor, a 'date which will live in infamy',"" Mr Johnson said. ""On a crystal clear morning, terrorists attacked the United States with the simple goal of killing or maiming as many human beings as possible, and by inflicting such bloodshed in the world's greatest democracy, they tried to destroy the faith of free peoples everywhere in the open societies which terrorists despise and which we cherish."" Flowers left by Boris Johnson at the garden in Grosvenor Square, bearing a message ""in defiance of those who would have us live in fear"" Mr Johnson said that ""precisely because of the openness and tolerance of the United States"", people of almost every nationality and religion were among those murdered that day. ""But while the terrorists imposed their burden of grief and suffering, and while the threat persists today, we can now say with the perspective of 20 years that they failed to shake our belief in freedom and democracy; they failed to drive our nations apart, or cause us to abandon our values, or to live in permanent fear."" The US national anthem was played during the Changing of the Guard at Windsor Castle on Saturday A minute's silence was also held at Windsor Castle earlier Tony Blair, who was prime minister at the time, also recorded a message for the event, saying the thinking of the 9/11 terrorists was ""filled with hatred, an ideology at violent odds with a world seeking to flourish across boundaries of faith and culture"". It is as ""flawed and irrational"" today as it was 20 years ago, he said. On 11 September, 2001, Andrew Cullen - originally from Motherwell in North Lanarkshire - arrived at work on the 89th floor of the South Tower. Soon afterwards, he heard an explosion in the North Tower. ""Myself and three colleagues made the decision to get out of the building, so we headed towards the stairwell and began descending from the 89th floor down to the Sky Lobby at the 44th floor,"" he said. ""It was at that point that the port authority instructed us to go back to our offices, so they sort of shuffled us into one of the freight elevators. ""At that point the button for 78 was lit but we decided we wanted to go down, so I was the one who pounded the lobby button just a few moments before the second plane hit the tower above us."" Read the full story here Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the anniversary was about remembering and honouring those who were killed and showing ""support to our American friends as they mark this difficult time in their history"". He said the tragedy was ""still so raw"", with the consequences of the attacks ""still being felt to this day"". ""But as we mark this anniversary, I'm convinced our resolve has never been stronger,"" he said. ""We will continue to fight terror and violence, by promoting our values of justice and peace."" The Labour leader laid flowers in the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square, London London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the lives of innocent people, including the 67 Britons, would be remembered, adding: ""Our values of freedom, tolerance and respect will always, always prevail. Hate will never win."" The Archbishop of Canterbury said 20 years on it was still hard to articulate the sense of ""shock and horror"" felt around the world after the attacks - including ""the devastating loss experienced by so many people, and the fear and uncertainty that terrible day brought"". Justin Welby added: ""9/11 was a sharp reminder to us of the fragility of the privilege many of us have of living free of the threat of violence, while many in our world continue to wake to war or the fear of war."" He urged his followers to follow the example of the first responders to the Twin Towers and be willing ""to make sacrifices for the wellbeing of others"".

Landlord tax could help pay for social care - Starmer,"Money to pay for social care could have been raised through taxing landlords, Sir Keir Starmer was expected to tell a conference. It comes after Boris Johnson announced plans to raise National Insurance tax on workers and employers in order to pay for the NHS backlog and social care Sir Keir was to describe the rise as ""unfair"" and ""poorly thought through"". But the Labour leader has come under pressure in recent days to detail his own plan to fund social care. Addressing the House of Commons earlier this week, Mr Johnson acknowledged his tax rise broke a manifesto commitment not to raise taxes, but defended the move as ""the right, reasonable and fair approach"" in light of the pandemic. He criticised calls for a rise in capital gains tax - the levy you pay on the profits when you sell an asset - arguing that it would not raise enough money to ""even begin to deal with this problem"". Social care changes at-a-glance Minister defends social care bill reform wait Will people still have to sell their homes? Speaking to the Local Government Association which represents councils in England and Wales, Sir Keir was expected to attack the Conservatives' plans, arguing that: ""Working people will pay more tax now, but might still have to sell their home to pay even more later."" ""This is an unfair plan that doesn't work. And who is left with the bill? It's working people. It's especially low earners and young people who have already borne the brunt of the economic impact of the pandemic,"" he was to say. Instead he was to argue that ""the money could have been raised by taxing the incomes of landlords, and those who buy and sell large quantities of financial assets, stocks shares"". Mr Johnson's plans, he was to say, leave ""a private landlord renting out multiple properties not paying a penny more in tax, and their hard-working tenants to pick up the burden"". He was to add it sees ""an Amazon worker's taxes raised, but Amazon itself able to squirrel profits away in tax havens and only pay a fraction of what high street shops do"". Earlier this week, Sir Keir told Sky News he would back ""wealth taxes"" to fund social care but did not set out further details. Giving shape to a future Labour policy, Sir Keir was also expected to say that his party would introduce a principle of ""home first"" care, shift the focus to prevention and early intervention, and introduce a ""new deal"" for care workers. Under Mr Johnson's proposals there will be a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance from next April for workers and employers. It means that someone earning Â£30,000 will pay an extra Â£255 a year, while someone on a Â£50,000 salary will pay Â£505. Income from share dividends - earned by those who own shares in companies - will also see a 1.25% tax rate increase. In 2023, National Insurance will return to its previous level and the tax increase will become a separate health and social care levy on earnings. The majority of the Â£36bn fund raised by the rise will go towards tackling the backlog of NHS cases created by the pandemic. A smaller portion of the money - Â£5.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that. In his speech, Sir Keir was to warn that the government plans would not provide any money for councils in the short term and would force them to put up council tax in order to meet demand.

Five lessons learned since 9/11,"Guantanamo Bay galvanised some in the Middle East against the US What lessons, if any, have been learned from the 20 years of fighting terrorism across the world? What has worked and what hasn't? And today, as Afghanistan is once more ruled by the movement that sheltered al-Qaeda, are we any wiser than we were on the morning of 11 September 2001? For an America reeling from the worst ever terrorist attack on the continental USA, the world was seen by some in sharp contrast. There were the good guys versus the bad guys. ""Every nation, every region,"" declared President George W Bush, nine days after the 9/11 attacks, ""now has a decision to make. Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists"". A so-called ""War on Terror"" had been declared. It has since led to the invasion of Afghanistan, then Iraq, to the rise of Isis and the proliferation of Iranian-backed militias across the Middle East, and the deaths of thousands of servicemen and women and many more civilians. Terrorism has not been eliminated - every major European country has suffered attacks in recent years - but there have been successes too. To date, there has never been an attack approaching the scale of 9/11. Al-Qaeda's bases in Afghanistan were destroyed, its leaders hunted down in Pakistan. The self-declared Isis caliphate that terrorised much of Syria and Iraq has been dismantled. What happened on 9/11? Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan? How much has the Afghanistan war cost? The list below is doubtless contentious and it is far from comprehensive. It is based on my own observations of covering this subject across the Middle East, Afghanistan, Washington and Guantanamo Bay. The clues were there but nobody joined up the dots in time. In the months leading up to 9/11, America's two primary intelligence agencies, the FBI and the CIA, were both aware that some kind of plot was in the wind. But such was the rivalry between domestic and overseas intelligence-gathering that they kept what they knew to themselves. Since then, the 9/11 Commission Report has exhaustively trawled through the mistakes made and major improvements have been made. Visiting the US National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) in Virginia in 2006, I was shown how 17 US agencies now pooled their intelligence on a daily basis. Britain set up its own fusion centre: the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) where dozens of specialists from MI5, MI6, Defence, Transport, Health and other areas all sit together inside one building on London's Embankment, providing a continual assessment of the ongoing terror threat to UK nationals at home and abroad. The city of Manchester mourned bombing victims in 2017 But the system is not perfect. Two years after the JTAC was established al-Qaeda carried out the 7/7 London bombings, using British nationals to kill more than 50 people. A massive plot to bomb multiple airliners in mid-flight was averted the following year with the help of Pakistan but Britain still suffered multiple attacks in 2017 including the Manchester bombing. So even good intelligence-gathering and sharing can fail to prevent attacks if the wrong decisions are taken on prioritisation of tasks. The 2015 Bataclan attack in Paris, which killed 130 people and for whichthe trial is currently under way, was partly the result of a failure by European authorities to share timely intelligence across borders. Of all the many reasons why Afghanistan has reverted to Taliban rule, one stands out: the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. This ill-fated decision became a massive distraction to what was going on in Afghanistan. Many US and British Special Forces, who had been successfully hunting down al-Qaeda operatives and working with Afghan partners to keep Taliban insurgents on the back foot, were withdrawn and sent to Iraq instead. This allowed the Taliban and others to regroup and come back stronger. By November 2003, when I visited a US infantry outpost in Afghanistan's Paktika province, Americans were already describing their mission there as ""Op Forgotten"". Inspirational Afghan robotics team begin new chapter 'I'll keep protesting until the Taliban kill me' It is easy to forget that the original mission in Afghanistan was clear-cut and well-executed. After the Taliban rulers refused to hand over the perpetrators, the US teamed up with the Northern Alliance (Afghans opposed to the Taliban) to successfully drive out both the Taliban and al-Qaeda. But in the years that followed the mission then got diluted, spinning off in numerous directions. Life improved immeasurably during that time for most Afghans but billions of dollars spent on ""nation building"" have been squandered through corruption and waste. Britain's partnering with its closest ally, the US, in the 2003 invasion of Iraq meant that the UK was the junior partner in nearly all the key decisions that followed during the subsequent occupation. Urgent pleas not to disband the Iraqi army or ban all members of the Baath party from government roles were ignored or overruled. The result was a catastrophic alliance between disgruntled and newly unemployed Iraqi military and intelligence officers with fanatical jihadists. This became Isis. A new order begins under Taliban rule Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and the binding pledge The collective panic that followed 9/11 meant that US and British intelligence ended up cooperating with certain regimes with appalling human rights records. These chickens came home to roost. For example, after Colonel Gaddafi's hideous regime in Libya was overthrown in 2011 journalists found a letter from a senior MI6 officer to his Libyan counterpart that discussed the extradition of an Islamist dissident to face arrest and mistreatment. Today, violent jihadism is most resurgent in the poorly governed or ungoverned parts of Africa, posing a problem for who exactly the West should partner with. Time and again people in the Middle East have told me: ""We may not have liked US foreign policy but we always respected its rule of law. Until Guantanamo Bay."" Rounding up suspects ""on the battlefield"" - including in a few cases innocent civilians who had been sold for a bounty - and then wrapping them in nappies, goggles and earmuffs to be transported halfway across the world to a US naval detention centre on Cuba did untold damage to America and the West's reputation. US troops swiftly eliminated al-Qaeda and the Taliban from Afghanistan in 2001, so why did the war drag on? Detention without trial was something that happened in autocratic countries back home. Arabs did not expect it of the US. Worse was to follow, with revelations of ""enhanced interrogation"", waterboarding and other mistreatment at CIA black sites  where suspected terrorists simply disappeared. The Obama presidency put a stop to this but the damage was done. The western interventions that preceded 9/11 were relatively quick and simple by comparison. Sierre Leone, Kosovo, even the Desert Storm campaign of 1991 - all had a finite ending. But the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and then Iraq have resulted in what have been called ""the forever wars"". No one involved back in 2001 or 2003 envisaged that they would still be there two decades later. Put simply, the West did not understand what it was getting into and there was no realistic exit plan. There is no doubt that if the West had not displaced the Taliban and Al-Qaida in Afghanistan in 2001 then more attacks from there would have ensued. The counter-terrorism mission in that country was not a failure but the nation-building one was never completed. And today, the one abiding image most people will take away is that of desperate Afghans running alongside a departing USAF C17 transport, trying to escape the country the West has now all but abandoned.

Families must choose food or fuel in benefits cut,"Mother-of-four Gemma Mathews is used to budgeting - but says the cut in Universal Credit would mean families face a choice between food and fuel this winter Families could struggle to keep warm and put food on the table this winter if universal credit cuts go ahead, according to a charity. Mother-of-four Gemma Mathews, from Carmarthenshire, said parents would face a choice between food and fuel if they lose the Â£20-a-week uplift. Charity Home-Start Cymru called fora reversal of the decision to cut the ""lifeline"" next month. The UK government said the uplift was always temporary and had done its job. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the extra payment would stop in October, after helping people through the pandemic. But there are growing calls for it to be extended or made permanent. The devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Irelandhave called on the UK government to rethink plans to end the universal credit uplift. According to the latest figures published by the Department for Work and Pensions, 236,253 households in Wales receive universal credit. Home-Start Cymru, which supports families across Wales, said losing the extra Â£20-a-week would ""risk thousands of Welsh families falling into unacceptable levels of poverty"". Why are my universal credit payments being reduced? Calls for extension to Â£20 universal credit top-up Mrs Mathews, 32, from Upper Brynamman, has been on universal credit since July, when her husband Adam gave up work to become a full-time carer. She said they would find it difficult to pay bills and meet the needs of their four children, including two with autism, if the plans go ahead. ""We're struggling anyway,"" she said, accusing the UK government of ""setting me up for failure"". ""This money would have been used for utilities, heating. It's a lot to be losing. ""The relief of having the extra Â£20-a-week was amazing. It was for Covid relief but Covid is still going on. ""For instance, if I run out of bread and milk I won't have that income to go and pick up something that I need. Or if there's an emergency like a tyre's broken on the car. ""Being on benefits, you can't prepare for things like that situation because you have to pay for the here and now. There have been times I've had to go to food banks because it has been a struggle."" With winter and Christmas approaching, Mrs Mathews said she was already budgeting as much as she can to cover household bills. She said: ""I try to buy in bulk rather than single-use and If I've got Â£20 to last me the week, my go-to tends to be store brands - not that tasty but it's a belly-filler. ""I don't buy lavish things, I buy basics, I look in the sales, bargain boxes. ""Parents like myself will have to make cuts - you pay a bill so you have to cut from the food budget. Mrs Matthews added cuts to universal credit will have a direct impact on children. ""I have to be quite restrictive because the children can be 'Can I have this? Can I have that?' and I have to say 'no'. It's quite difficult. ""Parents want to send their children to out-of-school activities like football or swimming but won't be able to do that anymore because they haven't got the funds to do it. That child then hasn't got the option to do that anymore. ""Christmas is going to come around the corner, how am I going to manage?"" Childhoods are being affected by poverty, says Home-Start Cymru Home-Start Cymru said childhoods were being adversely affected by poverty and that families ""deserve the opportunities they need to thrive because childhood won't wait"". Mrs Mathews said she would struggle to further cut living costs if their benefits are reduced. ""I try not to get into real debt with anybody because I know what it's like once you're under, you're under for a long time. I'm trying my best,"" she said. ""Normally through the summer months I would save money on the side and put that money towards my winter fuel. I'm unable to do that this year. ""When my benefits come in I need to prioritise the bills that come in first, so I'm up-to-date with those, then obviously I need to start putting money away for the heating bills. ""I need to feed my kids, so the kids are the priority for food, which means I probably won't be able to put the heating on, and I can get fleecy blankets for the kids. ""For me, there's no personal care like haircuts, clothes shopping, makeup, having your nails done, things like that. There's nothing left."" Wales 'has highest child poverty rates in UK' She added that she and her husband sleep in the living room of their three-bedroom council house and are waiting to be moved to a more suitable property for a family-of-six. But she worried that other families are suffering greater hardships and would not cope when their benefits are cut. ""There are families out there who are really going to struggle, they've got debts, they've got issues,"" she said. ""It's not people on benefits doing nothing. People look on the benefits system and think they're scrounging - no, we're not, we're doing this because of our certain circumstances in our lives."" Childhoods are being held back by poverty, says the charity Another mother on universal credit said her mental health has been affected by the announcement that the temporary uplift is to end. Sara, not her real name, has a one-year-old child and is living independently after escaping an abusive relationship. ""I can just about cope with things as they are, and was going to build back my emergency pot,"" she said. ""But when the Â£20-a-week goes, I'm going to be stuffed. I don't want to think about it. It's stressing me out."" Bethan Webber, chief executive of Home-Start Cymru, said the effects of the cut will be ""devastating"". ""These families rely on the Â£20 increase to buy essentials like food and clothing from themselves and their children. It has helped them keep their heads above water. ""Now is the time for the UK government to listen to the growing number of voices expressing support and rethink the plans to cut universal credit."" The UK government said: ""As announced by the Chancellor at the Budget, the uplift to universal credit was always temporary. It was designed to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so."" It added that universal credit will continue to provide vital support for those both in and out of work and the government's focus is on supporting people back into work.

"Schools safe for children and staff, says CMOSir Michael McBride says ""certainty of long-term harm to many children"" from not attending school.Northern IrelandComments","Northern Ireland primary pupils are only behind students in the east Asian countries Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan Schools are safe places for children and staff, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has said. Professor Sir Michael McBride made the comments in a detailed letter about schools to pupils, parents and staff. He added, though, that it was ""inevitable"" there would be Covid cases in schools. But he said there was a ""certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people"" from not attending school. ""The public health grounds for keeping and supporting children at school are extremely strong,"" he wrote. His letter comes as the Public Health Authority (PHA)takes over responsibility for contact tracing in schools on Friday. In his letter Sir Michael said that the Covid pandemic had damaged children's wellbeing, mental health and education. ""Children from more disadvantaged backgrounds have been particularly negatively impacted,"" he said. ""As we progress through the pandemic response, we must continue to strike a balance between safeguarding children's education and wellbeing and measures to contain Covid."" Pupils in contact with Covid case can stay in class Pandemic 'had severe impact' on young people Children's very low Covid risk confirmed by study Schools overwhelmed by 'tsunami' of Covid absences Sir Michael said that now was the right time to take a more targeted approach to contact tracing in schools and said he was writing to explain why that was the case. ""Multiple sources of evidence show that a lack of schooling increases inequalities, reduces the life chances of children and can exacerbate physical and mental health issues,"" he said. ""School improves health, learning, socialisation and opportunities throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood."" He wrote that it was ""no longer necessary"" to close schools as had happened earlier in the pandemic. Sir Michael McBride said there is a ""certainty of long-term harm to many children"" from not attending school He also cited large-scale studies from England and Scotland which showed ""the vast majority of those identified as school close contacts and sent home to isolate during the last academic year did not go on to develop Covid"". The chief medical officer said that the overall risk of children becoming severely ill from Covid was extremely low. He also said all school staff had the chance to be fully vaccinated, and that many other safety measures remained in place in schools. ""It is my professional opinion, which is shared by my chief medical officer colleagues across the UK, that very few, if any, children or teenagers will come to long-term harm from Covid due solely to attending school,"" he said. ""This has to be set against a certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people from not attending school."" Sir Michael said the contact tracing taken on by the PHA would bring Northern Ireland into line with England, Scotland and Wales and identify children with the ""closest contact"" to a positive case. He also said it would free principals and teachers to get back to ""doing what they do best - teaching and inspiring our children and young people.""

Fraud warning for young: 'I had Â£700 stolen',"Rudy, 18, is worried about being able to pay his rent after his money was stolen ""This money was the most important money I could have had,"" says Rudy D'Souza. ""I'd just moved out and got a new job. But my pay is due after my rent, so I felt really tense and like an idiot for falling for this scam."" The 18-year-old is talking about how Â£700 left over from his government-backedChild Trust Fundwas stolen last week. He was going to use it to help set up his new life until fraudsters scammed him in an act of so-calledpush payment fraud,external. In this type of scam, victims are tricked into transferring money to a fraudster in the belief they are calling from the victim's bank or the police. Last year alone, Â£479m was stolen from 150,000 victims in this way - an increase of 22% on the previous year. The criminals who targeted Rudy managed to convince him they were calling from his bank by quoting his sort code, account number and card details back to him over the phone. ""I never even heard of push payment fraud until I became a victim,"" Rudy told the BBC, ""I was aware my real bank would never ask for my password or OTP [one-time passcode] or give them permission to use my laptop by remote access, but they didn't ask me to do any of that - that's why I thought they were my bank. ""Now it turns out it's happened to a lot of people I know, but it's never really talked about because of all the shame around it."" As for the main awareness campaign run by UK Finance on behalf of the banks and building societies,Take Five To Stop Fraud,external, Rudy said he'd never heard of it. ""I've never seen anything on my Instagram feed about it, never seen it on TV,"" he says. ""It kind of felt it came out of the blue."" Anti-fraud charity the Fraud Advisory Panel is warning banks are not doing enough to raise awareness about the dangers of fraud to young adults. That is something that's especially important for 18 and 19-year-olds who are getting access to government-backed Child Trust Funds. About 55,000 people turn 18 each month, so that since the funds began to mature in September 2020, some 700,000 people have suddenly been able to access hundreds or even thousands of pounds. That can mean rich pickings for fraudsters. Arun Chauhan says banks can't use a ""one-size fits all"" approach with fraud awareness campaigns ""Key is that young adults do not understand the ease of impersonation and email interception which often leads to APP fraud,"" says Arun Chouhan, a solicitor and trustee at the Fraud Advisory Panel. ""There is no consistent approach to education of this demographic. Many do not realise the personal implications or risks of sharing data on social media,"" he adds. He says banks should be doing more on social media channels that will reach this age group, such as TikTok or YouTube. ""A fraud awareness campaign that aims to warn 25 to 30-year-olds may not work in the same way for 18 to 19-year-olds. You have to very specifically target different demographics, so you can't have generic, one-size-fits-all fraud awareness messaging."" UK Finance, which runs the Take Five To Stop Fraud campaign on behalf of banks, told Money Box; ""The banking sector is continuously looking at the best ways of ensuring customers are made aware of the risks of fraud, including advertising across a range of social media platforms."" It does have accounts on Twitter and on Facebook, but only 211 followers on Instagram and no presence on Snapchat or TikTok, although it says it is in discussions about putting content up on this platform. ""In the coming year, we plan to have advertising warnings up across a greater range of platforms to enable us to reach a wider audience, including more young people."" Since Rudy had his money stolen, he has been one of the lucky victims of push payment fraud who has had the money refunded by the bank.

Queen tells Biden 9/11 victims are in her prayers,"A private service of remembrance has been held in the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square, London The Queen has sent a message to US President Biden marking 20 years since the 11 September attacks, saying her thoughts and prayers are with the victims, survivors and their families. In her message, she also paid tribute to the resilience of the communities who joined together to rebuild. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the terrorists had failed to ""shake our belief in freedom and democracy"". After sunset, 67 candles were lit to remember the British victims. Commemorations have been taking place at a memorial garden in Grosvenor Square, London, where a private service of remembrance was held earlier, organised by a support group for victims' families. Other events have been held around the world to remember the 2,977 people killed. The world remembers lives lost on 9/11 What happened on 9/11? The attacks, which were planned by al-Qaeda from Afghanistan, saw four US passenger jets seized by suicide attackers - two of which were flown into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York. Another plane crashed into the Pentagon, just outside US capital Washington DC, and a fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. Candles have been put out in the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square, London, to remember British victims People comforted each other after attending the Memorial Garden Flowers have been laid in Grosvenor Square In her message to President Biden, the Queen said: ""As we mark the 20th anniversary of the terrible attacks on September 11 2001, my thoughts and prayers, and those of my family and the entire nation, remain with the victims, survivors and families affected, as well as the first responders and rescue workers called to duty. ""My visit to the site of the World Trade Center in 2010 is held fast in my memory. ""It reminds me that as we honour those from many nations, faiths and backgrounds who lost their lives, we also pay tribute to the resilience and determination of the communities who joined together to rebuild."" And in a defiant message to mark the anniversary, the prime minister said while the terror threat remained, people refused ""to live in permanent fear"". ""That we are coming together today - in sorrow but also in faith and resolve - demonstrates the failure of terrorism."" The Queen laid a wreath at Ground Zero during her 2010 visit Events have also been taking place at Windsor Castle, where a special changing of the guard ceremony took place, during which the US national anthem was played. It was an echo of the playing of the Star Spangled Banner at Buckingham Palace 20 years ago on the day after the atrocity, as a gesture of solidarity. There was a minute's silence after the Band of the Welsh Guards performed the anthem, watched by hundreds who had gathered at the castle. British doctor saw shocking 9/11 attack from plane 'A split-second decision saved my life on 9/11' Acting US ambassador Philip T Reeker said the events were a reminder that the US had ""no closer ally and no closer friend in good times and in bad times"" than the UK. He said: ""This has shown the special relationship remains so crucial to all of us."" Mr Reeker was among those attending another event at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, organised by education charity Since 9/11 for survivors of the attacks. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson says terrorism failed to drive US and UK apart During the commemoration, the message from the PM was played, in which he said recent events in Afghanistan had only strengthened people's belief in freedom and democracy. ""Twenty years ago, September 11 2001 became, in President Roosevelt's words after Pearl Harbor, a 'date which will live in infamy',"" Mr Johnson said. ""On a crystal clear morning, terrorists attacked the United States with the simple goal of killing or maiming as many human beings as possible, and by inflicting such bloodshed in the world's greatest democracy, they tried to destroy the faith of free peoples everywhere in the open societies which terrorists despise and which we cherish."" Flowers left by Boris Johnson at the garden in Grosvenor Square, bearing a message ""in defiance of those who would have us live in fear"" Mr Johnson said that ""precisely because of the openness and tolerance of the United States"", people of almost every nationality and religion were among those murdered that day. ""But while the terrorists imposed their burden of grief and suffering, and while the threat persists today, we can now say with the perspective of 20 years that they failed to shake our belief in freedom and democracy; they failed to drive our nations apart, or cause us to abandon our values, or to live in permanent fear."" The US national anthem was played during the Changing of the Guard at Windsor Castle on Saturday A minute's silence was also held at Windsor Castle earlier Tony Blair, who was prime minister at the time, also recorded a message for the event, saying the thinking of the 9/11 terrorists was ""filled with hatred, an ideology at violent odds with a world seeking to flourish across boundaries of faith and culture"". It is as ""flawed and irrational"" today as it was 20 years ago, he said. On 11 September, 2001, Andrew Cullen - originally from Motherwell in North Lanarkshire - arrived at work on the 89th floor of the South Tower. Soon afterwards, he heard an explosion in the North Tower. ""Myself and three colleagues made the decision to get out of the building, so we headed towards the stairwell and began descending from the 89th floor down to the Sky Lobby at the 44th floor,"" he said. ""It was at that point that the port authority instructed us to go back to our offices, so they sort of shuffled us into one of the freight elevators. ""At that point the button for 78 was lit but we decided we wanted to go down, so I was the one who pounded the lobby button just a few moments before the second plane hit the tower above us."" Read the full story here Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the anniversary was about remembering and honouring those who were killed and showing ""support to our American friends as they mark this difficult time in their history"". He said the tragedy was ""still so raw"", with the consequences of the attacks ""still being felt to this day"". ""But as we mark this anniversary, I'm convinced our resolve has never been stronger,"" he said. ""We will continue to fight terror and violence, by promoting our values of justice and peace."" The Labour leader laid flowers in the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square, London London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the lives of innocent people, including the 67 Britons, would be remembered, adding: ""Our values of freedom, tolerance and respect will always, always prevail. Hate will never win."" The Archbishop of Canterbury said 20 years on it was still hard to articulate the sense of ""shock and horror"" felt around the world after the attacks - including ""the devastating loss experienced by so many people, and the fear and uncertainty that terrible day brought"". Justin Welby added: ""9/11 was a sharp reminder to us of the fragility of the privilege many of us have of living free of the threat of violence, while many in our world continue to wake to war or the fear of war."" He urged his followers to follow the example of the first responders to the Twin Towers and be willing ""to make sacrifices for the wellbeing of others"".

US remembers those who died in 9/11,"Relatives of people who died on 9/11 have read out victims' names, as the US marks 20 years since the deadliest terror attacks on its soil. Many struggled to hold back tears at the ceremony held at Ground Zero, the site of the Twin Towers destroyed in the attacks by al-Qaeda militants. ""Twenty years feels like an eternity, but it still feels like yesterday,"" cried Lisa Reina who lost her husband. A minute's silence was held at the exact time each hijacked plane crashed. George W Bush, who was the US president at the time, gave a speech in Pennsylvania, where one of the planes crashed into a field after passengers overpowered the hijackers. ""The world was loud with carnage and sirens, and then quiet with missing voices that would never be heard again,"" he said. ""It's hard to describe the mix of feelings we experienced."" Saturday's events as they happened The official memorial in New York started with a minute's silence at 08:46 (12:46 GMT) - the exact moment the first plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center in 2001. All morning, roses continued to be placed beside the names of the 2,977 victims etched into the Ground Zero memorial. There were five more moments of silence over the next few hours - marking the time when the second plane crashed into the South Tower, when a third jet struck the Pentagon just outside Washington DC, when the fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania, and finally when each tower collapsed. The tributes continued into the night, as two beams of light shone four miles (6.4 km) into the sky. The Tribute in Light was illuminated after sunset. With thousands of names to read out, the list took hours to complete. Mike Low, whose daughter was a flight attendant in the first plane that hit the World Trade Center, started it off. He thanked those who helped his family get through ""the darkest days of our lives"". Mr Low recalled the ""grey and black world"" of New York in the aftermath of the attack, and asked for 9/11 to be remembered ""not as numbers or a date, but the faces of ordinary people"". Lisa Reina was nearly eight months pregnant when her husband Joseph was killed. Fighting back tears, she said: ""Our son is the spitting image of you... Continue to watch over us and your family. Until we meet again, my love."" A generation of relatives has been born since the attacks, and some took to the stage to share in the name-readings. One young girl told her late uncle: ""I never met you, but I really miss you."" This video can not be played How the victims of 9/11 were commemorated on the 20th anniversary At the memorial in New York, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden were joined by former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as former First Ladies Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama. Mr Biden travelled to all three attack sites on Saturday - New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. In a video released on the eve of the anniversary, he paid tribute to the victims. ""No matter how much time has passed, these commemorations bring everything painfully back as if you just got the news a few seconds ago,"" he said. Vice-President Kamala Harris spoke in Shanksville, Pennsylvania after George W Bush. ""We must challenge ourselves to look back, to remember, for the sake of our children... and for that reason, we must also look forward,"" she said. It is thought that the hijackers of the plane that crashed into the Shanksville field meant to attack the Capitol Building in Washington DC, but passengers and crew fought back. At a wreath-laying ceremony, Mr Biden said they had shown ""genuine heroism"". On Saturday morning, former President Donald Trump released a video statement praising first responders and adding it was a ""sad time for the way our war on those that did such harm to our country ended last week"" -referring to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Mr Trump did not attend the ceremony in New York, however he did visit a Manhattan police station near Trump Tower. Later on Saturday he was due to provide commentary for a boxing match in Florida with his eldest son, Donald Jr. Other ceremonies included a vigil at the New York Fire Department's memorial wall - a 56-foot bronze wall that honours the 343 firefighters who died on the day of the attacks. In total, 441 first responders were killed, the largest loss of emergency personnel in US history. At the Pentagon outside Washington, a dawn service was held. Two pipers played Amazing Grace as a small group of military leaders looked on in solemnity, the building bathed in blue light. A chapel of remembrance now marks the spot where American Airlines flight 77 crashed into the US defence building.

'Split-second decision saved my life',"Andrew was in the South Tower when the first plane hit and was trying to descend the building when the second plane caused another explosion Twenty years ago, Andrew Cullen felt the explosion of a plane hitting the skyscraper next to him just as much as he heard it. Instinct led him to a series of actions in the following minutes which would turn out to be critical. A split-second decision over which lift button to push turned out to be the biggest decision of his life. Hitting down instead of up just moments before the second plane hit the south tower of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 ensured the Scot would be alive to re-tell his story two decades on. Born in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, Andrew was 10 when his dad got a job in Pittsburgh and moved the family to the US in 1980. At the age of 25, he moved to Manhattan to work as an analyst at investment firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBR). On 11 September, 2001, he arrived at work on the 89th floor of the South Tower. He was part of a team working on a big deal for a bank. It was a beautiful day. Andrew Cullen survived the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Centre, escaping from his office on the 89th floor of the South Tower Reliving the morning onBBC Radio's Drivetime programme, Andrew said: ""It was very clear, there wasn't a cloud in the sky, so from the 89th floor you could see forever, straight over both the Statue of Liberty as well as east over to Queens and Brooklyn. ""Usually at about 06:45, the traders and the analysts and the other sales guys start rolling in and it was really while the salesmen and traders were making their morning phone calls that we felt and heard an enormous explosion from the North Tower. ""We had no idea what it was, but the ferocity of the explosion caused our building to sort of whipsaw and being on the south east side of the building I was able to see some of the debris coming out of the side of the building."" September 11 attacks: What happened on 9/11? 9/11: Images from New York that shocked the world The heroes of the forgotten maritime rescue mission He said: ""I got out of my chair and started walking north along the trading desk, and arrived at the equity desk where Derek Sword, my colleague from Dundee was sitting. I believe he was on the phone with his brother Alan at the time trying to surmise what had happened. ""At that point myself and three colleagues made the decision to get out of the building so we headed towards the stairwell and began descending from the 89th floor down to the Sky Lobby at the 44th floor and it was at that point that the port authority instructed us to go back to our offices, so they sort of shuffled us into one of the freight elevators. ""At that point the button for 78 was lit but we decided we wanted to go down so I was the one who pounded the lobby button just a few moments before the second plane hit the tower above us."" If the lift had gone up, they would have been killed. He said: ""At that point it was chaos. I got expelled from the elevator with some colleagues. I crawled around the corner to the stairwell and maybe 30 seconds later one of my colleagues came down to the 43rd floor and we made the decision we needed to get out of the building as quickly as possible."" A wall of dust and smoke races through streets as one of the World Trade Center towers collapses. Andrew was blown behind a desk in a health club as the store fronts along Wall Street were blown in. Andrew and his colleagues still had no idea what had happened. The only logical explanation they had was that the other tower had collapsed into their tower. Now he understands that during the massive second explosion, the jet fuel came down the lift shaft and blew the lift apart. He said: ""I am not sure how many survivors there were in the elevator but I was told it had dropped at that point. So we were fairly fortunate to be on the front."" After finding a stairwell, they managed to get to the lobby where port authority officers and fire crews were trying to organise people to get them out of the building. They did not want to waste a minute so they found the east side of the building and headed into the courtyard and then over towards the street. ""Once we had seen the effect of the planes flying into the building and witnessed some people jumping out of the building, we headed to a health club we knew to get away from the scene,"" Andrew said.  ""We had only arrived there for about 10 minutes before our tower collapsed and sent the debris down Wall Street where a lot of the store fronts were blown in including the Equinox club where we were. ""We were fairly fortunate that we didn't get hit with shrapnel and other debris that was flying around. We got knocked down to the floor and we were behind a desk when it blew in over the top of us. Once the dust had settled we made our way into one of the bathrooms and grabbed wet towels and wrapped them around our faces to avoid inhaling smoke. ""Again we found the east of the building and made our way over to the East River but it was feeling our way along because it was like walking through a blackout - that's how thick the dust and debris was. When we hit the East River we found about a million other people. After 9/11: Scotland's story 9/11 anniversary: How the world reacted to terror attacks 9/11 attacks: 'I saw the world as a scary place for the first time' Andrew believes it was instinct that got him out of the tower in time. ""When you have a threat that faces you and you don't know what it is, you have a choice,"" he said. ""You either face it or you get the hell out of the situation. ""All I knew was that the explosion I felt from the first tower being hit was extremely powerful, and I didn't need to be a third of a mile up in the air.  I am deathly terrified of heights so that ironically might have saved my life."" Later in the day Andrew helped work the phones with other employees who survived and by the end of the day they had an idea of who got out and who didn't. Scot Derek Sword was one of 67 KBW employees who died Derek, his Dundee friend, was one of the 2,606 who lost their lives in the Twin Towers attack. The pair bonded over their Scottish roots on Andrew's first day in the job. They were introduced by one of KBW's CEOs John Berry who also died. The firm lost 67 employees that day. The surviving staff spent the rest of the week in and out of New York hospitals checking logs to see if any of their colleagues had survived. Andrew, now 51, is a history and economics teacher in South Carolina. He has attended a few memorial services since that day but prefers to keep a low profile. ""You manage it but you don't get over it, "" he said. ""It's a process. It is always there and it might change your life but it shouldn't stop you living it. ""It forced me to think about how I was living my life and change my path a bit, rather than following what I thought was a prescriptive path, doing things I was a bit more interested in, maybe being a bit more impetuous than I would have been.""

From United to Disunited States,"It's almost a cliche, hackneyed even. A big event happens, and people say they will never forget where they were when they heard about this or that. But I suspect nearly everyone around the world above the age of 30 really does remember where they were when they heard about, then watched in real time, the most audacious, most dreadful terrorist attack on the United States unfold. Over the past few days, I have been talking to people not only who remember where they were, but how it upended their lives We spoke to Max Giaconne, who was 10 years old - and four days into his new school - when the teacher told him he needed to go to the principal's office. And there was his mother in tears. Max's father worked in the World Trade Center. Ann Van Hine was driving when she heard on the radio about the attack on the twin towers - and then an order calling all firemen to report for duty. She knew in that moment - with a terrible foreboding - her husband would be rushing into the Twin Towers as everyone else was trying to escape. And then I spoke to Andy. Like Max he was in an elementary school. But not as a pupil. Andy Card was President Bush's chief of staff, and had to interrupt the commander in chief as he read to schoolchildren to tell them that a second plane had hit the Twin Towers. His comments were succinct and brief: ""America is under attack,"" he told the president. Andy Card utters four words in the president's ear I remember the day vividly. As the BBC's Paris correspondent, I was reporting on attempts by Eurotunnel to curb the flow of illegal immigrants across the channel (some issues remain stubbornly familiar). We were driving from Lille to Calais for the evening news when my producer called to say we needed to find a television as something unbelievable was happening in New York. That afternoon my cameraman and I sat and edited our piece for the evening news but were unable to concentrate as we watched live the horrors unfolding across the Atlantic. A motorcycle dispatch rider went to my home in Paris to collect my passport and bring it to Calais. Who knew where we'd end up next. Some things about that day, that period I remember vividly. I remember the powerful sense of clarity it brought to so many people. What happened on 9/11? Five lessons learned (or not) since 9/11 Though the democracy we lived in might be imperfect with some dodgy, scheming politicians around - would we rather be living in societies with freedom of speech, due process, the rule of law, sexual equality, free and fair elections; or do we stand with those who would fly planes into buildings, who would stone homosexuals to death, who would deny women an education? This video can not be played Watch: Four stories of how the world reacted on 9/11 Simplistic maybe, but in a world that is made up of almost imperceptibly different shades of grey, this seemed black and white. But the other evening I watched the stunning BBC documentary 9/11: Inside The President's War Room which, incidentally, features that man Andy Card. And somehow 20 years on I had forgotten the chaos, the sheer panic, the disbelief that engulfed the US and its leadership. The rulers of the richest country in the world with the most feared military machine were cowering in bunkers, unclear what might happen next, uncertain what to do, fearful there might be a second wave of attacks. Though that is only part of the story. Alongside that there was a steely resolve; a unity of purpose. Twenty years ago Americans stood together; and most of the rest of the world stood with America. It was vividly exemplified by the Queen breaking with protocol (not something done lightly by the royal family), and ordering the Coldstream Guards to play the Star Spangled Banner during the Changing the Guard ceremony. This video can not be played Watch: The heroes of 9/11's forgotten maritime rescue mission There was iron resolve - the events of 9/11 would be avenged. Army recruitment offices would see long queues form outside their doors. Democrats and Republicans put aside their petty partisan bickering to focus on the big picture. And when George Bush stood on the rubble of the Twin Towers with a policeman's bullhorn in hand and said he had heard the American people, and the perpetrators of this crime would soon be hearing from America, he spoke for the nation. Within weeks a massive multinational force was assembled, with America spearheading, to force the Taliban - who'd allowed the al-Qaeda leaders who plotted the 9/11 attacks to set up terrorism finishing schools in the country - out of power. It was relatively straightforward militarily. I was despatched from Paris to move with a front line in Northern Afghanistan. I watched just outside Kunduz as B52 bombers flew daily sorties to dislodge the Taliban from their last remaining stronghold in the North. Ousting the Taliban was considered a global priority 20 years ago, writes the author (right) This would be the start of a series of American entanglements. And one thing they all seemed to share is a lack of long term success. The ""liberal interventionism"" championed by both President Bush and Tony Blair saw the Taliban booted out of Afghanistan, and Saddam Hussain ousted in Iraq - but what followed became known as the ""forever wars"". Messy entanglements where victory - if that is measured by a smooth functioning democracy - always bloodily out of reach. What has changed in Afghanistan in 20 years A new order begins under Taliban rule When President Obama came into power there was a different approach. In Libya the Americans would support the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, but at arm's length; with the Syrian civil war, America huffed and puffed but chose to sit that one out. In Egypt, the US supported the overthrow of President Mubarak - but when the Egyptians elected the Muslim Brotherhood to power, the Americans made clear their displeasure, and the generals moved back in. Every year, New York remembers In other words the Americans had tried invasion - it went badly. They'd tried ""intervention-lite"" - still no good. Staying outside a conflict brought criticism, and supporting the spread of democracy only worked if voters went for US friendly governments. It's a pretty unhappy tale of foreign intervention. The reasons for Donald Trump's victory in 2016 - with his proclamation of America First - are various. But one of them was certainly the growing weariness of the American people to the cost of these military entanglements. And this is the backdrop to the commemorations taking place in New York this weekend. Twenty years ago, Americans in the face of tragedy were united. Today, with relative peace and considerable prosperity they are bitterly divided. ...but for some it's too much to bear So to 2021. How incredible that to mark the 20th anniversary of 9/11 the Taliban have been forming their new government. The pre-eminent superpower seems to be suffering a crisis of confidence; and in the manner of its departure from Afghanistan ordered by Joe Biden - the Kabul debacle - a crisis of competence. How '9/11 mastermind' slipped through FBI's fingers I met Ann Van Hine in Battery Park, on the southern tip of Manhattan. She's appalled how much America has turned inwards and how Americans have turned against each other. She believes the unity shown 20 years ago is possible again today. As we sit talking, I realise that we are looking out to New York Harbour, towards the Statue of Liberty, with the stirring poem New Colossus on the plinth. ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"" Lady Liberty symbolises America opening its arms to the world. The opening of that golden door. But 20 years on the US feels a much sadder, more introspective place. PM to press Biden to delay Kabul withdrawal Biden's speech fact-checked 'Was my role in Afghan War worth it?'

Biden calls for unity as US marks 9/11,"The Tribute in Light installation in New York, ahead of the 9/11 commemorations US President Joe Biden has urged unity as his country remembers the victims of the 2001 11 September attacks. In a video released on the eve of the 20th anniversary, he paid tribute to the 2,977 people who lost their lives. ""We honour all those who risked and gave their lives in the minutes, hours, months and years afterwards,"" Mr Biden added, speaking of the emergency workers who responded to the attacks. Commemoration events are due to take place on Saturday. Joe Biden will begin with a ceremony at 08:30 (12:30 GMT) in New York at the site where the World Trade Center's Twin Towers once stood. He is not expected to deliver any speeches, but in his address on Friday, he said: ""No matter how much time has passed, these commemorations bring everything painfully back as if you just got the news a few seconds ago."" He acknowledged the ""darker forces of human nature - fear and anger, resentment and violence against Muslim Americans"" which followed the attacks, but said that unity had remained the US' ""greatest strength"". ""We learned that unity is the one thing that must never break,"" he added. Queen Elizabeth has sent a message to Mr Bidensaying her visit to the World Trade Center in 2010 was ""held fast in my memory"". ""My thoughts and prayers, and those of my family and the entire nation, remain with the victims, survivors and families affected, as well as the first responders and rescue workers called to duty,"" the Queen said.

Levelling up at risk of failure - ex-No 10 adviser,"Towns like Workington in Cumbria hope to benefit from the government's levelling up policy The architect of Boris Johnson's initiative to revive so-called left-behind areas has warned that the ""levelling up"" scheme is at risk of failure. Will Tanner, a former Tory No 10 adviser who was amongst the first to identify the ""red wall"" seats, calls on the government to abandon its ""top-down"" approach to the scheme. In a new report for his Onward think tank, Mr Tanner also says the government should learn from the success of the last Labour government's New Deal for Communities which helped cut poverty in such communities. Mr Tanner says: ""The Treasury will not level up left behind places using the same top-down policies that left places behind in the first place. ""If ministers are serious about levelling up in the long term, they need to build local capacity that can endure - and help local people take back control of their communities."" What is levelling up and how is it going? The town debating how to 'level up' Mr Tanner, a former adviser to Theresa May, has become an influential voice in Conservative circles after his Onward think tank identified the red wall seats in the run up to the last election. They were the once rock-solid Labour seats which fell into Conservative hands at the 2019 general election. In a report shortly before the election, Mr Tanner described ""Workington Man"" - from the West Cumbrian constituency - as the sort of lifelong Labour voter who would switch to the Conservatives. This voter was pro-Brexit, sceptical of globalisation and wanted a government that would protect cherished local institutions such as pubs and post offices from closing. In an interview with Newsnight ahead of the publication of his new report, Mr Tanner says: ""Absolutely we came up with the Workington Man concept at the last election. We identified that as the archetypal voter that swung towards the Conservative party and delivered all those seats in the north of England - like Workington, like Walsall, like Warrington - those seats that the Conservative party had often never held before. ""It is precisely those seats that would benefit from a more localised approach, a bottom-up approach where communities take control of local assets like libraries and sports clubs and community hubs. Using them as the lynchpin for regeneration is likely to be successful in regenerating those local areas."" Newsnight visited Workington to gauge opinion about the government's ""levelling up"" agenda. Some shoppers thought the government was too focused on larger metropolitan areas. But Mike Johnson, the Conservative leader of the local Allerdale Borough Council, did not recognise the criticisms in the report. Mr Johnson told Newsnight: ""We've certainly not encountered [too much central control] because a lot of the schemes we have put forward that have been successful bids have been community driven. ""For example we are looking at developing a sports village. That will involve a stadium for the local rugby team and the football team. That is driven by those two clubs. So it is sort of from grassroots up as opposed to it being imposed on them."" In his new report, Mr Tanner does praise the government for setting aside Â£1.4bn for the ""levelling up fund"". But he calls on ministers to learn from Labour's Â£2.29bn New Deal Communities scheme which ran from 1998 to 2011. Of the 39 areas covered by the programme, 77% saw levels of deprivation fall relative to the national average between 2004 to 2019. Dame Margaret Hodge, the former Labour minister, says the findings show it is wrong to say her party had neglected this area. She told Newsnight: ""Somehow this government thinks it invented a concern for and investment in communities that have gone through difficult times and may have high levels of deprivation. There have been policies to tackle this since I have been in politics."" Dame Margaret said that Labour had itself to blame for the belief among those in red wall seats that the party did not help those areas. Asked how Labour had lost the red wall seats even after investing in them she said: ""That goes back to what happened with Labour after 2010 when we disowned all the successes we had achieved during 13 years in government."" Onward has examined government regeneration schemes over the last 60 years in the report: ""Turnaround: How to regenerate Britain's less prosperous communities by helping them take back control"".

"Fraud warnings not working for young, says charity","Rudy, 18, is worried about being able to pay his rent after his money was stolen ""This money was the most important money I could have had,"" says Rudy D'Souza. ""I'd just moved out and got a new job. But my pay is due after my rent, so I felt really tense and like an idiot for falling for this scam."" The 18-year-old is talking about how Â£700 left over from his government-backedChild Trust Fundwas stolen last week. He was going to use it to help set up his new life until fraudsters scammed him in an act of so-calledpush payment fraud,external. In this type of scam, victims are tricked into transferring money to a fraudster in the belief they are calling from the victim's bank or the police. Last year alone, Â£479m was stolen from 150,000 victims in this way - an increase of 22% on the previous year. The criminals who targeted Rudy managed to convince him they were calling from his bank by quoting his sort code, account number and card details back to him over the phone. ""I never even heard of push payment fraud until I became a victim,"" Rudy told the BBC, ""I was aware my real bank would never ask for my password or OTP [one-time passcode] or give them permission to use my laptop by remote access, but they didn't ask me to do any of that - that's why I thought they were my bank. ""Now it turns out it's happened to a lot of people I know, but it's never really talked about because of all the shame around it."" As for the main awareness campaign run by UK Finance on behalf of the banks and building societies,Take Five To Stop Fraud,external, Rudy said he'd never heard of it. ""I've never seen anything on my Instagram feed about it, never seen it on TV,"" he says. ""It kind of felt it came out of the blue."" Anti-fraud charity the Fraud Advisory Panel is warning banks are not doing enough to raise awareness about the dangers of fraud to young adults. That is something that's especially important for 18 and 19-year-olds who are getting access to government-backed Child Trust Funds. About 55,000 people turn 18 each month, so that since the funds began to mature in September 2020, some 700,000 people have suddenly been able to access hundreds or even thousands of pounds. That can mean rich pickings for fraudsters. Arun Chauhan says banks can't use a ""one-size fits all"" approach with fraud awareness campaigns ""Key is that young adults do not understand the ease of impersonation and email interception which often leads to APP fraud,"" says Arun Chouhan, a solicitor and trustee at the Fraud Advisory Panel. ""There is no consistent approach to education of this demographic. Many do not realise the personal implications or risks of sharing data on social media,"" he adds. He says banks should be doing more on social media channels that will reach this age group, such as TikTok or YouTube. ""A fraud awareness campaign that aims to warn 25 to 30-year-olds may not work in the same way for 18 to 19-year-olds. You have to very specifically target different demographics, so you can't have generic, one-size-fits-all fraud awareness messaging."" UK Finance, which runs the Take Five To Stop Fraud campaign on behalf of banks, told Money Box; ""The banking sector is continuously looking at the best ways of ensuring customers are made aware of the risks of fraud, including advertising across a range of social media platforms."" It does have accounts on Twitter and on Facebook, but only 211 followers on Instagram and no presence on Snapchat or TikTok, although it says it is in discussions about putting content up on this platform. ""In the coming year, we plan to have advertising warnings up across a greater range of platforms to enable us to reach a wider audience, including more young people."" Since Rudy had his money stolen, he has been one of the lucky victims of push payment fraud who has had the money refunded by the bank.

What has changed in Afghanistan in 20 years,"Will current Manouchehri pupils be able to become doctors and engineers like their predecessors? Waving their hands excitedly in the air, a class of six- and seven-year-old girls eagerly try to get their teacher's attention, each one desperate to be chosen to answer a question about Persian grammar. The Manouchehri primary school in Kabul was among the first to re-open for girls following the US invasion in 2001 and the defeat of the Taliban. Back then, there was just a single room, with pupils sat on a mud floor. Under Taliban rule, beginning in Kabul in 1996, girls weren't allowed to get an education, and female teachers were ordered to stay at home. Aisha Misbah was one of them. Now she's headteacher and proudly shows off newly built classrooms. Many of those she taught have gone on to become doctors, engineers or even teachers at the school, she says. ""This is our biggest achievement. Our students are so bright. They're so creative and make such beautiful things that even we get shocked. I hope the Taliban will allow it all to continue."" Who's who in the Taliban leadership A new order begins under Taliban rule The frenzied final hours of the Afghan government Since taking over Afghanistan for a second time, the Taliban have permitted girls to go to school. For now, however, only primary school pupils of both genders are attending classes, whilst teachers await the publication of new rules governing secondary schools. In some more rural areas, there have long been reports of Taliban commanders only permitting girls to go to school until they reach the age of puberty. The most recent figures from the World Bank show that about 40% of Afghan girls attend primary school, far more than during the Taliban's previous stint in power but far fewer than in other countries in the region. It's a similar picture in healthcare, where infant and maternal mortality rates have improved but remain shockingly high. The Taliban insist women will be allowed to work, but some remain sceptical, especially after Taliban officials recently said most women, other than those working in healthcare or education, should stay at home until security improves. The same excuse was given throughout the 1990s to completely prevent women working. About half of all Manouchehri students have to study in large tents erected in the playground But the pupils at Manouchehri face other challenges, too. In the playground, three large tents have been erected, with desks and blackboards. The school is so overcrowded that about half of the pupils have to study outside. Pleas to the previous government fell on deaf ears, and when non-government organisations offered to help, they were told to give the money to the education ministry first. Rampant corruption has plagued Afghanistan over the past two decades, and it meant that the billions of dollars of international support didn't always make it to those in need. The education system has helped mould, however, a generation of young Afghan women and men who are vocal in standing up for their views, including challenging the Taliban. ""We are not afraid of death,"" said female protesters in Kabul earlier this week ""We are not those men and women of 20 years ago,"" one female protester at a demonstration in Kabul tells me, ""who were whipped into submission."" Another, her voice pulsing with emotion says: ""We are not afraid of death. We are the young generation who will bring forth the buds of peace."" The new government announced by the Taliban consists entirely of members of the group, all of whom are men. Many had served in senior positions during the Taliban's reign during the 1990s, a period marked by a brutal interpretation of sharia law. For many others in more rural areas, where attitudes are more socially conservative, the greater social freedoms some have grown up with in bigger cities since 2001 feel irrelevant when compared with the suffering of living along the frontline. Beauticians salons all over Kabul have been painted over amid fears of the Taliban reprisals Few Afghans have been unaffected by the war, irrespective of their background, but in villages caught along bloody frontlines, many have welcomed the arrival of the Taliban - for at least bringing an end to the violence. If the price of peace is greater cultural authoritarianism, some are more willing to pay it than others. At a snooker club in Kabul, less than a week after the city was taken over by the Taliban, I meet a group of young men from the city's middle class. A mix of students and business owners, speaking on condition of anonymity, they're scathing about the Taliban. One says they look like ""zombies"", worrying they will soon start dictating whether or not men can shave their beards or how they can style their hair, whilst others question how they can trust a group responsible for so many suicide bombings and attacks. But they're also all damning about Afghanistan's political class. Ashraf Ghani, the former president who fled abroad, ""should be arrested"", they proclaim. ""He sold out the future of all young people,"" says one of the group, accusing him of having escaped with millions of dollars - the allegation Mr Ghani denies. They're equally dismissive of those politicians who have stayed in the country but who over the years have often taken part in deeply disruptive political spats. ""They weren't trying to solve the problems of ordinary people, but just trying to fill their own pockets and share the wealth with their own relatives."" The last two presidential elections in Afghanistan ended in standoffs, with widespread allegations of voter fraud. Nevertheless, however flawed the previous democratic system was, the young men at the snooker club deeply rue its passing. ""We've worked hard and are educated. We could've lifted the country up but now we can't do anything to serve it."" Of all the ""gains"" made over the past two decades, the creation of an independent local media is one the principal success stories. News organisations were amongst the freest in the region, despite being violently targeted by militants. Journalists did at times face threats from the government. For example, former Vice-President Amrullah Saleh, now a leading figure in the National Resistance Front, once ordered the arrest of those responsible for ""fake news"" about civilian deaths as a result of a 2020 government air strike in Takhar province, in which it's believed 12 children were killed. Injured journalists Taqi Daryabi, left, and Nematullah Naqdi However, recent days have raised fears the Taliban will not tolerate coverage they perceive as negative. Whilst the group initially claimed they would allow a free press as long as journalists don't breach ""Islamic values"" or the ""national interest"", reporters covering recent, peaceful protests against the group have at times been detained and badly beaten. Earlier this week, 22 year-old Taqi Daryabi and a colleague were taken away by the Taliban from a demonstration they had been covering to a police station. ""There were around seven to 10 men in one room, they all started kicking me, and beating me with sticks and rubber pipes,"" Taqi told the BBC, his back and face still covered in bruises. Afghan journalists tell of beatings by Taliban ""One Talib told me, 'be grateful I didn't cut your head off,'"" Taqi says. ""Now that the Taliban are here, no-one can feel safe. In the past we have seen them kill, kidnap and beat journalistsâ¦ they should allow us to work freely."" Taliban fighters are now the new masters at Kabul's Bush Bazaar The legacy of American and international intervention in Afghanistan will be deeply contested. Signs of the US influence are already fading first. At ""Bush Bazaar"", named after the former American president and famous for selling military gear smuggled out of international bases, most of the flak jackets or rifle scopes on sale are now Chinese replicas. Whereas army soldiers or private security guards hired by politically powerful Afghans were once the main customers, now Taliban fighters stroll past the shops. One, Fatih, from the eastern province of Khost, is looking for a new set of boots. He's disappointed, he hoped to buy some that had been made in America, but ""everything is Chinese"".
