Strasbourg Jewish memorial vandalised,"The stone was found knocked off its plinth on Saturday morning A memorial stone at the site of Strasbourg's old synagogue has been vandalised, the deputy mayor of the eastern French city says. Alain Fontanel tweeted a picture of the marble slab,externalafter it was knocked off its plinth, calling the attack a ""new act of anti-Semitism in our city"". The memorial stands at the site of the synagogue, which was burned down by the Nazis in September 1940. Last month dozens of graves were desecrated at a nearby Jewish cemetery. Swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans were spray-painted on the graves. President Emmanuel Macron visited the cemetery in Quatzenheim, about 20km (12 miles) west of Strasbourg.

France has the biggest Jewish community in Europe, about 550,000 people. Statistics published last month showed a rise of 74% in the number of anti-Semitic attacks in France, from 311 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. Several high-profile recent incidents have brought the issue into focus. In one instance, a Jewish bakery in central Paris had the German word for Jews (""Juden"") spray-painted on its window.

Anti-Semitism beneath the yellow vests? France warns of steep rise in anti-Semitism Jewish groups have also been warning that a rising far right across Europe has been promoting anti-Semitism and hatred of other minorities. Crime data from Germany released last week revealed thatanti-Semitic offences had increased by 10% over the past year- including a 60% rise in physical attacks.

US police not charged for killing black man,"Stephon Clark had two children under the age of three Two US police officers will not face charges for shooting dead Stephon Clark, an unarmed black man, in California last March, prosecutors say. The shooting victim, aged 22, was shot at least seven times in his grandmother's backyard in Sacramento. According to the district attorney, the officers, who were investigating nearby break-ins, did not commit a crime. The death sparked protests and fuelled national anger over police use of force, particularly against black men. ""There is no question a human being died,"" District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert told reporters after making an apology to the Clark family. Police shot unarmed man '7 times in back' US police shooting protest shuts arena Are US police too quick to shoot? She said that a months-long investigation into the 18 March 2018 shooting had looked into whether a crime was committed. ""The answer to that question is no and, as a result, there was no criminal liability."" This video can not be played Police say they thought Stephon Clark had a gun - he was holding a phone The use of force was justified, Ms Schubert said, as the officers had feared for their lives, believing Mr Clark was armed with a gun and had allegedly moved towards the officers. Police body camera and helicopterfootage later revealed the officers fired 20 times at Mr Clark, who was then found with only an iPhone, andthey waited five minutes before giving him aid. The officers, who were put on leave last year, have not been named by authorities over fears for their safety. Sacramento's police chief Daniel Hahn announced that the department would conduct its own investigation and, depending on the findings, the officers could be fired. This video can not be played ""Stop, please, my brother just got shot"" District Attorney Schubert also revealed the mother of Mr Clark's children had filed a domestic violence complaint against him two days prior to his death, and that the 22-year-old had researched suicide websites. Drugs were found in his system after his death, she said, and these in addition to his ""state of despair"" could have ""affected his judgement"". But Mr Clark's family and activists criticised Ms Schubert for bringing up these details. ""Those officers didn't know any of that when they had him in the backyard and they killed him,"" Black Lives Matter leader Tanya Faison said. Ms Schubert repeatedly apologised for raising the information during her presentation.

Sala pilot 'dropped out of training'David Ibbotson was training for a commercial pilot's licence but dropped out before he finished.Wales,"Emiliano Sala was a record signing for Premier League side Cardiff City The pilot of the crashed plane carrying footballer Emiliano Sala dropped out of training for his commercial pilot's licence before it was completed. David Ibbotson, who has still not been found, was not licensed to carry paying passengers, which has fuelled speculation the flight was illegal. Cardiff City striker Sala's body was found in the wreckage just off Guernsey on 4 February. Mr Ibbotson's pilots licence and logbook were lost in the crash. Aninterim report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch(AAIB) on Monday said Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, held a private licence in the UK and the US, meaning he could not carry paying passengers within the EU, other than on a cost-sharing basis and not for reward. This video can not be played ""You wished you never went and watched the guy play,"" agent Mark McKay tells BBC sports editor Dan Roan The report added further investigation is needed to discover his background and experience as a pilot. The light aircraft disappeared on 21 January and Sala had completed his transfer to Premier League side Cardiff from French club Nantes just two days earlier - for a club record fee of Â£15m. He had returned to France to say goodbye to his former teammates. Sala pilot search finds 'no trace' Fifa investigates Sala transfer payment Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson In their interim report, the AAIB stated that, on the basis of a cost-sharing flight, ""it must not be made for the purpose of merely transporting the passenger"". For it to be classed as cost-sharing, pilot David Ibbotson would have had to have been making the journey regardless, dictating to Sala when the plane was leaving and sharing the cost of the flight equally with him. Agent Willie McKay, who commissioned the flight for Sala,said the flight from Nantes to Cardiffwas not a cost-sharing arrangement. He said ""Emi wasn't paying anything"" and that he was going to pay ""whatever Dave [Henderson] was going to charge"". Mr McKay said David Henderson was the pilot he used most frequently to arrange his flights. It is thought Mr Henderson was not available for the Sala flight, so he asked Mr Ibbotson to do the job. Payment would usually be made after a flight due to the varying amounts paid for landing fees at different airports. This video can not be played Cardiff could have done more - Willie McKay ""He said he couldn't do it himself but he was going to get someone. I trusted David, I had no reason not to,"" said Mr McKay. ""When you phone for a taxi you don't ask him if he has a driving licence. I was just thinking about getting the boy home which he wanted and we were happy with what we did. ""I've been told on good authority he was a very good pilot so for people to vilify the pilot after a man's death is a disgrace. I don't hold anyone responsible because it's just a tragic accident."" Sala funeral takes place in Argentina Emiliano Sala - born in Argentina, made in France Mr McKay's son Mark, agent to Nantes FC, who was also involved in organising and paying for flights for Mr Sala, said: ""I don't see how I would have done anything any differently. I've taken many flights - small aircraft, different types of aircraft, different pilots. ""I look at the situation that came about and if it was me, I'd have taken that flight and I think a lot of people would have taken that flight and not asked anything."" Mr Henderson has not responded to several approaches from the BBC for comment. Mr Ibbotson studied for a commercial pilot's licence (CPL) qualification from December 2012 until July 2014 through Cranfield Aviation Training School near Milton Keynes, but dropped out of the course without qualifying after failing to complete his theoretical training. The plane carrying Sala disappeared on 21 January Dr Stuart E Smith, head of training for the school, said: ""It is common for middle-aged private pilots to undertake the CPL theoretical knowledge course so that they may then complete CPL flight training and be able to earn money as a pilot or flight instructor."" He said Mr Ibbotson got in touch in 2016 with the intention of resuming his training, but never followed it further. He added that he had sent a report to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) soon after the tragedy. Investigations will continue to analyse air traffic communications and radar for clues, while other lines of enquiry will investigate how gas boiler engineer and part-time DJ Mr Ibbotson came to be flying a Â£15m footballer back to his new club. The Piper Malibu was registered in the US, whose rules stipulate the use of aircraft commercially outside of the country must be approved by the CAA and Federal Aviation Administration. No permission was sought or granted by the owners of the plane before Sala's flight. The AAIB released this photograph of the wreckage of the Piper Malibu Martin Robinson, chief executive of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said it was concerned about the use of so-called grey charters, which are unlicensed flights and the use of foreign-registered planes for air taxi work, since the incident. ""UK air charter companies pay a lot of money to the government for air operator certificates, without which they can't run commercial air taxi operations,"" said Mr Robinson. ""They know they're being undercut by competitors who in some cases are not fully compliant with the law. ""It's the responsibility of the person who organised the flight to have a suitably qualified pilot at the controls and to ensure the pilot had sufficient flying experience for this kind of flight and for the weather conditions that may be encountered. ""Mr Sala would have had no knowledge of David Ibbotson's licence but the person organising it should have known about that. ""They've let this man down."" The search for Mr Ibbotson's body resumed last week, but no trace was found.

"Sanders launches 2020 presidential bidBernie Sanders attacks the ""dangerous"" President Trump as he kicks off his run for the presidency.US & Canada","This video can not be played Mr Sanders got personal as he rounded on President Trump US Senator Bernie Sanders has launched his bid to be president in 2020 with an attack on corporate greed and a promise to unleash a ""political revolution"". Speaking in Brooklyn, New York, he called Donald Trump the ""most dangerous president"" in recent US history. Mr Sanders, a 77-year-old independent senator for Vermont, lost the 2016 Democrat race to Hillary Clinton. He faces a much more crowded field this time but brings name recognition and a passionate support base. More than 10 others are also running to be Democrat candidate, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker and the Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julian Castro. His speech promised a presidency that would ""bring people together"". He outlined numerous policies and attacked greed and the ""billionaire class"". As president, he said he would: Enact a ""federal jobs guarantee"" to ensure all Americans have work More than double the minimum wage from $7.25 (Â£5.50) to $15 Pass ""comprehensive"" immigration reform, including allowing hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants to stay in the US Make universities and colleges tuition-free Reform healthcare to give universal coverage He promised to fight for ""economic justice, social justice, racial justice and environmental justice"".

One of the challenges Mr Sanders faces is that the Democratic Party has shifted to the left, making his message less distinctive, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Sanders's brother Larry said the Vermont senator was right to try again for the presidency. ""I think Bernard's presidency would be really uplifting, finally to have somebody who people see as honest and has been committed for such a long time to be saying that we don't need the poverty, we can have all the things that we need,"" he said. ""It's all been a kind of crazy dogma that 'oh no, no, no, you can't afford that'."" Mr Sanders was born in Brooklyn, and the backdrop for his speech gave him an opportunity to contrast himself with the president. He grew up as the son of a Jewish immigrant who worked as a paint seller, while Mr Trump, who also was born in New York, was the son of a wealthy real estate developer. ""I did not have a father who gave me millions of dollars to build luxury skyscrapers, casinos and country clubs,"" he said. ""But I had something more valuable: I had the role model of a father who had unbelievable courage in journeying across an ocean, with no money in his pocket, to start a new and better life."" As he was speaking Mr Trump was addressing a conference of conservative activists, in which he attacked the Democrats and promised he would win re-election. Trump launches furious attack on Mueller He sarcastically mocked Democrat proposals on the environment and said plans for universal healthcare would lead to a ""socialist takeover of American healthcare"". He is the longest-serving independent in congressional history, but competes for the Democratic nomination as he says standing as a third-party candidate would diminish his chances of winning the presidency. He attended the University of Chicago, and in the 1960s and 1970s participated in anti-war and civil rights activism, like the 1963 March on Washington. Should Bernie Sanders' fundraising worry rivals? 17 things that Bernie Sanders believes In 1990, he became the first independent in 40 years to be elected to the House of Representatives. He served there until he ran for and won a seat in the Senate in 2007. Mr Sanders entered the race for the 2016 Democratic nomination as a marginal candidate but emerged as a surprise star during a series of televised debates. He labels himself a Democratic socialist, which he has defined as someone who seeks to ""create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy"". He became Mrs Clinton's closest rival, but she ultimately won the nomination before losing the presidential election to Mr Trump. Bernie Sanders has joined the race to stop Donald Trump from being re-elected. But who else has a shot at becoming the next president? Find out who is already running and who might join them.

More delays in search for missing climber,"Tom Ballard's sponsor Montane said they were not giving up hope The search for a British climber who went missing on a peak in Pakistan has suffered another setback due to bad weather. Tom Ballard and Italian climber Daniele Nardi last made contact on Sunday from an altitude of about 20,500ft (6,250m) on Nanga Parbat. Snow, cloud and poor visibility has meant a helicopter team and high altitude drones cannot fly as planned. Rescue attempts started late due to tensions between Pakistan and India. Mr Ballard, originally from Derbyshire, is the son of Alison Hargreaves, who died descending from the summit of K2 in 1995 -  the same year she becamethe first woman to conquer Everest unaided,external. On Friday, three drones were due to be flown by Spanish mountaineer Alex Txikon, in an area known as the Mummery Spur, named after Albert Mummery, who died on the mountain in 1895. Tom Ballard's mother Alison Hargreaves on her descent from the top of Mount Everest, which she reached in 1995 The search was postponed until Saturday with Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador in Pakistan, saying he hoped for a ""miracle"" to find ""tough guys"" Mr Ballard and Mr Nardi. Pilots had been on standby since 05:30 local time,according to Mr Nardi's Facebook page,external, but rescuers have been left frustrated.

Police suspicion over Scot's 'drowning',"Kim Gordon's disappearance prompted a three-day search by police divers at Monastery beach Police in the US are searching for a Scottish man who went missing during a visit to a beach in California. Kim Gordon, from Inverness, was reported missing on Monday after reportedly going for a swim at Monastery Beach in Carmel. However, the Monterey County Sheriff's Department said police divers had failed to find any sign of Mr Gordon after a three-day search. US officers are now exploring the possibility that he may still be alive. Monastery Beach is known for its fast currents and unpredictable waves Monastery Beach is a well-known beauty spot, but is also known for its strong currents and unpredictable waves. The sheriff's department said they had received a 911 call on Monday to say Mr Gordon had gone into the water and had not been seen since. A spokesman said Mr Gordon was still being considered as a missing person, but his disappearance was now considered to be ""under suspicious circumstances"". He added that the search for Mr Gordon was continuing, but officers were exploring the possibility that he may have tried to fake his own death.

Labour figures clash over anti-Semitism,"Tom Watson was accused of undermining party processes by Jennie Formby Two of Labour's most senior figures have clashed over how to handle anti-Semitism within the party. General secretary Jennie Formby accused deputy leader Tom Watson of ""completely unacceptable"" behaviour for asking that complaints about anti-Semitism be forwarded to him for monitoring. She said his approach would ""undermine"" and ""pollute"" existing party processes. Mr Watson stood by his request, saying ""opacity and delay"" by the party had led to ""a complete loss of trust"". The Labour Party has been dealing with complaints of anti-Semitism over the last two years. Mr Watson's original intervention came after nine MPsquit the Labour Party last monthciting the party's failure to tackle anti-Semitism as one of the reasons. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Watson: Labour's anti-Semitism 'shame' Mr Watson emailed all Labour MPs and peers telling them he would be ""logging and monitoring"" complaints of anti-Semitic abuse and bullying. Ms Formby then wrote to him, copying in all Labour parliamentarians. She told him: ""It is absolutely inappropriate for you to set up a vague parallel complaints monitoring system."" Ms Formby said that he and the party had ""very strict responsibilities"" to safeguard members' data under GPDR and data protection laws and asked for complaints not to be sent to Mr Watson ""or any unauthorised individual"". She added: ""Furthermore, you will undermine the work that my staff and I are doing and will confuse and pollute the existing formal process, compromising it and slowing it down."" Mr Watson responded: ""The constant concern of those complaining about anti-Semitism in our party is that there is no transparency about the process. ""Too often those who have suffered anti-Semitic abuse have not heard anything about the outcome of their complaint. ""It is my responsibility as deputy leader of the Labour Party to ensure people have confidence in our complaints system and our ability to deal transparently with the scourge of anti-Semitism. ""I will continue to do everything I can to achieve that."" Catherine McKinnell, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I, for one, have hugely welcomed Tom's intervention in this."" She said the current complaints system had a ""huge amount of trust to rebuild"", and that too many complaints ""just seem to disappear"". ""Nobody knows what the outcome of the complaint has been, nobody knows what the process has been,"" Ms McKinnell said, adding: ""The figures don't match up. So I think there does need to be some oversight."" It comes as members in Diane Abbott's Hackney North constituencyissued a motion against MPswho ""slander the party"" by claiming it is ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". Labour's Stella Creasy, who represents the neighbouring London constituency of Walthamstow, said the motion was ""disgraceful"" and called on Ms Formby to investigate the local party. She tweeted: ""What on earth is going on... that such a motion can be put forward?"" Sheffield Hallam members backed a similar motion and called for the reinstatement of MP Chris Williamson,who was suspended by the party last weekfor saying Labour had ""given too much ground"" in the face of criticism over anti-Semitism. Brent councillor Neil Nerva, a member of the Jewish Labour Movement, said colleagues at the meeting in Hackney North had said shadow home secretary Ms Abbott was present. He said Jewish members were ""distressed"" that the MP did not comment on the motion being voted on, adding: ""Now to me, that is becoming a bystander. I don't know whether Diane felt intimidated about standing up and saying what was being done."" Ms Abbott has not responded to questions about the meeting.

Johnny Depp sues ex-wife over article,"The couple met when both starred in the film The Rum Diary in 2010 The actor Johnny Depp has launched legal action against his ex-wife Amber Heard, accusing her of defamation. In December,Ms Heard, also an actor, wrote an article for the Washington Post,externaldescribing the backlash she faced due to speaking out about domestic violence. Mr Depp's lawsuit says he ""never abused Ms Heard"" and the claims are ""part of an elaborate hoax"" to advance his ex-wife's career. He is seeking $50m (Â£38m) in damages. Ms Heard first accused Mr Depp of domestic violence in May 2016, the year after they were married.Mr Depp was ordered to stay away from herandthe couple divorced in 2017. Photo evidence from 2016 of the injuries Amber Heard claimed were caused by Johnny Depp's domestic violence In her piece for The Washington Post, Ms Heard does not name Mr Depp but describes her experience of speaking out against domestic violence, stating she ""faced our culture's wrath"". She said she had lost a role in a film, was dropped by a major fashion brand and witnessed ""how institutions protect men accused of abuse"". Mr Depp's defamation claim says the article worked on the ""central premise that Ms Heard was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her"" and states that she was in fact the perpetrator. The lawsuit claims her allegations lost him his lucrative role as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean. The couple faced an Australian court for failing to declare their two dogs when entering the country in 2015 Ms Heard's attorney Eric George told People magazine thatMr Depp's legal action is an attempt to silence his ex-wife,externalbut ""she will not be silenced"". He said Mr Depp's actions ""prove he is unable to accept the truth of his ongoing abusive behaviour"", but that Ms Heard's legal team would ""prevail in defeating this groundless lawsuit"". In response, Mr Depp's attorney Adam Waldman told the magazine ""we hardly intend to silence Ms Heard"" but ""look forward to holding the overwhelming video, photographic and eyewitness evidence we finally possess up against Amber Heard's (so far silent) attempts to explain the inexplicable"".

Two men arrested at Texas execution,"Billie Wayne Coble murdered three members of estranged wife's family in 1989 Two men have been released on bail after allegedly throwing punches and swearing during an execution in Texas. Billie Wayne Coble, 70, was put to death by lethal injection nearly 30 years after murdering his wife's parents and brother. His son and grandson, Gordon Wayne and Dalton, allegedly became violent witnessing his death and were arrested after swearing and lashing out. The pair were later released on bail of  $1,000 (Â£755). Gordon Wayne Coble's wife also allegedly caused a disturbance but was not charged. Billie Wayne Coble is the oldest inmate executed in Texas since the state resumed capital punishment in 1982. How many countries still have the death penalty? How US death penalty capital changed its mind The Vietnam War veteran was convicted in 1989 of killing Robert and Zelda Vicha and their son Bobby. Coble had previously kidnapped his then-wife, Karen Vicha, apparently distraught over their pending divorce. He was released on bail before killing her family members nine days later. At his execution, his son and grandson allegedly began swearing and kicking other people in the witness room, with Gordon Wayne allegedly pounding on the window of the chamber. Officers intervened and took them outside where they were charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. Coble was once described by a prosecutor as having ""a heart full of scorpions"".

Sala pilot 'dropped out of training',"Emiliano Sala was a record signing for Premier League side Cardiff City The pilot of the crashed plane carrying footballer Emiliano Sala dropped out of training for his commercial pilot's licence before it was completed. David Ibbotson, who has still not been found, was not licensed to carry paying passengers, which has fuelled speculation the flight was illegal. Cardiff City striker Sala's body was found in the wreckage just off Guernsey on 4 February. Mr Ibbotson's pilots licence and logbook were lost in the crash. Aninterim report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch(AAIB) on Monday said Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, held a private licence in the UK and the US, meaning he could not carry paying passengers within the EU, other than on a cost-sharing basis and not for reward. This video can not be played ""You wished you never went and watched the guy play,"" agent Mark McKay tells BBC sports editor Dan Roan The report added further investigation is needed to discover his background and experience as a pilot. The light aircraft disappeared on 21 January and Sala had completed his transfer to Premier League side Cardiff from French club Nantes just two days earlier - for a club record fee of Â£15m. He had returned to France to say goodbye to his former teammates. Sala pilot search finds 'no trace' Fifa investigates Sala transfer payment Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson In their interim report, the AAIB stated that, on the basis of a cost-sharing flight, ""it must not be made for the purpose of merely transporting the passenger"". For it to be classed as cost-sharing, pilot David Ibbotson would have had to have been making the journey regardless, dictating to Sala when the plane was leaving and sharing the cost of the flight equally with him. Agent Willie McKay, who commissioned the flight for Sala,said the flight from Nantes to Cardiffwas not a cost-sharing arrangement. He said ""Emi wasn't paying anything"" and that he was going to pay ""whatever Dave [Henderson] was going to charge"". Mr McKay said David Henderson was the pilot he used most frequently to arrange his flights. It is thought Mr Henderson was not available for the Sala flight, so he asked Mr Ibbotson to do the job. Payment would usually be made after a flight due to the varying amounts paid for landing fees at different airports. This video can not be played Cardiff could have done more - Willie McKay ""He said he couldn't do it himself but he was going to get someone. I trusted David, I had no reason not to,"" said Mr McKay. ""When you phone for a taxi you don't ask him if he has a driving licence. I was just thinking about getting the boy home which he wanted and we were happy with what we did. ""I've been told on good authority he was a very good pilot so for people to vilify the pilot after a man's death is a disgrace. I don't hold anyone responsible because it's just a tragic accident."" Sala funeral takes place in Argentina Emiliano Sala - born in Argentina, made in France Mr McKay's son Mark, agent to Nantes FC, who was also involved in organising and paying for flights for Mr Sala, said: ""I don't see how I would have done anything any differently. I've taken many flights - small aircraft, different types of aircraft, different pilots. ""I look at the situation that came about and if it was me, I'd have taken that flight and I think a lot of people would have taken that flight and not asked anything."" Mr Henderson has not responded to several approaches from the BBC for comment. Mr Ibbotson studied for a commercial pilot's licence (CPL) qualification from December 2012 until July 2014 through Cranfield Aviation Training School near Milton Keynes, but dropped out of the course without qualifying after failing to complete his theoretical training. The plane carrying Sala disappeared on 21 January Dr Stuart E Smith, head of training for the school, said: ""It is common for middle-aged private pilots to undertake the CPL theoretical knowledge course so that they may then complete CPL flight training and be able to earn money as a pilot or flight instructor."" He said Mr Ibbotson got in touch in 2016 with the intention of resuming his training, but never followed it further. He added that he had sent a report to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) soon after the tragedy. Investigations will continue to analyse air traffic communications and radar for clues, while other lines of enquiry will investigate how gas boiler engineer and part-time DJ Mr Ibbotson came to be flying a Â£15m footballer back to his new club. The Piper Malibu was registered in the US, whose rules stipulate the use of aircraft commercially outside of the country must be approved by the CAA and Federal Aviation Administration. No permission was sought or granted by the owners of the plane before Sala's flight. The AAIB released this photograph of the wreckage of the Piper Malibu Martin Robinson, chief executive of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said it was concerned about the use of so-called grey charters, which are unlicensed flights and the use of foreign-registered planes for air taxi work, since the incident. ""UK air charter companies pay a lot of money to the government for air operator certificates, without which they can't run commercial air taxi operations,"" said Mr Robinson. ""They know they're being undercut by competitors who in some cases are not fully compliant with the law. ""It's the responsibility of the person who organised the flight to have a suitably qualified pilot at the controls and to ensure the pilot had sufficient flying experience for this kind of flight and for the weather conditions that may be encountered. ""Mr Sala would have had no knowledge of David Ibbotson's licence but the person organising it should have known about that. ""They've let this man down."" The search for Mr Ibbotson's body resumed last week, but no trace was found.

"Toddlers present at killing 'need help'Glendon Spence, 23, was attacked at a youth club where children as young as three were present.","Glendon Spence, 23, was attacked inside a Brixton youth club Children as young as three who were at a youth club in Brixton where a man was stabbed to death have not had any support, a mother has claimed. Glendon Spence, 23, was attacked on 21 February at the Marcus Lipton Youth Centre in London and died at the scene. He was stabbed close to where several children were taking part in a football training session. Lambeth Council insisted counselling for those affected had ""been made available"". Two 17-year-old boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have been charged with the murder of Mr Spence, from Lewisham. At the time of the stabbing, the Lambeth Tigers were holding a training session for five to eight-year-olds inside the sports hall. Two three-year-old boys were watching along with their parents when they heard a loud noise and saw people running. Two boys have been charges with Glendon Spence's murder One mother called Sarah, who chose not to disclose her surname to safeguard her son's identity, said although the children did not see the stabbing itself they were ""absolutely terrified"". She told BBC News: ""We all just grabbed a couple of the children and headed for the corner of the hall. ""I was running back and forth between the halls, just making sure the children are okay and explaining to the parents."" The majority of killings in London so far this year have been as a result of stabbings Sarah said Mr Spence lay bleeding heavily on the floor in a room 20ft (6m) away from the children. However, she said they could still see what was happening through glass-panelled doors. Dulwich and West Norwood Labour MP Helen Hayes visited the scene on the night of the stabbing, but Sarah said there had been a lack of support from others. ""We've not had any follow-up, we've not had any assistance at all,"" she claimed. ""I understand a young man lost his life and it's horrible, but to me I look at the people that witnessed this and were in that particular building as surviving victims that are alive."" David Marriott, who was running the Lambeth Tigers football session, echoed Sarah's concerns about the psychological impact on the children. He said: ""We have to think about the effect that it may have on them, and I don't think it was really thought about."" Mr Marriott wrote a letter to Lambeth Council leader Jack Hopkins and the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan demanding immediate access to counselling and therapy. In response, Lambeth Council arranged a group meeting with a psychologist and said that counselling had been ""made available"". David Marriott was running a football session at the club when Glendon Spence was stabbed Mr Hopkins said: ""It is shocking that the attack took place at one of the borough's youth centres, which should be a safe haven for those attending. ""It is also extremely distressing that this violence was witnessed by young people, alongside the hard-working youth workers at the Marcus Lipton Centre, leaving many of them traumatised.""

US urges UK to embrace chlorinated chicken,"Fears over chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef are ""myths"", according to the US ambassador to the UK. Inthe Daily Telegraph,external, Woody Johnson urged the UK to embrace US farming methods after Washingtonpublished its objectives,externalfor a UK-US trade deal. EU rules currently limit US exports of certain food products, including chicken and beef - but Mr Johnson wants that to change in the UK after Brexit. Downing Street has repeatedlydenied it will accept lower food standards. A No 10 spokeswoman said: ""We have always been very clear that we will not lower our food standards as part of a future trading agreement."" Mr Johnson, however, described warnings over US farming practices as ""inflammatory and misleading"" smears from ""people with their own protectionist agenda"". He also said the EU's ""Museum of Agriculture"" approach was not sustainable, adding: ""American farmers are making a vital contribution to the rest of the world. Their efforts deserve to be recognised. ""Instead, they are being dismissed with misleading scare-stories which only tell you half the story."" Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? Will a UK-US trade deal lower food standards in the UK? US firms seek changes to UK standards on beef and drugs Farmers seek food standards law after Brexit On chlorine-washed chicken, Mr Johnson said the process was the same as that used by EU farmers to treat their fruit and vegetables. Describing it as a ""public safety no-brainer"", he insisted it was the most effective and economical way of dealing with ""potentially lethal"" bacteria such as salmonella and campylobacter. President of the UK's National Farmer's Union (NFU) Minette Batters said that while Mr Johnson was correct in saying chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef was ""safe"" to eat, there were other factors that needed considering. ""The difference is welfare standards and environmental protection standards,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Our consumer has demanded high standards of animal welfare, we've risen to that challenge - he's right to make the point that food security is crucially important, we would say the same - but all we're saying is: 'Produce the food to our standards and we'll have a trade deal.'"" Ms Batters said chicken farms in the US were not required, for example, to include windows in their sheds or clean out in between flocks. The US National Farmers' Union has always maintained that its chicken and beef, which use processes banned by the EU, are ""perfectly safe"" and argues there has been a lot of ""fear-mongering"". The US wants the UK to import more of its farm produce However, its British counterpart said the UK government should not accept a US deal ""which allows food to be imported into this country produced in ways which would be illegal here"". That, Ms Batters said, ""would just put British producers out of business"". Amy Mount from Greener UK, an environmental lobby group, said: ""This wish-list shows that a hard-Brexit pivot away from the EU in favour of the US would mean pressure to scrap important protections for our environment and food quality. ""Any future trade deals should reflect the high standards that the UK public both wants and expects."" Despite the NFU's insistence that consumers are keen to maintain the current welfare standards in farming, Ms Batters said there was a possibility the UK would give in to the US. She said: ""There's always been the risk - and agriculture has always been the last chapter in any trade deal to be agreed - so yes there is a huge risk that British agriculture will be the sacrificial lamb in future trade deals."" Meanwhile, Dr Emily Jones, who is an associate professor of public policy at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, also said the issue was likely to be a sticking point for the US. ""I think the US won't buy it in negotiations with the UK,"" said Dr Jones, referring to the UK's insistence on maintaining its current standards. ""It's wanted, for a very long time, the EU to harmonise with US regulations and approaches to the production of food and it's exactly what it'll ask of the UK as well."" In the US, it is legal to wash chicken carcasses in strongly chlorinated water. Producers argue that it stops the spread of microbial contamination from the bird's digestive tract to the meat, a method approved by US regulators. But the practice has been banned in the EU since 1997, where only washing with cold air or water is allowed. The EU argues that chlorine washes could increase the risk of bacterial-based diseases such as salmonella on the grounds that dirty abattoirs with sloppy standards would rely on it as a decontaminant rather than making sure their basic hygiene protocols were up to scratch. There are also concerns that such ""washes"" would be used by less scrupulous meat processing plants to increase the shelf-life of meat, making it appear fresher than it really is.

Fake HMRC phone scams 'surge by 360%',"Victims of phone scams can often be older or more vulnerable An increasing number of scammers are using landline phone calls to con people out of money, after a crackdown on bogus emails and mobile phone texts. HM Revenue and Customs said it received 60,000 reports of phone scams in the six months to January 2019 - up 360% compared with the previous six months. It said conmen pose as tax officials, threatening legal action or jail. Treasury minister Mel Stride said anyone who was suspicious about a call should hang up and report it. HMRC, the authority in charge of taxes in the UK, said criminals were turning to more traditional scams such as cold calling publicly available phone numbers such as landlines. It said it had worked with Ofcom to shut down nearly 450 lines being used by scammers in the past year. Nearly 26 million homes have a landline phone, according to Ofcom, meaning they could be at risk from these type of scams. 'Scammers struck as my mum was dying' Phone scam callers 'invaded my life' Family gangs 'exploit pension savers' Elderly 'under siege' from scammers Mr Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the crackdown on text and email phishing scams had left fraudsters with ""no choice but to try and con taxpayers over the phone"". ""If you receive a suspicious call to your landline from someone purporting to be from HMRC which threatens legal action, to put you in jail, or payment using vouchers: hang-up and report it to HMRC who can work to take them off the network,"" he said. And HMRC said it would only ever call and ask for a payment for a debt that the person was already aware of - for example by previously having received a letter - or if the person had told it they owed some tax or submitted a self-assessment return. Pauline Smith is head of the Action Fraud service, where people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland can report fraud and cybercrime. ""Don't assume anyone who calls you is who they say they are,"" said Ms Smith. ""If a person calls and asks you to make a payment, log in to an online account or offers you a deal, be cautious and seek advice."" Scammers often target older and more vulnerable people. Caroline Abrahams, the director of charity Age UK, urged people to be cautious when receiving cold calls from someone requesting money, ""no matter where they say they're calling from"". ""If there are any niggling doubts it is always sensible to end the call and contact the company or government department separately using a phone number taken from a piece of official correspondence or their website,"" she said. ""We encourage people to feel in control of who calls them at home, for example by signing up to the Telephone Preference Service or installing a call blocking device.""

The friends who are good for your brain,"Creative thinking is essential for everything from solving problems to personal fulfilment. So, how can we do more to nurture it? Every day we are expected to make hundreds of decisions and judgements. These range from small ones, like what to have for breakfast, to big ones like whether to take a new job. The trouble is that our mental resources are limited - the human mind can only cope with so many things. Given this huge challenge, we adopt mental shortcuts to function effectively. It is an approach which gets us through life, but which can also limit our growth as people. Something as simple as thinking about the people we have around us can do a lot to change that and can even help us become more creative. It may seem like an odd question, but what is a spoon for? Your automatic assumption might well be that it is for stirring a cup of tea, or for eating cereal. We do not tend to think about the many other uses a spoon could have. What about using it to dig a hole, wedge a door open, or catapult peas across the table? The idea we reach first is a mental shortcut: it requires no thought and comes to mind without effort. It is a stereotype of the reasons for which we use a spoon. This is an example of heuristic thinking, or what many people would refer to as a gut feeling. Nevertheless,research suggests that there are some surprising ways,externalin which we can think more creatively - breaking away from the many such automatic thoughts we have A season of stories about bringing people together in a fragmented world. Watch: Get a flavour of the Crossing Divides season How the BBC is tackling the issue of polarisation in society One is by opening ourselves up to greater social diversity - in other words, doing things like mixing with, or listening to, people who are not ""just like us"". There are many ways in which we differ from each other: age, race, education, home town and so on. Being asked to interact with someone from a different culture or background requires us to take a leap outside our comfort zones. Even just imagining doing this can have an effect. Put differently, diversity gives the brain a powerful workout. And, just like a physical workout, it can be incredibly good for us. However, we know that ""birds of a feather flock together"".People tend to make friends with those who are similar to them- in terms of values, preferences, and personality traits. Breaking with these habits helps us challenge the heuristic-based thinking that shapes our automatic thoughts. Birds of a feather flock together When people are exposed to a more diverse group of people, their brains are forced to process complex and unexpected information. The more people do this, the better they become at producing complex and unexpected information themselves. This trains us to look more readily look beyond the obvious - precisely the hallmark of creative thinking. More stories like this Can our choice of friends be bad for us? Why so many young women 'aren't feminists' The strange normality of life in a breakaway state Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? In astudy on the benefits of social diversity,,externalone group of participants was asked to think of someone who conformed to stereotypes - such as a female midwife. The other group was asked to think of someone who did not - for example, a male childminder. How do you attach a candle to a wall with only a box of matches and drawing pins? We then measured the effect on creativity by asking participants to produce original names for a new brand of pasta. They were given existing pasta names as examples. Results showed that the group asked to picture people who did not conform to stereotypes were more creative. They relied less on the heuristic-based knowledge available in the task - the example of brand names - and came up with better new ones. Anyone for a bowl of ""fontegalli"" or ""squigllioni""? Other research has exploredwhether an experience of living abroad enhances creativity,external. The researchers used a puzzle called the Duncker candle problem. Participants were shown a picture containing a candle, a box of matches, and a box of pins. The task was to figure out, using only the objects on the table, how to attach the candle to the wall so that the candle burns properly and does not drip wax on the floor. The correct solution involved using the box of pins as a candleholder. This task requires participants to ignore their pre-existing associations and see objects as performing different functions from what is typical. The results showed that an experience of living abroad enhanced performance on this creativity task. Of course, most of us will not be improving our creativity by thinking about spoons, pasta names, or attaching candles to a wall. But there are many other things that can help us. Engaging with diversity could include anything from watching foreign films to reading books about someone from a different background. It could mean making new friends through volunteering with a group that includes people of all ages, or joining a sports club that involves people from other cultures. Researchers have also found that creating andenjoying the arts can help us,externalsee things from a new perspective, by putting ourselves in a character's shoes. They can also createa feeling of connectedness,externalandgeneral kindness.,external Opening ourselves to new experiences can seem hard to do, but it can help us cross divides and nurture new and inclusive friendships. In these challenging times for social cohesion, there may be real benefits of embracing the new and the unexpected. In doing so, we may not only be helping our own personal growth, but putting ourselves in the best possible position to help solve society's enduring problems.

Brazil's Lula to be let out for funeral,"Lula left for the cemetery under escort Former Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva is back in prison after being let out to attend his grandson Arthur's funeral. The seven-year-old died of meningitis on Friday. Lula, as he is known, was allowed to go to the burial in SÃ£o Paulo on Saturday, where supporters gathered to greet him. Lula is serving 12 years in prison on corruption charges. At the funeral, the former president insisted on his innocence. Lula's website said he announced at the funeral that when he met Arthur in heaven, he would prove his innocence after all the bullying that the boy had suffered in school due to his grandfather being in prison. Lula, who claims his conviction was politically motivated, would also prove that the prosecutor and judge who jailed him lied, the note added. An iconic figure for the left in Latin America, the former trade unionist led Brazil between 2003 and 2010. But he was convicted for work done on a beachfront property. In Februarya court doubled Lula's sentenceafter he was found guilty of benefiting from renovation work from a company implicated in a corruption scandal. His lawyers said he would appeal against the new conviction. Lula: Judge stopped me winning election A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Lula had asked permission to attend his brother's funeral in January, but the Brazilian Supreme Court did not grant the request until the funeral was under way. However, ParanÃ¡ state government said Lula would be allowed to attend Arthur's funeral in SÃ£o Paulo. The former leader is jailed in a federal prison in Curitiba, the capital of ParanÃ¡ state. This is his first time out after his conviction last April. Arrangements were made to fly Lula to SÃ£o Paulo, roughly 340 kilometres (210 miles) away. He was returned to his cell nine hours later, at around 15:45 local time (18:45 GMT). The ex-president's supporters chanted 'Free Lula' outside the cemetery Lula's was the most high-profile conviction from a sprawling anti-corruption investigation known asOperation Car Wash - dubbed ""the largest foreign bribery case in history"" by the US Department of Justice. His supporters have insisted he is the victim of political persecution, with his left-wing Worker's Party petitioning for his release. President Jair Bolsonaro said he hoped Lula ""rots in prison"" in a video address in October,external. His son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker for his father's party, made his feelings about Lula's temporary release clear on Twitter, labelling it ""absurd"" and stating that ""it only allows a high-profile thug to pass himself off as a victim"". The tweet was later deleted.

Public health 'improving despite cuts',"Councils in England say there has been a marked improvement in public health since they took over responsibility for delivering services nearly six years ago, despite budget cuts. The Local Government Association points to a fall in the number of smokers, fewer teenage pregnancies and a decrease in the suicide rate. But it warns progress could stop if there are further funding cuts. The government has said councils will get Â£1.3bn extra next financial year. Council spending cuts, in seven charts Reality Check: What do councils have to do? The LGA, which represents 370 councils in England and Wales, is calling on the government to reverse budget cuts to councils, which it says would alleviate cost pressures on the NHS. Councils nationally have had their funding cut by 49% in real terms, between 2010-11 and 2017-18,according to,externalthe government spending watchdog. But the LGA said despite the cuts, councils were enjoying success when it came to public health outcomes. Since taking over responsibility for public health in England in 2013, testing for sexually transmitted infections was up, while new diagnoses were down. The rate of teenage conception dropped by almost a quarter from 2013-14, and the number of adults smoking cigarettes in England between 2011 and 2017 fell by about 1.6 million, to 6.1 million. Overall, councils have maintained or improved 80% of the public health outcomes. Cllr Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the LGA's community wellbeing board, said cutting the public health budget was ""a false economy"" and make it harder to ""keep the pressure off the NHS and social care."" He added that the main public health challenges in England were tobacco use, poor diet, mental health, physical inactivity and substance misuse. Last month,the government agreed new funding plansfor councils in England. Speaking at the time, Housing and Communities Secretary James Brokenshire, said the financial pot would ""pave the way for a more confident, self-sufficient and reinvigorated local government."" MPs debate council funding after warnings Council spending cuts, in seven charts Are these councils defying the cuts? Council makes Â£82m budget cuts Reality Check: What do councils have to do?

"Teenage girl stabbed to death in parkThe girl was found dead in Harold Hill, Romford, on Friday night.London","Police said Jodie Chesney died at the scene A 17-year-old girl has been stabbed to death at a park in east London. Jodie Chesney's grandmother said in a Facebook appeal that the stabbing - on Friday night in Harold Hill, Romford - had been an ""unprovoked attack"". Jodie died at the scene, in St Neots Road, at about 21:30 GMT. The Metropolitan Police confirmed Jodie's identity, but no arrests have yet been made.

Toddlers present at killing 'need help',"Glendon Spence, 23, was attacked inside a Brixton youth club Children as young as three who were at a youth club in Brixton where a man was stabbed to death have not had any support, a mother has claimed. Glendon Spence, 23, was attacked on 21 February at the Marcus Lipton Youth Centre in London and died at the scene. He was stabbed close to where several children were taking part in a football training session. Lambeth Council insisted counselling for those affected had ""been made available"". Two 17-year-old boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have been charged with the murder of Mr Spence, from Lewisham. At the time of the stabbing, the Lambeth Tigers were holding a training session for five to eight-year-olds inside the sports hall. Two three-year-old boys were watching along with their parents when they heard a loud noise and saw people running. Two boys have been charges with Glendon Spence's murder One mother called Sarah, who chose not to disclose her surname to safeguard her son's identity, said although the children did not see the stabbing itself they were ""absolutely terrified"". She told BBC News: ""We all just grabbed a couple of the children and headed for the corner of the hall. ""I was running back and forth between the halls, just making sure the children are okay and explaining to the parents."" The majority of killings in London so far this year have been as a result of stabbings Sarah said Mr Spence lay bleeding heavily on the floor in a room 20ft (6m) away from the children. However, she said they could still see what was happening through glass-panelled doors. Dulwich and West Norwood Labour MP Helen Hayes visited the scene on the night of the stabbing, but Sarah said there had been a lack of support from others. ""We've not had any follow-up, we've not had any assistance at all,"" she claimed. ""I understand a young man lost his life and it's horrible, but to me I look at the people that witnessed this and were in that particular building as surviving victims that are alive."" David Marriott, who was running the Lambeth Tigers football session, echoed Sarah's concerns about the psychological impact on the children. He said: ""We have to think about the effect that it may have on them, and I don't think it was really thought about."" Mr Marriott wrote a letter to Lambeth Council leader Jack Hopkins and the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan demanding immediate access to counselling and therapy. In response, Lambeth Council arranged a group meeting with a psychologist and said that counselling had been ""made available"". David Marriott was running a football session at the club when Glendon Spence was stabbed Mr Hopkins said: ""It is shocking that the attack took place at one of the borough's youth centres, which should be a safe haven for those attending. ""It is also extremely distressing that this violence was witnessed by young people, alongside the hard-working youth workers at the Marcus Lipton Centre, leaving many of them traumatised.""

Rare fish washes up on California beach,"The hoodwinker sunfish was only discovered in 2014 A rare fish thought to live in the southern hemisphere has washed up in Santa Barbara, California. The appearance of the seven-foot (2.1m) hoodwinker sunfish has baffled scientists, who question how the fish made it so far from its home waters. An intern at the University of California spotted the animal at the Coal Oil Point Natural Reserve. It took researchers several days to properly identify the creature, which was only discovered in 2014. Photos of the giant fish first appeared on the Coal Oil Point Facebook page, and experts from around the world weighed in to help identify the creature. Allow Facebook content?

The animal was named ""hoodwinker"" after its discovery after eluding researchers for so many years. Marianne Nyegaard, a marine scientist who found and named the fish, told CNN she ""nearly fell out of my chair"" when she saw the pictures of the beached traveller. ""When the clear pictures came through, I thought there was no doubt,"" she said. ""It's intriguing what made this fish cross the equator."" The hoodwinker is larger and sleeker than other species of sunfish, weighing up to two tonnes (2,000kg). They reportedly favour more temperate waters, such as off the coast of Chile or New Zealand. A different form of sunfish appeared twice off the west coast of Scotland in a week last September.

US attacks 'myths' about farming methods,"Fears over chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef are ""myths"", according to the US ambassador to the UK. Inthe Daily Telegraph,external, Woody Johnson urged the UK to embrace US farming methods after Washingtonpublished its objectives,externalfor a UK-US trade deal. EU rules currently limit US exports of certain food products, including chicken and beef - but Mr Johnson wants that to change in the UK after Brexit. Downing Street has repeatedlydenied it will accept lower food standards. A No 10 spokeswoman said: ""We have always been very clear that we will not lower our food standards as part of a future trading agreement."" Mr Johnson, however, described warnings over US farming practices as ""inflammatory and misleading"" smears from ""people with their own protectionist agenda"". He also said the EU's ""Museum of Agriculture"" approach was not sustainable, adding: ""American farmers are making a vital contribution to the rest of the world. Their efforts deserve to be recognised. ""Instead, they are being dismissed with misleading scare-stories which only tell you half the story."" Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? Will a UK-US trade deal lower food standards in the UK? US firms seek changes to UK standards on beef and drugs Farmers seek food standards law after Brexit On chlorine-washed chicken, Mr Johnson said the process was the same as that used by EU farmers to treat their fruit and vegetables. Describing it as a ""public safety no-brainer"", he insisted it was the most effective and economical way of dealing with ""potentially lethal"" bacteria such as salmonella and campylobacter. President of the UK's National Farmer's Union (NFU) Minette Batters said that while Mr Johnson was correct in saying chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef was ""safe"" to eat, there were other factors that needed considering. ""The difference is welfare standards and environmental protection standards,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Our consumer has demanded high standards of animal welfare, we've risen to that challenge - he's right to make the point that food security is crucially important, we would say the same - but all we're saying is: 'Produce the food to our standards and we'll have a trade deal.'"" Ms Batters said chicken farms in the US were not required, for example, to include windows in their sheds or clean out in between flocks. The US National Farmers' Union has always maintained that its chicken and beef, which use processes banned by the EU, are ""perfectly safe"" and argues there has been a lot of ""fear-mongering"". The US wants the UK to import more of its farm produce However, its British counterpart said the UK government should not accept a US deal ""which allows food to be imported into this country produced in ways which would be illegal here"". That, Ms Batters said, ""would just put British producers out of business"". Amy Mount from Greener UK, an environmental lobby group, said: ""This wish-list shows that a hard-Brexit pivot away from the EU in favour of the US would mean pressure to scrap important protections for our environment and food quality. ""Any future trade deals should reflect the high standards that the UK public both wants and expects."" Despite the NFU's insistence that consumers are keen to maintain the current welfare standards in farming, Ms Batters said there was a possibility the UK would give in to the US. She said: ""There's always been the risk - and agriculture has always been the last chapter in any trade deal to be agreed - so yes there is a huge risk that British agriculture will be the sacrificial lamb in future trade deals."" Meanwhile, Dr Emily Jones, who is an associate professor of public policy at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, also said the issue was likely to be a sticking point for the US. ""I think the US won't buy it in negotiations with the UK,"" said Dr Jones, referring to the UK's insistence on maintaining its current standards. ""It's wanted, for a very long time, the EU to harmonise with US regulations and approaches to the production of food and it's exactly what it'll ask of the UK as well."" In the US, it is legal to wash chicken carcasses in strongly chlorinated water. Producers argue that it stops the spread of microbial contamination from the bird's digestive tract to the meat, a method approved by US regulators. But the practice has been banned in the EU since 1997, where only washing with cold air or water is allowed. The EU argues that chlorine washes could increase the risk of bacterial-based diseases such as salmonella on the grounds that dirty abattoirs with sloppy standards would rely on it as a decontaminant rather than making sure their basic hygiene protocols were up to scratch. There are also concerns that such ""washes"" would be used by less scrupulous meat processing plants to increase the shelf-life of meat, making it appear fresher than it really is.

Huawei chief's extradition process begins,"Meng Wanzhou is out on bail and living in Vancouver, Canada Canada has said it will allow the US extradition case against Huawei's chief financial officer to move forward, but the court must make a final decision. The US wants Meng Wanzhou to stand trial on charges including fraud linked to the alleged violation of sanctions on Iran. Ms Meng was arrested in Canada in December at the request of the US. China said the case against Ms Meng was an ""abuse of the bilateral extradition treaty"" between Canada and the US. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lu Kang said allowing the extradition hearing to go ahead was a ""political incident"". China expressed its ""strong dissatisfaction"" and ""resolute opposition"" to the extradition proceedings, he said. The high-profile detention has soured relations between China, the US and Canada. US authorities filed almost two dozen charges against Huawei, the world's second largest smartphone maker, and Ms Meng in January, along with a formal request for her extradition. The charges include bank fraud, obstruction of justice and theft of technology. Huawei and Ms Meng have both denied all the allegations. Canada's justice department had until Friday to decide whether or not the extradition case would proceed in Canadian courts. That decision was based on whether the request complied with the requirements of the US-Canada extradition treaty, and could not be refused if so. This video can not be played Ren Zhengfei says the US cannot ""crush"" his company after the arrest of his daughter ""An extradition hearing is not a trial, nor does it render a verdict of guilt or innocence,""the justice department said in a statement on Friday,external, announcing it was authorising the extradition process in the case of Ms Meng to proceed. ""If a person is ultimately extradited from Canada to face prosecution in another country, the individual will have a trial in that country."" In a statement, Ms Meng's defence team said they were disappointed by the decision ""in the face of the political nature of the US charges"" and in the wake of comments made by the US president. Donald Trump has twice suggested he would intervene in the US Justice Department's case against Ms Meng if it would serve national security interests or help achieve a trade deal with China. ""Our client maintains that she is innocent of any wrongdoing and that the US prosecution and extradition constitutes an abuse of the processes of law,"" they said. Ms Meng is currently out on bail in Vancouver and will remain so while court proceedings are under way. Tech Tent: 5G, Huawei and a question of trust Should we worry about Huawei? Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes? She is next scheduled to appear in the British Columbia Supreme Court on 6 March, when it will be confirmed Canada has issued the ""Authority to Proceed"" in her extradition to the US. Her extradition hearing will also be scheduled at that time. This decision is still an early step in the process. If a judge is satisfied with the evidence presented during the extradition hearing, he or she will authorise the individual be committed for extradition. The justice minister then decides whether to surrender the person to the US. Ms Meng does have avenues to appeal throughout the process. In some rare instances, extradition cases have dragged on for over a decade. Michael Spavor (L) and Michael Kovrig have been put under ""compulsory measures"" Ms Meng's arrest infuriated Chinese officials, who insist that she has not violated any laws, and led to a rise in diplomatic tensions between China and Canada. Canada says it is only following the rule of law in the case, but that has not satisfied China. Two Canadians are believed to have been detained in retaliation for Ms Meng's arrest. Ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were both detained in China in mid-December on accusations of harming national security. The case could also ratchet up tensions between China and the US, and impact the firm's global expansion efforts.

Huawei charges: The 100, 400 and 800-word story Huawei reaches out to Americans in WSJ ad US President Donald Trump's administration has reinstated all sanctions on Iran removed under a 2015 nuclear deal and recently imposed even stricter measures, hitting oil exports, shipping and banks. It also alleges Huawei stole technology from T Mobile used to test smartphone durability, as well as obstructing justice and committing wire fraud.

Pakistan hands back captured Indian pilot,"This video can not be played Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was handed over to Indian officials near a border crossing with Pakistan Pakistan has freed an Indian fighter pilot captured after his plane was shot down in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was handed over to Indian officials on Friday at the only legal border crossing with Pakistan. Minutes earlier, the pilot said on Pakistani TV that he was ""very impressed"" by the Pakistan army. On Thursday Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said the pilot's release was a ""peace gesture"" to India. India and Pakistan - both nuclear powers - claim all of Kashmir, but each controls only parts of it. The pilot is being hailed as a hero in India, with fireworks being set off in the capital Delhi. Who is captured Indian pilot Abhinandan? Villagers recount dramatic capture of pilot Praising the pilot, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the nation was ""proud of your exemplary courage"".

In what appeared to be an edited statement aired on Pakistan TV, the wing commander described how he was shot down and rescued from an ""agitated"" crowd by Pakistani soldiers. ""The Pakistan army looked after me really well, they are very professional,"" the pilot said while in uniform, adding that he saw potential for peace. The video statement was released by Pakistan's military minutes before the pilot walked across the border On Friday evening, the pilot went through medical check-ups and was debriefed by India's military in the capital Delhi. He will be reunited with his family this weekend, officials said. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC South Asia correspondent in Amritsar From the early hours of the morning crowds began to build at the Indian side of the Wagah border, the main crossing between India and Pakistan. Some were waving Indian flags, others had them painted on their cheeks. Today's events appear to have walked the nuclear neighbours back from the brink, but the underlying issues remain. India wants a firm commitment from Pakistan when it comes to flushing out militants on its soil - today the Pakistani foreign minister told the BBC he would act on this. But Indian officials could be sceptical - having raised these concerns before. Tensions between the two countries have escalated sharply in the past few weeks. Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Khan vs Modi: Who won the war of perception? On Tuesday, India carried out air strikes on what it said was a militant camp in Pakistan in retaliation for a suicide bombing that killed at least 40 Indian troops in Indian-administered Kashmir on 14 February. A Pakistan-based group said it carried out the attack - the deadliest to take place during a three-decade insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir. Pakistan - which denies any involvement in the 14 February attack - said it had no choice but to retaliate to the Indian raids with air strikes on Wednesday. That led to a dogfight and the Indian fighter jet being shot down in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. This video can not be played Life on both sides of the Kashmir conflict India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from Britain and partition in 1947. All but one were over Kashmir. Tens of thousands of troops remain positioned on either side of the border in the disputed region. The aerial attacks across the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Indian and Pakistani territory are the first since a war in 1971. At the height of the tension Pakistan closed its airspace, disrupting major air routes. Partial operations have now resumed at four main airports, with the full resumption of flights expected next week. ""As a peace gesture we are releasing the Indian pilot tomorrow,"" Mr Khan told Pakistani lawmakers in the National Assembly on Thursday. On Wednesday he pushed for talks with Delhi to prevent the risk of a ""miscalculation"" between the nuclear-armed neighbours. This video can not be played Footage appears to show wreckage from a downed Indian jet Pakistan's military spokesman said that Pakistan fighter jets had carried out ""strikes"" - exactly what they did remains unclear - in Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday. Two Indian air force jets then responded, crossing the de facto border that divides Kashmir. ""Our jets were ready and we shot both of them down,"" Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said. He said that one Indian pilot was in the custody of the Pakistani army. Jubilant Indians celebrated the pilot's release in New Delhi Images then circulated of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman's capture, which were condemned for what appeared to be a physical attack at the hands of residents in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, but also praised because of the actions of the Pakistani soldiers who intervened to create a barrier. Fighter pilot 'opened fire' before capture Pakistan's information ministry published - but subsequently deleted - a video showing the blindfolded pilot, who could be heard requesting water, just after he had been captured. In later footage, he could be seen sipping tea from a cup without a blindfold. India's foreign ministry later issued a statement demanding the release of its fighter pilot and condemning the images, describing them as a ""vulgar display of an injured personnel"".

The family released a brief statement on Friday condemning praise for the North Korean leader, without mentioning Mr Trump by name. ""We have been respectful during this summit process. Now we must speak out,"" wrote Fred and Cindy Warmbier. Fred and Cindy Warmbier were guests at Mr Trump's 2018 State of the Union speech ""Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. ""Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. ""No excuse or lavish praise can change that.""

Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the nation had only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for disabling its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and permanently halting nuclear and long-range rocket testing. ""This proposal was the biggest denuclearisation measure we could take at the present stage when taking into consideration the current level of confidence between the DPRK [North Korea] and the United States,"" said Mr Ri.

"Toddlers present at killing 'need help'Glendon Spence, 23, was attacked at a youth club where children as young as three were present.London","Glendon Spence, 23, was attacked inside a Brixton youth club Children as young as three who were at a youth club in Brixton where a man was stabbed to death have not had any support, a mother has claimed. Glendon Spence, 23, was attacked on 21 February at the Marcus Lipton Youth Centre in London and died at the scene. He was stabbed close to where several children were taking part in a football training session. Lambeth Council insisted counselling for those affected had ""been made available"". Two 17-year-old boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have been charged with the murder of Mr Spence, from Lewisham. At the time of the stabbing, the Lambeth Tigers were holding a training session for five to eight-year-olds inside the sports hall. Two three-year-old boys were watching along with their parents when they heard a loud noise and saw people running. Two boys have been charges with Glendon Spence's murder One mother called Sarah, who chose not to disclose her surname to safeguard her son's identity, said although the children did not see the stabbing itself they were ""absolutely terrified"". She told BBC News: ""We all just grabbed a couple of the children and headed for the corner of the hall. ""I was running back and forth between the halls, just making sure the children are okay and explaining to the parents."" The majority of killings in London so far this year have been as a result of stabbings Sarah said Mr Spence lay bleeding heavily on the floor in a room 20ft (6m) away from the children. However, she said they could still see what was happening through glass-panelled doors. Dulwich and West Norwood Labour MP Helen Hayes visited the scene on the night of the stabbing, but Sarah said there had been a lack of support from others. ""We've not had any follow-up, we've not had any assistance at all,"" she claimed. ""I understand a young man lost his life and it's horrible, but to me I look at the people that witnessed this and were in that particular building as surviving victims that are alive."" David Marriott, who was running the Lambeth Tigers football session, echoed Sarah's concerns about the psychological impact on the children. He said: ""We have to think about the effect that it may have on them, and I don't think it was really thought about."" Mr Marriott wrote a letter to Lambeth Council leader Jack Hopkins and the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan demanding immediate access to counselling and therapy. In response, Lambeth Council arranged a group meeting with a psychologist and said that counselling had been ""made available"". David Marriott was running a football session at the club when Glendon Spence was stabbed Mr Hopkins said: ""It is shocking that the attack took place at one of the borough's youth centres, which should be a safe haven for those attending. ""It is also extremely distressing that this violence was witnessed by young people, alongside the hard-working youth workers at the Marcus Lipton Centre, leaving many of them traumatised.""

VideoSpaceX launches military satellite,"This video can not be played SpaceX has launched a rocket carrying a military navigation satellite for the first time. The Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral on Sunday after four previous launches were cancelled due to bad weather and technical hitches. It's a significant achievement for Elon Musk's privately-held company, which has been trying to break into the military space launch market for years. SpaceX said this rocket was a ""rare, expendable"" version of the Falcon 9; it wouldn't try to re-land the booster after launch as it needed to use all its rocket fuel to move the satellite to its distant orbit.

Mr Maezawa, 42, has not revealed how much he paid for the trip, which brings together two eccentric billionaires who are not averse to being in the global spotlight. The Japanese entrepreneur began selling rare CDs and records in 1998 through a company he founded called Start Today. The mail-order catalogue business moved online at the turn of the millennium and added clothes to its offering. ""I was president of my company while touring around the country with the band,""he told the Japan Times earlier this year.,external""When it became physically impossible to handle both, I chose my company - that was around when I was 25 or 26."" He launched fashion e-retailer Zozotown in 2004, and by the time he was in his mid-30s, he was a billionaire. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Forbes magazine now lists him as the 18th richest man in Japan with a personal wealth of $2.9bn (Â£2.2bn). His company recently made headlines after it launched a bodysuit that customers can use to upload their exact body measurements to the clothes shopping site. He has splashed his cash at high-profile contemporary art auctions and paid $110.5m (Â£84m) last year for a large piece by Jean-Michel Basquiat - a record for the late US artist. At the time he said he planned to put it on display eventually at a museum in Chiba, his hometown. In 2016, he paid $57.3m for another Basquiat work - Devil's Head. He said in a statement he ""felt shivers"" when he first saw it. ""Regardless of its condition or sales value, I was driven by the responsibility to acknowledge great art and the need to pass on not only the artwork itself, but also the knowledge of the artist's culture and his way of life to future generations,"" he said. Yusaku Maezawa posted an image of Devil's Head in 2016 with the caption: ""Jean-Michel Basquiat is coming to Japan"" Now, the billionaire plans to use his trip around the Moon to inspire new ""masterpieces,"" created by the artists he chooses to accompany him. ""They will be asked to create something after they return to Earth. These masterpieces will inspire the dreamer within all of us,"" the future amateur astronaut told reporters. The art project called #dearMoon,externalwas presented in a video released shortly afterhe and Mr Musk announced the Moon flight. The price Mr Maezawa agreed to pay for his ticket to space has not been disclosed, but according to Mr Musk it's ""a lot of money"". Still, doubt remains over whether or not Mr Maezawa and his art troupe will make it to orbit the Moon. The launch relies on a rocket yet to be built, and Mr Musk himself said it was not ""100% certain we can bring this to flight"".

SpaceX set for crew demo launch,"This video can not be played SpaceX has launched the Falcon 9 rocket and capsule The demonstration of a new US system to get astronauts into orbit is under way. The SpaceX company has launched a capsule designed to carry people from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mission is uncrewed for this flight, but if it goes well, the American space agency is likely to approve the system for regular astronaut use from later this year. SpaceX founder Elon Musk said this could be the first step towards opening space travel to commercial customers. Not since the retirement of the shuttles in 2011 has the US been able to put humans in orbit. The billionaire who wants to fly to the Moon OneWeb launches pathfinder satellites It has been paying to use Russian Soyuz vehicles instead. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon crew capsule lifted off from Kennedy's historic Pad 39A at the precise planned time of 02:49 EST (07:49 GMT). The 11-minute ascent put the Dragon on a path to rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS) on Sunday. Because this is just a demonstration, there are no astronauts aboard - but there is a ""test dummy"". Dressed in a spacesuit and sitting next to a window, this anthropomorphic simulator is fitted with sensors around the head, neck, and spine. It will gather data on the type of forces that humans will experience when they get to ride in the spacecraft. SpaceX has nicknamed the dummy ""Ripley"" - after the Sigourney Weaver character in the Alien movies. Ripley has a microphone next to ""her"" ear to record the sounds astronauts would hear For the California company, this mission is a key milestone in its short history. Mr Musk, a technology entrepreneur and engineer, set up the organisation with the specific intention of taking people into space. ""It's been 17 years to get to this point, from 2002 to now. To be frank, I'm a little emotionally exhausted because it was super stressful,"" he told reporters immediately after the launch. ""Our focus has been on serving Nasa's needs but once Dragon is in regular operation, I think we will seek commercial customers of which the Nasa administrator, and Nasa in general, has been very supportive."" This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Meet the meme-loving magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla...published in 2021 Mr Musk said those customers could include private citizens going to the ISS, just as they have done on Soyuz vehicles in the past. Separately, the entrepreneur is developing a much bigger system - which he calls the Starship and Super Heavy rocket - to transport people to the Moon and Mars. Spectators turned out in the early hours in Florida to watch the launch The Dragon crew capsule is a variant on the ISS cargo freighter flown by SpaceX. Upgrades include life-support systems, obviously; and more powerful thrusters to push the vessel to safety if something goes wrong with a rocket during an ascent to orbit. It also has four parachutes instead of the freighter's three to control the return to Earth. Dragon crew capsules will splash down in the Atlantic not far from Kennedy. Artwork: The crew ship will approach the station from the front and dock automatically Nasa is essentially now contracting out crew transport to SpaceX. Whereas in the past, Nasa engineers would have top-down control of all aspects of vehicle design and the agency would own and operate the hardware - the relationship with industry has been put on a completely new footing. Today, Nasa sets broad requirements and industry is given plenty of latitude in how it meets those demands. Agency officials still check off every step, but the approach is regarded as more efficient and less costly. Nasa chief, Jim Bridenstine, stressed on Saturday that the re-introduction of American crew transport did not mean an end to cooperation with Russia. ""We want to make sure that we keep our partnership with Russia which has been very strong for a long period of time, going all the way back to the Apollo-Soyuz era,"" he said. ""But we also want to make sure we have our own capability to get back and forth to the International Space Station, so that we can have this strong partnership where they can launch on our rockets and we can launch on their rockets."" After being taken to orbit, the Dragon makes its own way to the station using onboard thrusters. One of the big differences between this mission and standard cargo flights is the mode of approach and attachment to the ISS. Freighters come up under the orbiting lab and are grappled by a robotic arm and pulled into a berthing position. On this occasion, we will see the crew version of Dragon approach the station at the bow and dock automatically, using a new design of connection ring. Arrival is set for 11:00 GMT on Sunday. ISS astronauts will be watching closely to see that the capsule behaves as it should. The Dragon is expected to stay at the station until Friday. The current plan has it undocking, firing its thrusters to come out of orbit, and splashing down at roughly 13:45 GMT. Kirk Shireman, the manager of Nasa's ISS programme, said: ""You'll hear us talk about this being a flight test; it absolutely is, although we view it also as a real mission, a very critical mission. ""The ISS still has three people onboard so this mission coming up to the ISS for the first time has to work; it has to work."" Nasa is also working with Boeing on crew transport. The company has developed a capsule of its own called the Starliner. This will have its equivalent demo flight in the next couple of months.

Who is the captured pilot?,"Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman Indian air force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, captured by Pakistani forces on Wednesday, has become the point of focus amid tensions between the two countries. The fighter pilot, who has 16 years of experience, is from the southern city of Chennai (formerly known as Madras). His jet was shot down in what Islamabad called a ""retaliation"" to India conducting air strikes in its territory. His capture was seen as a major setback for India. The government demanded his immediate release and Indian social media was full of tweets about him, with many calling him a hero and praying for his safe return. He was returned to much jubilation two days later, in what Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan described as a ""peace gesture"". Dramatic details of how he was captured in Pakistan have been revealed. ""I saw the Indian flag on his parachute and knew he was Indian. I also saw his plane get hit and saw him float down,"" Mohammad Razzaq Chaudhry, a resident of Bhimber district in Pakistani-administered Kashmir who witnessed the moment the jet was shot down on Wednesday, told BBC's Ilyas Khan. He added that locals rushed to the fallen pilot and that he was ""afraid"" that they might harm him. Mr Chaudhry said that some of the men were angry and attacked the pilot while others tried to stop them. ""I told them not to harm him - to leave him alone  until the army comes.""

Local media in India reported that crowds began thronging his family home soon after news of his capture spread. The Hindustan Times newspaper quoted one of his relatives as saying that they wanted the government to ""secure his release"" without delay. His family has refused to comment about his capture. The son of a decorated former fighter pilot, Wing Cdr Abhinandan was first commissioned as a fighter pilot in 2004. His mother is a doctor. He is reported to be in his mid-30s. His father, Air Marshal Simhakutty Varthaman, worked with decorated Tamil film maker Mani Ratnam, acting as an adviser for his 2017 film, Kaatru Veliyidai, which was set against the backdrop of the 1999 Kargil conflict between India and Pakistan. Mr Varthaman was the air marshal at the time. The Kargil conflict was the last time an Indian solider was captured and held by Pakistani forces. Group Captain K Nachiketa, who was also an air force pilot, was in Pakistan's custody for eight days after his jet crashed in their territory. Anti-India protesters in Pakistan have printed posters showing Abhinandan He is now retired and lives in the southern city of Hyderabad. ""He [Wing Cdr Abhinandan] should be treated appropriately as an officer and sent back to India,"" Group Captain Nachiketa told BBC Telugu. ""He is brave and courageous and we are all proud of him."" He added that he did not want to talk about his capture but said that ""all officers are trained for this and I am sure he will be with us shortly and join his unit again soon."" A clip of his appearance on a local television show,external- NDTV Good Times - in 2011 is also being circulated widely. In it, he is heard joking about how you need a ""bad attitude"" to be a successful fighter pilot. He also talks about how you trust your colleagues with your life, referring to ""blind faith"" in your co-pilot when you're in the air. India and Pakistan in 'uncharted waters' Air strikes a 'major escalation' India demands Pakistan release pilot India had initially said that all of its pilots were accounted for, contradicting Pakistani claims that they had captured a pilot. However Pakistan's information ministry then released - and later deleted - a video showing the pilot blindfolded and with blood on his face. This prompted a furious Delhi to summon Islamabad's deputy high commissioner and condemn what it called the ""vulgar display of an injured personnel"". In later footage, Wing Commander Abhinandan could be seen sipping tea from a cup without a blindfold. He appeared to have been cleaned up. He said his name, military position and that he was from ""down south"", but refused to share any details when asked about his mission: ""I'm not supposed to tell you that."" In what appeared to be an edited statement aired on Pakistan TV minutes before he was handed over, the wing commander praised the Pakistani army, adding he saw potential for peace. The wing commander also criticised the Indian press, saying they always exaggerate and say a lot of damaging things that mislead people. Allow Twitter content?
