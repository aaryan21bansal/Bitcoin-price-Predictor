Cleese attacks 'cowardly' BBC over Fawlty Towers,"John Cleese, who plays Basil Fawlty, has said the move is ""stupid"" John Cleese has laid into the ""cowardly and gutless"" BBC after an episode of Fawlty Towers was temporarily removed from a BBC-owned streaming platform. A 1975 episode titled The Germans was taken off UKTV's streaming service because it contains ""racial slurs"". In it, the Major uses highly offensive language, and Cleese's Basil Fawlty declares ""don't mention the war"". UKTV said it expected to reinstate the show with ""extra guidance"" in ""the coming days"". Cleese wrote on Twitter,external: ""The BBC is now run by a mixture of marketing people and petty bureaucrats."" He added: ""I would have hoped that someone at the BBC would understand that there are two ways of making fun of human behaviour. ""One is to attack it directly. The other is to have someone who is patently a figure of fun, speak up on behalf of that behaviour."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He went on to compare the situation with that of Alf Garnett, the racist character in sitcoms Till Death Us Do Part and In Sickness and in Health. ""We laughed at Alf's reactionary views. Thus we discredited them, by laughing at him,""Cleese wrote,external. ""Of course, there were people - very stupid people - who said 'Thank God someone is saying these things at last'. We laughed at these people too. Now they're taking decisions about BBC comedy."" He continued: ""But it's not just stupidity. The BBC is now run by a mixture of marketing people and petty bureaucrats. It used to have a large sprinkling of people who'd actually made programmes. Not any more. ""So BBC decisions are made by persons whose main concern is not losing their jobs... That's why they're so cowardly and gutless and contemptible. I rest my case."" UKTV also operates channels including Gold, and many of its channels and its digital player were taken over by the BBC's commercial arm BBC Studios last year. A BBC spokesman declined to comment. A UKTV statement said it would update the episode with guidance and contextual information in line with similar warnings on other classic comedy titles. ""We will reinstate Fawlty Towers once that extra guidance has been added, which we expect will be in the coming days,"" it added. ""We will continue to look at what content is on offer as we always have done."" Netflix and iPlayer at odds over BBC comedies Ant and Dec sorry for acting as people of colour Little Britain pulled from iPlayer and Netflix The Germans is still available to view on Britbox, which is part-owned by the BBC, with a message saying it ""contains some offensive racial language of the time and upsetting scenes"". It is also on Netflix, carrying a warning about ""language, [and] discrimination"". Journalist and broadcaster Carl Anka described the removal as ""a waste of time"", noting many people would prefer it if UKTV and other companies simply ""committed to hiring black creatives"" instead.

In 2013, it was reported that Cleese agreed for the offending lines to be edited out when it was repeated on TV. ""We are very proud of Fawlty Towers and its contribution to British television comedy,"" a BBC spokesmantold the Daily Mail at the time,external. ""But public attitudes have changed significantly since it was made and it was decided to make some minor changes, with the consent of John Cleese's management, to allow the episode to transmit to a family audience at 7.30pm on BBC Two."" This week, many channels and comedy figures have been making moves to reassess what is acceptable in today's society, following mass Black Lives Matter protests after the death of George Floyd. HBO Max temporarily removed Gone With The Wind because of its ""racial depictions"", and Little Britain was removed from the BBC iPlayer and Britbox because ""times have changed"". Netflix has also removed Little Britain plus David Walliams and Matt Lucas's Come Fly With Me, and The League of Gentlemen and The Mighty Boosh. Meanwhile, Ant and Dec apologised for impersonating ""people of colour"" on Saturday Night Takeaway, and requested ITV remove the 2003 and 2004 sketches from its catch-up service.

Paper faces backlash for headline on Rowling's ex,"The Sun said it had not intended to ""glorify"" domestic violence in its interview with JK Rowling's former husband Jorge Arantes The Sun newspaper has faced a backlash from domestic abuse charities for an article in which JK Rowling's ex said ""I'm not sorry"" for slapping her. As part of a blogaddressing criticism of her comments on transgender people, the Harry Potter author said her first marriage had been ""violent"". Jorge Arantestold the Sun,externalhe slapped Rowling when she left him - but added ""there was not sustained abuse"". The newspaper said it had not intended to ""enable or glorify"" domestic abuse. Critics have accused the author of being transphobic for her response to an article about ""people who menstruate"". Rowling said her personal experience of domestic abuse and sexual assault, and her concerns about protecting safe spaces for women, were some reasons why she spoke out about transgender issues. The Sun's front page headline on Friday was: ""I slapped JK and I'm not sorry"". Mr Arantes, who shares a daughter with Rowling from their marriage, told the paper: ""Yes. It is true I slapped her. But I didn't abuse her."" When asked about his response to her claims - which included that the relationship was violent - he said: ""If she says that, that's up to her. It's not true I hit her."" JK Rowling responds to trans tweets criticism Eddie Redmayne criticises JK Rowling trans tweets School renames Rowling house over trans tweets Nicole Jacobs, England's domestic abuse commissioner, wrote to the newspaper to say she was ""deeply concerned"" about the story. ""It is unacceptable that the Sun has chosen to repeat and magnify the voice of someone who openly admits to violence against a partner,"" she said. The charity Women's Aid said the newspaper's front page had a ""negative impact"", and added it was in conversation with the Sun about reflecting the voices of survivors of domestic abuse. ""Headlines matter,"" it added. Some 20 anti-domestic abuse campaigners - including the chief executive of Women's Aid - wrote an open letter calling on the paper to apologise. ""Responding to a woman disclosing her experiences of domestic abuse and sexual assault by giving a platform to her perpetrator to trivialise the abuse he subjected her to is irresponsible and dangerous,""the letter said,external. Press regulator Ipso said it had received more than 500 complaints about the Sun article. A spokeswoman for the Sun,externalsaid: ""It was certainly not our intention to 'enable' or 'glorify' domestic abuse, our intention was to expose a perpetrator's total lack of remorse. Our sympathies are always with the victims."" The spokeswoman added that the tabloid had a ""long history of standing up for abused women"", and ""over the we have empowered countless victims to come forward and seek help"". Politicians have also criticised the Sun's coverage. The Liberal Democrats called on the Sun to donate the revenue made from Friday's newspaper to Refuge - while Labour's shadow minister for domestic abuse and safeguarding, Jess Phillips, said ""doubt and disbelief"" benefited perpetrators of abuse.

The row about Rowling's comments on transgender issues began last weekend, after she responded to a headline on an online article discussing ""people who menstruate"" by writing in a tweet: ""I'm sure there used to be a word for those people.

She added: ""I'm mentioning these things now not in an attempt to garner sympathy, but out of solidarity with the huge numbers of women who have histories like mine, who've been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces.""

According toThe Guardian,external, prior to the Covid-19 lockdown, the Evening Standard's circulation was about 800,000 daily copies in the capital, but it was struggling due to an industry-wide decline in advertising revenues. Due to its reliance on readers using public transport, the Evening Standard was reported to have distributed just over 423,000 copies a day in April, after the nation went into lockdown. Osborne's replacement, Sheffield, will remain director of a female news brand she launched called This Much I Know, and will be ""tasked with making it a digital first operation"" added Rajan. ""That's a extremely difficult challenge for a title so heavily dependent on print for its income,"" he tweeted. ""As an ad-funded title reliant on footfall, the Standard has been devastated by the pandemic.""

"Positive virus tests falling in England, says ONS","The number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England is continuing to fall, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics. Around one in 1,700 people were infected between 25 May and 7 June, or 33,000 individuals, compared to one in 1,000 before then. The figures are based on 20,000 tests on people in private households. Everyone in the study was tested whether they had symptoms or not. The ONS figures,externalare thought to give a good picture of the proportion of people infected with the virus in the community - but they do not include infections in hospitals and care homes. However, there are wide margins of error around the figures because they are based on small numbers of people testing positive. As of 11 June, there were 202 more deaths reported in the UK, taking the total number of deaths with a positive test for Covid-19 to 41,481 since the epidemic began. In this analysis, 19,933 people from 9,179 households carried out their own swab tests of their throat and nose, which look for the presence of the virus. Just 11 individuals from eight households tested positive for coronavirus, allowing statisticians to come up with estimates for the whole population. At the end of April, the percentage of the population in England testing positive was 0.4% - now it's less than 0.1%, the ONS says. That means an average of 31,600 new infections occurring per week in private households, or 4,500 per day. The ONS analysis is part of a long-term study to track coronavirus in the general population with researchers from the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester and Public Health England. How does contact tracing work in England? Contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix' Whatever happened to the NHS contact-tracing app? The NHS test and trace scheme in England identified 31,000 close contactsfrom 8,000 people testing positive during its first week of operation, up to 3 June. But only two-thirds of cases shared details of their close contacts so they could be followed up and asked to self-isolate for 14 days. There is no new data on how many people have already had the virus, using antibody tests of blood samples from people in households. This is estimated to bearound 7% in England as of 24 May.

Premier League to make shirt tribute,"Players names on the back of shirts will be replaced with the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' for the first 12 games of the restarted season Premier League players' names will be replaced on the back of their shirts with 'Black Lives Matter' for the first 12 matches of the restarted season. The Premier League will also support any player who chooses to 'take a knee' before or during matches. Players in Germany have made gestures of solidarity with people protesting aboutthe death of George Floyd. ""We, the players, stand together with the singular objective of eradicating racial prejudice,"" read a statement. In a joint message from all 20 clubs, players added that they were committed to ""a global society of inclusion, respect, and equal opportunities for all, regardless of their colour or creed"". A Black Lives Matter badge will feature on all playing shirts for the rest of the season alongside a badge thanking NHS staff for their work during the coronavirus outbreak. BBC Sport has learned that Watford captain Troy Deeney played a pivotal role in the discussions between club captains and the Premier League, alongside Leicester City's Wes Morgan. Deeney's girlfriend, Alisha Hosannah, has designed the Black Lives Matter badge that will be used on the players' shirts. Several Premier League squads have already 'taken a knee' in training-ground images shared on social media, andanti-racism charity Kick It Out had asked that players feel free to do so on the pitch. The Football Association has said it will take a ""common sense approach"" to such protests. Four players, including Borussia Dortmund's England forward Jadon Sancho, were initially investigated by the Bundesliga authorities for making clear their support for anti-racism demonstrations in the wake of the death of 46-year-old Floyd in police custody in the United States last month. None was subsequently punished and the German Football Association said it would continue to allow such displays of support over the coming weeks. The Premier League resumes behind closed doors on 17 June after a three-month suspension caused by the pandemic. Former England, Newcastle and Spurs midfielder Jermaine Jenas, who made 280 Premier League appearances between 2002 and 2013, hopes the campaign for change continues beyond those first 12 games. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, he said: ""It's brilliant that all the clubs and the players have come together and said that this is what they want. I think it's a great message because the Premier League is one of the most powerful businesses in the world. ""I'm all for it in terms of the representation and for each club and player to be doing it. But I think the question on most people's lips is: what next? ""What about the week after? Does it just fade out and it's 'OK, we did our little bit and it's gone now'. Or are we actually going to see some real change within our game, our own house? ""There's been huge conversations about thelack of opportunities for black coaches.We need to quash all of that by starting to implement [diversity] at the hiring level of management, at the top clubs and within the FA.""

"FM resists 'loud demands' to end lockdown cautionMark Drakeford says he will not change strategy on easing the lockdown ""however loud the demands"".Wales politics","Mark Drakeford said he would not risk letting the ""deadly virus"" rise again Wales' first minister has said he will not shift from his cautious approach to easing coronavirus restrictions ""however loud the demands"". People in Wales arerestricted to journeys of five milesfor leisure and non-essential shops remain closed. In England, there is no travel limit andshops are reopening on Monday. The next review of the rules in Wales is due in a week's time, but Mark Drakeford said he was resisting calls to make changes sooner. The tourism industry warned this week it was ""on thebrink of collapse"" due to the restrictions. Scottish and Welsh FMs push for transition period extension Wales Millennium Centre says 250 jobs at risk Cases have been falling in Wales, withthe R number - the average number of people infected by each person who gets the virus - now down from 0.8 to 0.7, the first minister told the Welsh Government's daily news conference. There are32 people in critical care for coronavirus, the lowest figure since 25 March. ""We can chose a path in which we regain our freedoms gradually, carefully and safely, using the headroom we have made together - but never taking steps which would knowingly undermine everything we have achieved,"" he said. ""Or we could throw it all away, lift the restrictions in a rush and run the real risk that this deadly virus would be on the rise again in Wales. ""I want you to know that whatever happens elsewhere and however loud the demands to do things differently may be, we will stick to the path we have chosen."" Testing capacity had increased, he said, with Wales now having the ability to carry out 12,300 tests a day - although the figure of actual tests in the past 24 hours was 3,300. A new drive-through test centre opened in Deeside on Thursday, he said, with another due to open in Abergavenny next week. Conversations within government about the further easing of lockdown restrictions started the Saturday after the last review. There was a further conversation on Thursday and another on Friday, with a set of options to be presented ahead of the cabinet meeting of ministers on Wednesday of next week. The demands on ministers to lift restrictions are coming from all directions - zoos, restaurateurs, pub landlords, car showrooms and people wanting to see family members not living locally. The impression I get is that the intention is to continue with the strategy to date: pick one big change or a couple of small ones to fit the headroom ministers have to work with, in the hope that it does not cause an increase in transmission. Also, don't forget that with schools set to reopen for all year groups on 29 June they have already announced one big change that will overlap with the next three-week cycle, and - from the conversations I have had - there seems to be some uncertainty as to the possible ramifications of that change on the spread of the virus. So, a flurry of immediate changes is unlikely to be announced next week - but we could get, as the first minister suggested, the sketch of a plan for the easing of restrictions over the following weeks. Caution remains the watchword, scientific advice the guiding star. But, as one source said, there is a feeling that despite relatively positive polling for the Welsh Government's strategy, maybe ""people's tolerance is starting to wear thin"". A promise to test every care home resident in Wales was ""nearing completion"", Mr Drakeford said - despite a pledge it would be done by now. Mr Drakeford previously said all residents would be tested by June 12. ""We are nearing completion of testing every single care home resident and staff member in Wales, and from next week, we will continue to offer weekly tests for staff in care homes for the next four weeks,"" he added. ""As the position has improved, we have been able to help care homes plan for additional visits to residents from family and friends, provided these can be done safely and in line with the guidance."" Three-quarters of care homes in Wales have had no cases of the virus, he added. On Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), he said there was now a stockpile of 78 million items, with 14 million items having been supplied to other parts of the UK.

Scottish secretary wants one metre distance rule,"Mr Jack warned that many businesses would not survive unless the 2m rule is relaxed A UK cabinet minister has called for the 2m (6ft) social distancing rules to be relaxed as quickly as possible. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said he believed the distance should be cut to 1m as soon as is it safe to do so Mr Jack said the move was needed to ensure the tourism and hospitality sector were financially viable. His call was echoed by economist and former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, who wrote the party's growth commission report. Mr Wilson said reducing the distance was ""mission critical"" for many businesses across Scotland. The World Health Organisation recommends that people keep at least 1m apart to help reduce the risk of transmitting Covid-19. Coronavirus in Scotland - latest developments Podlitical: The cost of coronavirus on Scotland Could social distancing of less than two metres work? Both the UK and Scottish governments have said the current 2m rule is best of the best-available scientific evidence, and is needed to ensure the virus continues to be suppressed But the tourism industry, pubs, restaurants and other businesses say they will be unable to reopen unless the distance is cut, as has already happened in several other countries around the world. And Downing Street has been facing calls from Tory backbenchers to cut the social distancing rule in England. People across the UK must currently keep at least two metres apart Mr Jack told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the tourism and hospitality sector was ""effectively going to face three winters"" unless it can be restarted this summer. He said: ""As soon as it is possible to do so with the R number suppressed, I would like to see it move to 1m to get back to something near normal in the way that we conduct our lives and our businesses as we see the virus recede ""We've seen this happen without any bad consequences in other European countries. ""For a lot of hospitality businesses they need 2m to become 1m when it is safe to do so to be economically viable."" Asked when the UK government would change the rule, Mr Jack said the prime minister had an ""open mind"". He also said he would have preferred for Scotland's tourism industry to reopen on 1 July that than 15 July, as is currently the plan. Meanwhile, Mr Wilson told the same programme that he agreed many businesses would not be viable unless the social distancing rules were relaxed. He said: ""The evidence from around the world is that it is possible, and I think it is mission critical for so many businesses."" Scotland's finance secretary, Kate Forbes, joined the Podlitical team for a discussion about how coronavirus could have a ""disproportionate"" impact on Scotland's economy, the ""acute hardship"" facing firms and how to persuade people to return to shops and restaurants. You can listen to the podcast here. Mr Wilson said Scotland, where the economy relies on tourism and the oil sector more than other parts of the UK, would be among the hardest hit. He added: ""The tidal wave of unemployment, the cost of business failures, the cost to people who lose their income, that will be more damaging to their health and wellbeing and their mental health than the current Covid impact. ""It's not either/or. They are both part of the same problem."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that infection rates and cases were falling in Scotland due to a ""careful and orderly plan"". She added: ""The more we suppress - and hopefully eradicate Covid-19 - the more normality we can restore to the economy. Sustainability of recovery matters. ""If we can effectively eradicate Covid-19 and then control through Test and Protect and policies to mitigate against cases coming into country - we can restore much greater degree of normality. ""Decisions then about, eg, 2m v 1m are more possible. But first we must suppress/eradicate."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Hello Kitty boss says 'goodbye Kitty' aged 92,"Shintaro Tsuji has been at the helm of Sanrio for more than six decades The founder of the Japanese company that created Hello Kitty has announced he is stepping down as CEO aged 92. Shintaro Tsuji said he would hand over control of Sanrio to his 31-year-old grandson, Tomokuni Tsuji. It marks the first change in leadership in the company's six-decade history. Hello Kitty, a mouthless cartoon adorned with a trademark hair bow, has generated billions of dollars since its inception almost 50 years ago. The simple line-drawn image has appeared on merchandise including clothing, toys and stationery. It is targeted mostly at young children, but in recent years it has also proved popular with adults. Mr Tsuji will formally leave his role on 1 July. Analysis by Celia Hatton, Asia Pacific Editor Shintaro Tsuji started a gift company in the 1960s and quickly realised that the products featuring ""cute"" designs were his bestsellers. That led to the creation of Hello Kitty, who has since become an iconic Japanese character. But Kitty has competition: sales have been dropping inside Japan for years and Sanrio now depends on its increasingly fragile global business. So, Mr Tsuji's decision to step aside comes at a turning point for the company. In Japanese tradition, CEO founders strive to pass on their positions to family members. Mr Tsuji's son died of a heart attack in 2013, and so this is why his grandson is taking over. Tomokuni Tsuji has already pledged to transform the company and to drop outdated ideas. Let's hope he's not referring to Hello Kitty, who is older than the company's new leader. Tomokuni Tsuji, who is currently a senior managing director at Sanrio, will become the youngest CEO of a company listed on the Topix share index. He coincidentally shares a birthday with Hello Kitty on 1 November, according to the AFP news agency. But he is 14 years younger than the character itself. ""I want to transform the company to better respond to today's rapidly changing business environment,"" he told a press conference on Friday. Hello Kitty-branded products are sold around the world and its image has even featured on a bullet train There is even a Hello Kitty theme park in China Sanrio, whose business has been declining for several years, has been badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Annual net profits fell by 95% in the 2019/2020 fiscal year, according to figures published on Friday. Sales were also down 6.5 % on the previous year. Hello Kitty to be made into Hollywood film Japan unveils Hello Kitty-themed bullet train Meet Hello Kitty's biggest fan Hello Kitty-branded products are sold in 130 countries worldwide, with the range extending from prosecco to plimsolls. It is also licensed for amusement parks and cafÃ©s, while last year a Japanese railway firm splashed the image on its bullet train, painted in pink and white. Although the brand typifies the Japanese trend for ""kawaii"" or cuteness, the character itself is identified as British because when she was created in the 1970s British culture was fashionable in Japan.

The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has released new guidelines for Americans as restrictions around the country ease and people return to daily life. Director Dr Robert Redfield said the ""common sense"" guidance was meant to help people stay safe ""as communities open up and they begin to re-engage in daily life"". The recommendations include: There are other guidelines for large gatherings - like protests, rallies and concerts - as well. But the CDC guidance remains to social distance, practise good hand hygiene and follow local rules. Covid-19 response manager Dr Jay Butler told reporters: ""It's not intended to endorse any particular type of event but to be applicable to any type of event that might occur."" The new tips come as Covid-19 cases are on the rise in a number of states, though re-openings are underway nationwide. ""We know the pandemic is not over,"" Dr Butler said. ""The vast majority of Americans still have not been exposed to this virus."" Disinfect shopping carts, the guidelines say Film and television production can begin in California as early as today, officials have said, as long as local Covid-19 protocols are followed. It's unlikely that production will restart immediately. The Hollywood Reporter said crews are expected to get back to work by July or August. But what might the new Covid-19 workplace look like? An industry paper on protocols agreed upon by unions, guilds and employers listed masks, regular testing and staggered meal times as part of the new guidelines. Director Tyler Perry's studios had earlier released a proposal, which called for cast testing and self-isolation before turning up on set, as well as travelling on private jets to minimise risk and tests after any such travel,according to the Reporter,external. Travellers socially distance while in line at a screening checkpoint in Orlando, Florida US airports have seen the highest number of travellers this week since the start of the pandemic, the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reported. In April, airports saw a record low of just over 87,000 travellers in one day - compared to over two million at the same time last year. But on Monday, more than 430,000 people went through TSA checkpoints. Yesterday, that number surpassed 500,000 for the first time since March. The rise in US air travel comes while Covid-19 case counts are also on the rise in states across the country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still advises people to stay home and limit travel to prevent the spread of the virus. Allow Twitter content?

Ohio Health Director Dr Amy Acton, a key official responsible for the state's often-praised pandemic response, has resigned. Governor Mike DeWine has relied heavily on Acton's expertise. It was on her guidance that Ohio imposed early restrictions and became the first state to close schools. While Acton saw national praise for Ohio's quick response to the crisis, she also saw criticism from Ohio Republicans, who tried to limit her authority, and protesters who felt the lockdown measures were too strict. Her decision to close gyms was deemed to have violated the state's constitution, and a judge wrote that she ""acted in an impermissibly arbitrary, unreasonable, and oppressive manner"". DeWine, a Republican, has continued to defend Acton and the state's actions. He said on Thursday: ""I will always believe and know that many lives were saved because of her wise advice.""

The bond between mother and daughter is strong for many around the world - but none are thought to have graduated from medical school at the same time. And now, Cynthia Kudji and her daughter Jasmine are tackling the coronavirus pandemic together on the front line at the same hospital. The Ghanian-American doctors graduated a few weeks ago and have both been placed at LSU Health in Louisiana. ""It is like a dream come true,"" Cynthia told BBC Focus on Africa. ""My inspiration came from Jasmine. When you have a young child you aspire for them to be better than yourself. ""It meant so much having my daughter by my side as we went through this journey together."" The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged mothers who contract Covid-19  to continue breastfeeding their babies. Dr Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus said the WHO had studied the issue and the benefits of breastfeeding outweighed any risks of passing on the virus. ""We know that children are at relatively low risk of Covid-19, but are at high risk of numerous other diseases and conditions that breastfeeding prevents,"" he said at a briefing in Geneva. ""Based on the available evidence, the WHO's advice is that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of Covid-19. ""Mothers with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 should be encouraged to initiate and continue breastfeeding and not be separated from their infants unless the mother is too unwell,"" he said. Read more about breastfeeding and other questions asked by our readers and answered by BBC News Katy WatsonSouth America correspondent in Sao Palo President Jair Bolsonaro has opposed lockdowns and downplayed coronavirus The World Health Organization has warned that in some parts of Brazil, intensive care units are at a critical stage because of the high number of Covid-19 patients. Brazil is the second-worst affected country in the world, after the US, in terms of infections. Itâs on the brink of surpassing the UKâs death toll too - more than 40,000 people have now died in Brazil. There are clear hotspots in Brazil, especially in heavily populated areas. Thatâs according to Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme. Ryan said that while most intensive care units in the country were no more than around 80% full â and the health system was coping - some places had seen occupancy exceed 90% and were critical. He warned that Brazil still needed significant support to combat the virus. A baby baboon is among the West Bank zoo's new inhabitants Staff have been feeding and caring for the animals during lockdown There's been speculation that countries that have been under lockdown could see a baby boom over the next year as couples trapped at home together find ways to occupy the time. If so, humans wouldn't be the only ones. A tiny Palestinian zoo in the West Bank has had a baby boom of its own. Fifteen animals have born at Qalqilya zoo in the two months since it shut its doors to visitors - three times more than the normal number of births. One of the ostriches is rarely able to incubate her eggs, vet Sami Kahder explained, but this year she produced 11 eggs and built a nest. âBecause there werenât people around her, she was able to build a nest,â he told Reuters news agency. The monkeys are normally prone to miscarriage, he added, but now one baboon has given birth. This ostrich is among the zoo's occupants who were active during lockdown The zoo hopes visitors will want to come to see the newborns now restrictions have eased The London Coliseum, the largest theatre in the West End, is closed along with the rest of the UK capital's theatre district Theatres are ""running out"" of time and need urgent help from the UK government to stop the industry collapsing, says shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens. The Labour MP has written to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden asking for sector specific support, warning venues ""are going under"". Theatres, gig and comedy venues were ordered to shut in mid-March. Stevens says many cannot afford to reopen when restrictions are eased because of social distancing measures. She also says many actors, comedians and musicians have been excluded from Treasury support schemes, warning the prospect of no further income ""means large scale redundancies"". In response, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said many organisations have ""already benefited"" from government support. ""The UK government is
providing unprecedented financial support for the arts and culture through the
job retention scheme, a years' business rates holiday and more than
Â£200m emergency public funding,"" a DCMS spokesperson told BBC News. The DCMS added it is committed to opening arts and cultural institutions ""as soon as it
is safe to do so"". Earlier this week, Dowden said he would not ""stand by and see our world-leading position in arts and culture destroyed"". Dominic HughesHealth correspondent This video can not be played GP concerned for 'forgotten' non-Covid patients Covid-19 has transformed how family doctors across the UK work. GP Dr Debbie Noland, based in Liverpool, has been telling the BBC about how she has been adapting for a new reality. In between each appointment, Dr Noland must clean her consulting room and change her personal protective equipment (PPE). ""It's definitely far more challenging - and the job is challenging enough without the extra stress,"" she says. But the changes bring their own cost, with a much slower trickle of patients.

France has the fifth-highest death toll in the world and third-highest in Europe behind the UK and Italy. But, it is the 10th day in a row France has reported fewer than 100 daily deaths. As we've been reporting, another 202 people with coronavirus have died in the UK in a day. Each UK nation also reports its own Covid-19 death tolls.

The latest data shows: InEngland, a further 70 people died in hospitals after testing positive for the disease, taking the total to 27,860. InWales, a further 10 people have died with Covid-19. It takes the total number of deaths to 1,435, according to Public Health Wales. InScotland, the latest total death toll is now 2,442 - an increase of three.

All non-essential shops will beallowed to reopen in England from Monday, and councils have been outlining their plans to facilitate social distancing.They include: In Worcester, independent shops are being encouraged to operate on an appointment-only basis. ""Youâll also see hand sanitiser, one-way systems, social distancing signage as our stores get ready to open,"" said Samantha McCarthy the project and marketing manager for Worcester Business Improvement District. Asked whether the pandemic might kill the high street, she said: âI donât think it's the death. I think we were always going to evolve. The only thing this virus has done is push us to do it faster.â This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to keep safe while shopping Non-essential retailersin Northern Ireland have reopened today. Michelle Greeves, manager of Victoria Square shopping centre in Belfast, said stores had been planning how to open safely for weeks. ""We all live for retail and we've missed it so much, we've missed being able to do what we know we do well,"" she said.

This includes buses, trains, aircraft and ferries - all to stop coronavirus from spreading. Very young children, disabled people and those with breathing difficulties will be exempt. But if you wear your face covering incorrectly, you could actually be putting yourself more at risk from coronavirus. In Japan, some customers have donned plastic facemasks in bars When people in the UK wereasked last month,externalwhat they were most looking forward to post-lockdown, only seeing friends and family ranked higher than a night out. The government has said the hospitality sector, which includes pubs and bars, could reopen ""no earlier than 4 July"". But can nightlife in the UK ever conform to social distancing rules?

Protests threat to Churchill statue shameful - PM,"Protecting a statue of Winston Churchill from potential vandalism by boarding it up is ""absurd and shameful"", the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said the war-time leader expressed opinions that were ""unacceptable to us today"" but remained a hero for saving the country from ""fascist and racist tyranny"". Protesters daubed ""was a racist"" on the Parliament Square tribute last weekend. Labour said the PM should address the concerns of those demonstrating. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told the BBC he wanted to hear that Mr Johnson ""understands the deep hurt and anger that black people in our country feel"". Ina series of tweets,external, Mr Johnson said monuments like Churchill's were put up by previous generations as he urged people to ""stay away"" from demonstrations amid the coronavirus pandemic. ""We cannot try to edit or censor our past,"" he wrote of moves to remove tributes to historical figures. ""We cannot pretend to have a different history."" The stories behind the statues targeted in protests Penny Lane signs in Liverpool defaced over slavery claims Calls to remove 'racist' Gandhi statue in Leicester The statue in London's Parliament Square was boxed up ahead of a Friday evening Black Lives Matter protest in Westminster. A demonstration planned for Saturday was brought forward by a day because of fears there could be violent clashes with far-right groups. Leaders of the march urged those in attendance to keep the demonstration ""peaceful"" and not to join any anti-racism rallies planned for the weekend. Hundreds protested at Trafalgar Square in London on Friday evening Hundreds of campaigners surrounded Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square after walking from Hyde Park, as around two dozen police officers watched on. Other monuments have been removed ahead of separate protests planned over the weekend, while the Cenotaph war memorial, in nearby Whitehall, has also been covered.

Demonstrations have been taking place across the world followingthe death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month. This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson says it is ""absurd and wrong"" that statues must be covered to protect them Mr Johnson said that, while he understood ""legitimate feelings of outrage"" at Mr Floyd's death, the ""only responsible course of action"" was to ""stay away from these protests"". The prime minister said the demonstrations had been ""hijacked by extremists intent on violence"". Mr Johnson added that whatever people's feelings about the cause they should not support a demonstration which ""in all probability"" would ""end in deliberate and calculated violence"". Boarding around the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square was erected overnight The Metropolitan Police said it was ready to tackle violence directed at officers or property following disorder at anti-racism protests last weekend. Commander Bas Javid said both Black Lives Matter protestors and right-wing groups would be dealt with using the same tactics but urged all parties to stay at home and make their voices heard in other ways. He added it was accepted ""a very, very small minority"" were intent on engaging in violence last weekend but the force ""absolutely don't condone... violence of any kind"". Images appeared to show a protester climb the Cenotaph and attempt to set a flag alight While Churchill is credited with helping lead the Allies to victory in World War Two, some critics accuse him ofracism because of comments he made about Indians. The Grade-II listed bronze tribute to the former home secretary and prime minister was installed in 1973 at the north-east corner of Parliament Square, opposite the Carriage Gates entrance to the Palace of Westminster. ""It shows Churchill as a powerful, stocky, figure in a naval overcoat leaning informally on a stick and gazing, somewhat defiantly, towards the Houses of Parliament,""according to Historic England,external. This video can not be played Britainâs wartime leader divided opinion in his own lifetime, and remains a divisive figure today Winston Churchill, who lived between 30 November 1874 and 24 January 1965, is often named among Britain's greatest-ever people but for some he remains an intensely controversial figure. Despite his leading the country through the darkest hours of World War Two and being prime minister twice, critics point to his comments on race and some of his actions during both world wars. Churchill told thePalestine Royal Commission,externalthat he did not admit wrong had been done to Native Americans or aboriginal Australians as ""a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place"". His supporters argue that he was by no means the only person to hold these sorts of views during the period. He also advocated the use of chemical weapons, ""I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes,""he wrote in a memo,external.

"Paper faces backlash for headline on Rowling's exThe Sun says its article, and headline ""I slapped JK and I'm not sorry"", weren't meant to glorify abuse.UK","The Sun said it had not intended to ""glorify"" domestic violence in its interview with JK Rowling's former husband Jorge Arantes The Sun newspaper has faced a backlash from domestic abuse charities for an article in which JK Rowling's ex said ""I'm not sorry"" for slapping her. As part of a blogaddressing criticism of her comments on transgender people, the Harry Potter author said her first marriage had been ""violent"". Jorge Arantestold the Sun,externalhe slapped Rowling when she left him - but added ""there was not sustained abuse"". The newspaper said it had not intended to ""enable or glorify"" domestic abuse. Critics have accused the author of being transphobic for her response to an article about ""people who menstruate"". Rowling said her personal experience of domestic abuse and sexual assault, and her concerns about protecting safe spaces for women, were some reasons why she spoke out about transgender issues. The Sun's front page headline on Friday was: ""I slapped JK and I'm not sorry"". Mr Arantes, who shares a daughter with Rowling from their marriage, told the paper: ""Yes. It is true I slapped her. But I didn't abuse her."" When asked about his response to her claims - which included that the relationship was violent - he said: ""If she says that, that's up to her. It's not true I hit her."" JK Rowling responds to trans tweets criticism Eddie Redmayne criticises JK Rowling trans tweets School renames Rowling house over trans tweets Nicole Jacobs, England's domestic abuse commissioner, wrote to the newspaper to say she was ""deeply concerned"" about the story. ""It is unacceptable that the Sun has chosen to repeat and magnify the voice of someone who openly admits to violence against a partner,"" she said. The charity Women's Aid said the newspaper's front page had a ""negative impact"", and added it was in conversation with the Sun about reflecting the voices of survivors of domestic abuse. ""Headlines matter,"" it added. Some 20 anti-domestic abuse campaigners - including the chief executive of Women's Aid - wrote an open letter calling on the paper to apologise. ""Responding to a woman disclosing her experiences of domestic abuse and sexual assault by giving a platform to her perpetrator to trivialise the abuse he subjected her to is irresponsible and dangerous,""the letter said,external. Press regulator Ipso said it had received more than 500 complaints about the Sun article. A spokeswoman for the Sun,externalsaid: ""It was certainly not our intention to 'enable' or 'glorify' domestic abuse, our intention was to expose a perpetrator's total lack of remorse. Our sympathies are always with the victims."" The spokeswoman added that the tabloid had a ""long history of standing up for abused women"", and ""over the we have empowered countless victims to come forward and seek help"". Politicians have also criticised the Sun's coverage. The Liberal Democrats called on the Sun to donate the revenue made from Friday's newspaper to Refuge - while Labour's shadow minister for domestic abuse and safeguarding, Jess Phillips, said ""doubt and disbelief"" benefited perpetrators of abuse.

PPE failings identified by National Audit Office,"The availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health and care staff both before and during the Covid-19 pandemic has become one of the most intensely debated issues of the crisis. Doctors, nurses and care staff in many settings warned that supplies were running low and they were concerned about their safety. The National Audit Office (NAO) has now publishedthe first official assessment,externalof the supply and distribution of PPE in England by government organisations. It highlights shortcomings in the system, though the Department of Health and Social Care has said that parts of the report are ""misleading"". The NAO report, on the preparedness of the NHS and social care in England, states that the only stockpile available to meet increased demand for PPE in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak was the one built up in anticipation of a pandemic flu crisis. Crucially it did not contain gowns or visors.  According to the NAO, the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) recommended stockpiling gowns in June 2019. The Department of Health told the NAO that ""procurement of gowns was planned for early 2020"". Coronavirus: Has the NHS got enough PPE? Coronavirus: Concern over protective kit guidance change The NAO report looks at the assumptions in Whitehall modelling for PPE requirements in a ""worst case scenario"". Between mid March and early May, it says, the amount of face masks and clinical waste bags for use in health settings distributed from central stocks exceeded the modelled requirement but for all other items such as gowns, eye protectors and aprons it was lower. For social care, the items distributed were all less than the modelled requirement, and with gloves and eye protectors it was below 10%. The NAO adds that feedback from local providers revealed a large majority reporting that the PPE issue was having ""a high or significant disruptive impact in their area across health and social care services"". The Department of Health's argument to the NAO was that NHS and social care organisations could purchase their own PPE to top up what was sent out from central stocks. A spokesperson said: ""We have delivered over 1.7 billion pieces of PPE and we continue to ensure supplies reach the frontline. ""The modelled PPE requirements presented in this report are theoretical worst case estimates - it is misleading to compare them to figures on centrally procured PPE which do not account for equipment supplied through other routes or existing local stocks."" The report paints a picture of confusion over the extent to which local NHS and care organisations were responsible for securing their own supplies of PPE at a time of global shortages in an unprecedented pandemic. Central government opened up a dedicated central supply route in early April but for a while officials struggled to secure adequate stocks. On May 1, the Department of Health wrote to NHS trusts saying PPE was being centrally managed and that hospitals should only do their own sourcing from new local suppliers. By the middle of that month, says the NAO, central supplies of PPE were meeting demand from the health and care sectors. Public Accounts Committee chair Meg Hiller said the government had ""squandered the last opportunity to add to the central PPE stockpile, even after the NHS had gone to the highest level of alert."" She added: ""Care homes were at the back of the queue for both PPE and testing so only got a small fraction of what they needed from central government. Residents and staff were an afterthought yet again: out of sight and out of mind, with devastating consequences."" The PPE debate wont go away. The BBC'srecent Panorama investigationhighlighted some of the issues considered in the NAO report. It may take a while for the full story to emerge including an assessment of how the UK authorities handled PPE procurement at a time when every leading healthcare system was struggling to acquire supplies.  The NAO report is certainly an interesting early contribution to that debate. 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? TESTING:Who can get a test and how?

Post-Brexit checks on EU imports to be phased in,"The new rules will apply to goods coming into the UK from the European Union Checks on EU goods coming into the UK will be phased in next year to give firms ""time to adjust"", as ministers formally ruled out extending the Brexit transition period beyond 31 December. The UK had committedto introduce full import controls,externalon EU goods in January. But coronavirus has forced a rethink, with firms able to defer customs forms and tariff payments for six months and some physical checks delayed to July. Business welcomed what ministers said was a ""pragmatic and flexible"" step. But, in response, the EU said it would implement full checks on UK exports at the start of 2021. The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said the EU would not see the UK's move as a ""concession but rather a pragmatic move by a country that's not ready to implement full checks by then"".

The UK left the European Union at the end of January, but the transition period - during which existing trading rules and membership of the single market and customs union apply - lasts until the end of the year. Opposition MPs have been pushing for it to be extended,with the Scottish and Welsh first ministerswarning that exiting the current trading arrangements in just over six months time would be ""extraordinarily reckless"" given the economic damage and uncertainty caused by the coronavirus epidemic. Ministers from the two devolved administrations withdrew from a scheduled conference call with UK ministers on Friday evening in protest at their decision to rule out a delay, saying their views had been ""dismissed"". What are the sticking points in the trade talks? Border delays 'could cause fresh food problems' Trade deal still possible with EU, says UK minister Earlier, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said he had ""formally confirmed"" to the EU that the transition period will not be extended, adding that the ""moment"" for such a move had ""now passed"". However, there will be an about turn, in the short term at least, on the checks carried out on imports. In February, Mr Gove said full import controls were ""necessary"" from 1 January to keep UK borders ""safe and secure"" and to collect the appropriate taxes. Under the revised plan,external, checks on goods entering Britain will be phased-in in three stages up to the summer of 2021, regardless of whether a deal is done with the EU or not. From 1 January, there will be checks on controlled substances, such as alcohol and tobacco, while standard goods, such as clothes and electronics, will be subject to basic customs procedures. But firms will have up to six months to complete customs declarations and pay relevant tariffs From 1 April, those importing products of animal origin, including meat, milk or egg products, will have to pre-notify officials and provide the relevant health paperwork By 1 July, all goods will be liable for relevant tariffs and customs declarations as well as full ""safety and security"" declarations. From this moment, there will be an increase in physical checks on livestock, plants and other sanitary and phytosanitary products at ports and other entry points New border facilities will be built in order to process the required checks either at ports, or where there is not enough space, at ""inland sites"". Ministers said they would consult with ports about what new infrastructure was needed and where it should be located. The proposals only apply to rules on imports, with checks on exports to the EU being determined by Brussels. Mr Gove said the arrangements would be introduced in a way that gives businesses affected by coronavirus ""time to adjust"" but conceded ""more work"" was needed to ensure the UK was ready. ""From 1 January we will be outside the customs union and outside the single market so it's appropriate we have checks on goods coming in to the UK,"" he said. ""But it also appropriate that we take account of what's happening with the coronavirus. And we want to make sure business has an opportunity to adjust in a pragmatic and flexible way."" Firms are expected to have to fill in 200 million extra customs declarations every year and industry experts have said an extra 50,000 customs officials will need to be hired to deal with the extra paperwork. Ministers have announced Â£50m in extra funding to support the new customs infrastructure, for IT systems and for recruiting and training new customs brokers and freight forwarders. Michael Gove was a prominent figure in the Leave campaign, and in charge of preparations for a no-deal Brexit. It was no surprise, then, that he announced in February that full border controls would be implemented at the end of the transition period. But now the new system will be ""phased in"" - with some companies having up to six months to complete customs declarations. The government maintains that this is a ""pragmatic"" way to help businesses which have struggled under the coronavirus yoke. But his critics say that it is a sign of Mr Gove's dogmatism, not pragmatism - that he is determined to end, rather than extend, the transition period. Critics in his own party are far more concerned about what they see as a lack of preparedness. Only today did the government commit to building new border facilities. That, in itself, may be a further sign that trade talks with the EU are not making good progress. A leading figure involved in the negotiations last week conceded that a completely tariff-free deal may elude them. And some say the government, practically rather than philosophically, isn't yet fully prepared for the reality of life outside the EU. The Freight Transport Association said ministers had listened to its ""concerns"" while business lobby group, the CBI, said the move was ""pragmatic and sensible"". ""It will be welcomed by Britain's manufacturing and food businesses, which simply aren't ready for chaotic changes with our biggest trading partner at the end of the year,"" said its deputy director general Josh Hardie. The CBI also welcomed news thatBoris Johnson will meet the presidents of the European Commission, Council and Parliament remotely on Monday, as attempts to secure a trade deal with the EU are stepped up. The negotiating teams have also agreed to ""an intensified timetable"" for July after the fourth round of negotiations last week failed to reach a breakthrough.

Shops cut number of special offers in lockdown,"Toilet roll was not the only thing to disappear from supermarket shelves at the start of lockdown. Buy-one-get-one-free deals were pulled too. There was a 15% fall in the frequency of promotions during the first month of lockdown, research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found. This, in part, led to a 2.4% rise in the price of groceries in one month. Researchers said this was the equivalent of price increases expected for a whole year. There was also an 8% fall in the variety of grocery products on the shelves during lockdown, according to the research funded by the Nuffield Foundation, which campaigns on social policy. ""This, independently of price rises, will have a negative impact on consumers,"" the authors of the report said. Shoppers bulk bought various essentials just prior to, and at the start of, lockdown. It prompted a number of retailers to put limits on the number of items being bought, ranging from individual products such as toilet roll and pasta to the entire basket of items available via supermarket websites. Major supermarkets introduced limits on the number of in-demand items people could buy, such as toilet paper TheIFS research,externaltracked price data of groceries such as food, drink, toiletries, cleaning products and pet food. It found prices were 2.4% higher in the first month of lockdown, a rate more than 10 times higher than in preceding months and unprecedented in recent years. Since then, prices had fallen slightly, but they still remained more than 2% higher than before lockdown, the report said. ""There was more grocery inflation in one month than we often see in a year,"" said Martin O'Connell, co-author of the report. ""Higher prices and reduced variety have persisted in the following weeks. At a time when many households are subject to reductions in their income, higher prices for food, drinks and household goods will further feed into squeezed household budgets."" Half of this increase was the result of fewer promotions, such as buy-one-get-one-free deals and money off discounts. The IFS said was not recorded inofficial inflation figures, to be updated next week. What is the UK's inflation rate? Could you have to pay your bank to save money? The fall in promotions was different to during last recession, when consumers bought more goods that were on sale as their own finances were squeezed. This time, almost all households saw their grocery bills increase. The researchers also said that investors would have expected the coronavirus crisis to lead to prices falling, rather than rising. ""At a time when financial markets expect the Covid-19 pandemic to be a disinflationary shock, this increase in the price of groceries, which was experienced by almost all households and in almost all product categories, suggests policymakers nonetheless should remain vigilant about the prospect of higher inflation, at least for some goods and services,"" said co-author Xavier Jaravel.

"Positive virus tests falling in England, ONS estimates","The number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England is continuing to fall, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics. Around one in 1,700 people were infected between 25 May and 7 June, or 33,000 individuals, compared to one in 1,000 before then. The figures are based on 20,000 tests on people in private households. Everyone in the study was tested whether they had symptoms or not. The ONS figures,externalare thought to give a good picture of the proportion of people infected with the virus in the community - but they do not include infections in hospitals and care homes. However, there are wide margins of error around the figures because they are based on small numbers of people testing positive. As of 11 June, there were 202 more deaths reported in the UK, taking the total number of deaths with a positive test for Covid-19 to 41,481 since the epidemic began. In this analysis, 19,933 people from 9,179 households carried out their own swab tests of their throat and nose, which look for the presence of the virus. Just 11 individuals from eight households tested positive for coronavirus, allowing statisticians to come up with estimates for the whole population. At the end of April, the percentage of the population in England testing positive was 0.4% - now it's less than 0.1%, the ONS says. That means an average of 31,600 new infections occurring per week in private households, or 4,500 per day. The ONS analysis is part of a long-term study to track coronavirus in the general population with researchers from the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester and Public Health England. How does contact tracing work in England? Contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix' Whatever happened to the NHS contact-tracing app? The NHS test and trace scheme in England identified 31,000 close contactsfrom 8,000 people testing positive during its first week of operation, up to 3 June. But only two-thirds of cases shared details of their close contacts so they could be followed up and asked to self-isolate for 14 days. There is no new data on how many people have already had the virus, using antibody tests of blood samples from people in households. This is estimated to bearound 7% in England as of 24 May.

UK backtracks on full EU border checks post-Brexit,"The new rules will apply to goods coming into the UK from the European Union Checks on EU goods coming into the UK will be phased in next year to give firms ""time to adjust"", as ministers formally ruled out extending the Brexit transition period beyond 31 December. The UK had committedto introduce full import controls,externalon EU goods in January. But coronavirus has forced a rethink, with firms able to defer customs forms and tariff payments for six months and some physical checks delayed to July. Business welcomed what ministers said was a ""pragmatic and flexible"" step. But, in response, the EU said it would implement full checks on UK exports at the start of 2021. The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said the EU would not see the UK's move as a ""concession but rather a pragmatic move by a country that's not ready to implement full checks by then"".

The UK left the European Union at the end of January, but the transition period - during which existing trading rules and membership of the single market and customs union apply - lasts until the end of the year. Opposition MPs have been pushing for it to be extended,with the Scottish and Welsh first ministerswarning that exiting the current trading arrangements in just over six months time would be ""extraordinarily reckless"" given the economic damage and uncertainty caused by the coronavirus epidemic. Ministers from the two devolved administrations withdrew from a scheduled conference call with UK ministers on Friday evening in protest at their decision to rule out a delay, saying their views had been ""dismissed"". What are the sticking points in the trade talks? Border delays 'could cause fresh food problems' Trade deal still possible with EU, says UK minister Earlier, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said he had ""formally confirmed"" to the EU that the transition period will not be extended, adding that the ""moment"" for such a move had ""now passed"". However, there will be an about turn, in the short term at least, on the checks carried out on imports. In February, Mr Gove said full import controls were ""necessary"" from 1 January to keep UK borders ""safe and secure"" and to collect the appropriate taxes. Under the revised plan,external, checks on goods entering Britain will be phased-in in three stages up to the summer of 2021, regardless of whether a deal is done with the EU or not. From 1 January, there will be checks on controlled substances, such as alcohol and tobacco, while standard goods, such as clothes and electronics, will be subject to basic customs procedures. But firms will have up to six months to complete customs declarations and pay relevant tariffs From 1 April, those importing products of animal origin, including meat, milk or egg products, will have to pre-notify officials and provide the relevant health paperwork By 1 July, all goods will be liable for relevant tariffs and customs declarations as well as full ""safety and security"" declarations. From this moment, there will be an increase in physical checks on livestock, plants and other sanitary and phytosanitary products at ports and other entry points New border facilities will be built in order to process the required checks either at ports, or where there is not enough space, at ""inland sites"". Ministers said they would consult with ports about what new infrastructure was needed and where it should be located. The proposals only apply to rules on imports, with checks on exports to the EU being determined by Brussels. Mr Gove said the arrangements would be introduced in a way that gives businesses affected by coronavirus ""time to adjust"" but conceded ""more work"" was needed to ensure the UK was ready. ""From 1 January we will be outside the customs union and outside the single market so it's appropriate we have checks on goods coming in to the UK,"" he said. ""But it also appropriate that we take account of what's happening with the coronavirus. And we want to make sure business has an opportunity to adjust in a pragmatic and flexible way."" Firms are expected to have to fill in 200 million extra customs declarations every year and industry experts have said an extra 50,000 customs officials will need to be hired to deal with the extra paperwork. Ministers have announced Â£50m in extra funding to support the new customs infrastructure, for IT systems and for recruiting and training new customs brokers and freight forwarders. Michael Gove was a prominent figure in the Leave campaign, and in charge of preparations for a no-deal Brexit. It was no surprise, then, that he announced in February that full border controls would be implemented at the end of the transition period. But now the new system will be ""phased in"" - with some companies having up to six months to complete customs declarations. The government maintains that this is a ""pragmatic"" way to help businesses which have struggled under the coronavirus yoke. But his critics say that it is a sign of Mr Gove's dogmatism, not pragmatism - that he is determined to end, rather than extend, the transition period. Critics in his own party are far more concerned about what they see as a lack of preparedness. Only today did the government commit to building new border facilities. That, in itself, may be a further sign that trade talks with the EU are not making good progress. A leading figure involved in the negotiations last week conceded that a completely tariff-free deal may elude them. And some say the government, practically rather than philosophically, isn't yet fully prepared for the reality of life outside the EU. The Freight Transport Association said ministers had listened to its ""concerns"" while business lobby group, the CBI, said the move was ""pragmatic and sensible"". ""It will be welcomed by Britain's manufacturing and food businesses, which simply aren't ready for chaotic changes with our biggest trading partner at the end of the year,"" said its deputy director general Josh Hardie. The CBI also welcomed news thatBoris Johnson will meet the presidents of the European Commission, Council and Parliament remotely on Monday, as attempts to secure a trade deal with the EU are stepped up. The negotiating teams have also agreed to ""an intensified timetable"" for July after the fourth round of negotiations last week failed to reach a breakthrough.

Black actor's statue covered in 'corrosive liquid',"It is not yet known whether the statue has been permanently damaged A statue of a Jamaican poet, playwright and actor has been covered with what appears to be a corrosive substance. The monument to Alfred Fagon in St Pauls, Bristol, was erected in 1987 on the first anniversary of his death. Mr Fagon was the first black person to have a statue erected in their honour in the city. It was reported on Thursday to police, who said it was being investigated as criminal damage and inquiries were continuing. The statue was erected in green space off Grosvenor Road on the first anniversary of Alfred Fagon's death in 1987 Avon and Somerset Police said it was liaising with Bristol City Council to establish ownership of the statue and to determine if it had suffered any permanent damage. It comes after Black Lives Matter anti-racism protesters tore down a statue ofslave trader Edward Colstonin Bristol on Sunday. Since that statue was toppled several other statues around the UK of people linked to the slave trade have been removed, or it has been announced that they may be taken down. Mr Fagon's sister-in-law, Judy Malone-Fagon, said if it was vandalism, it was ""ignorant and idiotic"". ""It's the only statue to a black person in Bristol, who would do something like that?"" she said. ""It's shocking. Alfred didn't do anything to anyone but he would definitely have laughed at it, he was so much bigger and better than that."" Anton Phillips, an actor and friend of Mr Fagon, said following the ""dumping"" of the Colston statue it ""doesn't surprise me"". ""My memory of Alfred is he quite liked to laugh at things,"" he said. ""So I don't think he would have been angry, he would have laughed his head off about the absurdity of it and might have written something about it."" He was born in Jamaica in 1937, the third of nine brothers and two sisters. At the age of 18 he came to England to work on the railways before joining the army before moving to Bristol to work as a welder in the 1960s. One of his first plays, No Soldiers in St Pauls, explored the social tension between the police and the black community in 1970s Bristol. His final role was in the BBC's Fighting Back, set in St Pauls. He died suddenly from a heart attack on 28 August 1986 outside his flat in Camberwell, London. At the time police claimed they were unable to identify him and he was given a pauper's funeral. The annual Alfred Fagon Award was named after him and is for playwrights of Caribbean or African descent, resident in the UK.

"Fawlty Towers episode removed from UKTVAn episode of the popular British sitcom is pulled because it contains ""racial slurs"".","John Cleese, who plays Basil Fawlty, has said the move is ""stupid"" John Cleese has laid into the ""cowardly and gutless"" BBC after an episode of Fawlty Towers was temporarily removed from a BBC-owned streaming platform. A 1975 episode titled The Germans was taken off UKTV's streaming service because it contains ""racial slurs"". In it, the Major uses highly offensive language, and Cleese's Basil Fawlty declares ""don't mention the war"". UKTV said it expected to reinstate the show with ""extra guidance"" in ""the coming days"". Cleese wrote on Twitter,external: ""The BBC is now run by a mixture of marketing people and petty bureaucrats."" He added: ""I would have hoped that someone at the BBC would understand that there are two ways of making fun of human behaviour. ""One is to attack it directly.

UKTV also operates channels including Gold, and many of its channels and its digital player were taken over by the BBC's commercial arm BBC Studios last year. A BBC spokesman declined to comment. A UKTV statement said it would update the episode with guidance and contextual information in line with similar warnings on other classic comedy titles.

According toThe Guardian,external, prior to the Covid-19 lockdown, the Evening Standard's circulation was about 800,000 daily copies in the capital, but it was struggling due to an industry-wide decline in advertising revenues. Due to its reliance on readers using public transport, the Evening Standard was reported to have distributed just over 423,000 copies a day in April, after the nation went into lockdown. Osborne's replacement, Sheffield, will remain director of a female news brand she launched called This Much I Know, and will be ""tasked with making it a digital first operation"" added Rajan. ""That's a extremely difficult challenge for a title so heavily dependent on print for its income,"" he tweeted.

Trump told to back off over Seattle protest zone,"This video can not be played The area taken over by activists has been called Chaz, short for Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone State authorities in the north-western US state of Washington have hit back after President Donald Trump threatened to ""take back"" a police-free district controlled by protesters in Seattle. Governor Jay Inslee said Mr Trump should stay out of the state's business, and Seattle's mayor said any invasion of the city would be illegal. Police abandoned a precinct there on Monday after days of clashes. Mr Trump said the area had been overtaken by ""domestic terrorists"". Since police withdrew, demonstrations in the area have been largely peaceful. It has been called Chaz, an abbreviation of Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Hundreds of people have been gathering there to demonstrate, hear speeches and attend events. Is Trump in trouble for his stance on race? US military chief sorry for joining Trump walk Seven solutions to US police problems The protests in Seattle, Washington began in response to last month's death in police custody of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. President Trump, who has pushed states to take firm action against protesters, has meanwhile outlined proposals for reforming police, including greater funding for training and national guidelines on the use of force. However, he dismissed calls for defunding the police as an ""extreme agenda"". Such a measure involves budgets being allocated directly to communities rather than law enforcement. Hundreds of protesters have gathered in the Chaz The area around East Precinct in Seattle became a battleground between protesters and police in the past two weeks, leading the governor to send in the National Guard and for the mayor to impose a curfew. During the violence, demonstrators threw missiles at police, cars were torched and looting broke out, according to local media. At the weekend, Seattle police used tear gas and flash bangs to disperse protesters. Members of the city council rebuked the police department, accusing them of heavy-handed tactics. Then on Monday, the mayor ordered barricades to be removed near the precinct and the police building was boarded up. Since then protesters have taken over a zone spanning about six blocks of Capitol Hill, a hub of the city's trendy arts scene that has been gentrified in recent years as tech workers drive up property prices. Protesters have hung a sign over the Seattle Police Department's now-closed East Precinct Their demands include ""defunding"" the police - reducing funding to spend more on health and other community services - better disciplinary policies for police and the dropping of criminal charges against protesters. ""My grandparents marched and they were scared of getting dogs on them and tear gas,"" said 15-year-old protester Francis Vann, quoted by the Seattle Times newspaper. ""Tear gas isn't going to hurt me, isn't going to stop me. I'm young. I just really want a change."" Artist Kimisha Turner told AFP: ""I want my son to see that everybody out here cares about him and his life. Especially after so many weeks of protests and everything it just feels really good to be part of something that's really positive and peaceful."" Local media describe a festival-like atmosphere, with poetry readings, music and movie nights. Free fizzy water, snacks, sunscreen and hand sanitiser are available. In a series of tweets, the Republican president lashed out at liberal Democratic leaders in the north-western US state of Washington and its most populous city of Seattle. ""Take back your city NOW,"" Mr Trump wrote on Thursday. ""If you don't do it, I will."" Protesters in the Chaz have created a memorial of George Floyd and others In another tweet, he said ""Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle"", saying Washington Governor Jay Inslee was ""looking 'the fool'"". Mr Inslee tweeted back: ""A man who is totally incapable of governing should stay out of Washington state's business."" Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan defended the right to protest and told President Trump: ""Make us all safe. Go back to your bunker."" ""The threat to invade Seattle, to divide and incite violence in our city, is not only unwelcome, it would be illegal,"" she added. Earlier this month, when protests were spreading across the US, Mr Trump threatened to send in the US Army if state governors - who oversee law and order - were unable to guarantee safety and secure property on their streets. This would involve invoking the Insurrection Act, a 19th Century law which includes details of circumstances when the government in Washington DC can intervene without state authorisation. Trump threatens to send in army Can President Trump deploy the military? Trump to restart rallies on key slavery date The act says the approval of governors is not required when the president determines the situation in a state makes it impossible to enforce US laws, or when citizens' rights are threatened. This law was last invoked in 1992 during riots in Los Angeles following the acquittal of four police officers charged with assaulting black motorist Rodney King, but on that occasion the governor of California requested help. The law was used throughout the 1950s and 60s during the civil rights era by three different presidents. On some of these occasions there were objections from state governors. Police say they want to reopen the precinct and it is unclear how long the autonomous zone will remain. At a news conference on Wednesday, Assistant Chief Deanna Nollette said the police department had been abandoned because of threats that it would be vandalised or burned. She said the protesters' barricades were intimidating some residents. Police Chief Carmen Best posted a video message,externalto officers in which she said the police withdrawal ""seems like an insult to you and our community"". On Thursday afternoon the police chief said claims that citizens and businesses were being extorted in the zone were not true and had been based on anecdotal evidence from news and social media. Ms Best said call response times in the area served by East Precinct are normally between 5-18 minutes, but are now taking almost an hour, reports local Komo News. She said this means police are not able to respond to reports of assaults, rapes and robberies. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

Dominic HughesHealth correspondent Full PPE, ""red zones"" and cleaning the room between patients are now part of everyday practice. Covid-19 has transformed how GPs work - from having to wear full PPE instead of ordinary clothes, to seeing a huge decline in the number of patients they are seeing. We've been looking at how one practice in Liverpool has adapted. Local Democracy Reporting Service Places of worship and indoor venues are being lined up as possible places where at-risk people could receive their free flu vaccinations in the autumn. Bedford Borough Councilâs,externalhealth and wellbeing board heard that public health officials were looking at how to give people their annual jabs while everyone has to stay socially distant. The board also looked at how to convince people to get a flu jab, and other immunisations, during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Dr Nicola Smith, who chairs the new NHS clinical commissioning group covering Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes, said the health system is geared up but added: ""Itâs about convincing the public to get their vaccinations done. It is a really big thing and we will all be behind it."" This video can not be played A poem written by a well-known poet has been animated by a team of about 20 students working from home. Matt Harvey, from Dartington in Devon, wrote his piece âHi Coronavirus Wathaâ about six weeks ago. Students from the Falmouth School of Art put together a team of animators to bring it to life. Could Covid-19 have been here earlier than we thought? My experience of testing positive for coronavirus antibodies clearly struck a nerve. Many of you responded with your own experiences of having Covid-like symptoms - some as far back as November -and urged me to investigate further. What has helped you get through lockdown? With many people stuck inside for such a long time, we've been finding out how people have kept themselves busy and coped with the change. Laura Evans told us how social media became ""absolutely invaluable"" to her persona as the ""St Ives Mermaid"",  while Sam Corsfield saw it as an opportunity to educate people about homegrown vegetables. This video can not be played Local Democracy Reporting Service Hertfordshire County Council paid almost Â£2m for vital personal protective equipment (PPE) in April, as the price of face masks and disposable gloves soared during the peak of the pandemic. Thousands of pieces of PPE are now being provided to care homes and front-line council workers by the council every day. It has emerged that in April the cost of items including masks, goggles, gloves and aprons to the county council topped Â£1.9m and at times it was having to pay up to Â£1.75 for a face mask â items that had been just 20p in December. Director of adult social care, Iain MacBeath, said following the announcement of government funding, the county council had been making PPE available to care homes throughout the county, either by supplying directly or reimbursing their costs. And that has meant the bulk purchases made by the county council have kept prices relatively low and ensured availability. The amount of PPE being supplied to care homes has now increased to 25,000 items a day and within three months the councilâs expenditure on it is expected to reach up to Â£9m, despite prices having normalised. The most deprived parts of England and Wales have been hit twice as hard by coronavirus as wealthier areas, theOffice for National Statistics said,external. Urban areas were markedly worse affected than rural areas. And London had significantly more deaths from coronavirus per 100,000 people than any other region. Mortality rates are ""normally higher in more deprived areas"" and coronavirus appeared to be ""increasing this effect"", an ONS statistician said. In England, once you adjust for the age of population, there were 128 deaths involving Covid-19 per 100,000 people in the population in the most deprived areas. The least deprived areas saw less than half that rate (60 deaths per 100,000) in March, April and May. What has helped you get through lockdown? While some people have been cut off from their family for months, others have had far more time to spend with each other.

Known only as ""The Hat"", the man has left various sculptures and paintings at charity shops and pubs in the Woodbridge area of Suffolk. His latest work - panels showing the Union Jack and images of the virus - was left at Butley village telephone box. No-one knows who the artist is as he simply leaves a note signed ""The Hat"". More than 600 patients have now been successfully treated for coronavirus at North Yorkshire's hospitals and allowed to go home, it's been revealed. Of those, more than 500 were cared for at York or Scarborough hospitals, while 125 people have been successfully treated at Harrogate Hospital after being diagnosed with Covid-19. York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which runs York and Scarborough hospitals, says reaching this milestone has taken ""an amazing, dedicated and resilient team"". Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has saidhe will be ""ready to take action"" to help the UK economy weather the coronavirus crisis. He was speaking after figures showed the country's economy shrank by 20.4% in April - the largest monthly contraction on record - as the country spent its first full month in lockdown. ""We are still very much in the midst of this,"" Mr Bailey said. But he said the figure was ""pretty much in line"" with what the bank expected. ""Obviously it's a dramatic and big number, but actually it's not a surprising number,"" he said. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalsaid April's ""historic"" fall affected virtually all areas of activity, as large parts of the economy remained shut to battle the pandemic. Katy LewisBBC News Online Pastor Peter Nembhard thought he was going to die when he was admitted to hospital with coronavirus at the beginning of April. The 52-year-old from Grays, near Basildon, was placed on a Covid-19 ward on 2 April after testing positive and was put on a ventilator. ""There was one point that I had lost hope, as I thought I was going to die,"" he said. ""I will never forget one particular nurse, Vanya Roach, who was like an angel to me. I felt as if god sent her directly to help me fight this. ""Vanya took the time to explain exactly what was happening; she sat down and fed me and really helped me through my fight."" Ms Roach, a staff nurse, said: ""Iâm so pleased he has recovered and is doing well. He had such a great fighting spirit and was really involved in his recovery."" Heads say they are mounting military-style operationsto bring teenagers back to school in Englandin smaller groups from Monday next week. The ASCL heads union estimates 90% of secondaries will be welcoming some pupils with exams next year into class. The government wants schools to give Year 10 and 12 pupils some face-to-face time with teachers before term ends. But safety guidelines to minimise virus spread mean only a quarter of these year groups can be on site at a time. This is will not be a return to full-time schooling, more a range of review sessions and extra support, with priorities given to pupils who have struggled with remote learning. A fundraising appeal to help the wife of a hospital scientist in Hull who died after battling ""severe complications"" associated with coronavirus has raised more than Â£5,000 in 24 hours.

Now, friends of Mr Albufera are hoping to raise Â£7,000 to help pay to fly his body to the Philippines, where he was from. Writing on the Go Fund Me page, his friends said: ""We would like to give Rich the send-off he deserves back at home in the Philippines alongside his family."" Councils are calling for the government to allow people with a temporary immigration status to receive public funds amid fears they will be forced into homelessness during the pandemic. Increasing numbers of people who are not eligible to support from UK taxpayers are approaching local authorities for support during the coronavirus pandemic, the Local Government Association (LGA) said. People with a temporary immigration status are given the condition called ""no recourse to public funds"" by the Home Office, meaning they cannot access welfare benefits. But the LGA fears that, without this support and as people lose their jobs, they could become homeless. Councillor David Renard, the LGA's housing spokesman, said: ""As the economy recovers, local outbreaks may mean there still may be a need to be able to access safe and suitable accommodation and financial support to allow for self-isolation, particularly for single adults without care needs who are not usually eligible for social services' support."" A government spokeswoman said: ""Families with leave under family and human rights routes can apply, free of charge, to have no recourse to public funds conditions lifted and we encourage anyone eligible to submit an application."" Rozina SiniBBC News Millions of people in England who have not been able to hold loved ones since lockdown began will be allowed to reunite with them from Saturday. Further easing of coronavirus restrictions announced by the government mean single adults living alone - or single parents with children under 18 -can form a support bubble with one other household. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said 41,481 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 17:00 BST on Thursday - up by 202 from 41,279 the day before.

Shops slash number of special offers in lockdown,"Toilet roll was not the only thing to disappear from supermarket shelves at the start of lockdown. Buy-one-get-one-free deals were pulled too. There was a 15% fall in the frequency of promotions during the first month of lockdown, research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found. This, in part, led to a 2.4% rise in the price of groceries in one month. Researchers said this was the equivalent of price increases expected for a whole year. There was also an 8% fall in the variety of grocery products on the shelves during lockdown, according to the research funded by the Nuffield Foundation, which campaigns on social policy. ""This, independently of price rises, will have a negative impact on consumers,"" the authors of the report said. Shoppers bulk bought various essentials just prior to, and at the start of, lockdown. It prompted a number of retailers to put limits on the number of items being bought, ranging from individual products such as toilet roll and pasta to the entire basket of items available via supermarket websites. Major supermarkets introduced limits on the number of in-demand items people could buy, such as toilet paper TheIFS research,externaltracked price data of groceries such as food, drink, toiletries, cleaning products and pet food. It found prices were 2.4% higher in the first month of lockdown, a rate more than 10 times higher than in preceding months and unprecedented in recent years. Since then, prices had fallen slightly, but they still remained more than 2% higher than before lockdown, the report said. ""There was more grocery inflation in one month than we often see in a year,"" said Martin O'Connell, co-author of the report. ""Higher prices and reduced variety have persisted in the following weeks. At a time when many households are subject to reductions in their income, higher prices for food, drinks and household goods will further feed into squeezed household budgets."" Half of this increase was the result of fewer promotions, such as buy-one-get-one-free deals and money off discounts. The IFS said was not recorded inofficial inflation figures, to be updated next week. What is the UK's inflation rate? Could you have to pay your bank to save money? The fall in promotions was different to during last recession, when consumers bought more goods that were on sale as their own finances were squeezed. This time, almost all households saw their grocery bills increase. The researchers also said that investors would have expected the coronavirus crisis to lead to prices falling, rather than rising. ""At a time when financial markets expect the Covid-19 pandemic to be a disinflationary shock, this increase in the price of groceries, which was experienced by almost all households and in almost all product categories, suggests policymakers nonetheless should remain vigilant about the prospect of higher inflation, at least for some goods and services,"" said co-author Xavier Jaravel.

"Start Covid-19 inquiry now, say bereaved familiesAn immediate public inquiry could help save lives, say relatives of 450 virus victims.UK","Jamie Brown (left), whose father, Tony, died of Covid-19 in March, wants an urgent public inquiry Relatives of 450 people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic are demanding an immediate public inquiry. The families want an urgent review of ""life and death"" steps needed to minimise the continuing effects of the virus and a guarantee that documents relating to the crisis will be kept. A full inquiry would take place later, says lawyer, Elkan Abrahamson, who is representing the families. The government has said its current focus is on dealing with the pandemic. But the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group say immediate lessons need to be learned to prevent more deaths, and that waiting for ministers to launch an inquiry will cost lives. The call for an inquiry comes as a report from the National Audit Office -assessing the readiness of the NHS and social care in England for the pandemic,external-  has shown it is not known how many of the 25,000 people discharged from hospitals into care homes at the peak of the outbreak were infected with coronavirus. Self-isolating if traced is civic duty School in September 'part-time if 2m distancing' Health and Social Care Select Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt said it seemed ""extraordinary that no one appeared to consider"" the risk. The Department of Health says it took the ""right decisions at the right time"". Ministers have insisted throughout that their response to the pandemic has been based on scientific advice. But for Jamie Brown, whose father, Tony, died of Covid-19 in Colchester General Hospital on 29 March, two-and-a-half weeks after travelling into central London by train, the government's decision to lock down on 23 March came too late. Jamie, 28, who said his father made the journey once a week at most, believes his death was preventable. ""I can't help but believe that if we'd entered lockdown sooner he wouldn't have been exposed in the way he was,"" he said. Tony Brown, 65, became ill with a dry cough and a temperature on 17 March. He was bedridden but was adamant he would ""wait out"" the illness at home. He appeared to be getting better but on 28 March he developed chest pains. By the following morning his family were so concerned they called an ambulance, and soon after Tony reached hospital he had a cardiac arrest - caused by respiratory failure - and died. A post-mortem test confirmed Covid-19 was present. Jamie said government advice to ""stay at home"" meant his 65-year-old father did not seek medical help early enough. ""He was trying to wait it out and if you wait too long it turns out it kills you really quickly,"" he said. He added that a detailed public inquiry into the broader handling of the crisis in the UK must eventually take place, but right now he believes it is crucial that a limited inquiry starts as soon as possible. ""We need to learn the lessons immediately from what has gone wrong to get us to this point,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? The group of families, which has 450 members and is expected to grow further, is supported by the Liverpool-based law firm Broudie Jackson Canter that acted for the Hillsborough families. Their lawyer Mr Abrahamson has backed their call for an early phase to any inquiry, with full proceedings taking place once the pandemic is over. ""What we need to look at straightaway are the issues which are life-and-death decisions,"" he told the BBC. ""We expect there will be a second spike. We want to know what the government is going to do when that happens."" Mr Abrahamson said an early phase to a public inquiry would also help clarify government plans for fully reopening schools and easing the lockdown and lay out the science behind these decisions more clearly. The government has rejected calls for an early start to any public inquiry. A spokesperson said: ""At some point in the future there will be an opportunity for us to look back, to reflect and to learn some profound lessons. ""But at the moment, the most important thing to do is to focus on responding to the current situation."" The National Audit Office's report into the readiness of the NHS and social care in England for the pandemic said 25,000 people were discharged from hospitals into care homes between 17 March and 15 April. That was 10,000 fewer than the same period last year. ""It is not known how many had Covid-19 at the point of discharge,"" said the report. It said NHS England and NHS Improvement advice at the time was to urgently discharge from hospital ""all patients medically fit to leave"" in order to free up bed space for coronavirus patients.

"Start Covid-19 inquiry now, say bereaved families","Jamie Brown (left), whose father, Tony, died of Covid-19 in March, wants an urgent public inquiry Relatives of 450 people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic are demanding an immediate public inquiry. The families want an urgent review of ""life and death"" steps needed to minimise the continuing effects of the virus and a guarantee that documents relating to the crisis will be kept. A full inquiry would take place later, says lawyer, Elkan Abrahamson, who is representing the families. The government has said its current focus is on dealing with the pandemic. But the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group say immediate lessons need to be learned to prevent more deaths, and that waiting for ministers to launch an inquiry will cost lives. The call for an inquiry comes as a report from the National Audit Office -assessing the readiness of the NHS and social care in England for the pandemic,external-  has shown it is not known how many of the 25,000 people discharged from hospitals into care homes at the peak of the outbreak were infected with coronavirus. Self-isolating if traced is civic duty School in September 'part-time if 2m distancing' Health and Social Care Select Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt said it seemed ""extraordinary that no one appeared to consider"" the risk. The Department of Health says it took the ""right decisions at the right time"". Ministers have insisted throughout that their response to the pandemic has been based on scientific advice. But for Jamie Brown, whose father, Tony, died of Covid-19 in Colchester General Hospital on 29 March, two-and-a-half weeks after travelling into central London by train, the government's decision to lock down on 23 March came too late. Jamie, 28, who said his father made the journey once a week at most, believes his death was preventable. ""I can't help but believe that if we'd entered lockdown sooner he wouldn't have been exposed in the way he was,"" he said. Tony Brown, 65, became ill with a dry cough and a temperature on 17 March. He was bedridden but was adamant he would ""wait out"" the illness at home. He appeared to be getting better but on 28 March he developed chest pains. By the following morning his family were so concerned they called an ambulance, and soon after Tony reached hospital he had a cardiac arrest - caused by respiratory failure - and died. A post-mortem test confirmed Covid-19 was present. Jamie said government advice to ""stay at home"" meant his 65-year-old father did not seek medical help early enough. ""He was trying to wait it out and if you wait too long it turns out it kills you really quickly,"" he said. He added that a detailed public inquiry into the broader handling of the crisis in the UK must eventually take place, but right now he believes it is crucial that a limited inquiry starts as soon as possible. ""We need to learn the lessons immediately from what has gone wrong to get us to this point,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? The group of families, which has 450 members and is expected to grow further, is supported by the Liverpool-based law firm Broudie Jackson Canter that acted for the Hillsborough families. Their lawyer Mr Abrahamson has backed their call for an early phase to any inquiry, with full proceedings taking place once the pandemic is over. ""What we need to look at straightaway are the issues which are life-and-death decisions,"" he told the BBC. ""We expect there will be a second spike. We want to know what the government is going to do when that happens."" Mr Abrahamson said an early phase to a public inquiry would also help clarify government plans for fully reopening schools and easing the lockdown and lay out the science behind these decisions more clearly. The government has rejected calls for an early start to any public inquiry. A spokesperson said: ""At some point in the future there will be an opportunity for us to look back, to reflect and to learn some profound lessons. ""But at the moment, the most important thing to do is to focus on responding to the current situation."" The National Audit Office's report into the readiness of the NHS and social care in England for the pandemic said 25,000 people were discharged from hospitals into care homes between 17 March and 15 April. That was 10,000 fewer than the same period last year. ""It is not known how many had Covid-19 at the point of discharge,"" said the report. It said NHS England and NHS Improvement advice at the time was to urgently discharge from hospital ""all patients medically fit to leave"" in order to free up bed space for coronavirus patients.

London monuments boarded up ahead of protests,"Boarding around the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square was erected overnight A statue of Winston Churchill and the Cenotaph in central London have been boarded up ahead of planned protests. Monuments were targeted during last week's anti-racism protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in the USA. A Black Lives Matter protest planned for Saturday in Hyde Park has been brought forward to Friday, over fears of clashes with far-right groups. The Mayor of London has called on protesters to ""stay at home"" to avoid further disorder. ""Key statues"", including one of Nelson Mandela, will be covered for protection, Sadiq Khan said. During protests last weekend a statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square was defaced, while in Bristolan effigy of slave trader Edward Colstonwas pulled down. Video shared online also appeared to show a protester climb the Cenotaph, the memorial to Britain's war dead on Whitehall, and attempt to set a union jack flag alight. By Friday morning the statue of Churchill was fully encased More protests are taking place over the weekend. A Black Lives Matter protest planned for Saturday in Hyde Park has been brought forward to Friday, over fears it would be hijacked by counter-protests. Far-right groups have called on supporters to travel to London to protect monuments from being damaged. Images appeared to show a protester climb the Cenotaph and attempt to set a flag alight Mr Khan said: ""I'm extremely concerned that further protests in central London not only risk spreading Covid-19, but could lead to disorder, vandalism and violence. ""Extreme far-right groups who advocate hatred and division are planning counter-protests, which means that the risk of disorder is high. ""Staying home and ignoring them is the best response this weekend."" Violent protesters could be jailed within 24 hours under plans to fast-track arrests linked to protest. The BBC understands that opening hours at magistrates courts are to be extended to process anybody caught vandalising, causing criminal damage or assaulting police officers. A statue of Winston Churchill in London was spray-painted with the words ""was a racist"" Churchill is lauded for leading Britain to victory in World War Two. He is described on the UK government website as ""an inspirational statesman, writer, orator and leader"", and was voted the greatest ever Briton in a 2002 BBC poll. But for some he remains a controversial figure, in partbecause of his views on race. Anti-racism protest have been taking place across the country sparked by the killing of George Floyd in the US Following last weekend's protests, campaigns to have monuments to controversial historical figures taken down have gained pace. On Tuesday, a statue of slave ownerRobert Milligan was removedfrom outside the Museum of London Docklands. Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals in London have said they will remove two statues linked to slavery in response to anti-racism protests. The NHS foundation trust which runs the hospitals said monuments of Thomas Guy and Sir Robert Clayton will be moved out of public view.

Black actor's statue doused in bleach-like liquid,"It is not yet known whether the statue has been permanently damaged A statue of a Jamaican poet, playwright and actor has been covered with what appears to be a corrosive substance. The monument to Alfred Fagon in St Pauls, Bristol, was erected in 1987 on the first anniversary of his death. Mr Fagon was the first black person to have a statue erected in their honour in the city. It was reported on Thursday to police, who said it was being investigated as criminal damage and inquiries were continuing. The statue was erected in green space off Grosvenor Road on the first anniversary of Alfred Fagon's death in 1987 Avon and Somerset Police said it was liaising with Bristol City Council to establish ownership of the statue and to determine if it had suffered any permanent damage. It comes after Black Lives Matter anti-racism protesters tore down a statue ofslave trader Edward Colstonin Bristol on Sunday. Since that statue was toppled several other statues around the UK of people linked to the slave trade have been removed, or it has been announced that they may be taken down. Mr Fagon's sister-in-law, Judy Malone-Fagon, said if it was vandalism, it was ""ignorant and idiotic"". ""It's the only statue to a black person in Bristol, who would do something like that?"" she said. ""It's shocking. Alfred didn't do anything to anyone but he would definitely have laughed at it, he was so much bigger and better than that."" Anton Phillips, an actor and friend of Mr Fagon, said following the ""dumping"" of the Colston statue it ""doesn't surprise me"". ""My memory of Alfred is he quite liked to laugh at things,"" he said. ""So I don't think he would have been angry, he would have laughed his head off about the absurdity of it and might have written something about it."" He was born in Jamaica in 1937, the third of nine brothers and two sisters. At the age of 18 he came to England to work on the railways before joining the army before moving to Bristol to work as a welder in the 1960s. One of his first plays, No Soldiers in St Pauls, explored the social tension between the police and the black community in 1970s Bristol. His final role was in the BBC's Fighting Back, set in St Pauls. He died suddenly from a heart attack on 28 August 1986 outside his flat in Camberwell, London. At the time police claimed they were unable to identify him and he was given a pauper's funeral. The annual Alfred Fagon Award was named after him and is for playwrights of Caribbean or African descent, resident in the UK.

Boy reunited with dad stuck on boat near house,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Boy reunited with seaman dad moored outside house A boy has finally been reunited with his seaman father who he had longed to see while his boat was moored near their house during lockdown. Four-year-old Euan Gordon had only been able to wave to his dad Alasdair when the vessel docked just 100m (328ft) from their home in Oban. But now Alasdair has finished his stint at sea and returned to his family. Mum Seonaid Russell said it had been like Christmas Day when her son was reunited with his father. She said Euan had woken up at 05:00 with ""excitement"" and anticipation. Alasdair Gordon, 41, is in charge of the deck on the Pharos, which is responsible for the operation of Scottish lighthouses. Under normal circumstances, when the boat is moored near his home he can spend the night with his family. Boy yearns to see dad moored outside house But since the lockdown began, Alasdair and his crew have been instructed to stay on the ship when it is tied up in dock.

Seonaid, 34, said Euan had been counting down the days and knew his dad would be allowed off the ship on Thursday. She said: ""Euan was very excited and woke up particularly early because he he was so looking forward to seeing his dad. It was like Christmas for him. ""It was so lovely to see the smile on Euan's face."" The family live in a cabin in the grounds of Seonaid's mother's house. ""Euan loves baking and his granny had promised she would bake a cake with him in the morning for his dad,"" Seonaid said. ""So he ran through the garden to his granny's house at 06:00 and baked a beautiful cake for Alasdair's welcome home."" Seonaid and Euan then went to the pier for the reunion. ""Euan was so excited but he waited patiently until his dad came through the gates,"" she said. ""I also felt excited, and was so happy to see Euan so happy to see his dad again. ""Euan wanted confirmation his dad would now be staying with us for a while and he was delighted when we said yes."" They went back to the house for cake, then Alasdair took his son cycling in the park. Seonaid said: ""They spent time together to reacquaint themselves with each other. ""It's so lovely to see them back together."" Seonaid added that she was grateful that the Northern Lighthouse Board had stuck to the guidelines, and understood why it had done so.

Which areas have the most furloughed workers?,"The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was created less than three months ago, but has already grown into perhaps the most expensive intervention by a British government to support the jobs market. Just under nine million jobs are currently having their wages paid by the taxpayer through the pandemic shutdown, and for the first time, the HMRChas produced breakdowns,externalof precisely where and which employers are using the scheme. Shops and their suppliers are the biggest users of the scheme, claiming Â£3.3bn of Â£17.5bn total to furlough 1.6m workers. Then it's hotels and restaurants, claiming Â£2.6bn to park a further 1.4m workers. That is followed by manufacturers whose factories have been shut claiming Â£2.1bn for 831,000 workers. Everything from mining to education, health, waste, and estate agents are represented. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? By region, the pattern is of course the more employees, the greater the use of the scheme. Two million jobs in London and the South East, and 628,000 in Scotland, have been funded by the scheme. Perhaps the most fascinating data is the breakdown by council and parliamentary constituency. Almost all of the 650 MPs in the UK have more than 10,000 constituents who have been furloughed. It is an average of 13,000. But within that there are considerable variations. Mainly London constituencies with larger populations of employed people top the list, with West Ham having 29,300 furloughed jobs. Some very interesting patterns emerge if this data is compared with the number of jobs in the constituency. Nearly half of jobs in Brent Central in North West London - 45.4% - are furloughed, paid for by the taxpayer. Feltham and Crawley, close to Heathrow and Gatwick Airports, are in the top 10 too. But Glasgow East, Blackpool South and Westmorland and Lonsdale in Cumbria are also in the top 10. These figures show just how far spread is the reach of this scheme, and perhaps, just why it had to be extended by the chancellor into the autumn.

Welsh site 'preferred' for battery 'gigafactory',"St Athan is one of two sites listed for the lithium ion battery plant The firm behind a proposed battery factory which could create 4,000 jobs has listed a site in Wales as its ""preferred option"". Britishvolt, which wants to produce batteries for electric vehicles, said it will build its factory in St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan, or Coventry. The Welsh town is already home to an Aston Martin electric car plant, which opened fully in December 2019. The Welsh Government said it was ""very pleased"" St Athan was shortlisted. Ban on petrol and diesel car sales brought forward Petrol and diesel car ban 'could start in 12 years' Britishvolt's chief operating officer, Orral Nadjari, who studied at Cardiff University for seven years, said St Athan was a ""very good location"" for the factory, which would bring Â£1.2bn of investment. Britishvolt COO Orral Nadjari said St Athan was the ""preferred destination"" of the factory He said: ""We're looking to build a 'gigaplant' that is roughly 1km long, 500m wide and 30m high, so it's a huge undertaking, and something as big as that doesn't really just fit anywhere. ""The direct dialogue that we've had with the Welsh Government has been going on now for a couple of weeks, and the readiness and preparedness that they've shown us has been extremely interesting, hence now why they're in the running for our site location."" Britishvolt said it was offering between 3,500 and 4,000 direct jobs at the site, but denied it was marketing itself to the highest bidder in order to get more funding. ""I am being very honest and open about the fact that Wales is the kind of preferred option,"" Mr Nadjari added. ""We are not marketing or trying to sell to the highest bidder because the Welsh Government is doing an exceptional job and they are the preferred destination."" The Welsh Government said: ""We have been working with Britishvolt on this project for a significant period of time and we are very pleased they have shortlisted Bro Tathan as a location for its landmark gigafactory. ""We firmly believe that Bro Tathan provides a compelling case, particularly for a company looking to become one of the greenest battery producers worldwide."" Tim Williams, from the Welsh Automotive Industry, said the proposal was ""excellent news for Wales"". ""If this comes off, and hopefully it will, then we're talking about 3,500 new jobs directly and probably a multiplier of two in the supply chain,"" he said. ""The Welsh Government need to be as bold as they possibly can be. This is such a huge investment, such a big number of jobs and the Welsh Government over many years has had a very, very successful record in bringing in large projects."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said it was ""fantastic that we can talk about Wales as being a leading contender"" for the UK's first gigafactory.

Shops in NI reopen their doors,"A one way system was in operation in various shopping centres, as they reopened on Friday Non-essential retailers in Northern Ireland have now reopened after being forced to shut at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March. It is part of a number of lockdown measures lifted by the executive. Large retailers have already opened, but, on Thursday, theexecutive confirmed that shopping centresand small shops could reopen for business. From today, groups of up to 10 people in NI who do not live together can also meet outdoors. However, they must adhere to social distancing advice requiring people to stay 2m (6ft) apart, First Minister Arlene Foster said. What will shopping in NI look like? In full: The five stages of NI's plan to ease lockdown Q&A: What has and has not changed in NI lockdown? The executive met on Thursday and agreed to lift a number of lockdown restrictions, because the R-number - which measures the rate of infection - is currently estimated as being between 0.5 and 0.9.

Michelle Greeves, manager of Victoria Square shopping centre in Belfast, said stores had been planning how to open safely for weeks. ""We all live for retail and we've missed it so much, we've missed being able to do what we know we do well,"" she said. A number of public health measures have been introduced at Derry's Foyleside shopping centre The manager of Londonderry's biggest shopping centre, Foyleside, told BBC Radio Foyle that a number of public health measures were in place, including sneeze guards. Fergal Rafferty added that while it is not mandatory, shoppers are encouraged to wear face masks. The owner of a Belfast jewellers told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that it has been a ""big job"" to get everything ready to reopen. Peter Lunn said he expects his stores will only be able to handle half the volume they did before, due to safety measures. Stormont ministers had been coming under pressure to allow more shops to open, after all high street shops in the Republic of Ireland resumed business on Monday. Retailers had voiced concerns that they could be placed at a disadvantage against competitors across the border. Non-essential retailers in Englandwill open next week. By John Campbell, BBC News NI Business and Economics Editor Retail is the single biggest source of employment in Northern Ireland, accounting for more than 15% of all employee jobs. So the reopening of the sector is a significant step in the easing of lockdown. But there are major questions about how it will be handled. Childcare reopening has not synchronised with retail reopening, so some parents expected back at work could face a very difficult situation. Retailers in Belfast have been preparing to open - but the shopping experience will now look very different And what of the customers - will they be content to get back into the shops? Lockdown has probably accelerated the move towards more online shopping. But when we considerthe huge queues at Ikea's reopening, it suggests there is still a demand for the experience of physical retail. From Friday, places of worship and community centres can also open to provide childcare for parents who are required to return to work. But it is still not clear when all day care centres can resume business, and there remain restrictions on group size. Many parents are concerned about the availability of childcare in Northern Ireland At present, only vulnerable children and children of key workers can avail of childcare, but last week thedefinition of a key worker was expanded, as more sectors of the economy begin to reopen. According to the Nevin Economic Research Institute (NERI), about 350,000 workers in Northern Ireland have dependent children. Its research suggests 70% of them are likely to have ""intensive childcare requirements"". The first and deputy first ministers held meetings on Friday, with the health and education ministers, with a view to providing more information for the childcare sector. It was not mentioned in the executive's five-step Pathway to Recovery blueprint. From Saturday,single adults can stay at one other householdin a ""support bubble"", but it will not apply to those who are shielding. From Monday, people in Northern Ireland will be allowed to move house, after the property market was paused following the imposition of lockdown in March. Elite athletes will also be allowed to begin using outdoor sports facilities to train from Monday. Speaking on Good Morning Britain, First Minister Arlene Foster said that the executive would be discussing indicative dates next week for reopening salons and hopes ""to be able to bring some joy"" to people. But ministers have not yet decided whether to bring forward the date hotels, other tourist accommodation and the hospitality industry can reopen. Economy Minister Diane Dodds toldBBC One NI's The View programmeon Thursday night that she hopes to get the executive to agree on a date next week, when ministers meet again. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Friday, Mrs Dodds said she had ""a date in mind"" for an early reopening of the hospitality sector but would not be drawn on when it was. ""I would like to see it as soon as is practically possible but those are decisions that have to be taken collectively,"" she said. The minister added that she wants the executive to reduce social distancing advice from 2m to 1m, in order to give the hospitality industry a ""fighting chance to be viable"". The World Health Organization (WHO)has said 1m is safe,external, but it will be up to the Stormont Executive to take a collective decision to amend the guidance in Northern Ireland.

Three firms still positive despite the virus crisis,"Vivien Wong, who runs Little Moons, said lockdown didn't come as a great surprise The scale of the UK's economic troubles have been laid bare bythe latest GDP figures. Will the recovery be V-shaped, L-shaped, U-shaped, or is it far too early to tell? Despite the uncertainties, however, some British companies are nothing if not positive. Here, the owners of three firms that went into lockdown in March tell the BBC why they can see light at the end of the tunnel. The lockdown hit just as Little Moons was enjoying its best month of trading. The business, which makes the Japanese ice cream confection mochi for restaurants and supermarkets, shut down overnight. Co-founder Vivien Wong said lockdown didn't come as a great surprise. ""We'd followed what was happening in China and Hong Kong,"" she said. More than 50% of revenues came from restaurants, money that dried up immediately. ""We were weren't sure what was going to happen with supermarkets, but we knew immediately we had to go into cash preservation mode."" Luckily, Little Moons struck a deal with its landlord, which eased cash flow. ""We cancelled marketing and all unnecessary spending. Basically, we just hunkered down,"" Ms Wong said. The London-based company trades throughout Europe, which has helped Little Moons to get back to business. Ms Wong said: ""Europe opened up a little earlier, so from about mid-May we started getting orders from supermarkets. ""We started un-furloughing a few members of our team, and have just started cranking up production again."" But a return to the record trading Little Moons saw in March could be a long way off. Ms Wong said: ""We have halved the number of people on the production floor and changed shift patterns. ""It means we are not as efficient as before. That's really affected us financially."" Little Moons is employing more cleaners, and the cost of face masks and other food hygiene equipment has soared. The firm's future is tied up with the restaurant sector, which she worries may never fully recover. That said, supermarket orders are rising, which Ms Wong puts down to people wanting comfort food. ""It was pretty catastrophic"" is how Adam Redhouse describes the first few days of lockdown. Sales and lettings at his London estate agents firm disappeared virtually overnight. ""We furloughed sales staff immediately, and closed all the offices,"" he said. ""We lost over 50% of the sales pipeline over the first few days as people cancelled."" And yet, over the following weeks the business continued to get what Mr Redhouse said were ""a fair few inquiries. That was a massive surprise. But if you can't do viewings, you can't sell properties."" Still, even though Squire Estates did very few transactions, the continuing customer interest at least gave him hope that business would pick up once the lockdown eased. It was only in mid-May that estate agents began re-opening for business, but Mr Redhouse has been amazed at the pace of recovery. ""It sounds crazy, given how much business we lost,"" he said. ""It was on a Tuesday night that the government said we could re-open, and on the Wednesday morning we un-furloughed all the sales staff. There was a lot of pent up demand for transactions and viewings,"" he said. It helped, Mr Redhouse believes, that he and his partner made a special effort to keep in touch with clients and potential clients during the lockdown. Business continues to pick up, but will it get back to normal? ""I like to think so. The amount of demand that we are seeing shows that people want to move. I feel positive,"" he said. Sophie Lawler's 17 health clubs remain closed to their 100,000 members in the north of England and Wales. And like the rest of the fitness sector, she has no idea when she might get the green light to re-open. ""The whole sector has struggled financially, and may do so for years to come,"" she said. ""The industry is shouldering quite some rental burden, costs we still incur even while we're closed."" Furloughing has been vital. ""It's given us a great deal of oxygen to keep the business going,"" she said. Staff wages are the biggest fixed costs after property rents and rates. As soon as Total Fitness is given the go-ahead to re-open Ms Lawler plans to bring all the staff back from furlough. ""We will need all our people, maybe even more."" She'd like to see the government do more to help, perhaps with some VAT exemptions and support for landlords to let them ease the burden on leaseholders. Despite the uncertainties, however, she says the fitness industry ""has an exceptionally bright future if we can weather this storm"". Ms Lawler said the sector has proved particularly resilient to recessions in the past, and will do so again. She expects to see a uptick in customers who recognise the importance of fitness and exercise in the fight to stay healthy against viruses. ""It terms of demand, we will do pretty well when we get through to the other side of this,"" she said. The trouble is, she has no idea when that might be. ""Our single biggest challenge is that there is just no guidance on re-opening.""

The UK had committedto introduce full import controls,externalon EU goods in January. But coronavirus has forced a rethink, with firms able to defer customs forms and tariff payments for six months and some physical checks delayed to July.

The UK left the European Union at the end of January, but the transition period - during which existing trading rules and membership of the single market and customs union apply - lasts until the end of the year. Opposition MPs have been pushing for it to be extended,with the Scottish and Welsh first ministerswarning that exiting the current trading arrangements in just over six months time would be ""extraordinarily reckless"" given the economic damage and uncertainty caused by the coronavirus epidemic. Ministers from the two devolved administrations withdrew from a scheduled conference call with UK ministers on Friday evening in protest at their decision to rule out a delay, saying their views had been ""dismissed"". What are the sticking points in the trade talks? Border delays 'could cause fresh food problems' Trade deal still possible with EU, says UK minister Earlier, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said he had ""formally confirmed"" to the EU that the transition period will not be extended, adding that the ""moment"" for such a move had ""now passed"". However, there will be an about turn, in the short term at least, on the checks carried out on imports. In February, Mr Gove said full import controls were ""necessary"" from 1 January to keep UK borders ""safe and secure"" and to collect the appropriate taxes. Under the revised plan,external, checks on goods entering Britain will be phased-in in three stages up to the summer of 2021, regardless of whether a deal is done with the EU or not. From 1 January, there will be checks on controlled substances, such as alcohol and tobacco, while standard goods, such as clothes and electronics, will be subject to basic customs procedures. But firms will have up to six months to complete customs declarations and pay relevant tariffs From 1 April, those importing products of animal origin, including meat, milk or egg products, will have to pre-notify officials and provide the relevant health paperwork By 1 July, all goods will be liable for relevant tariffs and customs declarations as well as full ""safety and security"" declarations. From this moment, there will be an increase in physical checks on livestock, plants and other sanitary and phytosanitary products at ports and other entry points New border facilities will be built in order to process the required checks either at ports, or where there is not enough space, at ""inland sites"". Ministers said they would consult with ports about what new infrastructure was needed and where it should be located. The proposals only apply to rules on imports, with checks on exports to the EU being determined by Brussels. Mr Gove said the arrangements would be introduced in a way that gives businesses affected by coronavirus ""time to adjust"" but conceded ""more work"" was needed to ensure the UK was ready. ""From 1 January we will be outside the customs union and outside the single market so it's appropriate we have checks on goods coming in to the UK,"" he said. ""But it also appropriate that we take account of what's happening with the coronavirus. And we want to make sure business has an opportunity to adjust in a pragmatic and flexible way."" Firms are expected to have to fill in 200 million extra customs declarations every year and industry experts have said an extra 50,000 customs officials will need to be hired to deal with the extra paperwork. Ministers have announced Â£50m in extra funding to support the new customs infrastructure, for IT systems and for recruiting and training new customs brokers and freight forwarders. Michael Gove was a prominent figure in the Leave campaign, and in charge of preparations for a no-deal Brexit. It was no surprise, then, that he announced in February that full border controls would be implemented at the end of the transition period. But now the new system will be ""phased in"" - with some companies having up to six months to complete customs declarations. The government maintains that this is a ""pragmatic"" way to help businesses which have struggled under the coronavirus yoke. But his critics say that it is a sign of Mr Gove's dogmatism, not pragmatism - that he is determined to end, rather than extend, the transition period. Critics in his own party are far more concerned about what they see as a lack of preparedness. Only today did the government commit to building new border facilities. That, in itself, may be a further sign that trade talks with the EU are not making good progress. A leading figure involved in the negotiations last week conceded that a completely tariff-free deal may elude them. And some say the government, practically rather than philosophically, isn't yet fully prepared for the reality of life outside the EU. The Freight Transport Association said ministers had listened to its ""concerns"" while business lobby group, the CBI, said the move was ""pragmatic and sensible"". ""It will be welcomed by Britain's manufacturing and food businesses, which simply aren't ready for chaotic changes with our biggest trading partner at the end of the year,"" said its deputy director general Josh Hardie. The CBI also welcomed news thatBoris Johnson will meet the presidents of the European Commission, Council and Parliament remotely on Monday, as attempts to secure a trade deal with the EU are stepped up. The negotiating teams have also agreed to ""an intensified timetable"" for July after the fourth round of negotiations last week failed to reach a breakthrough.

The Welsh town is already home to an Aston Martin electric car plant, which opened fully in December 2019. The Welsh Government said it was ""very pleased"" St Athan was shortlisted. Ban on petrol and diesel car sales brought forward Petrol and diesel car ban 'could start in 12 years' Britishvolt's chief operating officer, Orral Nadjari, who studied at Cardiff University for seven years, said St Athan was a ""very good location"" for the factory, which would bring Â£1.2bn of investment. Britishvolt COO Orral Nadjari said St Athan was the ""preferred destination"" of the factory He said: ""We're looking to build a 'gigaplant' that is roughly 1km long, 500m wide and 30m high, so it's a huge undertaking, and something as big as that doesn't really just fit anywhere. ""The direct dialogue that we've had with the Welsh Government has been going on now for a couple of weeks, and the readiness and preparedness that they've shown us has been extremely interesting, hence now why they're in the running for our site location."" Britishvolt said it was offering between 3,500 and 4,000 direct jobs at the site, but denied it was marketing itself to the highest bidder in order to get more funding. ""I am being very honest and open about the fact that Wales is the kind of preferred option,"" Mr Nadjari added. ""We are not marketing or trying to sell to the highest bidder because the Welsh Government is doing an exceptional job and they are the preferred destination."" The Welsh Government said: ""We have been working with Britishvolt on this project for a significant period of time and we are very pleased they have shortlisted Bro Tathan as a location for its landmark gigafactory. ""We firmly believe that Bro Tathan provides a compelling case, particularly for a company looking to become one of the greenest battery producers worldwide."" Tim Williams, from the Welsh Automotive Industry, said the proposal was ""excellent news for Wales"". ""If this comes off, and hopefully it will, then we're talking about 3,500 new jobs directly and probably a multiplier of two in the supply chain,"" he said. ""The Welsh Government need to be as bold as they possibly can be. This is such a huge investment, such a big number of jobs and the Welsh Government over many years has had a very, very successful record in bringing in large projects."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said it was ""fantastic that we can talk about Wales as being a leading contender"" for the UK's first gigafactory.

Shops in NI reopen their doorsAll non-essential retailers were given the green light to resume trading after lockdown.Northern Ireland,"A one way system was in operation in various shopping centres, as they reopened on Friday Non-essential retailers in Northern Ireland have now reopened after being forced to shut at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March. It is part of a number of lockdown measures lifted by the executive. Large retailers have already opened, but, on Thursday, theexecutive confirmed that shopping centresand small shops could reopen for business. From today, groups of up to 10 people in NI who do not live together can also meet outdoors. However, they must adhere to social distancing advice requiring people to stay 2m (6ft) apart, First Minister Arlene Foster said. What will shopping in NI look like? In full: The five stages of NI's plan to ease lockdown Q&A: What has and has not changed in NI lockdown? The executive met on Thursday and agreed to lift a number of lockdown restrictions, because the R-number - which measures the rate of infection - is currently estimated as being between 0.5 and 0.9.

Michelle Greeves, manager of Victoria Square shopping centre in Belfast, said stores had been planning how to open safely for weeks. ""We all live for retail and we've missed it so much, we've missed being able to do what we know we do well,"" she said. A number of public health measures have been introduced at Derry's Foyleside shopping centre The manager of Londonderry's biggest shopping centre, Foyleside, told BBC Radio Foyle that a number of public health measures were in place, including sneeze guards. Fergal Rafferty added that while it is not mandatory, shoppers are encouraged to wear face masks. The owner of a Belfast jewellers told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that it has been a ""big job"" to get everything ready to reopen. Peter Lunn said he expects his stores will only be able to handle half the volume they did before, due to safety measures. Stormont ministers had been coming under pressure to allow more shops to open, after all high street shops in the Republic of Ireland resumed business on Monday. Retailers had voiced concerns that they could be placed at a disadvantage against competitors across the border. Non-essential retailers in Englandwill open next week. By John Campbell, BBC News NI Business and Economics Editor Retail is the single biggest source of employment in Northern Ireland, accounting for more than 15% of all employee jobs. So the reopening of the sector is a significant step in the easing of lockdown. But there are major questions about how it will be handled. Childcare reopening has not synchronised with retail reopening, so some parents expected back at work could face a very difficult situation. Retailers in Belfast have been preparing to open - but the shopping experience will now look very different And what of the customers - will they be content to get back into the shops? Lockdown has probably accelerated the move towards more online shopping. But when we considerthe huge queues at Ikea's reopening, it suggests there is still a demand for the experience of physical retail. From Friday, places of worship and community centres can also open to provide childcare for parents who are required to return to work. But it is still not clear when all day care centres can resume business, and there remain restrictions on group size. Many parents are concerned about the availability of childcare in Northern Ireland At present, only vulnerable children and children of key workers can avail of childcare, but last week thedefinition of a key worker was expanded, as more sectors of the economy begin to reopen. According to the Nevin Economic Research Institute (NERI), about 350,000 workers in Northern Ireland have dependent children. Its research suggests 70% of them are likely to have ""intensive childcare requirements"". The first and deputy first ministers held meetings on Friday, with the health and education ministers, with a view to providing more information for the childcare sector. It was not mentioned in the executive's five-step Pathway to Recovery blueprint. From Saturday,single adults can stay at one other householdin a ""support bubble"", but it will not apply to those who are shielding. From Monday, people in Northern Ireland will be allowed to move house, after the property market was paused following the imposition of lockdown in March. Elite athletes will also be allowed to begin using outdoor sports facilities to train from Monday. Speaking on Good Morning Britain, First Minister Arlene Foster said that the executive would be discussing indicative dates next week for reopening salons and hopes ""to be able to bring some joy"" to people. But ministers have not yet decided whether to bring forward the date hotels, other tourist accommodation and the hospitality industry can reopen. Economy Minister Diane Dodds toldBBC One NI's The View programmeon Thursday night that she hopes to get the executive to agree on a date next week, when ministers meet again. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Friday, Mrs Dodds said she had ""a date in mind"" for an early reopening of the hospitality sector but would not be drawn on when it was. ""I would like to see it as soon as is practically possible but those are decisions that have to be taken collectively,"" she said. The minister added that she wants the executive to reduce social distancing advice from 2m to 1m, in order to give the hospitality industry a ""fighting chance to be viable"". The World Health Organization (WHO)has said 1m is safe,external, but it will be up to the Stormont Executive to take a collective decision to amend the guidance in Northern Ireland.

Fawlty Towers episode removed from UKTV,"John Cleese, who plays Basil Fawlty, has said the move is ""stupid"" John Cleese has laid into the ""cowardly and gutless"" BBC after an episode of Fawlty Towers was temporarily removed from a BBC-owned streaming platform. A 1975 episode titled The Germans was taken off UKTV's streaming service because it contains ""racial slurs"". In it, the Major uses highly offensive language, and Cleese's Basil Fawlty declares ""don't mention the war"". UKTV said it expected to reinstate the show with ""extra guidance"" in ""the coming days"". Cleese wrote on Twitter,external: ""The BBC is now run by a mixture of marketing people and petty bureaucrats."" He added: ""I would have hoped that someone at the BBC would understand that there are two ways of making fun of human behaviour. ""One is to attack it directly. The other is to have someone who is patently a figure of fun, speak up on behalf of that behaviour."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He went on to compare the situation with that of Alf Garnett, the racist character in sitcoms Till Death Us Do Part and In Sickness and in Health. ""We laughed at Alf's reactionary views. Thus we discredited them, by laughing at him,""Cleese wrote,external. ""Of course, there were people - very stupid people - who said 'Thank God someone is saying these things at last'. We laughed at these people too. Now they're taking decisions about BBC comedy."" He continued: ""But it's not just stupidity. The BBC is now run by a mixture of marketing people and petty bureaucrats. It used to have a large sprinkling of people who'd actually made programmes. Not any more. ""So BBC decisions are made by persons whose main concern is not losing their jobs... That's why they're so cowardly and gutless and contemptible. I rest my case."" UKTV also operates channels including Gold, and many of its channels and its digital player were taken over by the BBC's commercial arm BBC Studios last year. A BBC spokesman declined to comment. A UKTV statement said it would update the episode with guidance and contextual information in line with similar warnings on other classic comedy titles. ""We will reinstate Fawlty Towers once that extra guidance has been added, which we expect will be in the coming days,"" it added. ""We will continue to look at what content is on offer as we always have done."" Netflix and iPlayer at odds over BBC comedies Ant and Dec sorry for acting as people of colour Little Britain pulled from iPlayer and Netflix The Germans is still available to view on Britbox, which is part-owned by the BBC, with a message saying it ""contains some offensive racial language of the time and upsetting scenes"". It is also on Netflix, carrying a warning about ""language, [and] discrimination"". Journalist and broadcaster Carl Anka described the removal as ""a waste of time"", noting many people would prefer it if UKTV and other companies simply ""committed to hiring black creatives"" instead.

In 2013, it was reported that Cleese agreed for the offending lines to be edited out when it was repeated on TV. ""We are very proud of Fawlty Towers and its contribution to British television comedy,"" a BBC spokesmantold the Daily Mail at the time,external. ""But public attitudes have changed significantly since it was made and it was decided to make some minor changes, with the consent of John Cleese's management, to allow the episode to transmit to a family audience at 7.30pm on BBC Two."" This week, many channels and comedy figures have been making moves to reassess what is acceptable in today's society, following mass Black Lives Matter protests after the death of George Floyd. HBO Max temporarily removed Gone With The Wind because of its ""racial depictions"", and Little Britain was removed from the BBC iPlayer and Britbox because ""times have changed"".

Fears of second virus outbreak hit global shares,"Global stock markets have fallen amid fears that an uptick in coronavirus cases could cause more economic damage. The declines came after the US Federal Reserve warned that the American economy faces a long road to recovery. In the US on Thursday, the three main share indexes saw their worst day in weeks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down almost 7%. Stock markets in Asia also fell on Friday with benchmark indexes losing ground in Japan, Hong Kong and China. The falls followed a weeks-long rally that had helped shares recover some ground from the lows seen in March. Energy and travel stocks were among the biggest losers, as global crude oil prices also took a hit. Earlier on Thursday, European shares also dropped, with the UK's FTSE 100, the Dax in Germany and France's CAC 40 all losing 4% or more. What is a recession? Fed warns US faces 'long road' to recovery UK economy virus hit among worst of leading nations ""Government, companies and people would be better prepared for a second wave than for the first one,"" said Roland Kaloyan, European equity strategist at Societe Generale. ""But the problem is there is a limit to governments injecting money."" Share prices had gained in recent weeks amid hopes that the economy would rebound as authorities loosened restrictions put in place to try to slow the spread of the virus. Last week's surprise report showing US employers had restarted hiring in May helped to push the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to new highs. But the recovery remains tentative. On Thursday, the US Labor Department reported that another 1.5 million people had filed new unemployment claims last week. More than 30 million continue to collect the benefits, it said. US Federal Reserve policymakers said on Wednesday that the unemployment rate could remain above 9% at the end of the year - close to the worst level of the financial crisis, At a news conference, Fed chairman Jerome Powell warned that this assessment may prove optimistic, if coronavirus infection and hospitalisation rates rise. Several states that have moved to reopen, including Arizona and South Carolina, have seen an uptick in Covid-19 cases in recent days. ""It could hurt the recovery, even if you don't have a national level pandemic. Just a series of local ones, of local spikes, could have the effect of undermining people's confidence in travelling, in restaurants and in entertainment,"" he said. ""It would not be a positive development."" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not want to see a return of the lockdowns that had kept the world's largest economy frozen for weeks. But economists have warned that people will stay at home voluntarily if they are afraid of becoming ill.

What is a recession?,"The UK is out of recession after the economy returned to growth in the first three months of the year, official figures show. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the economy was ""returning to full health"", but Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said this was no time for a ""victory lap"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures for the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is the value of all the goods and services the UK produces. When GDP rises, a country's economy grows and average incomes rise as a result. But sometimes the economy shrinks, GDP falls, and that's a sign that the economy is doing badly, which could hit people's pockets. What is GDP and how does it affect me? The UK is in recession if GDP falls for two successive three-month periods - known as quarters. The economy shrank 0.1% between July and September last year and then by a further 0.3% between October and December. This meantthe economy went into recession at the end of 2023. But the latest figures from the ONS show the UK economy grew by 0.6% between January and March 2024, marking the end of the recession. Is Rishi Sunak keeping his five key promises? Theprevious UK recession was in 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. It only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% fall in GDP recorded between April and June 2020 was the largest on record. In 2008 a recession started as a result of the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters, or 15 months. Economic growth can mean more jobs are available and companies can pay more to employees and shareholders. Higher wages and larger profits also generate money for the government through taxes. It can chooseto spend more on things like benefits and public services, or cut tax rates. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Some people might lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. Others may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Benefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle, especially if the government decides to spend less on public services. In a recession,the Bank of England - which is independent of government - typically cuts interest rates. This makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and economic growth. However,prices have been rising very quickly in the UK, and the Bank put interest rates up to tackle that inflation. After 14 rate increases,the Bank hasheld interest rates at 5.25% six times in a row. When the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called ""stagflation"". This can be very difficult to solve, because the two issues require different solutions. However in May 2024, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC thatthe UK economy had ""turned a corner"". With growth of 0.6% from January to March this year, the UK was the joint fastest growing economy inthe G7 group of industrialised nations. But until then, the UK had been one of the weaker members of the G7. The US economygrew by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was much better than expected. That put the US at 2.5% over 2023 as a whole, the best performance of all other advanced economies. It is also expected to outperform the rest of the G7 in 2024. In October 2023,the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would grow by just 0.6% in 2024. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)expects the UK economy to grow by 0.7% in 2024, but that is less than half of its earlier prediction of 1.8% growth.

What is the UK's GDP?,"The UK's economy had zero growth in the third quarter of 2024, according to the latest official figures. The strength of the economy affects things like pay increases for workers and the amount of tax the government can raise to pay for services. GDP stands for gross domestic product, and is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments and people in a country. In the UK, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) publishesnew GDP figures every month,external. However, quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are considered more important. Most economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily. That's because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises. When GDP is falling, it means the economy is shrinking - which can be bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known asa recession, which can lead to pay freezes and job losses. The UK briefly fell into recession at the end of 2023, when the economy shrank in the last two quarters of the year. It rebounded in the first half of 2024, when GDP increased 0.7% between January and March, and0.5% between April and June,external. However, the economy had zero growth betweenJuly and September. The latest monthly figures show that GDPshrank by 0.1% in October. Analysts said the unexpected fall was linked to measures announcedin that month's Budget, including a rise in employernational insurance contributions (NICs)and ahigher minimum wage. In early December, the influential think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cut its growth forecast for the UK for 2024. It now expects the UK economy to grow by 0.9% across the year as a whole, down from its previous prediction of 1.1%. That would make it the fourth best performer in the G7 group of rich nations,according to the OECD,external, behind the US, Canada and France, but ahead of Italy, Germany and Japan. However, economic forecasts are not always accurate. If GDP is going up steadily, people pay more in tax because they're earning and spending more. This means more money for the government, which it can choose to spend on public services, such as schools, police and hospitals. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Governments tend to get less money in tax, which means they may decide to freeze or cut public spending, or put taxes up. In 2020, the Covid pandemic caused the most severe UK recession for more than 300 years, which forced the government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy. How much money does the UK government raise and spend each year? Where does the government borrow billions from? GDP can be measured in three ways: Output: The total value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy - agriculture, manufacturing, energy, construction, the service sector and government Expenditure:The value of goods and services bought by households and by government, investment in machinery and buildings - this also includes the value of exports, minus imports Income: The value of the income generated, mostly in terms of profits and wages In the UK, the ONS publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three measurements. But early estimates mainly use the output measure, using data collected from thousands of companies. The UK produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question. At that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised as more information comes in. The ONS publishes more information about thison its website,external. GDPdoesn't tell the whole story: the hidden economy:unpaid work such as caring for children or elderly relatives isn't captured inequality:it also doesn't show how income is split across a population - rising GDP could result from the richest getting richer, rather than everyone becoming better off, and some people could be worse off To try and address this, the ONS also publishes a figure for GDP per capita - or head of population - which can tell a different story. In fact, when you strip out inflation and population growth, the latest quarterly figures show thatGDP per capita actually fell by 0.1% between July and September 2024,external. Official GDP figures don't take into account unpaid work like looking after children Some critics also argue that GDP doesn't take into account whether the economic growth it measures is sustainable,or the environmental damage it might do. Alternative measures have been developed which try to capture this. Since 2010,the ONS has also measured well-being,externalalongside economic growth. This assesses health, relationships, education and skills, as well as people's personal finances and the environment. But despite its limitations, GDP is still the most widely-used measure for most government decisions and international comparisons.

The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has released new guidelines for Americans as restrictions around the country ease and people return to daily life. Director Dr Robert Redfield said the ""common sense"" guidance was meant to help people stay safe ""as communities open up and they begin to re-engage in daily life"". The recommendations include: There are other guidelines for large gatherings - like protests, rallies and concerts - as well. But the CDC guidance remains to social distance, practise good hand hygiene and follow local rules. Covid-19 response manager Dr Jay Butler told reporters: ""It's not intended to endorse any particular type of event but to be applicable to any type of event that might occur."" The new tips come as Covid-19 cases are on the rise in a number of states, though re-openings are underway nationwide. ""We know the pandemic is not over,"" Dr Butler said. ""The vast majority of Americans still have not been exposed to this virus."" Disinfect shopping carts, the guidelines say Film and television production can begin in California as early as today, officials have said, as long as local Covid-19 protocols are followed. It's unlikely that production will restart immediately. The Hollywood Reporter said crews are expected to get back to work by July or August. But what might the new Covid-19 workplace look like? An industry paper on protocols agreed upon by unions, guilds and employers listed masks, regular testing and staggered meal times as part of the new guidelines. Director Tyler Perry's studios had earlier released a proposal, which called for cast testing and self-isolation before turning up on set, as well as travelling on private jets to minimise risk and tests after any such travel,according to the Reporter,external. Travellers socially distance while in line at a screening checkpoint in Orlando, Florida US airports have seen the highest number of travellers this week since the start of the pandemic, the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reported. In April, airports saw a record low of just over 87,000 travellers in one day - compared to over two million at the same time last year. But on Monday, more than 430,000 people went through TSA checkpoints. Yesterday, that number surpassed 500,000 for the first time since March. The rise in US air travel comes while Covid-19 case counts are also on the rise in states across the country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still advises people to stay home and limit travel to prevent the spread of the virus. Allow Twitter content?

Ohio Health Director Dr Amy Acton, a key official responsible for the state's often-praised pandemic response, has resigned. Governor Mike DeWine has relied heavily on Acton's expertise. It was on her guidance that Ohio imposed early restrictions and became the first state to close schools. While Acton saw national praise for Ohio's quick response to the crisis, she also saw criticism from Ohio Republicans, who tried to limit her authority, and protesters who felt the lockdown measures were too strict. Her decision to close gyms was deemed to have violated the state's constitution, and a judge wrote that she ""acted in an impermissibly arbitrary, unreasonable, and oppressive manner"". DeWine, a Republican, has continued to defend Acton and the state's actions. He said on Thursday: ""I will always believe and know that many lives were saved because of her wise advice.""

The bond between mother and daughter is strong for many around the world - but none are thought to have graduated from medical school at the same time. And now, Cynthia Kudji and her daughter Jasmine are tackling the coronavirus pandemic together on the front line at the same hospital. The Ghanian-American doctors graduated a few weeks ago and have both been placed at LSU Health in Louisiana. ""It is like a dream come true,"" Cynthia told BBC Focus on Africa. ""My inspiration came from Jasmine. When you have a young child you aspire for them to be better than yourself. ""It meant so much having my daughter by my side as we went through this journey together."" The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged mothers who contract Covid-19  to continue breastfeeding their babies. Dr Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus said the WHO had studied the issue and the benefits of breastfeeding outweighed any risks of passing on the virus. ""We know that children are at relatively low risk of Covid-19, but are at high risk of numerous other diseases and conditions that breastfeeding prevents,"" he said at a briefing in Geneva. ""Based on the available evidence, the WHO's advice is that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of Covid-19.

Brazil is the second-worst affected country in the world, after the US, in terms of infections. Itâs on the brink of surpassing the UKâs death toll too - more than 40,000 people have now died in Brazil. There are clear hotspots in Brazil, especially in heavily populated areas. Thatâs according to Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme. Ryan said that while most intensive care units in the country were no more than around 80% full â and the health system was coping - some places had seen occupancy exceed 90% and were critical. He warned that Brazil still needed significant support to combat the virus. A baby baboon is among the West Bank zoo's new inhabitants Staff have been feeding and caring for the animals during lockdown There's been speculation that countries that have been under lockdown could see a baby boom over the next year as couples trapped at home together find ways to occupy the time. If so, humans wouldn't be the only ones. A tiny Palestinian zoo in the West Bank has had a baby boom of its own. Fifteen animals have born at Qalqilya zoo in the two months since it shut its doors to visitors - three times more than the normal number of births. One of the ostriches is rarely able to incubate her eggs, vet Sami Kahder explained, but this year she produced 11 eggs and built a nest. âBecause there werenât people around her, she was able to build a nest,â he told Reuters news agency. The monkeys are normally prone to miscarriage, he added, but now one baboon has given birth. This ostrich is among the zoo's occupants who were active during lockdown The zoo hopes visitors will want to come to see the newborns now restrictions have eased The London Coliseum, the largest theatre in the West End, is closed along with the rest of the UK capital's theatre district Theatres are ""running out"" of time and need urgent help from the UK government to stop the industry collapsing, says shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens. The Labour MP has written to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden asking for sector specific support, warning venues ""are going under"". Theatres, gig and comedy venues were ordered to shut in mid-March. Stevens says many cannot afford to reopen when restrictions are eased because of social distancing measures. She also says many actors, comedians and musicians have been excluded from Treasury support schemes, warning the prospect of no further income ""means large scale redundancies"". In response, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said many organisations have ""already benefited"" from government support. ""The UK government is
providing unprecedented financial support for the arts and culture through the
job retention scheme, a years' business rates holiday and more than
Â£200m emergency public funding,"" a DCMS spokesperson told BBC News. The DCMS added it is committed to opening arts and cultural institutions ""as soon as it
is safe to do so"". Earlier this week, Dowden said he would not ""stand by and see our world-leading position in arts and culture destroyed"".

GP Dr Debbie Noland, based in Liverpool, has been telling the BBC about how she has been adapting for a new reality.

Asked whether the pandemic might kill the high street, she said: âI donât think it's the death. I think we were always going to evolve.

A new global rugby union calendar will never come to fruitionif it cannot be agreed now, with the sport stopped because of the coronavirus pandemic, says British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland. A harmonised schedule of fixtures has been an ongoing issue in the sport and is set to be discussed at a World Rugby meeting on Monday. ""If they can't have a consensus when they've basically got a blank sheet of paper to start from, then there's never going to be agreement,"" said Gatland. In other sporting news: Â© 2025 BBC.

"Start Covid-19 inquiry now, say bereaved familiesAn immediate public inquiry could help save lives, say relatives of 450 virus victims.","Jamie Brown (left), whose father, Tony, died of Covid-19 in March, wants an urgent public inquiry Relatives of 450 people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic are demanding an immediate public inquiry. The families want an urgent review of ""life and death"" steps needed to minimise the continuing effects of the virus and a guarantee that documents relating to the crisis will be kept. A full inquiry would take place later, says lawyer, Elkan Abrahamson, who is representing the families. The government has said its current focus is on dealing with the pandemic. But the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group say immediate lessons need to be learned to prevent more deaths, and that waiting for ministers to launch an inquiry will cost lives. The call for an inquiry comes as a report from the National Audit Office -assessing the readiness of the NHS and social care in England for the pandemic,external-  has shown it is not known how many of the 25,000 people discharged from hospitals into care homes at the peak of the outbreak were infected with coronavirus. Self-isolating if traced is civic duty School in September 'part-time if 2m distancing' Health and Social Care Select Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt said it seemed ""extraordinary that no one appeared to consider"" the risk. The Department of Health says it took the ""right decisions at the right time"". Ministers have insisted throughout that their response to the pandemic has been based on scientific advice. But for Jamie Brown, whose father, Tony, died of Covid-19 in Colchester General Hospital on 29 March, two-and-a-half weeks after travelling into central London by train, the government's decision to lock down on 23 March came too late. Jamie, 28, who said his father made the journey once a week at most, believes his death was preventable. ""I can't help but believe that if we'd entered lockdown sooner he wouldn't have been exposed in the way he was,"" he said. Tony Brown, 65, became ill with a dry cough and a temperature on 17 March. He was bedridden but was adamant he would ""wait out"" the illness at home. He appeared to be getting better but on 28 March he developed chest pains. By the following morning his family were so concerned they called an ambulance, and soon after Tony reached hospital he had a cardiac arrest - caused by respiratory failure - and died. A post-mortem test confirmed Covid-19 was present. Jamie said government advice to ""stay at home"" meant his 65-year-old father did not seek medical help early enough. ""He was trying to wait it out and if you wait too long it turns out it kills you really quickly,"" he said. He added that a detailed public inquiry into the broader handling of the crisis in the UK must eventually take place, but right now he believes it is crucial that a limited inquiry starts as soon as possible. ""We need to learn the lessons immediately from what has gone wrong to get us to this point,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? The group of families, which has 450 members and is expected to grow further, is supported by the Liverpool-based law firm Broudie Jackson Canter that acted for the Hillsborough families. Their lawyer Mr Abrahamson has backed their call for an early phase to any inquiry, with full proceedings taking place once the pandemic is over. ""What we need to look at straightaway are the issues which are life-and-death decisions,"" he told the BBC. ""We expect there will be a second spike. We want to know what the government is going to do when that happens."" Mr Abrahamson said an early phase to a public inquiry would also help clarify government plans for fully reopening schools and easing the lockdown and lay out the science behind these decisions more clearly. The government has rejected calls for an early start to any public inquiry. A spokesperson said: ""At some point in the future there will be an opportunity for us to look back, to reflect and to learn some profound lessons. ""But at the moment, the most important thing to do is to focus on responding to the current situation."" The National Audit Office's report into the readiness of the NHS and social care in England for the pandemic said 25,000 people were discharged from hospitals into care homes between 17 March and 15 April. That was 10,000 fewer than the same period last year. ""It is not known how many had Covid-19 at the point of discharge,"" said the report. It said NHS England and NHS Improvement advice at the time was to urgently discharge from hospital ""all patients medically fit to leave"" in order to free up bed space for coronavirus patients. The advice was changed on 15 April but the NAO noted that, as of 17 May, one in three care homes had declared a coronavirus outbreak, with more than 1,000 homes dealing with positive cases during the peak of infections in April. It follows a separate report by care chiefs in England, who saidthere were ""tragic consequences""of moving patients from hospitals to care homes at the start of the pandemic. The Department of Health and Social Care said 60% of all care homes had avoided outbreaks entirely. Mr Hunt, a Conservative MP and former health secretary, said: ""It seems extraordinary that no-one appeared to consider the clinical risk to care homes despite widespread knowledge that the virus could be carried asymptomatically. ""Places like Germany and Hong Kong took measures to protect their care homes that we did not over a critical four-week period.""

"Trump told to back off over Seattle protest zoneThe US president threatens to ""take back"" a police-free district controlled by protesters.","This video can not be played The area taken over by activists has been called Chaz, short for Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone State authorities in the north-western US state of Washington have hit back after President Donald Trump threatened to ""take back"" a police-free district controlled by protesters in Seattle. Governor Jay Inslee said Mr Trump should stay out of the state's business, and Seattle's mayor said any invasion of the city would be illegal. Police abandoned a precinct there on Monday after days of clashes. Mr Trump said the area had been overtaken by ""domestic terrorists"". Since police withdrew, demonstrations in the area have been largely peaceful. It has been called Chaz, an abbreviation of Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Hundreds of people have been gathering there to demonstrate, hear speeches and attend events. Is Trump in trouble for his stance on race? US military chief sorry for joining Trump walk Seven solutions to US police problems The protests in Seattle, Washington began in response to last month's death in police custody of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. President Trump, who has pushed states to take firm action against protesters, has meanwhile outlined proposals for reforming police, including greater funding for training and national guidelines on the use of force. However, he dismissed calls for defunding the police as an ""extreme agenda"". Such a measure involves budgets being allocated directly to communities rather than law enforcement. Hundreds of protesters have gathered in the Chaz The area around East Precinct in Seattle became a battleground between protesters and police in the past two weeks, leading the governor to send in the National Guard and for the mayor to impose a curfew. During the violence, demonstrators threw missiles at police, cars were torched and looting broke out, according to local media. At the weekend, Seattle police used tear gas and flash bangs to disperse protesters. Members of the city council rebuked the police department, accusing them of heavy-handed tactics. Then on Monday, the mayor ordered barricades to be removed near the precinct and the police building was boarded up. Since then protesters have taken over a zone spanning about six blocks of Capitol Hill, a hub of the city's trendy arts scene that has been gentrified in recent years as tech workers drive up property prices. Protesters have hung a sign over the Seattle Police Department's now-closed East Precinct Their demands include ""defunding"" the police - reducing funding to spend more on health and other community services - better disciplinary policies for police and the dropping of criminal charges against protesters. ""My grandparents marched and they were scared of getting dogs on them and tear gas,"" said 15-year-old protester Francis Vann, quoted by the Seattle Times newspaper. ""Tear gas isn't going to hurt me, isn't going to stop me. I'm young. I just really want a change."" Artist Kimisha Turner told AFP: ""I want my son to see that everybody out here cares about him and his life.

Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan defended the right to protest and told President Trump: ""Make us all safe. Go back to your bunker."" ""The threat to invade Seattle, to divide and incite violence in our city, is not only unwelcome, it would be illegal,"" she added. Earlier this month, when protests were spreading across the US, Mr Trump threatened to send in the US Army if state governors - who oversee law and order - were unable to guarantee safety and secure property on their streets. This would involve invoking the Insurrection Act, a 19th Century law which includes details of circumstances when the government in Washington DC can intervene without state authorisation.

Trump to restart rallies on key slavery date The act says the approval of governors is not required when the president determines the situation in a state makes it impossible to enforce US laws, or when citizens' rights are threatened. This law was last invoked in 1992 during riots in Los Angeles following the acquittal of four police officers charged with assaulting black motorist Rodney King, but on that occasion the governor of California requested help. The law was used throughout the 1950s and 60s during the civil rights era by three different presidents. On some of these occasions there were objections from state governors. Police say they want to reopen the precinct and it is unclear how long the autonomous zone will remain. At a news conference on Wednesday, Assistant Chief Deanna Nollette said the police department had been abandoned because of threats that it would be vandalised or burned.

On Thursday afternoon the police chief said claims that citizens and businesses were being extorted in the zone were not true and had been based on anecdotal evidence from news and social media. Ms Best said call response times in the area served by East Precinct are normally between 5-18 minutes, but are now taking almost an hour, reports local Komo News. She said this means police are not able to respond to reports of assaults, rapes and robberies.

Border delays 'could cause fresh food problems',"Post-Brexit transition border checks could cause fresh food supply problems, an industry body has warned. Shoppers will notice the supply issues next January unless there is a ""massive upgrade"" in border facilities, the British Retail Consortium said. The warning came after cabinet minister Michael Gove said that border checks are ""inevitable"" after the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. Officials said firms have enough time to prepare for the changes. Border checks could quickly cause hold-ups at Channel ports of thousands of trucks, including those carrying fresh food, the BRC said. The government will have to ""move fast"" to put in place the necessary border infrastructure and staff to cope with those checks by the end of the year, it said. If it doesn't, ""consumers in the UK will see significant disruption, particularly in the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables"" the BRC's director of food and sustainability Andrew Opie warned. ""If you think this is going to hit us in January, that's our peak import season for things like fresh fruit and vegetables. Customers are really going to see the problems on supermarket shelves unless we get that infrastructure,"" he said. ""So, you've got enormous bureaucracy, enormous change, but crucially you've got a problem with the infrastructure at the key ports around the Channel, which currently really act as an extension of the motorway for our supply chain, where you will be holding thousands of vehicles every day."" ""I don't know if you've been to Dover recently, but there isn't an enormous amount of room to hold that infrastructure,"" he added. The warning came after Mr Gove told a Border Delivery Group event on Monday: ""The UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union, so we will have to be ready for the customs procedures and regulatory checks that will inevitably follow."" Brexit: Jargon-busting guide to the key terms Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? Brexit trade: What do the UK and EU want? The Brexit transition period is due to end at 11pm on 31 December this year. From then, there will be import checks at the UK border, and traders in the EU and UK will have extra paperwork,the government said,external. From next January, all traders will have to fill out customs declarations and be liable to customs checks on goods for cross-channel trade. If no trade deal is reached with the EU, taxes such as tariffs will also need to be charged and collected. Michael Gove said businesses must be ready for 'customs procedures and regulatory checks' Facilities such as the Channel Tunnel have been designed for minimal border checks. New customs infrastructure, facilities and systems as well as staff, agents and vets will have to be in place by the end of this year. But Mr Gove told the conference there would be light touch administration of trade across the Irish Sea. However, last week it emerged that Stena Line, the biggest operator of ferries in the Irish Sea, is preparing for trade checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It was quietly confirmed in a speech. Some might argue it has been inevitable since the election. But the change in the way the UK trade border functions with our biggest trade partner is one of the single biggest changes to the way the UK economy functions. Put simply, many industries rely on the frictionless free flow of goods between the UK and the continent. The unequivocal message from Michael Gove is that businesses should prepare for the the end of that as 2020 draws to a close. Whereas the impact of all this in the Irish Sea has garnered considerable attention, the new trading arrangements between Dover and Calais and along the Channel Tunnel will have a bigger effect on the economy. By getting businesses to take the prospect seriously, the government's hope is that more will be prepared and so delays and disruption can be limited. But we are dealing with parts of the border that are designed to run without checks. There will need to be more customs officers, thousands more customs agents, mass recruitment of vets, and new customs posts. Almost every independent economic analysis - and the government's own until now - has shown that extra trade friction with what is currently our biggest market will be an overall hit to the economy. Preparation can help alleviate some of that hit, but not all. Businesses also said they face extra costs from checks. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said that for many businesses, border delays would incur higher costs than tariffs. Adam Marshall, the BCC director general, said: ""Additional friction will equal higher costs for a lot of our business, and while the discussion over the past few months has focussed a lot on tariffs, it's actually these border costs... that really is the biggest source of cost for most."" EU trade will not be waved through with zero checks, which would have been the case under a no-deal Brexit. Traders will not be able to use special arrangements to lodge new paperwork after a grace period at a later date. Industries from car manufacturers to food distributors, which rely on the frictionless free flow of goods with the continent, say they face extra costs, delays and red tape from what are known as non-tariff barriers. Products of animal origin will need export certificates from a registered vet.

Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church.

Like many of you, we are often working from home because of lockdown restrictions. Jonathan sent this selfie from his desk in England. BBC reporter Jonathan Jurejko working from home Raees Hassain is now back at home and getting to know his three-year-old brother Ayaan Aged just six weeks, Raees Hassain, from the UK, was given only a ""remote"" chance of survival. After being diagnosed with a rare heart defect, his family were dealt another blow when he tested positive for Covid-19. But five weeks after being rushed to hospital, Raees is back at home and getting to know his three-year-old brother Ayaan. ""It was a life or death situation. Even the doctors said the odds were against us,"" said Farah, who couldn't touch her son without wearing full protective kit. ReadRaees' remarkable story- and find out how he's getting on now. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has released new guidelines for Americans as restrictions around the country ease and people return to daily life. Director Dr Robert Redfield said the ""common sense"" guidance was meant to help people stay safe ""as communities open up and they begin to re-engage in daily life"". The recommendations include: There are other guidelines for large gatherings - like protests, rallies and concerts - as well. But the CDC guidance remains to social distance, practise good hand hygiene and follow local rules. Covid-19 response manager Dr Jay Butler told reporters: ""It's not intended to endorse any particular type of event but to be applicable to any type of event that might occur."" The new tips come as Covid-19 cases are on the rise in a number of states, though re-openings are underway nationwide. ""We know the pandemic is not over,"" Dr Butler said. ""The vast majority of Americans still have not been exposed to this virus."" Disinfect shopping carts, the guidelines say Film and television production can begin in California as early as today, officials have said, as long as local Covid-19 protocols are followed. It's unlikely that production will restart immediately. The Hollywood Reporter said crews are expected to get back to work by July or August. But what might the new Covid-19 workplace look like? An industry paper on protocols agreed upon by unions, guilds and employers listed masks, regular testing and staggered meal times as part of the new guidelines. Director Tyler Perry's studios had earlier released a proposal, which called for cast testing and self-isolation before turning up on set, as well as travelling on private jets to minimise risk and tests after any such travel,according to the Reporter,external. Travellers socially distance while in line at a screening checkpoint in Orlando, Florida US airports have seen the highest number of travellers this week since the start of the pandemic, the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reported. In April, airports saw a record low of just over 87,000 travellers in one day - compared to over two million at the same time last year. But on Monday, more than 430,000 people went through TSA checkpoints. Yesterday, that number surpassed 500,000 for the first time since March. The rise in US air travel comes while Covid-19 case counts are also on the rise in states across the country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still advises people to stay home and limit travel to prevent the spread of the virus. Allow Twitter content?

Ohio Health Director Dr Amy Acton, a key official responsible for the state's often-praised pandemic response, has resigned. Governor Mike DeWine has relied heavily on Acton's expertise. It was on her guidance that Ohio imposed early restrictions and became the first state to close schools. While Acton saw national praise for Ohio's quick response to the crisis, she also saw criticism from Ohio Republicans, who tried to limit her authority, and protesters who felt the lockdown measures were too strict. Her decision to close gyms was deemed to have violated the state's constitution, and a judge wrote that she ""acted in an impermissibly arbitrary, unreasonable, and oppressive manner"". DeWine, a Republican, has continued to defend Acton and the state's actions. He said on Thursday: ""I will always believe and know that many lives were saved because of her wise advice."" Acton - who was appointed in February - will stay on as chief health adviser. Read more about DeWine, Acton and Ohio's lauded response to the pandemic here. Allow Twitter content?

The bond between mother and daughter is strong for many around the world - but none are thought to have graduated from medical school at the same time. And now, Cynthia Kudji and her daughter Jasmine are tackling the coronavirus pandemic together on the front line at the same hospital. The Ghanian-American doctors graduated a few weeks ago and have both been placed at LSU Health in Louisiana. ""It is like a dream come true,"" Cynthia told BBC Focus on Africa. ""My inspiration came from Jasmine. When you have a young child you aspire for them to be better than yourself. ""It meant so much having my daughter by my side as we went through this journey together."" The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged mothers who contract Covid-19  to continue breastfeeding their babies. Dr Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus said the WHO had studied the issue and the benefits of breastfeeding outweighed any risks of passing on the virus. ""We know that children are at relatively low risk of Covid-19, but are at high risk of numerous other diseases and conditions that breastfeeding prevents,"" he said at a briefing in Geneva. ""Based on the available evidence, the WHO's advice is that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of Covid-19. ""Mothers with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 should be encouraged to initiate and continue breastfeeding and not be separated from their infants unless the mother is too unwell,"" he said. Read more about breastfeeding and other questions asked by our readers and answered by BBC News Katy WatsonSouth America correspondent in Sao Palo President Jair Bolsonaro has opposed lockdowns and downplayed coronavirus The World Health Organization has warned that in some parts of Brazil, intensive care units are at a critical stage because of the high number of Covid-19 patients. Brazil is the second-worst affected country in the world, after the US, in terms of infections. Itâs on the brink of surpassing the UKâs death toll too - more than 40,000 people have now died in Brazil. There are clear hotspots in Brazil, especially in heavily populated areas. Thatâs according to Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme. Ryan said that while most intensive care units in the country were no more than around 80% full â and the health system was coping - some places had seen occupancy exceed 90% and were critical. He warned that Brazil still needed significant support to combat the virus. A baby baboon is among the West Bank zoo's new inhabitants Staff have been feeding and caring for the animals during lockdown There's been speculation that countries that have been under lockdown could see a baby boom over the next year as couples trapped at home together find ways to occupy the time. If so, humans wouldn't be the only ones. A tiny Palestinian zoo in the West Bank has had a baby boom of its own. Fifteen animals have born at Qalqilya zoo in the two months since it shut its doors to visitors - three times more than the normal number of births. One of the ostriches is rarely able to incubate her eggs, vet Sami Kahder explained, but this year she produced 11 eggs and built a nest. âBecause there werenât people around her, she was able to build a nest,â he told Reuters news agency. The monkeys are normally prone to miscarriage, he added, but now one baboon has given birth. This ostrich is among the zoo's occupants who were active during lockdown The zoo hopes visitors will want to come to see the newborns now restrictions have eased The London Coliseum, the largest theatre in the West End, is closed along with the rest of the UK capital's theatre district Theatres are ""running out"" of time and need urgent help from the UK government to stop the industry collapsing, says shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens. The Labour MP has written to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden asking for sector specific support, warning venues ""are going under"". Theatres, gig and comedy venues were ordered to shut in mid-March. Stevens says many cannot afford to reopen when restrictions are eased because of social distancing measures. She also says many actors, comedians and musicians have been excluded from Treasury support schemes, warning the prospect of no further income ""means large scale redundancies"". In response, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said many organisations have ""already benefited"" from government support. ""The UK government is
providing unprecedented financial support for the arts and culture through the
job retention scheme, a years' business rates holiday and more than
Â£200m emergency public funding,"" a DCMS spokesperson told BBC News. The DCMS added it is committed to opening arts and cultural institutions ""as soon as it
is safe to do so"". Earlier this week, Dowden said he would not ""stand by and see our world-leading position in arts and culture destroyed"". Dominic HughesHealth correspondent This video can not be played GP concerned for 'forgotten' non-Covid patients Covid-19 has transformed how family doctors across the UK work. GP Dr Debbie Noland, based in Liverpool, has been telling the BBC about how she has been adapting for a new reality. In between each appointment, Dr Noland must clean her consulting room and change her personal protective equipment (PPE). ""It's definitely far more challenging - and the job is challenging enough without the extra stress,"" she says. But the changes bring their own cost, with a much slower trickle of patients.

France has the fifth-highest death toll in the world and third-highest in Europe behind the UK and Italy. But, it is the 10th day in a row France has reported fewer than 100 daily deaths. As we've been reporting, another 202 people with coronavirus have died in the UK in a day. Each UK nation also reports its own Covid-19 death tolls.

All non-essential shops will beallowed to reopen in England from Monday, and councils have been outlining their plans to facilitate social distancing.They include: In Worcester, independent shops are being encouraged to operate on an appointment-only basis. ""Youâll also see hand sanitiser, one-way systems, social distancing signage as our stores get ready to open,"" said Samantha McCarthy the project and marketing manager for Worcester Business Improvement District. Asked whether the pandemic might kill the high street, she said: âI donât think it's the death. I think we were always going to evolve. The only thing this virus has done is push us to do it faster.â This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to keep safe while shopping Non-essential retailersin Northern Ireland have reopened today. Michelle Greeves, manager of Victoria Square shopping centre in Belfast, said stores had been planning how to open safely for weeks. ""We all live for retail and we've missed it so much, we've missed being able to do what we know we do well,"" she said. The manager of Londonderry's biggest shopping centre, Foyleside, said a number of public health measures were in place, including sneeze guards. This video can not be played Face coverings are beingmade compulsory for people travelling on public transportin England from 15 June. This includes buses, trains, aircraft and ferries - all to stop coronavirus from spreading. Very young children, disabled people and those with breathing difficulties will be exempt. But if you wear your face covering incorrectly, you could actually be putting yourself more at risk from coronavirus. In Japan, some customers have donned plastic facemasks in bars When people in the UK wereasked last month,externalwhat they were most looking forward to post-lockdown, only seeing friends and family ranked higher than a night out. The government has said the hospitality sector, which includes pubs and bars, could reopen ""no earlier than 4 July"". But can nightlife in the UK ever conform to social distancing rules? And what would a Covid-safe evening out look like?

Vietnam was the first country to allow football fans back in to watch matches - and there has been a huge rush by supporters to get back on the terraces. So much so that one Vietnamese top-flight match between Ha Tinh and Ha Noi had to be halted because of overcrowding. Thankfully, no-one appeared to be hurt - according to Vietnamese football expert Bill George - and the game resumed with fans stood on the running track around the pitch. Vietnam has had only 333 confirmed Covid-19 cases, recording no deaths. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A new global rugby union calendar will never come to fruitionif it cannot be agreed now, with the sport stopped because of the coronavirus pandemic, says British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland. A harmonised schedule of fixtures has been an ongoing issue in the sport and is set to be discussed at a World Rugby meeting on Monday. ""If they can't have a consensus when they've basically got a blank sheet of paper to start from, then there's never going to be agreement,"" said Gatland. In other sporting news: Â© 2025 BBC.
