Archibald wins first gold for GB,"This video can not be played Archibald wins world omnium gold Britain's Katie Archibald won gold in the women's omnium at the Track Cycling World Championships in Hong Kong. The 23-year-old Scot held off Australia's Amy Cure in the points race for her first individual world title. Britain now have three medals following asilver for Elinor Barkerandbronze for Chris Lathamin the scratch races. World Championship debutant Ryan Owens reached the quarter-finals of the men's sprint as fellow Briton and Olympic champion Callum Skinner crashed out. Follow World Track Cycling Championships on the BBC The omnium explained and other mysteries Archibald won Olympic gold alongside Barker, Laura Kenny and Joanna Rowsell Shand in the team pursuit at Rio 2016 and was world team pursuit champion in 2014. But with defending world and Olympic omnium champion Kenny pregnant with her first child, Archibald was handed an individual spot and seized her opportunity. ""I feel really privileged to pull it off,"" she said. ""It was an unbelievably grippy race, I really thought I'd lost it in the middle point but I pulled it out of the bag. ""It feels very strange, I'm used to having my girls, my team-mates, around me it's odd to celebrate by yourself but I'm looking forward to catching up with them at the hotel."" European champion Archibald won the first two events - the scratch race and the newly-added tempo race - and led by eight points at the halfway stage. She finished fifth in elimination race as rival Cure took maximum points, meaning the two were level going into the final event. Archibald edged two points clear before the final sprint of the points race, and put in a fantastic push down the final straight to secure victory. It was her first individual success on a world stage and she has had to overcome multiple setbacks on her road to individual glory. At the end of 2015, a motorbike accident forced her to withdraw from the 2016 World Championships in London and she was heavily criticised by ex-British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton. In November last year, she fractured her wrist as she partnered Manon Lloyd to victory in the inaugural women's madison at the Track Cycling World Cup in Glasgow. Elinor Barker (second left) and Katie Archibald (far right) won gold alongside Joanna Rowsell-Shand (left) and Laura Kenny (second right) in the team pursuit at Rio 2016 Olympic gold medallist Chris Boardman A wonderful performance. I thought she was completely spent in the closing stages; I genuinely didn't think that she had another sprint in her. But she just found something from somewhere to take the sprint from her rivals. She knew she only had one effort, Cure went too early but nobody could manage the speed of Archibald's final dash. Eleven-time world gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy Some of the big names are out of the British team but it's giving the younger riders a chance to shine and hopefully cement a place in the team come Tokyo 2020. Ryan Owens (left) was taken as a reserve to Rio after just nine months on the programme Earlier, Owens eased into Saturday's quarter-finals of the men's sprint. The 21-year-old, who travelled to Rio 2016 as a reserve, beat Hugo Barrette of Canada. But individual sprint Olympic silver medallist Skinner suffered a second-round exit. The 24-year-old Scot, who also won Olympic gold in the team sprint alongside Kenny and Phil Hindes in Rio, was beaten by Max Niederleg of Germany. ""The field were three or fourth tenths ahead of my pace and it makes it difficult when you come up against the second seed,"" Skinner told BBC TV. ""It's just a reflection of where we are. I can't be too disappointed."" In the men's individual pursuit, Matt Bostock and Andy Tennant finished 13th and 14th while, in the men's points race, Mark Stewart came seventh.

Cook unbeaten as Essex dominate Somerset,"Alastair Cook (left) will resume day two needing 11 for a half-century Specsavers County Championship Division One, Cooper Associates County Ground (day one): Somerset 209:Trego 48; Zaidi 3-17 Essex 60-2:Cook 39* Somerset 1 pt, Essex 3 pts Scorecard Ex-England captain Alastair Cook hit an unbeaten 39 for Essex against Somerset in his first Championship appearance since standing down as Test skipper. Cook took two slip catches in the first session as the visitors bowled Somerset out for 209 in Taunton. In bowler-friendly conditions Peter Trego (48) top scored as the home side struggled to deny Essex's bowlers. Although Nick Browne was bowled cheaply by Craig Overton, Cook held out under heavy cloud cover as Essex closed 60-2. Cook returned to the hosts' line-up after being sidelined for their first match against Lancashire with a hip injury, and the England opener took two low catches at first slip as Marcus Trescothick and new Somerset captain Tom Abell were both dismissed by Ravi Bopara. Dean Elgar (34) and James Hildreth (36) shared a 54-run third-wicket partnership, before the former was stumped off spinner Ashar Zaidi. Trego's lone resistance was ended as he top-edged Simon Harmer to Zaidi but the hosts managed to pick up a solitary batting bonus point as they edged past 200. After a short delay due to bad light and surviving a tight lbw call, Cook sent Jamie Overton for three consecutive fours as he eased into the match. Roelof van der Merwe ensured Somerset ended on a high, as he bowled Tom Westley for 10 with the final ball of the day. Somerset all-rounder Peter Trego said: ""I think it's probably slightly swung in their favour. ""It's the old cricketing clichÃ©: you can only see how good a pitch is when both sides have batted on it and Alastair Cook is a phenomenal player and he's making life look relatively easy out there and I don't think any of us did. ""It's a sporting wicket. There's certainly something there for the bowler, but you get rewarded for quality batting.""

Watch: World Track Cycling Championships,"GB's Katie Archibald wins gold in women's omnium Kristina Vogel (Ger) wins women's sprint gold Jordan Kerby (Aus) wins men's individual pursuit Men's points race GB's Mark Stewart 7th A mass-start race of 40km (160 laps). Points are scored in intermediate sprints, which are held every 10 laps, with five points for the winner followed by three, two and one for the next three over the line. There are also 20 points on offer for lapping the field. Tactics vary, with some riders sitting at the back to conserve energy and contest the intermediate sprints, while others try to gain a lap by breaking off the front and rejoining the back of the main bunch. The winner is the rider with the most points at the end of the race. A straight race against the clock over 4km. One rider starts on the back straight, one on the home straight but they are competing against the clock rather than each other. The quickest two riders in qualifying contest the final, where to win you must catch the other rider or be first to complete the distance. The omnium has had a major overhaul following the Rio 2016 Olympics, changing from a six-race event over two days to a four-race event held on a single day. The new format consists of four bunch races, with the scratch, elimination and points races retained and a new event - the tempo race - added. This also means the omnium is now a pure endurance event instead of a test of sprinting and endurance. Points are accumulated by riders in the first three events - the scratch, tempo and elimination races - with 40 points for the winner, 38 for second, 36 for third and so on. Each point then won during the final event - the points race - is added to the rider's points total. The rider with the highest score at the end of the points race is the winner. Today's events To qualify for the knockout rounds, riders must complete a 200m flying lap in the fastest time possible, with 28 now progressing instead of 24 at previous World Championships. The knockout races tend to feature slow, tactical starts, followed by a frenetic finish as two riders race against each other with the first to cross the line winning - the perceived advantage being that the rider coming from behind can draft, using less energy and thus have a better chance of being victorious. Olympic champions Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Steven Burke and Callum Skinner have been named in the squad of 20 riders, of whom 10 are making their World Championship debut. Great Britain will hope to match theirÂtable-topping five gold medalsÂ from last year's event in London but are without a number of star names. Six-time Olympic champion Jason Kenny and four-time Olympic gold medallist wife Laura, who areÂexpecting their first child,Â will miss the championships, while Bradley Wiggins has retired and Mark Cavendish is focusing on road racing. Women's endurance:Â Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Ellie Dickinson, Neah Evans, Emily Kay, Manon Lloyd, Emily Nelson Men's endurance:ÂMatt Bostock, Steven Burke, Kian Emadi, Chris Latham, Mark Stewart, Andy Tennant, Oliver Wood Sprint:ÂJack Carlin, Katy Marchant, Lewis Oliva, Ryan Owens, Callum Skinner, Joe Truman If you've been encouraged to get your lyrca on, Get Inspired has a guide on how to get started in the sportÂavailable here.

Vettel fastest in Bahrain first practice,"Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel is well placed to rival Lewis Hamilton for the drivers' title this season Bahrain Grand Prix on the BBC Dates:14-16 AprVenue:Bahrain International Circuit Coverage:Practice, qualifying and race on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra (second practice online only). Live text commentary, leaderboard and imagery on BBC Sport website and app. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel set the pace infirst practice at the Bahrain Grand Prixas title rival Lewis Hamilton was down in 10th for Mercedes. Vettel, who shares the championship lead with Hamilton, was 0.4 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo. Hamilton was 1.9secs back in 10th, but his time was set earlier in the session and is unlikely to be representative. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen stopped on the track with an engine problem. Smoke poured from the back of the Finn's car as he pulled off after Turn 13, with  Ferrari saying the problem was ""overheating in the turbo area"". Relive all the action from the first practice session Full result from first practice Hamilton was 0.366secs quicker than team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who has vowed to make amends for the spin behind the safety car in China last weekend that left him sixth as Hamilton won. Both Mercedes drivers set their fastest times in the hottest part of the day, whereas Vettel's came nearly half an hour later. First practice in Bahrain is typically not reflective of the rest of the weekend as it is held in the heat of the early afternoon, whereas qualifying and race start at twilight and track temperatures drop dramatically after dark. It was an uneventful session, and only a harmless spin by Williams driver Felipe Massa punctuated the testing. Ferrari were not the only team to suffer an engine problem - McLaren's Stoffel Vandoorne also stopped out on track when his engine cut out. The Belgian had just completed his fastest lap of the session, 2.3secs off Vettel's pace. Team-mate Fernando Alonso, who it was announced on Wednesday wouldmiss the Monaco Grand Prixto race in the Indianapolis 500, was eighth fastest, 1.675secs behind Vettel, setting his time shortly after Vandoorne's problem. Ricciardo's team-mate Max Verstappen was third fastest, 0.469secs behind the Australian, ahead of Force India's Sergio Perez, Massa and team-mate Lance Stroll, and Perez's team-mate Esteban Ocon.

SportAnalysis: How Conte has taken Mourinho's mantle14 April 2017 (06:56:20),"You can see highlights of Manchester United v Chelsea on Match of the Day 2 at 22:30 GMT on Sunday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website. There is pride, as well as points, at stake at Old Trafford on Sunday because Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho will not take it well if Antonio Conte beats him in his own backyard. Conte has not just won both their previous meetings this season, his Chelsea side are 18 points above United and closing in on the Premier League title. I did not expect the gap between the two teams to be so big but nobody could have foreseen how well Conte would do in what is a highly competitive league - I certainly didn't. If you are looking for a comparison, you could say his impact in his first season in the Premier League has been Mourinho-esque - the same as when Jose first came to England in 2004 and blew everyone away. In many ways, Conte is the new Mourinho - he has only been in England for eight months but has already taken over his mantle. By that, I mean the way Conte has been the outstanding manager this season with his results and how he has implemented his style of play to build a team that is exciting to watch and a threat going forward. Just as with Mourinho, you would not exactly say that everyone loves him, but most people admire the job he has done at Chelsea, and his enthusiasm and charisma too. This video can not be played FA Cup: Chelsea 1-0 Manchester United highlights Mourinho may see a bit of himself in Conte and I would understand if he is a bit envious of the success the Italian has had. He has stolen his thunder with what is essentially Mourinho's team, and got so much more out of the group of players he was left with after Mourinho's second spell at the club. I was one of those who thought Mourinho would quickly transform United in a similar way, but they simply have not made the same transition since he took charge. Yes, there are signs of improvement from the Louis van Gaal era but I still think United will finish outside the top four, which is pretty unacceptable when you consider how much money they have spent. If they do not qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League, then you cannot get away from the fact that this season will be a distinctly disappointing one. I am not suggesting Mourinho is going to get the sack in that scenario - or that he should do - but, for United and for him, is winning the League Cup and finishing fifth or sixth really enough? Fourth official Mike Jones separates Mourinho and Conte during Chelsea's FA Cup win over United in March Mourinho has already clashed with Conteon the touchline this season,and he will be absolutely desperate to beat him this time. I don't think United can play an open game against Chelsea on Sunday because, if they try to go toe to toe with them, the way Conte's team counter-attack will really cause them problems. So I am expecting a cagey affair. If you asked me to pick a winner I would go with the Blues but I just have a feeling Zlatan Ibrahimovic will play a big part in the outcome. I would not put it past him to do something special to decide the game - but even if United do come out on top at Old Trafford, they face a huge task to break into the top four now. Looking at their remaining fixtures, they will need to go on an unbelievable run in some difficult games. At the same time, they have to hope Liverpool or Manchester City slip up because the top two seem to be too far clear now. You cannot rule United out of winning all of those games, simply because of who they are and the quality they have in their team. But, on this season's form, I just cannot see it. United are unbeaten for 21 league games, going back totheir 4-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge in October,but it is their inability to score goals that has been the determining factor in where they are in the table, because they have not beaten a lot of teams you would expect them to run riot against. United's current ratio of goals per league game in 2016-17 is 1.53. The only season since 1990 in which it has been lower was Louis van Gaal's second as United manager (1.29). They have scored one more than Bournemouth and have the lowest total in the top six by a significant amount. I don't think anyone imagined them struggling so badly in front of goal. Van Gaal, Mourinho's predecessor at Old Trafford, was criticised heavily for his brand of football - but his United team scored more goals in his first season, and so did David Moyes' side. United's trademark style is 'attack, attack, attack' but apart from Ibrahimovic they have been blunt when they have come forward. Ibrahimovic has had a fantastic season and bailed them out on countless occasions but it feels like they rely solely on him to score, and that has been their biggest problem. Jose Mourinho vs Louis van Gaal and David Moyes at Man Utd after 30 PL games Manager Moyes Van Gaal Mourinho Wins 15 17 15 Draws 6 8 12 Defeats 9 5 3 Points 51 59 57 Goals scored 48 52 46 Goals conceded 34 27 24 Win % 50% 56.7% 50% League position 7 4 5 Mourinho is right when he says his other attacking players need to be more consistent, but topublicly criticise the likes of Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford,externalis a risky tactic. We have seen something similar withhis treatment of Luke Shaw,and nowthere are rumours he has had a bust-up with David de Gea too.,external This video can not be played Mourinho's scathing assessment of Luke Shaw I can understand what he is saying about Shaw being in the last-chance saloon but, for whatever reason, there is not complete harmony in the United camp at the moment. That is the other big difference between what Conte has achieved at Chelsea, and the way he has done it - because it appears there is total harmony there, with everyone pulling in the same direction. Whatever he is talking about, Mourinho's whole demeanour as a manager seems to have changed - he used to be witty and charming when he spoke to the media, but now he is painful to watch. This video can not be played Man Utd 0-0 West Brom: Jose Mourinho in disbelief at question All of that sort of behaviour seems to be an attempt to deflect attention from some of the issues affecting his team. For example, when he spoke to the BBC's Conor McNamara after United drew at home to West Brom, his emphasis was on pulling Conor up for his question, rather than concentrating on the matter in hand - which is why his team are not doing well enough in the final third of the pitch. As of 14 April, it is 211 days since United were last in the Premier League's top four (on 15 September) and 237 days since they were top (on 19 August). They are currently fifth but were sixth for 104 consecutive days until 18 March The buck has to stop with Mourinho at some point - he will know himself that he has to do better, and he has a lot of work to do. This is his first season at United and, in his defence, you could argue this is not his team yet. But that argument does not really work when you think about how quickly Conte has made a difference at Chelsea, and how far United are behind them. United have already invested heavily in their team in the past three years - Mourinho has spent about Â£150m, and Van Gaal about another Â£250m in his time in charge, which is an astonishing amount to lay out and still be outside the top four. To change that, it looks like they will have to do the same again this summer, but how much more money will they throw at it, and where does the spending stop? The United fans have been exceptionally patient with Mourinho so far but I am not sure if that will last going into next season if they miss out on the Champions League again.

We have seen something similar withhis treatment of Luke Shaw,and nowthere are rumours he has had a bust-up with David de Gea too.,external This video can not be played Mourinho's scathing assessment of Luke Shaw I can understand what he is saying about Shaw being in the last-chance saloon but, for whatever reason, there is not complete harmony in the United camp at the moment. That is the other big difference between what Conte has achieved at Chelsea, and the way he has done it - because it appears there is total harmony there, with everyone pulling in the same direction. Whatever he is talking about, Mourinho's whole demeanour as a manager seems to have changed - he used to be witty and charming when he spoke to the media, but now he is painful to watch. This video can not be played Man Utd 0-0 West Brom: Jose Mourinho in disbelief at question All of that sort of behaviour seems to be an attempt to deflect attention from some of the issues affecting his team. For example, when he spoke to the BBC's Conor McNamara after United drew at home to West Brom, his emphasis was on pulling Conor up for his question, rather than concentrating on the matter in hand - which is why his team are not doing well enough in the final third of the pitch. As of 14 April, it is 211 days since United were last in the Premier League's top four (on 15 September) and 237 days since they were top (on 19 August). They are currently fifth but were sixth for 104 consecutive days until 18 March The buck has to stop with Mourinho at some point - he will know himself that he has to do better, and he has a lot of work to do. This is his first season at United and, in his defence, you could argue this is not his team yet. But that argument does not really work when you think about how quickly Conte has made a difference at Chelsea, and how far United are behind them. United have already invested heavily in their team in the past three years - Mourinho has spent about Â£150m, and Van Gaal about another Â£250m in his time in charge, which is an astonishing amount to lay out and still be outside the top four. To change that, it looks like they will have to do the same again this summer, but how much more money will they throw at it, and where does the spending stop? The United fans have been exceptionally patient with Mourinho so far but I am not sure if that will last going into next season if they miss out on the Champions League again.

RSC Anderlecht 1-1 Manchester United,"Leander Dendoncker's goal sends the tie back to Old Trafford level Manchester United were left to rue missed chances as Anderlecht salvaged a late draw to change the complexion of their Europa League quarter-final tie. Leander Dendoncker got in front of Matteo Darmian to head an equaliser with the Belgian side's first effort on goal four minutes from time. Until that moment United had subdued the hosts, and deservedly led when Henrikh Mkhitaryan tapped in from a tight angle after Marcus Rashford's shot was spilled in the first half. But the Armenian side-footed wide when well placed after the break and Paul Pogba fired into the shins of goalkeeper Ruben to leave Jose Mourinho's side vulnerable to the sucker punch landed by 21-year-old Dendoncker. 'I have no better word than sloppy' - Mourinho blames his attack Relive Anderlecht v Manchester United Henrikh Mkhitaryan has scored in four successive away European appearances for Manchester United United's Europa League odyssey this term has taken in disappointing evenings away to Feyenoord, Fenerbahce and Rostov, and Mourinho's frustration in Brussels will centre on a decent performance undermined by lax finishing and a late defensive lapse. Since his last foray into second-tier European competition in 2003, the Portuguese has become accustomed to the bright lights of the Champions League, winning it twice and disparagingpredecessor Rafael Benitez's Europa League success after taking over at Chelsea in 2013. But United's position in the Premier League - four points off the top four with games running out - has forced him to revise his attitude. For most of the match, his team seemed focused on the task. Just five games away from booking a return to the Champions League - Uefa's sweetener for winning the competition - they looked solid in defence and slick in attack. For their part, Anderlecht's enterprising young team offered little, deprived of possession and restricted to efforts from distance - but all that changed with Dendoncker's late goal. United will still fancy their chances of finishing the job at Old Trafford next week, but with more dangerous opponents elsewhere in the draw - notably Lyon and Schalke - similar mistakes could easily derail their progress to May's final. Rashford has eight goals in 42 appearances this season for United Mourinho claimed that his attackers let down their defensive colleagues in his post-match interview, but it seemed harsh to burden Rashford with a share of the blame after one of his brightest performances of the season. The 19-year-old - whose goal return wasrecently questioned by Mourinho,external- was heavily involved before being replaced by Marouane Fellaini in the 75th minute. He roamed dangerously from the left, tormenting full-back Dennis Appiah and threatening with a dipping shot from distance before creating the opener as Ruben failed to grasp his sweetly struck shot His industry in the opposite direction also caught the eye as he diligently tracked Anderlecht's runners. It was the sort of all-around performance that Mourinho usually demands of his attacking players but, publicly at least, the boss seemed nonplussed. The full-back was solid at the back and added an edge in attack for United Of players who have scored at least two goals, only Zlatan Ibrahimovic (134) has a better minutes-per-goal rate than Mkhitaryan (212) for Manchester United in all competitions this season. The Red Devils are unbeaten in their last four European away games (W2 D2), after losing each of the five before that. Leander Dendoncker scored with Anderlecht's only shot on target of the game. Paul Pogba attempted 127 passes in the game, the fourth-highest total by a player in a Europa League game this season. He is also second with 130 against Zorya Luhansk on 29 September. Manchester United play Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday before the second leg at Old Trafford next Thursday. Anderlecht play KV Oostende on Sunday in the Belgian top flight.

Is artificial intelligence racist?,"Only white babies appear in a search for ""babies"" on Microsoft search engine Bing... There is growing concern that many of the algorithms that make decisions about our lives - from what we see on the internet to how likely we are to become victims or instigators of crime - are trained on data sets that do not include a diverse range of people. The result can be that the decision-making becomes inherently biased, albeit accidentally. Try searching online for an image of ""hands"" or ""babies"" using any of the big search engines and you are likely to find largely white results. In 2015, graphic designer Johanna Burai created theWorld White Web project,externalafter searching for an image of human hands and finding exclusively white hands in the top image results on Google. Her website offers ""alternative"" hand pictures that can be used by content creators online to redress the balance and thus be picked up by the search engine. Google says its image search results are ""a reflection of content from across the web, including the frequency with which types of images appear and the way they're described online"" and are not connected to its ""values"". Ms Burai, who no longer maintains her website, believes things have improved. ""I think it's getting better... people see the problem,"" she said. ""When I started the project people were shocked. Now there's much more awareness."" ...and white hands appear if you type ""hands"" into Google. TheAlgorithmic Justice League,external(AJL) was launched by Joy Buolamwini, a postgraduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in November 2016. She was trying to use facial recognition software for a project but it could not process her face - Ms Buolamwini has dark skin. ""I found that wearing a white mask, because I have very dark skin, made it easier for the system to work,"" she says. ""It was the reduction of a face to a model that a computer could more easily read."" It was not the first time she had encountered the problem. Five years earlier, she had had  to ask a lighter-skinned room-mate to help her. ""I had mixed feelings. I was frustrated because this was a problem I'd seen five years earlier was still persisting,"" she said. ""And I was amused that the white mask worked so well."" Joy Buolamwini found her computer system recognised the white mask, but not her face. Ms Buolamwini describes the reaction to the AJL as ""immense and intense"". This ranges from teachers wanting to show her work to their students, and researchers wanting her to check their own algorithms for signs of bias, to people reporting their own experiences. And there seem to be quite a few. One researcher wanted to check that an algorithm being built to identify skin melanomas (skin cancer) would work on dark skin. ""I'm now starting to think, are we testing to make sure these systems work on older people who aren't as well represented in the tech space?"" Ms Buolamwini says. ""Are we also looking to make sure these systems work on people who might be overweight, because of some of the people who have reported it? It is definitely hitting a chord."" Ms Buolamwini thinks the situation has arisen partly because of the well-documented lack of diversity within the tech industry itself. Every year the tech giants release diversity reports and they make for grim reading. Google's latest figures,external(January 2016) state that 19% of its tech staff are women and just 1% are black. At Microsoft in September 2016,external17.5% of the tech workforce were women and 2.7% black or African American. At Facebook in June 2016,externalits US tech staff were 17% women and 1% black. You get the picture. But what has that got to do with algorithms? ""If you test your system on people who look like you and it works fine then you're never going to know that there's a problem,"" Joy Buolamwini argues. Of the 44 winners of a beauty contest last year judged by algorithms, and based on some 6,000 uploaded selfies from 100 different countries, only one was non-white and a handful were Asian. Alex Zhavoronkov, Beauty.AI's chief science officer,told the Guardian the result was flawed because the data set used to train the AI (artifical intelligence) had not been diverse enough,external. ""If you have not that many people of colour within the data set, then you might actually have biased results,"" he said at the time. On a more serious note, AI software used in the US to predict which convicted criminals might reoffend, was found to be more likely to incorrectly identify black offenders as high risk and white offenders as low risk,according to a study by the website Propublica,external(the software firm disputed these findings). Suresh Venkatasubramanian, an associate professor at the University of Utah school of computing, says creators of AI need to act now while the problem is still visible. ""The worst that can happen is that things will change and we won't realise it,"" he told the BBC. ""In other words the concern has been that the bias, or skew, in decision-making will shift from things we recognise as human prejudice to things we no longer recognise and therefore cannot detect - because we will take the decision-making for granted."" Are we accidentally programming prejudiced robots? He is however optimistic about tech's progress. ""To say all algorithms have racist manifestations doesn't make sense to me,"" he says. ""Not because it's impossible but because that's not how it's actually working. ""In the last three to four years what's picked up is the discussion around the problems and possible solutions,"" he adds. He offers a number of these: creating better and more diverse data sets with which to train the algorithms (they learn by processing thousands of, for example, images) sharing best practice among software vendors, and building algorithms which explain their decision making so that any bias can be understood. Ms Buolamwini says she is hopeful that the situation will improve if people are more aware of the potential problems. ""Any technology that we create is going to reflect both our aspirations and our limitations,"" she says. ""If we are limited when it comes to being inclusive that's going to be reflected in the robots we develop or the tech that's incorporated within the robots."" Can AI create a meritocracy?

When celebrities eat their own words,"In 2015, John Cleese said there was ""no way"" he'd ever work at the BBC again. Nowhe has changed his mindafter announcing he will make a new BBC sitcom that will reunite him with his Clockwise co-star Alison Steadman. Cleese isn't the first celebrity to go back on his very public word. From Charlie Simpson's Busted to Bond star Sean Connery, it's wise to never say never again. Busted busted in 2005 There are some bands that will never get back together. Abba. The Jam. The Smiths. Then there are those that ""will never get back together"".Like The Stone Roses,external. And Busted. The group that had eight top 10 hits in the 2000s, and sent many a teenage girl all aflutter, split in 2005 when frontman Charlie Simpson left. Simpsontold BBC Newsbeat""not in a million years"" would they reform. But some 999,990 years before that date, Simpson announced they were getting back together after all. Speaking at the time of their reunion in November 2015, Simpson said: ""I reckon I said it 20 more times than that, privately and publicly, and I meant it every single time. ""But as I say, I have changed my mind, and that has been down to the circumstances changing. I never thought we would get to a point where we were in a studio writing music we all got behind creatively and that was a huge shock to me."" The band played UK arenas in 2016 with the aptly named Pigs Can Fly Tour. Gervais returned to the Globes not once, not twice, but three times When Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globe awards in 2010, offending half of Hollywood in the process, he told the relieved A-list audience: ""It's OK folks, I won't be doing this again."" But he returned the following year, and again in 2012, before announcing very publicly he would not be back. On his blog after the 2012 ceremony, the acerbic comic wrote: ""I've told my agent to never let me be persuaded to do it again though. It's like a parachute jump. You can only really enjoy it in retrospect when you realise you didn't die and it was quite an amazing thing to do."" Four years later, he headed back. Employing a good old British turn of phrase, Gervais tweeted: ""It's a good job I'm drunk. Otherwise the thought of hosting The Golden Globes again would seem like a real pain in the arse."" Whoopi Goldberg was one of several Hollywood stars who threatened to quit the US What do Whoopi Goldberg, Miley Cyrus, Amy Schumer, Chloe Sevigny and Ne-Yo have in common? They all should be living in Canada or Europe after vowing to leave the US if Donald Trump was elected President. But they're not. Some hastily tweeted U-turns when Trump was elected, others went quiet and hoped nobody would remember. Goldberg said ""I'm not leaving the country I was born and raised in,"" while Schumer used social media to declare her pledge to move to Spain was merely a ""joke"". Cyrus released an emotional video the morning after Trump's win saying she ""accepted"" the new president. Samuel L Jackson, who had been succinct in his intentions, also backed out. ""If that mother... becomes president, I'm moving my black ass to South Africa,"" he said. He didn't. Charlie Chaplin returned to Europe in 1952 In the early 1950s, Charlie Chaplin reportedly said he had ""no further use for America"" and ""wouldn't go back there if Jesus Christ was President"". After a series of political controversies, personal scandals and falling audiences, he decided to hold the world premiere of Limelight in London, where the film was set, rather than the US, where he had settled. Boarding the RMS Queen Elizabeth in New York in 1952, he received word that his re-entry permit had been revoked and he would have to be interviewed about his political views and moral behaviour if he wanted to return. He said: ""I have been the object of lies and propaganda by powerful reactionary groups who, by their influence and by the aid of America's yellow press, have created an unhealthy atmosphere in which liberal-minded individuals can be singled out and persecuted."" By 1972, feelings had softened on both sides and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences offered Chaplin an honorary Oscar. Chaplin was given a 12-minute standing ovation, the longest in the Academy's history, as he accepted his award for ""the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century"". Daniel Craig (left) and Sean Connery are regularly voted the best Bonds Daniel Craig famously said he would ""rather slash my wrists"" than reprise his role as 007 fifth time. ButThe Sun reported last week,externalhe was ""ready to do a final Bond"". It isn't confirmed, but the newspaper said film producer Barbara Broccoli had almost persuaded him to get back on board one last time. Craigis regarded as one of the best Bonds of all time,external- and it seems the best Bonds are also the most fickle. In 1983, Sean Connery returned to the role for the seventh and last time in Never Say Never Again, with the title being more than a subtle nod to Connery's reported remarks that he would ""never again"" play Bond.

Just what are Trump's trade priorities?,"Trade was one of the dominant themes in Donald Trump's election campaign. He often focused on particular US trade partners. Mexico and China were most frequently in his sights. And one of his first actions as president was towithdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade deal, agreed by his predecessor but which had not come into force. So what are President Trump's priorities for trade? What does he hope to achieve? He often focuses on trade imbalances: the US deficit in trade with the rest of the world and bilateral deficits too. Here are somefigures,external. Last year the US had a deficit of half a trillion dollars in trade in goods and services with the rest of the world. For China, the bilateral deficit was close to $350bn (Â£280bn). For Japan, Germany and Mexico, the figures were in the range of $60-70bn. President Trump considers these figures to be evidence that the US has done badly, that it has been treated unfairly. Mexico,he has said,external, is ""killing us on jobs and trade"". He has expressed similar views onChina: ""We are like the piggy bank that's being robbed."" Trump and trade: A radical agenda? Is Trump wise to take on China over trade? What is the World Trade Organization? His trade adviser Peter Navarro told the Financial Times that Germany uses a grossly undervalued euro to exploit its trade partners, essentially arguing that the exchange rate gives Germany a competitive advantage that's unfair. Mr Trump has also criticised Japan for barriers to American car exports and for manipulating its currency to gain a competitive advantage. He wants to see a reversal of the decline in manufacturing employment that the US has experienced. (Thenumber of jobs in manufacturing,externaldropped sharply in the 2000s, thoughthe share of total employment,externalhas been falling for decades.) So where do those concerns lead President Trump's trade agenda? His bilateral discussions have got off to a somewhat gentler start than his campaign language might have led us to expect. He held asummit with Chinese President Xi Jinpinglast weekend. Mr Trump said ""tremendous progress"" had been made in talks with Mr Xi They agreed a 100-day programme of talks. The US expects China to offer better access to its market, including for beef and services companies. Mr Trump's campaign language about possibly imposing largetariffs on imports from China, as much as 45%, was not on display this time. One China critic in the US, Gordon Chang,asked,external: ""Did Trump just roll over on China trade?"" And just days after meeting President Xi, Mr Trump said his administrationwould not label China a currency manipulator, rowing back on a campaign promise. China's critics have a wide-ranging list of allegations about unfair practices - subsidies to Chinese industries, dumping underpriced goods, and the theft of patents and copyright. With Mexico, President Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), a deal that dramatically reduced barriers to commerce between the US, Mexico and also Canada. Most goods are traded free of tariffs (taxes applied only to traded goods). He has said that Nafta was the worst trade deal the US has ever done, that it kills American jobs. How would he like to change it? He has threatened a number of carmakers with ""border taxes"" (that is tariffs) if they expand production in Mexico for export to the US market. Donald Trump is not popular in Mexico That would be inconsistent with Nafta as it currently stands and it's hard to see how it would comply with any amendments to Nafta that the Mexican government would be willing to accept. It's also almost certain that such action would be incompatible withWorld Trade Organization (WTO) rules. But there are signs that the administration's approach may in the event be softer. There is a draft letter from the administration to Congress setting out objectives for a renegotiation. National Public Radio described the proposed changes as""tweaks"",external. There is quite a long list of areas proposed for revision, including a right to re-impose tariffs (probably temporarily) in response to a surge in imports and an effort to remove barriers to US exports to the other two countries. There is also a call to look at what are called ""rules of origin"", which specify how much of a product's value has to be added in the Nafta area to qualify for tariff-free treatment. A higher threshold could make it harder to use components made in China, for example. But what is clear is that this is about revising rather than scrapping Nafta. It's also unclear exactly what Mr Trump would do about disputes in trade with other countries. Options include making more aggressive use of the WTO's rules for disputes. There is its judicial dispute settlement system, and there are actions that countries can take unilaterally against subsidised or dumped imports (sold abroad more cheaply than in the producer's home market), provided they do it in a way that is set out in WTO rules. What worries many trade experts is that the Trump administration might be ready to bypass WTO rules and impose new barriers to imports regardless of the organisation's rules. It would be a very serious, possibly fatal blow for the credibility of the agency if the world's largest economy were not to take it and its rules seriously. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin at the recent G20 meeting; the G20 dropped an anti-protectionist commitment after opposition from the US The WTO is at the heart of a system of international trade relations, based on rules that started to take shape soon after World War Two. Althoughthe WTO itself wasn't established until 1995, much of the rulebook that it now manages goes back to the late 1940s. There is a lot of anxiety among trade officials about just how the global trade system might unravel if the WTO were seriously undermined.  The concern is that there could be widespread new restrictions arising and their view - shared by the great majority of economists - is that increased trade protectionism would be bad for living standards around the world. It certainly caused a lot of anxiety when a recent meeting of finance ministers from the G20 leading economiesdropped from its communiquea remark that had previously been routinely included about avoiding trade protectionism, something that was done at the insistence of the US delegation. So we certainly have some new questions about what role the US will take in shaping the future of the global trading system. President Trump's most strident campaign comments haven't yet been fully reflected in the actions of his administration, with the exception perhaps of the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But it is still very early days. G20 drops anti-protectionist pledge What is the World Trade Organization?

He lives in a place where Russian and separatist flags fly above government buildings and Russian roubles buy you mainly Russian goods. The Kremlin recently said that separatist IDs could be used to travel east over the border into Russia. A Ukrainian soldier checks a woman's passport as she waits to enter the separatist-controlled east Despite close financial and military ties with the two so-called separatist republics, Moscow has still not officially recognised them or taken the land as its own. More from Tom Burridge in Ukraine Ukraine nationalist blockade threatens economy A new, bloody chapter Russia accepts passports issued by Ukraine rebels And despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary, the Kremlin still denies it has armed, and fought alongside, the separatist armies. The conflict is entering its fourth year and Anatoliy says life under the separatists ""couldn't be worse"". Others complain there are no jobs for the young, that basic goods are expensive and that shooting and shelling never stops. Anatoliy does not like ""what Putin has done"" to eastern Ukraine. ""Ukraine used to be whole and undivided. Why the hell did he come here?"" he asks. But one woman does not like what she hears and interrupts.  She blames Ukraine for ""creating this concentration camp"". The separatist-held east is more cut off from the rest of Ukraine than ever before. And the crossing point now at least feels like a border. With the right paperwork, people can move back and forth past a network of military checkpoints on either side. Now, though, the Ukrainian government has blocked the movement of all commercial goods across the frontline. This video can not be played 'I'm so sick of this war' - Ukraine woman tells of loss It did so because the separatists seized Ukrainian-owned businesses in the territory they control. The separatists were themselves responding to an initial blockade of rail lines by former Ukrainian soldiers, who said trade with Ukraine across the frontline was funding the separatist armies. The war had already greatly damaged eastern Ukraine's coal and steel plants. Now this valuable industrial network has been sliced in two, causing unquantifiable economic pain on either side. The Avdiikva coke plant is among the biggest in Europe and helps fuel Ukraine's steel industry Despite the risks so close to the frontline, keeping the plant running is vital for Ukraine For Ukraine analyst Michael Bociurkiw it is a ""set of very bad developments"" that makes the chances of eastern Ukraine being incorporated back into the rest of the country less likely. ""It's another nail in the coffin for Minsk."" He means the peace agreement, signed by Russia and Ukraine in the Belarusian capital Minsk in early 2015. Mr Bociurkiw worked extensively in eastern Ukraine for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE is responsible for monitoring the conflict, in order to pressure both sides into obeying the still elusive ceasefire. For him, the war could be resolved in one phone call between Moscow and Washington. ""But unless there is political will, I don't think we are going to see peace any time soon."" Ukrainian ex-soldiers began a blockade to stop goods going to and from the separatists Repeated attempts to implement a lasting ceasefire have failed. And that means more loss of life. ""What are we losing our parents for?"" asks Nadia, 22. Her mother, Katya, was killed in the town of Avdiivka by a mortar round or shell as she walked home. ""Why are people dying?"" she says as tears run slowly down her cheeks. ""Make them stop all of this. Make them sign treaties in Minsk or whatever,"" she says, appealing to those with power on either side of the conflict. ""Do anything so that this is over soon.""

The next Harry Potter words to join the dictionary?,"Quidditch is the second word invented by the Harry Potter author to join the English language Quidditch - the game played by Harry Potter - is now magically appearing in the Oxford Dictionaries, joining that other Potter term ""muggle"". But what other words dreamed up by author JK Rowling are on the cusp of gaining official recognition? Potterhead... Wrock... Bellatrix... three terms that muggles may not understand. And if you need to be told what a muggle is in the first place, then you can at least consult a dictionary on that one. The BBC has learned that another small list of words associated with the Harry Potter book series is on the Oxford University Press watchlist, which decides on the words likely to gain inclusion in its dictionaries. Potterhead refers to a fan of Harry Potter, while Wrock [short for Wizard Rock] is a genre of Harry Potter-related music. Bellatrix is the name of a character in the series, which Rowling named after a star in the Orion constellation. Rowling's word ""muggle"" made its debut in 1997's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone The Oxford University Press has a vast database of some three billion words ready for editors to consider for publication in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and the website Oxford Dictionaries. The OED is a historical dictionary which records all the core words and meanings in English over more than 1,000 years, while the latter tracks ""current"" English and includes modern meanings of words. Most words have to be in circulation for 10 years before they will be considered for the OED, but in the meantime many enter the Oxford Dictionaries website after careful consideration. Rowling's word ""muggle"" - which made its debut in 1997's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - was an exception to the rule. Muggle leapt into the Oxford English Dictionary in less than half the usual time, appearing in 2002 as ""a person who lacks a particular skill or skills, or who is regarded as inferior in some way"". Charlotte Buxton, an associate editor at Oxford Dictionaries, explained that some words are fast-tracked if they ""cross into our world"" quickly and are widely used. She said: ""It's fairly unusual for a made-up word to get in. They have to move beyond the book - quidditch is now a real sport, not just a made-up game. ""It is really significant as it shows that Harry Potter has had such a huge impact."" Ms Buxton said she thought ""Horcrux"" - an object which contains a wizard's evil - might be next on Oxford Dictionaries' radar. She added: ""Harry Potter could be ripe for a project."" Other realms which have crossed into ours include The Simpsons animated comedy show Previous Oxford University Press projects include last year's focus onRoald Dahl as a celebration of the centenary of his birth. Almost 8,000 real words - and invented ones - were included in a special Roald Dahl dictionary, which took five years to compile. Of these words, several do have a place in the OED, including golden ticket, oompa loompa and human bean. Ms Buxton said it has been children's authors, such as Dahl, who have tended to coin the most new words over the last century because they are the most playful and creative. ""In particular, authors who create their own language - such as [Lord of the Rings author] JRR Tolkien. He created a complete world with its own language. ""Writers who do that - like JK Rowling - really make their mark."" she said. Other realms which have crossed into ours are the fantasy fiction of Twilight, and the animated comedy show The Simpsons. The Simpsons lays claim to three words in Oxford Dictionaries: Jeebus, cromulent and embiggen. It is also credited for popularising the word ""meh"" - which has been added to the OED. ""Children's books are read by children and by adults to their children, which leads to words being used within the family and beyond,"" Ms Buxton said. This gives the words better staying power. Meanwhile, realist authors, such as the Victorian author Charles Dickens, tend not to create as many new words as they are concerned with reflecting the real world, she said. It is William Shakespeare who is famously credited for having the biggest influence on the English language - providing the first evidence of more than 1,600 words, from ""admired"" to ""watch-dog"" and ""night owl"". But Ms Buxton says it is hard to know how many words Shakespeare invented and how many he simply recorded. What we do know is that not all of them stood the test of time: has anyone met a ""flirt-gill"" recently? Superman:A translation of the German Ãbermensch used by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche to denote the concept of an ""ideal superior man of the future"". Blatant:Invented by Edmund Spenser in his epic poem The Faerie Queene (1596), where he wrote of a ""blatant beast"". Robot:Coined by the Czech author Karel Capek, robot made its first appearance in a 1920 sci-fi play called R.U.R, short for Rossum's Universal Robots. Cyberspace:Invented by William Gibson for a 1981 science fiction short story called Burning Chrome, which was published in Omni magazine in 1982. Serendipity:Coined by Horace Walpole in a letter he wrote to Horace Mann in 1754, after the title of the fairy tale The Three Princes of Serendip, the heroes of which 'were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of'. Eucatastrophe:Coined by JRR Tolkien in a 1944 letter to describe ""a sudden and favourable resolution of events in a story; a happy ending"". Doublethink:In George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four he created a language called Newspeak which included the word doublethink - which refers to the acceptance of contrary opinions or beliefs at the same time. Blurb:Coined in 1907 by the American humourist Gelett Burgess, ""blurb"" was first found on a comic book jacket embellished with a drawing of a young lady whom Burgess dubbed ""Miss Belinda Blurb"". Chortle:Introduced by Lewis Carroll in Through the Looking Glass, published in 1871, the word is probably a blend of chuckle and snort. Cloud cuckoo land:In his comedy Birds, the ancient Greek playwright Aristophanes named the city built by the birds to separate the gods from mankind - it was translated into English in 1824 as ""cloud cuckoo land"".

A guide to the 'misunderstood' millennials,"Lots of people have been having their say about so-called millennials recently - and now MPs are getting their own guide. Researchers at the House of Commons have produced a handbook for its 650 members - whose average age is 50 - full of statistics about what they call the ""generation much talked about and arguably misunderstood"". Like the baby boomers and Generation X before them, this group have acquired their own tag, although there is debate about the exact parameters of the group. So who is a millennial? According to this guide, it defines the generation as those now aged 25 to 34. Totnes in Devon - not many millennials That means they would have experienced at least some, if not all, of their teenage years and early adulthood in the 21st Century. And now the House of Commons Library, which describes itself as a ""bespoke enquiry service to MPs and their staff"", has assessed this millennial generation in 50 pages ofstatistics and research,external. Here are some of its key findings: The millennials are ""more urban and diverse"" than older people. More than a quarter were born abroad, more than for any other age group. The area with the highest proportion of millennials  is Battersea in London while the lowest is Totnes in Devon. There are 39 millennial MPs currently sitting in the House of Commons (plus one, the SNP's Mhairi Black, who at 22 is too young to squeeze into that definition.) The retail sector is a common employer of millennials Employment rates among millennials are at a ""near record high"", the report says. But it's not all good news - their wages have suffered more than other age groups since the recession in 2008, when many were just entering the world of work. The report points toresearch,externalshowing that millennials do not follow the usual pattern of having higher average pay than the generation before them. They are most likely to work in the wholesale and retail sector, followed by health and social work. And unsurprisingly, millennials are less wealthy than older generations, having had less time to accumulate savings. To illustrate the point, half of households led by a millennial have net wealth of Â£700 or less. However in the 65 to 74 age group, half have accumulated Â£22,700 or more, the report says. They will also have to wait longer to receive their state pension than previous generations. Millennials 'set to earn less than generation X' It will not be news to many millennials, but they are much less likely to own their own home than previous generations. The report says 59% of households led by a millennial are renting, with 38% owning their own home. It has not always been this way - 20 years ago, the report says, young people were more likely to own than rent. But now millennials are less likely to own their own home - and more likely to rent in the private sector - than any other age group. In the past 20 years there has also been a slight increase in the proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds living with their parents, the report says, citing Office for National Statistics figures. This is the case for 14% of millennials. Millennials were more likely to have voted to stay in the EU, polls suggest Millennials were most likely to have voted Labour in the 2015 election, according to a post-election survey - which put Labour on 32.4% to the Tories' 28.7%. But they were also some of the least likely people to turn out to vote. Millennial turnout was higher in last year's EU referendum, and they were ""far more likely"" to vote Remain, the Commons research says. As for their view on the world, the report adds: ""Recent significant world events such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crises are seen as having a major impact on millennials' socio-political outlook. ""For example... it is argued that millennials have experienced long term 'scarring' in the labour market by having the misfortune to enter the workforce at the height of the financial crises.""
