UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in,"There will be ""bumpy moments"" for UK businesses and travellers as they get to grips with new EU rules, says government minister Michael Gove. He said there would be ""practical and procedural changes"" when the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. Mr Gove also urged people going to the EU to make extra checks, including mobile phone roaming charges. EU ambassadors have approved the post-Brexit trade deal,paving the way for it to take effect on 1 January. Under EU rules it can take effect provisionally, though the European Parliament will vote on it in January. In the UK, MPs will vote on the deal on Wednesday. Meanwhile, UK International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said she expects to sign a continuity trade agreement with Turkey this week - a move that was not possible until the deal with the EU was struck. Quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal How Brexit will change your holidays in 2021 What will happen to mobile roaming charges? Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ""I'm sure there will be bumpy moments but we are there in order to try to do everything we can to smooth the path."" He warned businesses that time was ""very short"" to make the final preparations before the transition period ends. ""The nature of our new relationship with the EU - outside the Single Market and Customs Union - means that there are practical and procedural changes that businesses and citizens need to get ready for,"" he said. ""We know that there will be some disruption as we adjust to new ways of doing business with the EU, so it is vital that we all take the necessary action now."" Businesses have been urged to make sure they understand the new rules on importing and exporting goods, including the different rules that apply to trade with Northern Ireland, and to consider how they will make customs declarations on EU trade. Mr Gove also encouraged travellers to EU destinations from 1 January to take out comprehensive travel insurance, check their mobile phone provider's roaming charges and make sure they have at least six months left on their passports. Measures are being put in place around the UK as it prepares to enter its new trading relationship with the EU. The Scottish government has signed a leaseto use a former military airfield in Dumfries and Galloway as an emergency lorry parkfor up to 240 vehicles if there is disruption at Cairnryan port near Stranraer. In Wales,traffic measures have been introduced on a major road leading to Holyhead port. Meanwhile,travellers from Great Britain will need to declare cash of â¬10,000 (Â£9,049) or more when entering Northern Irelandfrom 1 January. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work What happens next with Brexit? The trade deal was reached after months of fraught talks on issues including fishing rights and business rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would provide new legislative and regulatory freedoms to""deliver for people who felt left behind"". But fishermen's leaders have accused him of ""caving in"" and sacrificing their interests. Labour called it a ""thin deal"" that needed ""more work"" to protect UK jobs. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the ""bumpy moments"" Mr Gove warned about were of the government's own making because it waited to strike the deal ""so close to the wire"". She said the government had refused to engage with business on preparations, while dodging questions for months about the recruitment of customs agents and the development of IT systems. ""The government is treating its own incompetence as inevitable,"" she said. The SNP said it was ""the understatement of the century"" that the UK would face disruption, adding that millions of businesses would now face ""a mountain of extra costs, red tape, bureaucracy and barriers to trade in just four days' time"". Conservative grandee Lord Heseltine has urged MPs and peers to abstain when voting on the deal, warning it will inflict ""lasting damage"" on the UK. The former deputy prime minister said he would ""in no way share the endorsement of the legislation"", but that he would not vote against it because the consequences of a no-deal would be even graver. Political parties in Northern Ireland that take their seats in Westminster - the DUP, the Alliance and the SDLP - areset to vote against the deal. The DUP, which supports Brexit, said its eight MPs would oppose the deal because it did not address ""damaging"" issues caused by introducing customs checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. This video can not be played Brexit deal: How did we get here? Over the weekend, Chancellor Rishi Sunak sought to reassure the City of London that it will not be damaged by the deal. He said they would be ""doing a few things a bit differently"" and looking at ""how we make the City of London the most attractive place to list new companies anywhere in the world"". The chancellor said the deal was ""an enormously unifying moment for our country"" and it brought reassurance to those who were concerned about the impact on businesses.

'Enormous damage' to US agencies by Trump - Biden,"This video can not be played President-elect Biden accuses the Trump administration of ""irresponsibility"" over national security US President-elect Joe Biden has accused the US defence department of ""irresponsibility"" for failing to give his team the information it needs for the transition of power. He said his team had encountered ""obstruction from the political leadership"". Mr Biden also claimed that agencies critical to US security had suffered ""enormous damage"" under Donald Trump. A Pentagon spokesman said it had been ""completely transparent"". Mr Biden takes office on 20 January but President Trump has refused to concede. For weeks after the 3 November election, Mr Biden was blocked from receiving key intelligence briefings, an essential and normally routine part of a presidential transition. After Mr Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition process last month,Mr Biden praised the White House for its help in the process. But his tone had changed on Monday. Mr Biden spoke after a briefing by national security and foreign policy aides. In a speech which he posted on Twitter,external, Mr Biden said his team was facing ""roadblocks"" in the defence department and the Office of Management and Budget. ""Right now, we just aren't getting all the information that we need from the outgoing administration in key national security areas,"" he said. ""It's nothing short, in my view, of irresponsibility."" The president-elect added that his team needed a ""clear picture of our force posture around the world"" and that US adversaries could exploit any confusion that resulted. What to expect when Biden is sworn in What Joe Biden wants to do The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Does Biden's new team better reflect America? Following Mr Biden's remarks, Acting Defence Secretary Christopher Miller said officials had been ""working with the utmost professionalism to support transition activities"". ""The Department of Defense has conducted 164 interviews with over 400 officials and provided over 5,000 pages of documents - far more than initially requested by Biden's transition team,"" he said. Thepresidential transition processis the handover of important information and duties from the outgoing administration to the president-elect and his or her team, ensuring that they are fully up to speed when they reach the White House on 20 January. Christopher Miller was appointed acting defence secretary by President Trump after he sacked Mark Esper The president-elect described key security agencies as having been ""hollowed out"" in personnel, capacity and morale. ""The policy processes have atrophied or have been sidelined,"" he added, saying that this was ""to the despair of our alliances"". Mr Trump sacked his Defence Secretary Mark Espershortly after the election, apparently over Mr Esper's disagreement with his call to deploy the military against anti-racism protesters. Mr Trump's subsequent installation of loyalists in the department was viewed with concern by political opponents, who saw it as an attempt to sow chaos in the final weeks of his administration. The president has not commented on Mr Biden's latest remarks. Mr Esper himself became defence secretary only in 2019. President Trump's first defence secretary was Gen Jim Mattis, who left the post after his views and the president's increasingly diverged. Other senior security officials who have left their positions in the Trump administration include Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, fired in November 2019, and John Bolton, who left his job as national security adviser in September 2019. He was the third person to hold that role under Mr Trump. The White House revolving door What time is Biden's inauguration?

Ghislaine Maxwell denied bail in sex crime case,"Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested at her home in July and is charged with sex crimes A US judge has turned down a $28.5m (Â£21.4m) bail package by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell who is awaiting trial on sex crime charges. The New York ruling said the suspect, 59, poses a flight risk and the offer did not assure her appearance at future hearings. She is accused of helping the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein groom young girls, which she denies. It is the second time bail for Ms Maxwell has been denied. She has been in jail in Brooklyn, New York City sinceshe was arrested in Julyat her secluded mansion in the state of New Hampshire. Lawyers suggested she had been hiding out at the mansion. Her bail package proposed that she be allowed to return home with armed guards to prevent her from escaping. This video can not be played New York attorney: Ghislaine Maxwell ""helped exploit girls as young as 14-years-old"" Lawyers objected to her prison conditions, saying she was subject to invasive searches and that guards disturbed her every 15 minutes to check she was still alive. But prosecutors said there was a risk that, if bailed, Ms Maxwell could use her wealth to flee to France or the UK where she is a citizen and suggested she might try to avoid extradition. Ms Maxwell was in a relationship with financier Jeffrey Epstein in the 1990s. He died in a prison cell in August last year as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges, more than a decade after he was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Four of the charges against Ms Maxwell relate to the years between 1994 and 1997, when prosecutors say she helped Epstein groom girls as young as 14. The other two charges are allegations of perjury in 2016. She faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted in her trial, which is scheduled to begin next July. Court documents filed in Novemberto apply for bail said the multi-million dollar proposal represented all of Ms Maxwell and her husband's joint assets, including three homes. Ms Maxwell is the daughter of media mogul Robert Maxwell. She allegedly introduced Epstein to wealthy and powerful figures including Bill Clinton and the Duke of York, Prince Andrew of the British Royal Family.

S Africa announces new restrictions as cases soar,"Mr Ramaphosa said the country had let its guard down President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced new tougher coronavirus restrictions, a day after South Africa recorded more than one million Covid-19 cases. Indoor and outdoor gatherings will be banned, a curfew introduced from 21:00 to 06:00, and alcohol sales prohibited. Mr Ramaphosa said the country was at an extremely dangerous point in the pandemic and action had to be taken. Recently authorities confirmed a new, faster-spreading variant of the virus had been detected in South Africa. Some hospitals and medical centres have reported a huge rise in admissions, putting a heavy strain on resources. In a televised speech, Mr Ramaphosa said the new 501.V2 variant was now well established in South Africa, and the recent rise in cases was a ""cause for great alarm"". ""We have simply let our guard down,"" said the president. He added that the new measures would come into effect at midnight on Monday (22:00 GMT) and last at least until 15 January. Coronavirus variants: The science explained UK has two cases of variant linked to South Africa Fresh air: The forgotten coronavirus weapon He said gatherings excepts for funerals and a few other limited exceptions would be banned, no-one would be able to leave their homes between 21:00 and 6:00 without a permit, and all shops, bars and other venues would have to close by 20:00. All alcohol sales would also be banned, and every individual who failed to wear a mask in public places would face possible fines or imprisonment, he added. South Africa is seeing a steady increase in cases driven by the new coronavirus variant On Sunday South Africa became the first country in Africa to pass a million Covid-19 cases, with 1,004,413 infections and 26,735 deaths since the outbreak began in March. Last week, it recorded a daily average of 11,700 new infections - a rise of 39% on the previous week - and from Wednesday to Friday, the daily number of new cases was above 14,000. The 501.V2 variant is believed to be driving the surge in infections. It was identified by a network of South African scientists in the Eastern Cape province and then rapidly spread to other parts of the country. Earlier this week,the UK banned travel from South Africabecause of the new variant.Another new Covid variant has already been detected in the UK, although they have evolved separately. Both have a mutation - called N501Y - which is in a crucial part of the virus that it uses to infect the body's cells, but appear unrelated to each other. After South Africa, the worst hit country on the African continent is Morocco, which has seen 432,079 cases and 7,240 deaths. They are followed by Egypt with 132,541 cases and 7,405 deaths and Tunisia with 131,592 infections and 4,466 deaths.

Travel warning after heavy snowfall in parts of England,"Cars were abandoned earlier in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent Heavy snow in the Midlands has led to police warning drivers they should only take to the roads for essential trips. Cars were abandoned and roads shut in Stoke-on-Trent after up to 3in of snow fell. Rail services are also disrupted. Authorities in Staffordshire and Gloucestershire urged people not to travel unless absolutely necessary. A Met Office yellow warning of snow and ice for much of England and Wales and parts of Scotland remains in place until 10:00 GMT on Tuesday. The village of Oulton, in Staffordshire, was covered with snow on Monday There were reports of delays, stranded motorists and abandoned cars on the A53 at Etruria and in Hanley, in Stoke on Trent, with more issues on the A34, in Stone, and on the A500. Police in Lichfield said the Burntwood bypass, between the M6 Toll and Miners Way, had also been closed due to a crash. They said officers across Staffordshire were dealing with ""numerous snow-related incidents"".

Gove 'confident' schools can reopen in England,"This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""Teachers have been working incredibly hard...in order to make sure that testing system is in place"" Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said he is ""confident"" the staggered return to secondary schools in England can go ahead as planned. But Mr Gove said the issue was still being reviewed, amid concern over the spread of the new coronavirus variant. Wales and Scotland have delayed or revised the start of the new term. Northern Ireland schools are due back next week. Ministers have said exam year pupils in England would return as normal. But the majority of secondary school pupils in England are due to begin the term studying remotely, to give head teachers time to implement a coronavirus testing programme for students and staff. Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he still expected Year 11 and Year 13 pupils to return in the first week of January, with the rest going back to the classroom later in the month. ""It is our intention to make sure we can get children back to school as early as possible,"" he said. Impact of new variant on children investigated Schools 'may need to close to control new variant' Will schools be closed next term by variant of virus? He said that prioritising children's attendance in school was ""the right thing to do"" but he acknowledged concerns about the new variant, which scientists believe may be more transmissible. ""We have a new strain and it is also the case that we have also had, albeit in a very limited way, Christmas mixing, so we do have to remain vigilant,"" Mr Gove said. ""We are confident that we will be able to get schools back in good order. Our plan and our timetable is there, and we are working with teachers to deliver it."" Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast the safe return to school would be built on an effective testing system, with teachers working ""incredibly hard"" to implement it. Teachers' union the NASUWT said schools have not been given enough time to prepare for mass testing - and that further guidance and support were needed for those in the highest tier areas. Dr Patrick Roach, the union's general secretary, told BBC News it was ""vitally important"" the government helps schools to arrange testing programmes ""to ensure an effective mass testing system is possible"". England:Secondary school pupils in exam years will return at the start of term while others begin their learning online. Face-to-face learning is expected to resume for everyone by 11 January. Primary schools will return as normal Scotland:Schools will start term on 11 January with learning taking place online until at least 18 January. Wales:Term will start with online learning, but the majority of pupils are expected to resume face-to-face lessons by 11 January. A full return to the classroom is expected to be complete by 18 January Northern Ireland:All schools will initially reopen for face-to-face teaching at the start of term, but years 8 to 10 will move to remote learning from 25 January for at least two weeks Schools in all the UK nations are remaining open for vulnerable children. England, Wales and Scotland have also committed to maintain face-to-face teaching for children of key workers. The union has written to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, calling for him to allow schools in the highest tier areas to teach online, except for vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers. Mark Tilling, head teacher of High Tunstall College of Science in Hartlepool, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One that he needed to train 21 staff to carry out the mass testing, which would take at least a week from the start of term. He said: ""The key issue for me is, is it safe to open if we can't do mass testing? If it isn't then the government need to make a decision that we can't open."" The National Education Union has also written to Mr Williamson and the prime minister, repeating its call for schools and colleges to teach classes online for at least the first two weeks of January. Although there is no suggestion the new variant poses more of a threat to children's health,scientists are investigating whether it spreads more easily in children. Preliminary research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggested thatschools and universities might need to close on top of existing tier 4 restrictionsto bring the new variant under control. Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the government did not have a clear strategy and was not acting quickly enough. ""Parents will be extremely concerned that all they're getting is rumour and innuendo. Teachers and school staff will need to know what is expected of them,"" she said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the Today programme the country faced ""very, very tough choices"" over schools. He said that while schools were an ""absolute priority"", there would be a ""trade-off"" that could mean other parts of society had to stay closed. The UK faced ""continued pressures"" from the spread of Covid-19 for at least the next two or three months, Sir Jeremy said.

EU ambassadors approve post-Brexit trade deal,"The ambassadors who meet in Brussels are jointly called Coreper Ambassadors from the 27 EU member states have unanimously approved the EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal, paving the way for it to take effect. The deal is likely to become law on 1 January, as the UK Parliament is expected to approve it on Wednesday. Under EU rules it can take effect provisionally, though the European Parliament will vote on it in January. The deal sets the framework for trade once the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union in four days' time. The deal, which ended nine months of negotiations, will be approved by all 27 EU governments in writing at 15:00 (14:00 GMT) on Tuesday, the German EU presidency said. They have had three days to analyse the details ofthe EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement,external, since its publication. But most of the 1,246-page document had already been seen by member states in previous weeks. The deal ends nearly 50 years of UK membership of the bloc, covering a vast array of policies besides those governing common trade rules. UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that he had spoken to European Council President Charles Michel about the deal,externaland its forthcoming ratification by EU governments. ""I welcomed the importance of the UK/EU Agreement as a new starting point for our relationship, between sovereign equals,"" he said. ""We looked forward to the formal ratification of the agreement and to working together on shared priorities, such as tackling climate change."" There was much relief that the tortuous negotiations - including last-minute haggling over fish quotas - finally ended on Christmas Eve. The no-deal scenario would have meant reverting to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules on 1 January, notably the immediate imposition of tariffs - import taxes - and quotas on a huge range of goods.

Atlantic discovery: 12 new species in the deep,"Epizoanthus martinsae lives on black corals at depths of almost 400m Almost five years of studying the deep Atlantic in unprecedented detail has revealed 12 species new to science. The sea mosses, molluscs and corals had eluded discovery because the sea floor is so unexplored, scientists say. Researchers warn that the newly discovered animals could already be under threat from climate change. Carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean is making it more acidic, causing coral skeletons in particular to corrode. Corals are the foundations of the cities of the deep, providing shelter and food for many species The scientists involved stressed it was ""not too late to protect these special species"" and the important habitats they occupied. New species: ""At least"" 12 new deep-sea species. The team also found approximately 35 new records of species in areas where they were previously unknown Climate change: Ocean warming, acidification, and decreasing food availability will combine to significantly shift and reduce the availability of suitable habitats for deep-sea species by 2100 Hydrothermal vents: Scientists discovered a field of these sea-floor hot springs in the Azores. Hydrothermal fields are important areas of relatively high biological productivity that host complex communities in the midst of the vast deep ocean As Prof George Wolff, an ocean chemist from the University of Liverpool who was involved in the project pointed out: ""We can still say we have better maps of the surface of the Moon and Mars than of the sea floor."" Antropora gemarita feeds on particles of food suspended in the water ""So whenever you go to the deep ocean, you find something new - not just individual species but entire ecosystems."" Prof Murray Roberts from the University of Edinburgh ledthe Atlas project,external, as it is called. He told BBC News that nearly five years of exploration and investigation had revealed some ""special places"" in the ocean and worked out ""how they tick"". Underwater robotics allowed exploration at depths that would crush human divers ""We found whole communities formed by sponges or deep ocean corals that form the cities of the deep sea,"" he explained. ""They support life. So really important fish use these places as spawning grounds. ""If those cities are damaged by destructive human uses, those fish have nowhere to spawn and the function of those whole ecosystems is lost for future generations. ""It's like understanding that the rainforest is an important place for biodiversity on the land; the same is true of the deep sea - there are important places that need to be protected and, crucially , they are all connected."" The project involved researchers from 13 countries around the Atlantic - combining ocean chemistry and physics, as well as biological discovery, to work out how the ocean environment is changing as the world warms and as humans exploit more of the deep sea for fishing and mineral extraction. Researchers carried out more than 40 Atlantic expeditions to explore the deep ocean in detail Studying ocean currents and depositions of fossils on the seabed revealed that the major currents in the North Atlantic have slowed dramatically in response to climate change. ""The implications of that are complicated, but potentially the connections between ecosystems are being reduced,"" Prof Roberts explained, because ocean currents are the highways that link different habitats together in the vastness of the deep ocean. A bryozoan named Microporella funbio was discovered in an undersea mud volcano off the Spanish coast ""The value of all this knowledge is that it enables us to understand what we might risk losing,"" said Prof Claire Armstrong, a natural resource economist from the University of TromsÃ¸. ""The deep ocean can be so out of sight and out of mind that we're not really aware of what we're doing to its environments and the consequences of what we do."" With a growing global population, increasing pollution and emerging areas of commercial activity in the deep sea, including prospecting for medically and industrially useful products, marine scientists say it is vital to fill the gaps in our ocean knowledge. The ocean is not an endless resource, Prof Armstrong added. ""Conserving and knowing what we might need in the future is really, really difficult.""

Hundreds of British skiers flee Swiss quarantine,"Verbier is one of the most popular Alpine resorts for British skiers More than 200 British skiers fled a coronavirus quarantine in the popular Swiss resort of Verbier on Saturday night, reports say. A spokesman in Valais canton said 420 British guests had booked into Verbier accommodation before Christmas and now only about a dozen were left. Switzerland imposed a 10-day quarantine backdated to 14 December because of the new virus strain spreading in the UK. The country also stopped flights from the UK and South Africa on 20 December. Some Swiss hoteliers only discovered the guests had vanished when room service trays were left untouched outside doors, Swiss media reported. Others were called by British tourists demanding their money back once they had safely crossed into France, the BBC's Imogen Foulkes reports from Geneva. Verbier is especially popular among the British, who normally make up about one-fifth of the resort's winter clientele. Switzerland caused controversy by deciding, despite the pandemic, to keep its ski resorts open. This video can not be played Italy's Foppolo ski resort lost its all-important Christmas ski season Some Swiss believe that decision was a mistake, our correspondent reports. Others are angry, as for decades the British have been enthusiastic winter visitors to Switzerland, but now feel the tourists have abused the hospitality offered to them. Scientists say the new Covid-19 strain first spotted in the UK is more infectious than the one responsible for the pandemic, but not necessarily any more dangerous for those infected. The new variant has already been detected in Switzerland and several other countries. Another new variant emerged in South Africa this month and has spread elsewhere. The spokesman for Bagnes, an area of Valais containing Verbier, voiced understanding for the departed British. ""We understand their anger,"" Jean-Marc Sandoz told the SonntagsZeitung. ""Suddenly families with small children were locked into 20 sq m (215 sq ft), and that's intolerable."" Verbier has plenty of signs up warning people to obey the Covid rules Ski resorts were crowded in neighbouring Austria at the weekend, but Austria's quarantine means that very few foreign tourists have travelled there. For locals too the options are limited, as hotels and restaurants are shut, and social distancing has reduced the cable car and train services. There were long queues of traffic outside some Austrian resorts, forcing car parks to close early. Ski lifts were only able to take about half the normal numbers, because of social distancing, and Covid masks were obligatory. Resorts close to Salzburg were less crowded, broadcaster ORF reported.

Mr Sandoz said the new coronavirus quarantine had made it ""the worst week our community has ever experienced"". The Swiss health ministry, quoted by AFP news agency, said on Sunday two cases of the British Covid-19 variant had been detected in Switzerland and one in neighbouring Liechtenstein. It also said there were two Swiss cases of the South African variant. Ski resorts in France, Italy and many other countries are closed to tourists this season - a devastating blow to their income. At the start of the pandemic in Europe the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl was identified as a virus hotspot, and an official report, published in October, deplored errors which had allowed thousands of tourists to get infected.

Saudi jails woman activist despite global outcry,"Loujain al-Hathloul was detained in 2018 A prominent Saudi female activist, who campaigned for women's right to drive, has been sentenced to more than five years in prison. Loujain al-Hathloul, 31, has already been in a maximum security prison for two and a half years. She and other activists were detained in 2018 on charges including contacts with organisations hostile to Saudi Arabia. International human rights groups have repeatedly called for her release. But on Monday, the country's Specialised Criminal Court, which was set up to try terrorism cases, convicted her of various charges including trying to harm national security and advance a foreign agenda. It sentenced her to five years and eight months in prison. Two years and ten months of the sentence are said to have been suspended. She and her family have denied all charges. They have also said that she has been tortured in jail - accusations the court dismissed. Saudi Arabia's human rights problems that won't go away Activist 'offered freedom if she denies torture' How Saudiâs ânew directionâ is changing life for women like me Hathloul was detained just weeks before Saudi women were finally allowed to drive in 2018 - the cause she championed. Saudi officials insist her detention has nothing to do with that issue. This video can not be played Saudi women hit the road Hathloul's family says she was held incommunicado for three months following her arrest, and that she was subjected to electric shocks, whippings, and sexual harassment. They also allege that she was offered freedom if she agreed to say she was not tortured. Human rights experts have said her trial did not meet international standards. In November,Amnesty International condemned her transfer to the Specialised Criminal Court,external, saying it exposed ""the brutality and hypocrisy"" of Saudi authorities. The case is seen as further damaging the reputation of Saudi Arabia's controversial de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, known as MBS. He has led a programme of reforms, including lifting the ban on women driving, in a bid to open up the conservative kingdom to investment. But he has also been condemned for the continued crackdown on rights activists, as well as the Saudi authorities' role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Loujain Al-Hathloul is now even more famous for her incarceration than she was for her bold activism in the campaign for the right to drive. She has come to symbolise the human rights abuses that stubbornly cast a long shadow over Saudi Arabia's drive for economic and social reform - while it keeps an increasingly tight rein on political dissent. When Joe Biden takes over as US president, he is expected to take a tougher stance on human rights violations. But Saudi officials insist they will continue to chart their own course. The Kingdom believes its role as the world's top oil exporter and regional power player matter to the international community above all else. Al-Hathloul's sentence, including years of suspended and already-served time, mean she and other activists could be freed in the new year. That may help ease pressure on a Kingdom, which also does not want to be seen as bending to the dictates of others. This video can not be played Saudi Arabia reforms: Are they good news for women?

Concern at 'unprecedented' English infection level,"London Ambulance Service received as many emergency calls on 26 December as it did at the height of the first wave of Covid-19 England's ""very high"" Covid infection level is a ""growing concern"" as the NHS struggles to cope with rising patient numbers, a health official has said. On Monday, a record 41,385 Covid cases and 357 deathswere reported in the UK,external. NHS England said the number of people being treated for the virus in hospital is now 20,426, which is higher than the previous peak of about 19,000 in April. Health officials in Wales and Scotland have also said they are at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Monday's figure for new cases is the highest daily number reported by the UK government, and the first time the daily total has surpassed 40,000. It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in April, but testing capacity was too limited to detect the true number. Some data over the Christmas period is incomplete, as a result of certain services being paused. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said Monday's figure included some infections where reporting was delayed, but that officials did not deny there had been a significant increase in infections. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""This very high level of infection is of growing concern at a time when our hospitals are at their most vulnerable, with new admissions rising in many regions."" ""Despite unprecedented levels of infection, there is hope on the horizon,"" she added. Dr Doyle urged members of the public to ""continue to play our part in stopping the spread of the virus"" as the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is rolled out. Hospitals in Wales, Scotland and the south of England have reported rising pressure on their services as the number of Covid patients increases. Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, south-east London, said on Monday that an ""internal incident"" over its ""high number of Covid-positive patients"" had been ongoing since Sunday. ""All our patients have received the treatment they need, including intensive care treatment for Covid-19 and oxygen therapy as required. ""We are continuing to monitor the situation to ensure that this remains the case,"" a spokesperson for Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust said. Two stats stand out today and underline the extent of the pressure on the NHS. One is the more than 20,000 Covid patients in English hospitals, more than the peak in the first wave in April. In many ways it is even tougher for hospitals now, as they are trying to clear the backlog on non-urgent operations and procedures cancelled in the first wave - as well as cope with the surge in Covid numbers. It is worth pointing out though that one reason for the high level of patients is that some are there thanks to drugs and therapies discovered in the past year who might not have survived in the first wave. The other key statistic is the 41,385 new daily reported cases - by far the highest number since the testing system was fully established in the summer. Some sadly will become seriously ill after a week or so which points to even greater strain on hospitals in the new year. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said she saw ""wall to wall Covid"" when she worked at one London hospital on Christmas Day. Dr Katherine Henderson told the BBC there was a ""great deal of difficulty"" getting patients into wards. She added: ""The chances are that we will cope, but we cope at a cost - the cost is not doing what we had hoped, which is being able to keep non-Covid activities going."" Covid hospital pressures in Wales 'incredibly challenging' NHS faces being 'overwhelmed' warn health leaders Danny Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, told BBC News disruption to non-urgent care in both hospitals and other health services was ""inevitable"" as infections rise. About half of the health boards in Wales have already cancelled non-urgent care, according to the director of the Welsh NHS Confederation. Darren Hughes told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the situation in Welsh hospitals was ""incredibly serious, and worsening"", with some intensive care units already at capacity. Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar said large numbers of patients, and staff sickness, have createdan ""incredibly challenging"" situation. And doctors have warnedScotland's health system is ""severely stretched"". Infection rates in England are currently highest in areas of Essex, London and other parts of the South East. Parts of Essex haverecorded the highest weekly coronavirus case ratessince the pandemic began. In the week leading up to 21 December, Brentwood, Epping Forest and Thurrock all had rates of more than 1,350 cases per 100,000 people. Tracey Fletcher, the chief executive of Homerton hospital in east London, said her staff were ""extremely busy"" andurged people to comply,externalwith the tier four restrictions in force. As of 24 December, London, the South East, and the East of England had the greatest proportion of new variant cases Patricia Marquis, regional director of the Royal College of Nursing in south-east England, said the number of beds and staff available at hospitals in her area was ""really close to the edge"". ""We are getting to the point where it does feel like there is a possibility that hospitals will become overrun,"" she told Radio 4's PM programme. Ms Marquis said the strain on staffing meant nurses were looking after ""far more patients"" than usual and ""it does feel unsafe at times for them"". The South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) said it has warned the military and fire service that paramedics may soon need their support. SCAS, which serves Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire, said it had seen a threefold increase in 111 calls over the Christmas period, along with a 60-70% increase in staff absences as a result of showing Covid symptoms or having to self-isolate. This chart, using data up to 23 December, shows how hospital admissions had been rising in London Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government's tiered system for coronavirus rules in England was the ""right strategy"" to tackle coronavirus, but accepted the NHS was under pressure and there were ""difficult months ahead"". Some 24 million people in the south-east and east of England - about 43% of the population - are now living under the strictest tier four rules and a review on 30 December could see more areas placed under the restrictions. Mainland Scotland entered level four restrictions from Saturday for three weeks, and similar rules are in place in Wales. Northern Ireland has also entered a new six-week lockdown. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? London 999 calls as high as Covid first wave peak The BBC has been told the London Ambulance Service (LAS) received7,918 emergency calls on 26 December- as many as at the height of the first wave of Covid-19. An LAS memo said the rising demand was down to the ""rapid spread of the new variant of the Covid-19 virus"". Figures seen by the BBC show at one London hospital on Sunday morning, ambulance crews were typically waiting nearly six hours to hand over patients to staff.

London 999 calls near March peak,"Patient demand in London is ""now arguably greater"" than in the first wave of the pandemic, according to the service London Ambulance Service (LAS) received as many emergency calls on 26 December as it did at the height of the first wave of Covid-19, the BBC has learned. Nearly 8,000 calls were received, a 40% increase on a typical ""busy"" day. Patient demand was ""now arguably greater"" than during the first wave, an internal message to all staff said. LAS said it was ""working urgently"" to reduce delays. It urged people only to dial 999 with genuine life-threatening emergencies and to use 111 if possible. The rapid spread of the new variant of Covid-19 was said to be the cause of the increased demand, according to the message. The UK reported another30,501 positive tests on Sunday, and 316 deaths of people who had tested positive within the past 28 days. Meanwhile South Central Ambulance Service - which serves Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire - said it was ""extremely busy"" and asked peopleonly to dial 999 in a ""life-threatening or serious emergency"",external. One London paramedic told the BBC that some patients were being treated in ambulance bays upon arrival at hospital, due to a lack of beds inside. ""It's been a horrendous time,"" the paramedic said. ""Ambulance staff are finding the whole situation very stressful."" Figures seen by the BBC show that at one London hospital on Sunday morning, ambulance crews were typically waiting nearly six hours to hand over patients to hospital staff. Levels of patient demand were equal ""and now arguably greater"" than those seen during the first wave of the pandemic, according to the all-staff message sent by LAS chief executive Garrett Emmerson. On 26 December, LAS received 7,918 calls, while on 16 March - one of its busiest ever days - it received marginally more. ""The demand is occurring because of the rapid spread of the new variant of the Covid-19 virus, initially in north-east London, but now spreading into north central London and predicted to spread further across the rest of the capital in the coming days and weeks"", the memo read. As of 24 December, London, the South East, and the East of England had the greatest proportion of new variant cases The NHS 111 service was twice as busy as usual in London, the message added. London Ambulance Service said it was working to find ways of alleviating pressures. It said private ambulance services, student paramedics, volunteers and the London Fire Brigade had been recruited to supplement its crews in order to provide as many ambulances as possible with two staff members. LAS was also receiving assistance from South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS), East of England Ambulance Service and St John Ambulance. Non-patient facing colleagues with clinical skills have also been moved to work frontline shifts. A separate message sent to ambulance crews on 26 December requested them, when it was safe to do so, to transport all patients to hospital on blue flashing lights in order to ""reduce travel times"". Usually only the most seriously unwell patients are taken to hospital in this way. In a statement, LAS said: ""Like NHS organisations across the country, demand for our services has risen sharply over the past weeks. ""Our colleagues in emergency departments are also under pressure receiving our patients as quickly as they can. We are working urgently with NHS partners to reduce any delays. ""The public can support us by only calling 999 for life-threatening emergencies. For urgent medical advice go to: 111.nhs.uk."" Thecapital has the highest coronavirus infection rate of any UK region,with 794.6 cases per 100,000 people over the last seven days. On Sunday, it reported another 9,719 infections.

EU ambassadors approve post-Brexit trade dealThe landmark EU-UK deal is on its way to becoming law provisionally on 1 January.Europe,"The ambassadors who meet in Brussels are jointly called Coreper Ambassadors from the 27 EU member states have unanimously approved the EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal, paving the way for it to take effect. The deal is likely to become law on 1 January, as the UK Parliament is expected to approve it on Wednesday. Under EU rules it can take effect provisionally, though the European Parliament will vote on it in January. The deal sets the framework for trade once the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union in four days' time. The deal, which ended nine months of negotiations, will be approved by all 27 EU governments in writing at 15:00 (14:00 GMT) on Tuesday, the German EU presidency said. They have had three days to analyse the details ofthe EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement,external, since its publication. But most of the 1,246-page document had already been seen by member states in previous weeks. The deal ends nearly 50 years of UK membership of the bloc, covering a vast array of policies besides those governing common trade rules. UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that he had spoken to European Council President Charles Michel about the deal,externaland its forthcoming ratification by EU governments. ""I welcomed the importance of the UK/EU Agreement as a new starting point for our relationship, between sovereign equals,"" he said. ""We looked forward to the formal ratification of the agreement and to working together on shared priorities, such as tackling climate change."" There was much relief that the tortuous negotiations - including last-minute haggling over fish quotas - finally ended on Christmas Eve. The no-deal scenario would have meant reverting to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules on 1 January, notably the immediate imposition of tariffs - import taxes - and quotas on a huge range of goods. The tariffs on some food items would have been 50% or higher. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work What happens next with Brexit? The new trade deal: enables the UK to continue selling goods to the EU market - the UK's biggest trade partner - without tariffs or quotas includes binding enforcement and dispute settlement mechanisms to address any unfair competition - what the EU calls ""level playing field"" rules ensures continued smooth transport links between the UK and EU, including safeguards on passenger rights means new paperwork and other barriers for UK businesses in Europe, including financial services, which employs more than a million people in the UK does little to address the needs of the UK service sector, accounting for about 80% of the UK economy transfers 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in British waters to the UK fleet, over a five-and-a-half year transition period reduces UK access to EU programmes in various fields, including policing and education.

"Hundreds of British skiers flee Swiss quarantineMore than 200 Britons flee Verbier, defying a Swiss order to remain in their hotels and chalets.Europe","Verbier is one of the most popular Alpine resorts for British skiers More than 200 British skiers fled a coronavirus quarantine in the popular Swiss resort of Verbier on Saturday night, reports say. A spokesman in Valais canton said 420 British guests had booked into Verbier accommodation before Christmas and now only about a dozen were left. Switzerland imposed a 10-day quarantine backdated to 14 December because of the new virus strain spreading in the UK. The country also stopped flights from the UK and South Africa on 20 December. Some Swiss hoteliers only discovered the guests had vanished when room service trays were left untouched outside doors, Swiss media reported. Others were called by British tourists demanding their money back once they had safely crossed into France, the BBC's Imogen Foulkes reports from Geneva. Verbier is especially popular among the British, who normally make up about one-fifth of the resort's winter clientele. Switzerland caused controversy by deciding, despite the pandemic, to keep its ski resorts open. This video can not be played Italy's Foppolo ski resort lost its all-important Christmas ski season Some Swiss believe that decision was a mistake, our correspondent reports. Others are angry, as for decades the British have been enthusiastic winter visitors to Switzerland, but now feel the tourists have abused the hospitality offered to them. Scientists say the new Covid-19 strain first spotted in the UK is more infectious than the one responsible for the pandemic, but not necessarily any more dangerous for those infected. The new variant has already been detected in Switzerland and several other countries. Another new variant emerged in South Africa this month and has spread elsewhere. The spokesman for Bagnes, an area of Valais containing Verbier, voiced understanding for the departed British. ""We understand their anger,"" Jean-Marc Sandoz told the SonntagsZeitung. ""Suddenly families with small children were locked into 20 sq m (215 sq ft), and that's intolerable."" Verbier has plenty of signs up warning people to obey the Covid rules Ski resorts were crowded in neighbouring Austria at the weekend, but Austria's quarantine means that very few foreign tourists have travelled there. For locals too the options are limited, as hotels and restaurants are shut, and social distancing has reduced the cable car and train services. There were long queues of traffic outside some Austrian resorts, forcing car parks to close early. Ski lifts were only able to take about half the normal numbers, because of social distancing, and Covid masks were obligatory. Resorts close to Salzburg were less crowded, broadcaster ORF reported. Read more on coronavirus and ski resorts: Defiant ski nations bid to save holiday season 'Momentous' errors in ski resort Covid outbreak Border checks to stop French skiing abroad Despite the sympathy voiced by Mr Sandoz, there were some angry tweets condemning the British tourists for slipping out of quarantine under cover of darkness.

Mr Sandoz said the new coronavirus quarantine had made it ""the worst week our community has ever experienced"". The Swiss health ministry, quoted by AFP news agency, said on Sunday two cases of the British Covid-19 variant had been detected in Switzerland and one in neighbouring Liechtenstein. It also said there were two Swiss cases of the South African variant. Ski resorts in France, Italy and many other countries are closed to tourists this season - a devastating blow to their income. At the start of the pandemic in Europe the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl was identified as a virus hotspot, and an official report, published in October, deplored errors which had allowed thousands of tourists to get infected.

"Covid hospital pressures 'incredibly challenging'Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar says patient numbers and staff sickness has increased pressure.WalesBrexit traffic measures introduced at portThe contingency plan for any disruption at Holyhead includes ""stacking"" lorries along the A55.Wales","Dr Giri Shankar says patient numbers and staff sickness makes for an ""incredibly challenging"" time for hospitals Large numbers of patients and staff sickness have created an ""incredibly challenging"" situation at Wales' hospitals, a health official has said. Cardiff and Vale health boardappealed for medics to helpUniversity Hospital of Wales' critical care department on Boxing Day and received 33 offers. The health board had no spare intensive care beds on 20 December, figures show. Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar said the health system was under enormous and unprecedented pressure.

Just before Christmas, the sickness rates were just around 10-12%, he said, adding: ""That's a large number of unavailable workforce. ""Therefore, as you saw yesterday and the day before, health boards making plea for whatever help they can get from various sources including medical students, ex-health care professionals, and so on,"" he said. ""So, it is an incredibly challenging situation and not just in Cardiff and Wales but across all our health boards."" Dr Shankar told BBC Radio Wales that a ""significant proportion"" of the workforce are sick and unwell The health board tweeted a plea at about 21:15 GMT on Boxing Day saying its critical care department was ""urgently looking for assistance from medical students or other staff groups who have previously supported with proning patients"". Proning involves turning patients on to their front to increase the oxygen supply to the lungs. Sharp rise in Covid infections in Wales How many people have died with Covid in Wales? Q&A: What has changed in Wales lockdown? On Sunday morning it thanked people for responding to its request and said there was now ""no need to call us"". The Welsh Government say by mid-morning on Sunday the unit had received 33 officers of assistance locally and from other parts of Wales. It said a ""small number"" of people who have worked for the health board before will have their offer taken up, while the details of others will be kept on file should they be required later. The number of intensive care beds available in a unit fluctuates day by day, depending on factors such as staffing. For example, according to NHS Wales informatics, Cardiff and Vale health board's intensive care has been running at close to full capacity in recent days, with no spare bed on the unit at all on 20 December. On Monday, Public Health Wales reported afurther 15 people had diedafter contracting coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 3,383. Hospitals in the south of England have saidthey have seen a ""real rise in pressure""as the number of Covid patients needing treatment increases. Speaking to BBC Radio 5Live, Dr Andrew Lansdown, a consultant endocrinologist at University Hospital of Wales, said the influx of Covid-19 patients had become ""relentless"". ""We really have felt stretched to the limit,"" he said, adding the number of patients with the virus coming through the hospital was ""massive"". ""I think it's not just the new variant, which seems to be spreading faster. You've also got the usual winter pressures at the hospital, as well as staff themselves who are ill, self-isolating."" He said the past few weeks had seen hospitals in Wales coming under ""extreme pressure"". Dr Lansdown said the response to the appeal for help on social media had been ""overwhelming"" but he feared that it would not be long before other hospitals across Wales and the rest of the UK would be facing similar pressures. ""During the first wave there was a large resource of energy in staff, whereas now in the second wave it's quite different,"" he said. ""We can see a lot of staff fatigue. It's a fatigue that is obviously physical, but it very much is emotional as well. ""We're seeing staff members themselves becoming unwell, some have sadly died during the pandemic. And then trying to balance that with looking after patients as well."" He added: ""I think it's a picture right across Wales.""

"Brexit traffic measures introduced at portThe contingency plan for any disruption at Holyhead includes ""stacking"" lorries along the A55.Wales","Holyhead's port sees an estimated five million tonnes of freight every year Traffic measures have been introduced on a major road leading to Holyhead port as the UK prepares to enter its new trading relationship with the EU. The Welsh Government has said the plans are aimed at ""minimising any possible disruption to the port, town and wider community"". Freight turned away from the port due to incorrect documentation will be sent on to the westbound A55. The UK Government has predicted this could be 40-70% of freight. Quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal What just happened with Brexit? Holyhead is the second busiest roll-on/roll-off port in the UK, behind only Dover. Around 600 lorries and trailers leave the port on ferries bound for Dublin every day. A trade deal between the EU and UKhas now been agreedand will take effect from 1 January, but the changes in the trading relationship between the two parties mean there could besome disruption. The Welsh Government added it expected the peak of traffic issues to be in mid-January. The eastbound carriageway between junction two and four of the A55 will run with contraflow. The Welsh Government said,external: ""All HGVs turned away from the port will be redirected back to the contraflow to turn off at Junction 4 and join the westbound carriageway which is reserved for redirected HGVs."" Lorries will be stacked if there is no other site available. It said work is already under way to prepare Plot 9 of Parc Cybi in Holyhead and the site due to be ready to accept HGVs by mid-January. When asked if stacked lorry drivers would have access to toilets and food and drink, the Welsh Government said ""appropriate welfare facilities"" would be provided. Economy Minister Ken Skates said: ""We need to implement these contingency plans in order to do what we can to minimise any possible disruption for the port, community of Holyhead and wider area. ""We have never faced this kind of situation before and we have a duty to prepare for the worst possible scenario."" The EU is implementing border controls from 1 January TheKent port has seen gridlock over recent weeksas Britain approached the end of its transition period with the EU and France banned all Channel crossings over the new coronavirus variant in the south-east of England. Chair of the CBI in North Wales Kinza Sutton told BBC Radio Wales: ""We anticipate that there will be delays. ""Certainly the changes to documentation is going to cause huge changes for everybody, so certainly during January I'd imagine there will be delays as everyone gets used to the new systems."" Aplan to buy a truck stop as part of post-Brexit inbound customs checks was scrapped on Christmas Eve. Border customs checks on inbound lorries and trailers will be implemented from July. On Monday, a Welsh Government spokeswoman said along with the UK government it had determined other potential sites on Parc Cybi would be a more suitable alternative. ""This would also offer the opportunity for the truck stop to remain open, protecting jobs and providing a service for its customers, should it wish to do so,"" she said, adding further details would be provided in due course. Anglesey Councillor and Executive member for Highways Robert G Parry said Parc Cybi was the ""ideal place"" for lorries. The Plaid councillor for the Canolbarth MÃ´n Ward said: ""It means that they don't get off the A55 at allâ¦ and there's plenty of room there."" But he said the Welsh Government needed to ""speed things up"". ""They've left it until the last minute,"" he said. ""Of course there is the difference now that the deal has been made but they've been too slow in moving forward to provide these facilities. ""Only time will tell. What happens during the next two days will show us what will happen."" Local traffic will be diverted on to the A5 through the village of Caergeiliog, which was the original route to the port before the A55 was extended in 2001. Councillor Gwilym O Jones said he had been ""assured"" measures including a lower speed limit and enforcement would be in place. ""I'm very pleased that people are listening to what I've been asking for,"" he added.

First Aboriginal cricketer inducted to Hall of Fame,"Johnny Mullagh, standing second from right with a pocket handkerchief, was the standout performer of the first Australian cricket team One of the stars of the first Australian cricket tour of England has become the first Aboriginal inducted to the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. Johnny Mullagh was part of the 1868 Aboriginal team that became the country's first sporting team to tour internationally. The Hall of Fame chairman said Mullagh contributed to Australia's identity. It was an ""oversight"" not to have recognised the importance of the 1868 team before now, Peter King added. The selection panel agreed to change the criteria to allow Mullagh to be inducted, as he had not played Test cricket. It said it wanted to acknowledge the impact of indigenous players. ""Johnny Mullagh and the 1868 Aboriginal team paved the way for so many future Australians to showcase their skill and talent on the world stage,"" Mr King said. ""To consider the team's feats were in an era dictated by inequality, makes their story even more remarkable and worthy of recognition."" The unheralded story of Australia's indigenous cricketers Born in about 1841, Johnny Mullagh - also known by the traditional name Unaarrimin - was a Jardwadjali man from what is now the state of Victoria. He learned to play cricket working on a nearby farm. He was among 13 Aboriginal men picked to form a team who were brought to London in 1868 by a former first-class cricketer, Charles Lawrence, an expat who had been living in Sydney. Mullagh is credited with being a skilful all-rounder. He played in 45 of the 47 matches on the 1868 England tour, scoring 1,698 runs at an average of 23.65 and taking 245 wickets at 10. He also played in the third cricket match ever staged at Australia's most famous ground, the MCG. The best player duringthis week's Boxing Day Test between Australia and India in Melbournewill receive the newly created Mullagh Medal in his honour. Johnny Mullagh, pictured holding a cricket ball, defied colonial orders to live on state-controlled reserves Aboriginal Australians, who had inhabited the continent for tens of thousands of years prior to British colonisation, were subjected to severe discrimination in the 19th Century and afterwards. Mullagh was a passionate advocate of indigenous rights, refusing to live on state-controlled reserves. He continued to play cricket, despite colonial restrictions on the movement of Aboriginal people, and continued to do so up until the months before his death in 1891. Australian cricket has belatedly made efforts to recognise indigenous players, but only fast bowler Jason Gillespie has represented the country in tests in the men's game. There will be a further two inductees to the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame announced in February 2021.

Hilaria Baldwin denies faking her Spanish heritage,"The podcaster has been accused of faking a Spanish accent Hilaria Baldwin, podcaster and wife of actor Alec Baldwin, has responded to claims she misled the public about her Spanish heritage. Ms Baldwin, a popular yoga instructor, has been accused on social media of faking her Spanish accent. In a seven-minutevideo on Instagram,external, Ms Baldwin said she was born in Boston but was partly raised in Spain. However,her management's biography of her,externalstates that she was born on the Spanish island of Mallorca. She also previously claimed in an interview that she did not move to the United States until she was 19 to attend university in New York. ""I've seen chatter online questioning my identity and culture,"" Ms Baldwin wrote. ""This is something I take very seriously, and for those who are asking - I'll reiterate my story, as I've done many times before. ""I was born in Boston and grew up spending time with my family between Massachusetts and Spain. My parents and sibling live in Spain and I chose to live here, in the USA. We celebrate both cultures in our home - Alec and I are raising our children bilingual, just as I was raised."" Ms Baldwin explained that her accent can change because she regularly switches between Spanish and English, adding that she mixes the two when she gets ""nervous or upset"". She said in the video that she had grown up using the name Hillary in the US and Hilaria in Spain, before later ""consolidating"" under Hilaria. Hilaria Baldwin is married to actor Alec Baldwin Suspicions started to rise after claims about her heritage went viral on social media. A video of Ms Baldwin asking how to say cucumber in English has also been widely shared. People claiming to be former classmates of Ms Baldwin in Boston then disputed her Spanish accent. ""I went to [high school] with Hillary Hayward Thomas in Boston and she had no accent, was archetypal northeastern prep schooler,"" wrote David Golan on Twitter. Her husband posted a video, appearing to defend her but not by name. ""We live in a world now where we're hidden behind the anonymity of social media,"" Mr Baldwin said. ""People feel that they can say anything. They can say anything. They probably would like to do anything if they weren't at risk of getting caught and going to prison."" Ireland Baldwin has also leapt to her stepmother's defence. ""It's so pathetic that anyone would want to play detective, and dig that deep into someone's life that they don't know, don't know anything about, how they were raised, who they were actually raised by,"" she said on Instagram.

"Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus?","The symptoms of Covid and other respiratory infections are now very similar As the latest version of the Omicron variant continues to spread quickly, the official list of Covid symptoms has been expanded in England - but not yet in the rest of the UK. Theupdated guidance now lists nine extra symptoms,external, including a sore throat, muscle pains and diarrhoea, but many of these are similar to cold and flu symptoms. So how can you tell if you've got Covid, a bad cold or something else? The new list of Covid symptoms has been expanded from the original three: a new, continuous cough a fever or high temperature loss of or change to smell or taste It now includes nine other symptoms which are common signs of other respiratory infections too: shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted, lack of energy muscle aches or pains headache that lasts longer than usual blocked or runny nose sore throat, stuffy or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick It's not possible to tell if you have Covid-19, flu or another respiratory infection based on symptoms alone, official advice says. But spotting these symptoms can help to reduce the spread to other more vulnerable people. If you have any of these symptoms plus a high temperature or you don't feel well enough to go to work or school, you're advised to stay at home. Nine new Covid symptoms added to official list This was one of the three key Covid symptoms identified during the first two years of the pandemic but it appears to be much less common with Omicron infections. The most common five symptoms experienced by people with positive Covid tests recently are runny nose (83%), fatigue (71%), sore throat (69%), headache (69%) and sneezing (68%), according to the ZOE Covid symptom app. Coronavirus loss of smell: Meat tastes like petrol A high temperature is 37.8C or above, and can happen when the body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus. If you don't have a thermometer, check if you - or the person you're worried about - feel hot to the touch on the chest or back. A high temperature is unlikely with a cold. If you haveany of these symptoms,externalplus a high temperature or you don't feel well enough to carry out normal activities, you're advised to stay at home in England. You should avoid contact with other people, in particular those who are at high risk of becoming seriously unwell if they get Covid. People with symptoms are no longer advised to test for Covid in England, but if you do have a positive result, you should try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for five days after the day you took your test. Many people will no longer be infectious after five days but some may still be able to pass on the virus for up to 10 days. People with symptoms are still advised to take a PCR test in Scotland and Northern Ireland or a lateral flow test (LFT) in Wales. Anyone who tests positive in the three nations is asked to isolate. When testing ends in Scotland, people who feel unwell will be advised to stay at home until they feel better. What is the Covid isolation advice across the UK? Who can still get free Covid tests? Why are so many people catching Covid again? The advice is to try to keep your distance from people you live with, particularly those whose immune system is weaker than normal. You can also open windows in rooms for 10 minutes after someone with symptoms has left. Cleaning frequently touched surfaces such as door handles and remote controls can protect people in your house from Covid and other viruses. If you can't stay at home while you feel unwell, you can reduce the chances of passing on the infection you have by: wearing a well-fitting face mask avoiding crowded places such as public transport or large indoor gatherings taking exercise outdoors covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and washing your hands frequently For most people who've been vaccinated - and children, even if they haven't had a jab - Covid infections are usually mild, and typically last for up to a week. But some groups are still at higher risk and need protecting from Covid and other respiratory infections, including: older people those who are pregnant those who are unvaccinated people of any age whose immune system means they are at higher risk of serious illness people of any age with certain long-term conditions Some very young children who were born prematurely or who have heart conditions are also at risk from RSV, another respiratory virus. Most people can be treated for Covid at home, as with any other mild respiratory illness. You should get plenty of rest and drink water to keep hydrated. You can take paracetamol to relieve headaches and muscle aches or pains, but antibiotics won't work against viral infections like Covid. If you're having trouble breathing, contact your doctor, or use theNHS 111 coronavirus service online,external. If you're very worried about sudden shortness of breath, call 999. The NHS also advises: call 111 if you're worried about a baby or child under five if your child seems very unwell, is getting worse or you think there's something seriously wrong, call 999 don't delay getting help if you're worried, trust your instincts BOOSTER:Who can get the fourth jab and how do you book it?

How Covid-19 altered world events,"The year 2020 has been like no other. The coronavirus infected more than 67 million people, impacted 80% of jobs, and placed billions in lockdown. It's tempting to imagine how 2020 would have turned out differently without a pandemic. What extra time would we have had with loved ones? What birthdays, weddings and milestones did we miss? And while the crisis affected all of us personally, it also shaped news events around the world, with knock-on effects for millions. Here are just four political issues, from four continents, which were altered by the pandemic. The presidential election was meant to look very different. There should have been raucous rallies, and busy trips up and down the campaign trail. Instead, the pandemic meant in-person rallies were delayed, and Joe Biden accepted the Democratic nomination in a near-empty room. Several attendees at a White House event became infected - while the president himself was dramatically flown to hospital after testing positive. Experts believe there are various reasons why Donald Trump lost- but his handling of the pandemic was one of the biggest factors. ""It's clear the impact of the pandemic hurt Trump considerably,"" says Alan Abramowitz, political science professor at Emory College. Mr Trump failed to introduce adequate measures, and ""to some extent discouraged"" public health guidelines like social distancing and mask wearing, he says, turning off enough voters in swing states to tip the balance in Mr Biden's favour. Ironically, Prof Abramowitz adds, people typically rally behind the president in a crisis. ""If Mr Trump had addressed the pandemic seriously and effectively, I think he would have won the election pretty easily."" The pandemic also caused an economic downturn, which typically hurts incumbent presidents. Allan Lichtman, a historian who devised a ""13 keys"" system that correctly predicted each presidential race since 1984, called the 2020 election for Joe Biden in August - on the basis of several factors, including the short-term and long-term economy. ""It was Trump's failed response to the pandemic that resulted in his defeat,"" Prof Lichtman, a professor of history at American University, says.Mr Trump downplayed the pandemicand so failed to contain infections quickly, which ""cost him the short-term economic key and the long-term economic key"". Covid-19 meant the Democratic party moved most of their campaigning online - which may have also helped the Biden campaign. Joe Biden accepted the Democratic nomination in a near-empty room, at a virtual congress ""Biden is memorable for making gaffes and misspeaking,"" says Miles Coleman, associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, a political analysis newsletter at the University of Virginia. The pandemic meant Mr Biden adopted a lower profile - and the election became ""just an up or down vote on Trump"", rather than ""a choice between two candidates"". However, Mr Coleman adds, the fact Republicans continued with traditional in-person campaigning also meant ""Trump gained with non-white voters in rural areas where people may not have the best internet - where you need to go door to door to reach voters."" Finally, Prof Lichtman believes the pandemic also helped drive the highest voter turnout in more than a century. The pandemic ""created a real sense of national emergencyâ¦ I think that convinced American people - both pro-Trump and pro-Biden - that this election was the most critical event of their lifetime."" Five reasons Biden won the election Why Donald Trump lost In 2019, the world was gripped by an unfolding crisis in Hong Kong. The international financial centre saw near-weekly pro-democracy protests, often involving clashes with police, tear gas, and on occasion live bullets being fired. While the demonstrations drew condemnation from Beijing and some businesses, the public largely appeared sympathetic - as shown in local elections in late 2019 wherepro-democracy groups won by a landslide. Yet by 2020, the streets of Hong Kong were mostly quiet, the movement became subdued, and pro-democracy legislators either resigned - or fled the territory altogether. What changed? 2019 v 2020: Images from a Hong Kong gone quiet The pandemic, which hit Hong Kong in January, led to a decline in demonstrations at the start, says Joey Siu, a student activist. ""Hong Kongers are aware of the seriousness of the virus, given that we've had experience of the 2003 Sars outbreak."" However, the first and second waves of the pandemic were contained relatively quickly. The greater impact, analysts argue, came from how the pandemic led to strict public gathering guidelines - which were also used to penalise people at demonstrations. Victoria Hui, a politics professor at Notre Dame University, says the authorities had always wanted to stop the anti-government protests, and ""the pandemic gave the authorities an excuse"" to do so under the guise of public health. Several pro-democracy activists have been fined, and protests banned, under social distancing guidelines. Ms Siu says many had previously been willing to risk taking part in unauthorised demonstrations as there was still ""a chance that we wouldn't get arrested, and a chance we could win at court"". ""But now, with the public gathering ban, police are able to prosecute anybody who seems to be taking part in a pro-democracy protest, and fine you HK$2,000 ($260; Â£190)."" The government says its regulations are based on science, and needed to prevent infections. An annual candlelit vigil commemorating the Tiananmen massacre was among those banned amid coronavirus restrictions Then there were two major developments - the imposition of a sweeping national security law, and the postponement of parliamentary elections - that are widely seen to have restricted Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. The national security law made ""inciting hatred"" of the government, calling on countries to impose sanctions on Chinese officials, or usingcertain protest slogans, offences punishable by life imprisonment. Beijing has long said that such a law is needed to protect Hong Kong's integrity - but some argue that the timing of the law, which was finally introduced in May, was ""fundamentally shaped by Covid-19"". ""Beijing calculated that the rest of the world would be preoccupied,"" says Prof Hui. The impact of the legislation was instant. Some pro-democracy groups disbanded, and shops took down posters supporting protesters. Activists became much, much more afraid to protest, says Ms Siu. Supporters of the legislation, however, arguedit was needed to restore stabilityafter a year of often violent protests. This video can not be played Hong Kong's Ronny Tong defends new security law A month later, amid a third wave of infections, the government announced that legislative elections would be postponed by a year - despite some health experts saying it was still possible to hold polls safely. The government said the postponement was necessary given the ""immense infection risk"", and dozens of other elections around the world had also been delayed. However, rights groups believed it was a political move, as pro-democracy groups had been hoping to win a majority in parliament. In subsequent months,several other pro-democracy politicians were charged by police, or disqualified altogether. In November, all of Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers resigned in protest - leaving the legislature with almost no dissenting voices for the first time ever. Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? The city of two masks faces a new crisis Hong Kong's dying news stands tell a story of change Many outside of Africa had not heard of Tigray, a region in northern Ethiopia, before 2020. But in November, a conflict erupted between the Ethiopian government and the regional party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - leading to reports of hundreds dead, and more than 40,000 people fleeing into neighbouring Sudan.There had been fears the fighting could have destabilised the entire region. One of the triggers for the crisis was the way the government handled the constitutional crisis that emerged after national elections were postponed due to Covid-19. ""The postponement of elections is one of the fundamental causes of this war,"" says Tsedale Lemma, editor-in-chief of the Addis Standard. Under new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia had committed to democratic reforms in 2018. The national elections scheduled for August 2020 were the first opportunity for most opposition groups to compete, ""after decades of absence from the political space"", she says. ""Everyone was excited."" ""There were a lot of political tensions between rival groups, and although some had expressed concerns about possible post-election violenceâ¦ people had hope that the elections would settle tensions."" When the pandemic hit in March, the electoral commission's initial decision to postpone the vote was accepted by most opposition groups. However, it also sparked a constitutional crisis as the government's term was due to end in September. The government failed to compromise with opposition parties about what should happen next, says Ms Tsedale. Instead, a partisan legal council made the decision to extend the government's term and postpone elections indefinitely until the pandemic was over - and this was voted through by parliament's upper house, which is completely controlled by the ruling party, she adds. This meant the government lost legitimacy with its rivals. The crisis has forced more than 40,000 people from their homes Comfort Ero, Africa programme director at the International Crisis Group, says ""the pandemic and the decision around elections added more fuel to what was already a combustible situation."" Ethiopia was already in a ""fragile transition"", with tensions between the government and the regions, and threats of communal violence, she says. The opposition saw the postponement of elections ""as another example of the prime minister not consulting with his rivals and acting unilaterally"". In response, the TPLF - which already had long-standing tensions with Mr Abiy - held its own regional elections on 9 September, in defiance of the federal government. ""That was the straw that broke the camel's back - the TPLF no longer recognised the central government, while the federal government refused to recognise the TPLF - they entered a phase of mutual delegitimisation and after that, war was a matter of when, not if,"" says Ms Tsedale. Ethiopian troops captured Tigray's capital in late November, declaring victory - but fighting has continued in parts of the region and the UN has warned of ""an appalling impact on civilians"". The conflict is ""a tragic, sad outcome... we missed a golden opportunity of building politics built on consensus,"" Ms Tsedale says. 'How we survived when our city was shelled' 'I survived an 11-hour gun battle' Crisis has engulfed Ethiopia. Hereâs what it means In April, political observers began saying thatthe pandemic had ""saved"" Benjamin Netanyahu's political career,external. Mr Netanyahu had just been sworn in for a fifth term as prime minister, in a unity government with his rival Benny Gantz. The country had been in a state of political limbo for almost a year - despite holding three elections between 2019 and 2020 - as no bloc had enough seats to form a ruling coalition. In fact, in the most recent, March elections,Mr Gantz was invited to form a government first,external, as he had a slim majority of MPs backing him, united by the goal of ousting Mr Netanyahu. However, the opposition ""had difficulty forming a government because they came from a very wide range of parties - from right-wing nationalists to left-wing communists,"" says Anshel Pfeffer, a commentator for Haaretz newspaper. Then the pandemic arrived, while Mr Netanyahu was still acting as caretaker leader. ""People suddenly felt there was a state of emergency, and Netanyahu took charge of Covid policy, saying he was the only person leading the country in an emergency,"" Mr Pfeffer says. ""The pandemic came at the best possible political timing for Netanyahu - it certainly helped put more pressure on Gantz to join him."" Mr Gantz, who had vowed never to sit in government with Mr Netanyahu as prime minister, defended his U-turn, saying ""these are not normal times"". Under the terms of the unity government, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gantz would rotate as prime minister, with Mr Netanyahu going first. The agreement was seen by many as a victory for Mr Netanyahu, who had defied opponents' calls to step down after being charged with corruption months earlier. He denies accusations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Protesters have rallied against Mr Netanyahu's alleged corruption and handling of the pandemic The pandemic brought Mr Netanyahu breathing space, says Tal Schneider, diplomatic correspondent at Globes. ""The entire problem behind the scenes is the criminal trial - he just looks to gain more time."" By contrast, she added, Mr Gantz no longer posed a political threat because he was seen as having ""cheated his voters"" and his base by joining Mr Netanyahu in government. And the unity government did not stay united for long - just eight months later, it collapsed amid a row over state budgets. Israeli voters will have their fourth electionin two years in March, and Mr Netanyahu has vowed to return with a ""huge win"".

EU ambassadors approve post-Brexit trade dealThe landmark EU-UK deal is on its way to becoming law provisionally on 1 January.,"The ambassadors who meet in Brussels are jointly called Coreper Ambassadors from the 27 EU member states have unanimously approved the EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal, paving the way for it to take effect. The deal is likely to become law on 1 January, as the UK Parliament is expected to approve it on Wednesday. Under EU rules it can take effect provisionally, though the European Parliament will vote on it in January. The deal sets the framework for trade once the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union in four days' time. The deal, which ended nine months of negotiations, will be approved by all 27 EU governments in writing at 15:00 (14:00 GMT) on Tuesday, the German EU presidency said. They have had three days to analyse the details ofthe EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement,external, since its publication. But most of the 1,246-page document had already been seen by member states in previous weeks. The deal ends nearly 50 years of UK membership of the bloc, covering a vast array of policies besides those governing common trade rules. UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that he had spoken to European Council President Charles Michel about the deal,externaland its forthcoming ratification by EU governments. ""I welcomed the importance of the UK/EU Agreement as a new starting point for our relationship, between sovereign equals,"" he said. ""We looked forward to the formal ratification of the agreement and to working together on shared priorities, such as tackling climate change."" There was much relief that the tortuous negotiations - including last-minute haggling over fish quotas - finally ended on Christmas Eve. The no-deal scenario would have meant reverting to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules on 1 January, notably the immediate imposition of tariffs - import taxes - and quotas on a huge range of goods. The tariffs on some food items would have been 50% or higher. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work What happens next with Brexit? The new trade deal: enables the UK to continue selling goods to the EU market - the UK's biggest trade partner - without tariffs or quotas includes binding enforcement and dispute settlement mechanisms to address any unfair competition - what the EU calls ""level playing field"" rules ensures continued smooth transport links between the UK and EU, including safeguards on passenger rights means new paperwork and other barriers for UK businesses in Europe, including financial services, which employs more than a million people in the UK does little to address the needs of the UK service sector, accounting for about 80% of the UK economy transfers 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in British waters to the UK fleet, over a five-and-a-half year transition period reduces UK access to EU programmes in various fields, including policing and education.

Game of Thrones games maker dies 'after poisoning',"A Chinese tycoon who died on Christmas Day was poisoned, Shanghai police say. Lin Qi, 39, was the chairman and chief executive of games developer Yoozoo, best known for the Game of Thrones: Winter Is Coming strategy game. The Shanghai police statement pointed to one of Mr Lin's colleagues - identified only by his surname Xu - as the main suspect. Mr Lin was believed to have a net worth of around 6.8bn yuan (Â£960m), according to the Hurun China Rich List. Many employees and ex-employees gathered outside Yoozoo's office on Friday to mourn his death. The businessman was a star of China's lucrative gaming market and had also made a foray into film production. He founded Yoozoo in 2009 and successfully led the company through a period where the gaming industry saw substantial changes towards mobile gaming. GoT makers adapt Chinese sci-fi saga for Netflix China imposes video game curfew for minors How online gaming has become a social lifeline - BBC Worklife The company also issued an emotional statement on its official Weibo microblog. ""Goodbye youth,"" it said, adding, ""We will be together, continue to be kind, continue to believe in goodness, and continue the fight against all that is bad."" The post attracted thousands of comments while the topic has been viewed more than 290 million times on Weibo. Many of the tributes featured calligraphy as Mr Lin was an avid calligrapher along with being a poetry enthusiast. Details are scant but Mr Lin is believed to have been poisoned, based on police statements. Yoozoo released its own statement, saying Mr Lin had admitted himself to hospital after feeling unwell but was in a stable condition. Things took a dramatic turn on Friday when the company announced its founder had died. According to local media reports, the person in custody could be Xu Yao, who heads Yoozoo's movie production arm. There was also some speculation among local media that Mr Lin had been poisoned via aged pu'er tea, a fermented Chinese drink. Apart from its Game of Thrones game, Yoozoo is also the co-publisher of Supercell's smash-hit game Brawl Stars along with China's Tencent Holdings. The company is also known for its connection with the Chinese sci-fi novel Three-Body Problem as it holds the rights for its film adaptation. But its expansion into the motion picture business wasn't as successful as the company had hoped and the project to adapt the book into six films by Yoozoo Pictures never took off. In September, it granted US streaming platform Netflix the right to adapt the sci-fi novel for television. The book is the first instalment of the trilogy Remembrance of Earth's Past by writer Liu Cixin and has received critical acclaim, counting both former US President Barack Obama and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg among its fans.

"Game of Thrones games maker dies 'after poisoning'Lin Qi, 39, was the founder of Chinese firm Yoozoo which developed the popular online game.Business","A Chinese tycoon who died on Christmas Day was poisoned, Shanghai police say. Lin Qi, 39, was the chairman and chief executive of games developer Yoozoo, best known for the Game of Thrones: Winter Is Coming strategy game. The Shanghai police statement pointed to one of Mr Lin's colleagues - identified only by his surname Xu - as the main suspect. Mr Lin was believed to have a net worth of around 6.8bn yuan (Â£960m), according to the Hurun China Rich List. Many employees and ex-employees gathered outside Yoozoo's office on Friday to mourn his death. The businessman was a star of China's lucrative gaming market and had also made a foray into film production. He founded Yoozoo in 2009 and successfully led the company through a period where the gaming industry saw substantial changes towards mobile gaming. GoT makers adapt Chinese sci-fi saga for Netflix China imposes video game curfew for minors How online gaming has become a social lifeline - BBC Worklife The company also issued an emotional statement on its official Weibo microblog. ""Goodbye youth,"" it said, adding, ""We will be together, continue to be kind, continue to believe in goodness, and continue the fight against all that is bad."" The post attracted thousands of comments while the topic has been viewed more than 290 million times on Weibo. Many of the tributes featured calligraphy as Mr Lin was an avid calligrapher along with being a poetry enthusiast. Details are scant but Mr Lin is believed to have been poisoned, based on police statements. Yoozoo released its own statement, saying Mr Lin had admitted himself to hospital after feeling unwell but was in a stable condition. Things took a dramatic turn on Friday when the company announced its founder had died. According to local media reports, the person in custody could be Xu Yao, who heads Yoozoo's movie production arm. There was also some speculation among local media that Mr Lin had been poisoned via aged pu'er tea, a fermented Chinese drink. Apart from its Game of Thrones game, Yoozoo is also the co-publisher of Supercell's smash-hit game Brawl Stars along with China's Tencent Holdings. The company is also known for its connection with the Chinese sci-fi novel Three-Body Problem as it holds the rights for its film adaptation. But its expansion into the motion picture business wasn't as successful as the company had hoped and the project to adapt the book into six films by Yoozoo Pictures never took off. In September, it granted US streaming platform Netflix the right to adapt the sci-fi novel for television. The book is the first instalment of the trilogy Remembrance of Earth's Past by writer Liu Cixin and has received critical acclaim, counting both former US President Barack Obama and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg among its fans.

Covid hospital pressures 'incredibly challenging',"Dr Giri Shankar says patient numbers and staff sickness makes for an ""incredibly challenging"" time for hospitals Large numbers of patients and staff sickness have created an ""incredibly challenging"" situation at Wales' hospitals, a health official has said. Cardiff and Vale health boardappealed for medics to helpUniversity Hospital of Wales' critical care department on Boxing Day and received 33 offers. The health board had no spare intensive care beds on 20 December, figures show. Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar said the health system was under enormous and unprecedented pressure. He told BBC Radio Wales that a ""significant proportion"" of the workforce are sick and unwell. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Just before Christmas, the sickness rates were just around 10-12%, he said, adding: ""That's a large number of unavailable workforce. ""Therefore, as you saw yesterday and the day before, health boards making plea for whatever help they can get from various sources including medical students, ex-health care professionals, and so on,"" he said. ""So, it is an incredibly challenging situation and not just in Cardiff and Wales but across all our health boards."" Dr Shankar told BBC Radio Wales that a ""significant proportion"" of the workforce are sick and unwell The health board tweeted a plea at about 21:15 GMT on Boxing Day saying its critical care department was ""urgently looking for assistance from medical students or other staff groups who have previously supported with proning patients"". Proning involves turning patients on to their front to increase the oxygen supply to the lungs. Sharp rise in Covid infections in Wales How many people have died with Covid in Wales? Q&A: What has changed in Wales lockdown? On Sunday morning it thanked people for responding to its request and said there was now ""no need to call us"". The Welsh Government say by mid-morning on Sunday the unit had received 33 officers of assistance locally and from other parts of Wales. It said a ""small number"" of people who have worked for the health board before will have their offer taken up, while the details of others will be kept on file should they be required later. The number of intensive care beds available in a unit fluctuates day by day, depending on factors such as staffing. For example, according to NHS Wales informatics, Cardiff and Vale health board's intensive care has been running at close to full capacity in recent days, with no spare bed on the unit at all on 20 December. On Monday, Public Health Wales reported afurther 15 people had diedafter contracting coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 3,383. Hospitals in the south of England have saidthey have seen a ""real rise in pressure""as the number of Covid patients needing treatment increases. Speaking to BBC Radio 5Live, Dr Andrew Lansdown, a consultant endocrinologist at University Hospital of Wales, said the influx of Covid-19 patients had become ""relentless"". ""We really have felt stretched to the limit,"" he said, adding the number of patients with the virus coming through the hospital was ""massive"". ""I think it's not just the new variant, which seems to be spreading faster. You've also got the usual winter pressures at the hospital, as well as staff themselves who are ill, self-isolating."" He said the past few weeks had seen hospitals in Wales coming under ""extreme pressure"". Dr Lansdown said the response to the appeal for help on social media had been ""overwhelming"" but he feared that it would not be long before other hospitals across Wales and the rest of the UK would be facing similar pressures. ""During the first wave there was a large resource of energy in staff, whereas now in the second wave it's quite different,"" he said. ""We can see a lot of staff fatigue. It's a fatigue that is obviously physical, but it very much is emotional as well. ""We're seeing staff members themselves becoming unwell, some have sadly died during the pandemic. And then trying to balance that with looking after patients as well."" He added: ""I think it's a picture right across Wales.""

Brexit traffic measures introduced at port,"Holyhead's port sees an estimated five million tonnes of freight every year Traffic measures have been introduced on a major road leading to Holyhead port as the UK prepares to enter its new trading relationship with the EU. The Welsh Government has said the plans are aimed at ""minimising any possible disruption to the port, town and wider community"". Freight turned away from the port due to incorrect documentation will be sent on to the westbound A55. The UK Government has predicted this could be 40-70% of freight. Quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal What just happened with Brexit? Holyhead is the second busiest roll-on/roll-off port in the UK, behind only Dover. Around 600 lorries and trailers leave the port on ferries bound for Dublin every day. A trade deal between the EU and UKhas now been agreedand will take effect from 1 January, but the changes in the trading relationship between the two parties mean there could besome disruption. The Welsh Government added it expected the peak of traffic issues to be in mid-January. The eastbound carriageway between junction two and four of the A55 will run with contraflow. The Welsh Government said,external: ""All HGVs turned away from the port will be redirected back to the contraflow to turn off at Junction 4 and join the westbound carriageway which is reserved for redirected HGVs."" Lorries will be stacked if there is no other site available. It said work is already under way to prepare Plot 9 of Parc Cybi in Holyhead and the site due to be ready to accept HGVs by mid-January. When asked if stacked lorry drivers would have access to toilets and food and drink, the Welsh Government said ""appropriate welfare facilities"" would be provided. Economy Minister Ken Skates said: ""We need to implement these contingency plans in order to do what we can to minimise any possible disruption for the port, community of Holyhead and wider area. ""We have never faced this kind of situation before and we have a duty to prepare for the worst possible scenario."" The EU is implementing border controls from 1 January TheKent port has seen gridlock over recent weeksas Britain approached the end of its transition period with the EU and France banned all Channel crossings over the new coronavirus variant in the south-east of England. Chair of the CBI in North Wales Kinza Sutton told BBC Radio Wales: ""We anticipate that there will be delays. ""Certainly the changes to documentation is going to cause huge changes for everybody, so certainly during January I'd imagine there will be delays as everyone gets used to the new systems."" Aplan to buy a truck stop as part of post-Brexit inbound customs checks was scrapped on Christmas Eve. Border customs checks on inbound lorries and trailers will be implemented from July. On Monday, a Welsh Government spokeswoman said along with the UK government it had determined other potential sites on Parc Cybi would be a more suitable alternative. ""This would also offer the opportunity for the truck stop to remain open, protecting jobs and providing a service for its customers, should it wish to do so,"" she said, adding further details would be provided in due course. Anglesey Councillor and Executive member for Highways Robert G Parry said Parc Cybi was the ""ideal place"" for lorries. The Plaid councillor for the Canolbarth MÃ´n Ward said: ""It means that they don't get off the A55 at allâ¦ and there's plenty of room there."" But he said the Welsh Government needed to ""speed things up"". ""They've left it until the last minute,"" he said. ""Of course there is the difference now that the deal has been made but they've been too slow in moving forward to provide these facilities. ""Only time will tell. What happens during the next two days will show us what will happen."" Local traffic will be diverted on to the A5 through the village of Caergeiliog, which was the original route to the port before the A55 was extended in 2001. Councillor Gwilym O Jones said he had been ""assured"" measures including a lower speed limit and enforcement would be in place. ""I'm very pleased that people are listening to what I've been asking for,"" he added.

Trump signs Covid relief and spending package,"This video can not be played Trump asked Congress to amend the Covid aid bill earlier this week US President Donald Trump has belatedly signed into law a coronavirus relief and spending package bill, averting a partial government shutdown. Mr Trump had previously refused to sign the bill, criticising ""wasteful spending"" and calling for higher payouts to people hit by the pandemic. The delay meant that millions temporarily lost unemployment benefits. The relief package worth $900bn (Â£665bn) was approved by Congress after months of negotiation. It is part of a $2.3tn spending package that includes $1.4tn for normal federal government spending. Republican and Democratic Party lawmakers had been pleading with the president to sign it before a budget deadline of midnight on Monday. If he had not, some government agencies would have had to close, unless legislators could pass a stopgap bill. About 14 million Americans faced a lapse in unemployment benefit payments and new stimulus cheques. Unemployment benefits will now be restored. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home After the coronavirus aid relief bill overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives and Senate last Monday, Mr Trump issued an implied veto threat, describing the package as a ""disgrace"" and full of ""wasteful"" items. The bill includes a payment of $600 to Americans earning less than $75,000 a year. Mr Trump said he wanted Americans to receive $2,000 - but Republicans in Congress refused to agree to the change. Mr Trump also baulked at the annual aid money for other countries in the federal budget, arguing that those funds should instead go to struggling Americans. The economic effect of the pandemic has left millions of Americans reliant on food aid and other assistance His demand to send the measure back to Capitol Hill stunned lawmakers since he had largely stayed out of the negotiations. His top economic adviser, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, had proposed the $600 payments early this month, and many questioned why the president had waited so long to object. It was not immediately clear why Mr Trump - who is in Florida - finally decided to sign the bill into law on Sunday. He said he was signing the bill with ""a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed"". He leaves office on 20 January after losing November's election to Mr Biden, although he has refused to admit defeat. Republican Senator Mitt Romney said he was ""relieved"" that the legislation had at last become law. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, Republican Senator Pat Toomey said the president risked being remembered for ""chaos, misery and erratic behaviour"". US President-elect Joe Biden had warned of ""devastating consequences"" if Mr Trump continued to refuse to sign. In a strongly worded statement published on the transition website on Saturday, Mr Biden described Mr Trump's refusal to sign the bill as an ""abdication of responsibility"". ""It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don't know if they'll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump's refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority,"" Mr Biden said.

Man behind famous BBC and Channel 4 'idents' dies,"Martin Lambie-Nairn in 2011 Martin Lambie-Nairn, the noted designer who created popular ""idents"" for the BBC and Channel 4, has died aged 75. His design consultancy created Channel 4's original animated ""blocks"" logo in 1982 and the globe balloon idents used by BBC One from 1997 to 2001. His company also produced memorable idents for BBC Two, one of which had blue paint splashing horizontally across the screen to hit a metallic 2. He was recently seen discussing his work on BBC Four'sThe Sound of TV. Lambie-Nairn's death on Christmas Day was announced by ML-N, the consultancy he co-founded. He was behind Channel 4's original blocks logo In a statement, it described him as ""one of the leading graphic designers and creative directors of his generation"". ""His exceptional work, kindness and infectious creative spirit touched the lives of so many people,"" the statement continued. ""He will be hugely missed by everyone who had the privilege to work alongside him over the years."" Former Apple design chief Sir Jony Ive also paid tribute, saying he was ""fortunate"" Lambie-Nairn had ""defined part of my visual landscape growing up"". ""His work for the BBC was so very gentle, thoughtful and beautiful,"" he said. ""Identities driven by beauty and not a marketing agenda are so rare and so valuable."" He also conceived BBC One's familiar globe balloon Lambie-Nairn's other credits include satirical puppet show Spitting Image, which he co-created with John Lloyd, Roger Law and and Peter Fluck. It was Lambie-Nairn who suggested Fluck and Law make a show based on their sculpted caricatures. This led to episodes of the original show,recently revived by streaming service BritBox, bearing the credit ""From an original lunch by Martin Lambie-Nairn"". Other brand signifiers in which his company had a hand include the bubble logo used by mobile phone company O2. He also oversaw a Blue Peter competitionto design the official emblem for the Queen's diamond jubilee in 2012. His BBC Two idents gave the channel a sleek new identity Speaking to the BBC in 2013, Lambie-Nairn said designers like himself were ""in the business of setting channels apart from each other"". ""All branding is about setting yourself apart and trying to be clear to your audience or customers that you stand for this set of values,"" he continued.

How will it affect my holidays?,"Rules on travelling between the UK and European Union countries change on 1 January 2021, after an agreement to keep many rules the same for 11 months after Brexit comes to an end. At the moment, no. Because of Covid, travellers from most non-EU countries can't visit except for essential reasons. After 31 December, the UK will no longer be treated like a member of the EU, so becomes subject to these rules. The only non-EU countries exempt from these restrictions are those with very low infection rates, such as New Zealand. The EU could choose to exempt the UK, and individual EU countries could create a ""travel corridor"" with the UK, allowing restriction-free travel. If the rules are changed, you'll be able to travel to all EU countries - plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - as a tourist, without needing a visa. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal You'll be able to stay for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. So, an Easter weekend in Spain, followed by a June fortnight in Italy, would be covered by your 90-day limit. The rules for Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are different. You could make a 90-day trip to any of them and still not use up your 90-day allowance for other EU countries. You may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, to work or study, or forbusiness travel.,external From 2022, UK nationals will have to pay for avisa-waiver scheme,externalin order to visit many European countries. No. Your current passport will be valid as long as: It is less than 10 years old And has six months left before it runs out The six-month rule won't apply for visits to Ireland, because it is part ofthe Common Travel Area.,external If you need a new passport -which will be a different colour- the government says youshould apply in plenty of time.,external The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)has entitled about 27 million UK citizens to state-provided medical treatment if they fall ill or have an accident in EU countries, as well as a number of others. All EHIC cards issued before the end of 2020 will be valid until their expiry date (on the front of your card). The government says it will issue a new card, called the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Like EHIC, it will cover chronic or existing illnesses, routine maternity care and emergencies. However, there are no further details yet on when it will start. Its advice,externalis that you should buy travel insurance with healthcare cover before going on holiday - especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition. You'll no longer be able to use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes. When you arrive in an EU country (except Ireland), be prepared to show your return ticket. You could also be asked to show that you have enough money for your stay. It could also takelonger to cross the UK border.,external The guarantee of free roaming throughout the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norwayends on 1 January 2021. You should check with your mobile provider to see if you're likely to face extra charges. The four main UK operators have said they have no plans to reintroduce roaming fees. The EU and the UK agreed to co-operate on international mobile roaming. But there is nothing in the post-Brexit trade agreement that would stop travellers being charged for using their phone in the EU, and vice versa, in the future. The government has passed laws to protect customers, including: A Â£45-a-month cap on using mobile data abroad (then you must opt in to use more) Requirements for customers to be informed when they've reached 80% and 100% of their data allowance Yes, but you'll need to take your driving licence, as well as your log book (V5C) and valid insurance documents if you are taking your own car. You will need to contact your insurer six weeks before you travel to get a green card that will prove you have insurance. Most drivers will not need to buy an International Driving Permit, with the exception of those with paper licences (not photocards) and those with licences issued in Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man, who will need one for some European countries. What are the rules on driving in the EU after transition? Pet passports issued in Great Britain will not be valid for travel to the EU from 1 January 2021. From that date,pets travelling from Great Britain to the EU will need to have an animal health certificate (AHC).,externalThe same rules will apply if you are taking your pet to Northern Ireland. In 2002, this dog was the first to travel to the UK using a pet passport AHCs will be issued by a vet, will be valid for four months and must be obtained no more than 10 days before travel. AHCs will be valid for a single trip into the EU, onward travel within the EU and re-entry to Great Britain. Your pet must have been microchipped and have had a rabies vaccination. It will also have to have a treatment againstEchinococcus multilocularis(a type of tapeworm) for entry into Finland, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway or Malta. Passengers from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) travelling to EU countries cantake advantage of duty-free shopping,externalfrom January 2021. Limits on tobacco and alcohol will increase.

Hospitals under pressure as Covid cases rise,"London Ambulance Service received as many emergency calls on 26 December as it did at the height of the first wave of Covid-19 England's ""very high"" Covid infection level is a ""growing concern"" as the NHS struggles to cope with rising patient numbers, a health official has said. On Monday, a record 41,385 Covid cases and 357 deathswere reported in the UK,external. NHS England said the number of people being treated for the virus in hospital is now 20,426, which is higher than the previous peak of about 19,000 in April. Health officials in Wales and Scotland have also said they are at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Monday's figure for new cases is the highest daily number reported by the UK government, and the first time the daily total has surpassed 40,000. It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in April, but testing capacity was too limited to detect the true number. Some data over the Christmas period is incomplete, as a result of certain services being paused. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said Monday's figure included some infections where reporting was delayed, but that officials did not deny there had been a significant increase in infections. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""This very high level of infection is of growing concern at a time when our hospitals are at their most vulnerable, with new admissions rising in many regions."" ""Despite unprecedented levels of infection, there is hope on the horizon,"" she added. Dr Doyle urged members of the public to ""continue to play our part in stopping the spread of the virus"" as the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is rolled out. Hospitals in Wales, Scotland and the south of England have reported rising pressure on their services as the number of Covid patients increases. Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, south-east London, said on Monday that an ""internal incident"" over its ""high number of Covid-positive patients"" had been ongoing since Sunday. ""All our patients have received the treatment they need, including intensive care treatment for Covid-19 and oxygen therapy as required. ""We are continuing to monitor the situation to ensure that this remains the case,"" a spokesperson for Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust said. Two stats stand out today and underline the extent of the pressure on the NHS. One is the more than 20,000 Covid patients in English hospitals, more than the peak in the first wave in April. In many ways it is even tougher for hospitals now, as they are trying to clear the backlog on non-urgent operations and procedures cancelled in the first wave - as well as cope with the surge in Covid numbers. It is worth pointing out though that one reason for the high level of patients is that some are there thanks to drugs and therapies discovered in the past year who might not have survived in the first wave. The other key statistic is the 41,385 new daily reported cases - by far the highest number since the testing system was fully established in the summer. Some sadly will become seriously ill after a week or so which points to even greater strain on hospitals in the new year. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said she saw ""wall to wall Covid"" when she worked at one London hospital on Christmas Day. Dr Katherine Henderson told the BBC there was a ""great deal of difficulty"" getting patients into wards.

Darren Hughes told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the situation in Welsh hospitals was ""incredibly serious, and worsening"", with some intensive care units already at capacity.

"Hospitals under pressure as Covid cases riseRising demand is down to the ""rapid spread"" of the new variant of Covid-19, health bosses say.","London Ambulance Service received as many emergency calls on 26 December as it did at the height of the first wave of Covid-19 England's ""very high"" Covid infection level is a ""growing concern"" as the NHS struggles to cope with rising patient numbers, a health official has said. On Monday, a record 41,385 Covid cases and 357 deathswere reported in the UK,external. NHS England said the number of people being treated for the virus in hospital is now 20,426, which is higher than the previous peak of about 19,000 in April. Health officials in Wales and Scotland have also said they are at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Monday's figure for new cases is the highest daily number reported by the UK government, and the first time the daily total has surpassed 40,000. It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in April, but testing capacity was too limited to detect the true number. Some data over the Christmas period is incomplete, as a result of certain services being paused. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said Monday's figure included some infections where reporting was delayed, but that officials did not deny there had been a significant increase in infections. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""This very high level of infection is of growing concern at a time when our hospitals are at their most vulnerable, with new admissions rising in many regions."" ""Despite unprecedented levels of infection, there is hope on the horizon,"" she added. Dr Doyle urged members of the public to ""continue to play our part in stopping the spread of the virus"" as the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is rolled out. Hospitals in Wales, Scotland and the south of England have reported rising pressure on their services as the number of Covid patients increases. Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, south-east London, said on Monday that an ""internal incident"" over its ""high number of Covid-positive patients"" had been ongoing since Sunday. ""All our patients have received the treatment they need, including intensive care treatment for Covid-19 and oxygen therapy as required.

"UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come inMinisters warn of ""practical and procedural changes"" when the Brexit transition period ends this week.","There will be ""bumpy moments"" for UK businesses and travellers as they get to grips with new EU rules, says government minister Michael Gove. He said there would be ""practical and procedural changes"" when the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. Mr Gove also urged people going to the EU to make extra checks, including mobile phone roaming charges. EU ambassadors have approved the post-Brexit trade deal,paving the way for it to take effect on 1 January. Under EU rules it can take effect provisionally, though the European Parliament will vote on it in January. In the UK, MPs will vote on the deal on Wednesday. Meanwhile, UK International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said she expects to sign a continuity trade agreement with Turkey this week - a move that was not possible until the deal with the EU was struck. Quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal How Brexit will change your holidays in 2021 What will happen to mobile roaming charges? Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ""I'm sure there will be bumpy moments but we are there in order to try to do everything we can to smooth the path."" He warned businesses that time was ""very short"" to make the final preparations before the transition period ends. ""The nature of our new relationship with the EU - outside the Single Market and Customs Union - means that there are practical and procedural changes that businesses and citizens need to get ready for,"" he said. ""We know that there will be some disruption as we adjust to new ways of doing business with the EU, so it is vital that we all take the necessary action now."" Businesses have been urged to make sure they understand the new rules on importing and exporting goods, including the different rules that apply to trade with Northern Ireland, and to consider how they will make customs declarations on EU trade. Mr Gove also encouraged travellers to EU destinations from 1 January to take out comprehensive travel insurance, check their mobile phone provider's roaming charges and make sure they have at least six months left on their passports. Measures are being put in place around the UK as it prepares to enter its new trading relationship with the EU. The Scottish government has signed a leaseto use a former military airfield in Dumfries and Galloway as an emergency lorry parkfor up to 240 vehicles if there is disruption at Cairnryan port near Stranraer. In Wales,traffic measures have been introduced on a major road leading to Holyhead port. Meanwhile,travellers from Great Britain will need to declare cash of â¬10,000 (Â£9,049) or more when entering Northern Irelandfrom 1 January. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work What happens next with Brexit? The trade deal was reached after months of fraught talks on issues including fishing rights and business rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would provide new legislative and regulatory freedoms to""deliver for people who felt left behind"". But fishermen's leaders have accused him of ""caving in"" and sacrificing their interests. Labour called it a ""thin deal"" that needed ""more work"" to protect UK jobs. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the ""bumpy moments"" Mr Gove warned about were of the government's own making because it waited to strike the deal ""so close to the wire"". She said the government had refused to engage with business on preparations, while dodging questions for months about the recruitment of customs agents and the development of IT systems. ""The government is treating its own incompetence as inevitable,"" she said. The SNP said it was ""the understatement of the century"" that the UK would face disruption, adding that millions of businesses would now face ""a mountain of extra costs, red tape, bureaucracy and barriers to trade in just four days' time"". Conservative grandee Lord Heseltine has urged MPs and peers to abstain when voting on the deal, warning it will inflict ""lasting damage"" on the UK. The former deputy prime minister said he would ""in no way share the endorsement of the legislation"", but that he would not vote against it because the consequences of a no-deal would be even graver. Political parties in Northern Ireland that take their seats in Westminster - the DUP, the Alliance and the SDLP - areset to vote against the deal. The DUP, which supports Brexit, said its eight MPs would oppose the deal because it did not address ""damaging"" issues caused by introducing customs checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. This video can not be played Brexit deal: How did we get here? Over the weekend, Chancellor Rishi Sunak sought to reassure the City of London that it will not be damaged by the deal. He said they would be ""doing a few things a bit differently"" and looking at ""how we make the City of London the most attractive place to list new companies anywhere in the world"". The chancellor said the deal was ""an enormously unifying moment for our country"" and it brought reassurance to those who were concerned about the impact on businesses.

Citizen journalist jailed for Wuhan reports,"The former lawyer was detained in May A Chinese citizen journalist who covered Wuhan's coronavirus outbreak has been jailed for four years. Zhang Zhan was found guilty of ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble"", a frequent charge against activists. The 37-year-old former lawyer was detained in May, and has been on hunger strike for several months. Her lawyers say she is in poor health. Ms Zhang is one of several citizen journalists who have run into trouble for reporting on Wuhan. There is no free media in China and authorities are known to clamp down on activists or whistleblowers seen as undermining the government's response to the outbreak. Missing Chinese journalist 'under state supervision' Journalist reappears two months after Wuhan chase Wuhan scientist 'welcomes' visit over lab leak claim Ren Quanniu, one of Zhang Zhan's lawyers, expressed serious concern for her physical and mental wellbeing, saying she was very weak and on hunger strike. Mr Ren said his client ""looked devastated"" when her sentence was announced and her mother sobbed loudly. In a video interview with an independent filmmaker before her arrest, Ms Zhang said she decided to travel to Wuhan in February after reading an online post by a resident about life in the city during the outbreak. Once there, she began documenting what she saw on the streets and hospitals in livestreams and essays, despite threats by authorities, and her reports were widely shared on social media. The rights group Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders said,externalher reports also covered the detention of other independent journalists and the harassment of families of victims who were seeking accountability. ""Maybe I have a rebellious soul... I'm just documenting the truth. Why can't I show the truth?"" she said in a clip of the interview obtained by the BBC. ""I won't stop what I'm doing because this country can't go backwards."" This video can not be played From fear to freedom: China's painful year fighting Covid-19 Ms Zhang went missing on 14 May according to the CHRD. One day later, it was revealed she had been detained by police in Shanghai, more than 400 miles (640km) away. She was formally charged in early November. The indictment sheet alleges she sent ""false information through text, video and other media through [platforms like] WeChat, Twitter and YouTube"". She is also accused of accepting interviews with foreign media outlets and ""maliciously spreading"" information about the virus in Wuhan. A sentence of four to five years was recommended. In protest against her arrest, Ms Zhang has gone on a hunger strike and is said to be in very poor health. Zhang Keke, who is also a lawyer for Ms Zhang, said in a statement that when he visited her in early December she had told him she was being force-fed via a feeding tube. He also said she was suffering from headaches, dizziness and stomach pain. ""Restrained 24 hours a day, she needs assistance going to the bathroom, and she tosses and turns in her sleep,"" the lawyer said. ""She feels psychologically exhausted, like every day is a torment."" The lawyer had applied for a postponement of the trial given the state of Ms Zhang's health. Ms Zhang had previously been detained in 2019 for voicing support for activists in Hong Kong. Leo Lan, a research and advocacy consultant at the CHRD, said Ms Zhang's latest sentencing was ""alarming"". ""[Her] sentence is so heavy. The Chinese government is very determined to silence her and intimidate other citizens who tried to expose what happened in Wuhan,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm concerned about the fate of other detained citizens who also reported news about the pandemic."" Several other citizen journalists who reported from Wuhan - Li Zehua, Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin - went missing earlier this year. Li eventually resurfaced, saying he was forcibly quarantined, while Chen is reported to be staying with family but under government supervision. The whereabouts of Fang Bin are still unknown.

Gove 'confident' schools can reopen in EnglandBut the cabinet minister said the issue was under review after other UK nations delayed the return.Family & Education,"This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""Teachers have been working incredibly hard...in order to make sure that testing system is in place"" Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said he is ""confident"" the staggered return to secondary schools in England can go ahead as planned. But Mr Gove said the issue was still being reviewed, amid concern over the spread of the new coronavirus variant. Wales and Scotland have delayed or revised the start of the new term. Northern Ireland schools are due back next week. Ministers have said exam year pupils in England would return as normal. But the majority of secondary school pupils in England are due to begin the term studying remotely, to give head teachers time to implement a coronavirus testing programme for students and staff. Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he still expected Year 11 and Year 13 pupils to return in the first week of January, with the rest going back to the classroom later in the month. ""It is our intention to make sure we can get children back to school as early as possible,"" he said. Impact of new variant on children investigated Schools 'may need to close to control new variant' Will schools be closed next term by variant of virus? He said that prioritising children's attendance in school was ""the right thing to do"" but he acknowledged concerns about the new variant, which scientists believe may be more transmissible. ""We have a new strain and it is also the case that we have also had, albeit in a very limited way, Christmas mixing, so we do have to remain vigilant,"" Mr Gove said. ""We are confident that we will be able to get schools back in good order. Our plan and our timetable is there, and we are working with teachers to deliver it."" Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast the safe return to school would be built on an effective testing system, with teachers working ""incredibly hard"" to implement it. Teachers' union the NASUWT said schools have not been given enough time to prepare for mass testing - and that further guidance and support were needed for those in the highest tier areas. Dr Patrick Roach, the union's general secretary, told BBC News it was ""vitally important"" the government helps schools to arrange testing programmes ""to ensure an effective mass testing system is possible"". England:Secondary school pupils in exam years will return at the start of term while others begin their learning online. Face-to-face learning is expected to resume for everyone by 11 January. Primary schools will return as normal Scotland:Schools will start term on 11 January with learning taking place online until at least 18 January. Wales:Term will start with online learning, but the majority of pupils are expected to resume face-to-face lessons by 11 January. A full return to the classroom is expected to be complete by 18 January Northern Ireland:All schools will initially reopen for face-to-face teaching at the start of term, but years 8 to 10 will move to remote learning from 25 January for at least two weeks Schools in all the UK nations are remaining open for vulnerable children. England, Wales and Scotland have also committed to maintain face-to-face teaching for children of key workers. The union has written to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, calling for him to allow schools in the highest tier areas to teach online, except for vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers. Mark Tilling, head teacher of High Tunstall College of Science in Hartlepool, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One that he needed to train 21 staff to carry out the mass testing, which would take at least a week from the start of term. He said: ""The key issue for me is, is it safe to open if we can't do mass testing? If it isn't then the government need to make a decision that we can't open."" The National Education Union has also written to Mr Williamson and the prime minister, repeating its call for schools and colleges to teach classes online for at least the first two weeks of January. Although there is no suggestion the new variant poses more of a threat to children's health,scientists are investigating whether it spreads more easily in children. Preliminary research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggested thatschools and universities might need to close on top of existing tier 4 restrictionsto bring the new variant under control. Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the government did not have a clear strategy and was not acting quickly enough. ""Parents will be extremely concerned that all they're getting is rumour and innuendo. Teachers and school staff will need to know what is expected of them,"" she said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the Today programme the country faced ""very, very tough choices"" over schools. He said that while schools were an ""absolute priority"", there would be a ""trade-off"" that could mean other parts of society had to stay closed. The UK faced ""continued pressures"" from the spread of Covid-19 for at least the next two or three months, Sir Jeremy said.

"Atlantic discovery: 12 new species in the deepA dozen ocean species new to science could already be threatened by climate change, scientists find.Science & Environment","Epizoanthus martinsae lives on black corals at depths of almost 400m Almost five years of studying the deep Atlantic in unprecedented detail has revealed 12 species new to science. The sea mosses, molluscs and corals had eluded discovery because the sea floor is so unexplored, scientists say. Researchers warn that the newly discovered animals could already be under threat from climate change. Carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean is making it more acidic, causing coral skeletons in particular to corrode. Corals are the foundations of the cities of the deep, providing shelter and food for many species The scientists involved stressed it was ""not too late to protect these special species"" and the important habitats they occupied. New species: ""At least"" 12 new deep-sea species. The team also found approximately 35 new records of species in areas where they were previously unknown Climate change: Ocean warming, acidification, and decreasing food availability will combine to significantly shift and reduce the availability of suitable habitats for deep-sea species by 2100 Hydrothermal vents: Scientists discovered a field of these sea-floor hot springs in the Azores. Hydrothermal fields are important areas of relatively high biological productivity that host complex communities in the midst of the vast deep ocean As Prof George Wolff, an ocean chemist from the University of Liverpool who was involved in the project pointed out: ""We can still say we have better maps of the surface of the Moon and Mars than of the sea floor."" Antropora gemarita feeds on particles of food suspended in the water ""So whenever you go to the deep ocean, you find something new - not just individual species but entire ecosystems."" Prof Murray Roberts from the University of Edinburgh ledthe Atlas project,external, as it is called. He told BBC News that nearly five years of exploration and investigation had revealed some ""special places"" in the ocean and worked out ""how they tick"". Underwater robotics allowed exploration at depths that would crush human divers ""We found whole communities formed by sponges or deep ocean corals that form the cities of the deep sea,"" he explained. ""They support life. So really important fish use these places as spawning grounds. ""If those cities are damaged by destructive human uses, those fish have nowhere to spawn and the function of those whole ecosystems is lost for future generations. ""It's like understanding that the rainforest is an important place for biodiversity on the land; the same is true of the deep sea - there are important places that need to be protected and, crucially , they are all connected."" The project involved researchers from 13 countries around the Atlantic - combining ocean chemistry and physics, as well as biological discovery, to work out how the ocean environment is changing as the world warms and as humans exploit more of the deep sea for fishing and mineral extraction. Researchers carried out more than 40 Atlantic expeditions to explore the deep ocean in detail Studying ocean currents and depositions of fossils on the seabed revealed that the major currents in the North Atlantic have slowed dramatically in response to climate change. ""The implications of that are complicated, but potentially the connections between ecosystems are being reduced,"" Prof Roberts explained, because ocean currents are the highways that link different habitats together in the vastness of the deep ocean. A bryozoan named Microporella funbio was discovered in an undersea mud volcano off the Spanish coast ""The value of all this knowledge is that it enables us to understand what we might risk losing,"" said Prof Claire Armstrong, a natural resource economist from the University of TromsÃ¸. ""The deep ocean can be so out of sight and out of mind that we're not really aware of what we're doing to its environments and the consequences of what we do."" With a growing global population, increasing pollution and emerging areas of commercial activity in the deep sea, including prospecting for medically and industrially useful products, marine scientists say it is vital to fill the gaps in our ocean knowledge. The ocean is not an endless resource, Prof Armstrong added. ""Conserving and knowing what we might need in the future is really, really difficult.""

Your post-Christmas guide to staying positive this winter,"The last few months have been awful for so many people, with millions dealing with grief, stress, financial difficulties, job losses and isolation caused by the pandemic. Now, a new lockdown in England and similar restrictions across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are adding to the gloom of winter - a season that can be tough for many people even in normal times. But the country's leading mental health experts say there are things that many of us can do to give ourselves a lift. Here are some of their tips. Getting outdoors for exercise can be difficult in winter, but pretty much all experts agree that it's a great way to boost your mood. ""Our minds and bodies are completely inseparable"", says Dr Brendon Stubbs, of King's College London. Exercise triggers the release of endorphins into the bloodstream, relieving pain and producing a feeling of well-being. Research by Dr Stubbs has also shown that exercise also increases electrical activity in the emotional processing areas of the brain, particularly the hippocampus and the pre-frontal cortex. ""It's vital to keep active to improve your mental health and stimulate your brain including those areas"", he says. ""If you don't exercise, the activity drops."" That's one of the reasons why a lack of exercise increases your risk of anxiety and depression. Exercise can also boost the production of a protein, BDNF, or brain derived neurotrophic factor, which is crucial for brain health. ""You can think of it as a kind of brain fertiliser - it helps parts of your brain regenerate,"" says Dr Stubbs. Even short periods of exercise - just 10 minutes - can help. ""Anything that leaves you slightly out of breath, like a brisk walk, or something like gardening, or a cycle ride, will do."" How to exercise safely in the winter Adopting helpful habits to stop you over-thinking is one of the best things you can do, says psychologist Prof Jennifer Wild of Oxford University. She calls it ""getting out of your head."" People often dwell on problems, going over and over the same negative thoughts, and Prof Wild has some simple suggestions to stop that happening. ""If you've been worrying about a problem for 30 minutes or more without coming up with a plan of action, or you've been going over questions with no answers, it's time to stop"", she says. The main thing is to shift your focus from worries to practical problem-solving. So stop and ask yourself what steps you can take to address the problem. It's not easy, of course, to stop yourself dwelling on problems. Some recommend physical activity to help you shift mental gears. In any case, it takes some training. It's perfectly normal to worry, but many of our worries never materialise.One study,externalof patients with anxiety found only around one in 10 worries ever turn out to be real problems. One explanation is the way we have evolved. It has made us highly tuned to negativity and danger, as a defence against threats which led to death or serious injury. Danger is ""over-encoded in our brains"", says Prof Wild. ""You can make yourself feel much calmer if you recognise that you're over-thinking, stop and focus on facts."" How can I overcome my anxiety? ""Setting a new goal or target, can really help pull you through,"" says Cardiff neuroscientist, Dr Dean Burnett. That could be a big project like learning a language or something as small as trying out a new recipe. If big ideas are too much, start small. The point is that if it's outside your comfort zone, and it's pushing you forward, it gives you a focus and a sense of control. For many people that's hugely helpful for their mental state. ""Novelty is fundamentally rewarding,"" says Dr Burnett. ""Learning to do new things is frequently how we acquire self-worth"", he adds. ""Goal-motivated behaviour is one of the most fundamental ways that we operate."" Covid-19 has made it a lot harder to be with others in person, and winter can make it harder still. That's a big issue for millions of people and the mental health consequences for some will be serious. So it's a good idea to maximise the little social contact that is available. ""We're not really designed to be on our own,"" says Prof Emerita Elizabeth Kuipers, of King's College London. ""We're socially-oriented. We feel better with social contact."" Talking problems over when you can is a good idea, but the key thing is how it's done, she says. ""Going over problems again and again, just rehearsing how terrible you feel, may not help at all. Talking things through with someone who can help you reframe your problems, and help you move through them can be much more helpful."" Isolated people are more likely to focus on themselves, says Prof Kuipers, and that can make things worse. So reach out when you can, and if Covid-19 means you can't do that in person, make that phone call to a friend, or arrange to talk online. Optimists live longer, have better relationships and better immune systems, says Olivia Remes of Cambridge University. And the good news is you can cultivate optimism: an inner sense that you can make a difference to your life, and that it's not all down to things outside your control. How? Her number one tip is the principle of""do it badly,external"". In other words don't wait to do things perfectly at the right time on the right day. That's even more important in winter when gloomy weather might make you think twice about doing something. ""Our inner voice of criticism continually stops us from doing worthwhile things"", she says. ""Jump straight into action. Do things and accept that they might initially be done badly. When you do that, most of the time the results are actually not that bad - and they're almost always better than doing nothing."" Olivia's other tips include writing down three things each day that you're grateful about, to force yourself to focus on what's gone well and why.  It'll fire up the left hand side of your brain which is associated with positivity. ""Emotions are contagious"", she says, so ""if you can, gently steer away from negative, miserable people who are constantly complaining"", because you'll find yourself becoming one of those people too.

EU ambassadors approve post-Brexit trade dealThe landmark trade deal is on its way to becoming law provisionally on 1 January.Europe,"The ambassadors who meet in Brussels are jointly called Coreper Ambassadors from the 27 EU member states have unanimously approved the EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal, paving the way for it to take effect. The deal is likely to become law on 1 January, as the UK Parliament is expected to approve it on Wednesday. Under EU rules it can take effect provisionally, though the European Parliament will vote on it in January. The deal sets the framework for trade once the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union in four days' time. The deal, which ended nine months of negotiations, will be approved by all 27 EU governments in writing at 15:00 (14:00 GMT) on Tuesday, the German EU presidency said. They have had three days to analyse the details ofthe EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement,external, since its publication. But most of the 1,246-page document had already been seen by member states in previous weeks. The deal ends nearly 50 years of UK membership of the bloc, covering a vast array of policies besides those governing common trade rules. UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that he had spoken to European Council President Charles Michel about the deal,externaland its forthcoming ratification by EU governments. ""I welcomed the importance of the UK/EU Agreement as a new starting point for our relationship, between sovereign equals,"" he said. ""We looked forward to the formal ratification of the agreement and to working together on shared priorities, such as tackling climate change."" There was much relief that the tortuous negotiations - including last-minute haggling over fish quotas - finally ended on Christmas Eve. The no-deal scenario would have meant reverting to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules on 1 January, notably the immediate imposition of tariffs - import taxes - and quotas on a huge range of goods. The tariffs on some food items would have been 50% or higher. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work What happens next with Brexit? The new trade deal: enables the UK to continue selling goods to the EU market - the UK's biggest trade partner - without tariffs or quotas includes binding enforcement and dispute settlement mechanisms to address any unfair competition - what the EU calls ""level playing field"" rules ensures continued smooth transport links between the UK and EU, including safeguards on passenger rights means new paperwork and other barriers for UK businesses in Europe, including financial services, which employs more than a million people in the UK does little to address the needs of the UK service sector, accounting for about 80% of the UK economy transfers 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in British waters to the UK fleet, over a five-and-a-half year transition period reduces UK access to EU programmes in various fields, including policing and education.

Coronavirus: Daily updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning.UK,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday morning. Hospitals and ambulance services are coming under increased pressure as the new coronavirus variant fuels a rise in infections,health bosses have said. London Ambulance Service received as many emergency calls on Boxing Day as it did at the height of the first wave of Covid-19, theBBC has learned. The service and at least two others have urged people to call 999 only if there is a serious emergency. And NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, said hospitals in London and the south of England were under ""real pressure"" due to demand from Covid-19 and other conditions, as well as staff absence. Donald Trump hassigned into law a coronavirus relief and spending packageworth $900bn (Â£665bn), averting a partial government shutdown. The outgoing US president had initially refused to sign the bill, saying he wanted to give people bigger one-off payments. The delay meant that millions of Americans temporarily lost unemployment benefits. Congress approved the stimulus package last week, after months of negotiation. You canread hereabout how food banks across the country have been straining to meet rising demand during the pandemic, even in some of the country's wealthier regions. This video can not be played Trump asked Congress to amend the Covid aid bill earlier this week South Africa has become the first country on the African continent to registermore than one million Covid-19 cases. The grim milestone was reached just days after authorities confirmed that a new, faster-spreading, coronavirus variant had been detected. Some hospitals and medical centres have reported a huge rise in admissions, putting a heavy strain on resources. President Cyril Ramaphosa is widely expected to announce tougher restrictions to prevent the virus from spreading further. The variant - known as 501.V2 and separate to the one driving infections in the UK - is believed to be behind the surge in cases. Two cases linked to the South African variant were last weekdetected in the UK. South Africa is seeing a steady increase in cases driven by the new coronavirus variant Dr Bethan Gibson says she hasshed more tears during the pandemic than in her entire career. The senior intensive care doctor, from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, said Wales' lockdown - brought forward by eight days to start on 20 December - was ""vital"" amid rising critical care numbers. She said the pandemic had been ""relentless"" on staff, with many taking time off with burnout or stress. But she hopes vaccination will bring some kind of normality by Easter. Dr Bethan Gibson said the pandemic had been ""relentless"" on critical care staff With Christmas over and the long, dark months upon us, winter can be tough for many of us in normal times - let alone during a pandemic.

"Hospitals under pressure as Covid cases riseRising demand is down to the ""rapid spread"" of the new variant of Covid-19, health bosses say.UK","London Ambulance Service received as many emergency calls on 26 December as it did at the height of the first wave of Covid-19 England's ""very high"" Covid infection level is a ""growing concern"" as the NHS struggles to cope with rising patient numbers, a health official has said. On Monday, a record 41,385 Covid cases and 357 deathswere reported in the UK,external. NHS England said the number of people being treated for the virus in hospital is now 20,426, which is higher than the previous peak of about 19,000 in April. Health officials in Wales and Scotland have also said they are at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Monday's figure for new cases is the highest daily number reported by the UK government, and the first time the daily total has surpassed 40,000. It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in April, but testing capacity was too limited to detect the true number. Some data over the Christmas period is incomplete, as a result of certain services being paused. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said Monday's figure included some infections where reporting was delayed, but that officials did not deny there had been a significant increase in infections. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""This very high level of infection is of growing concern at a time when our hospitals are at their most vulnerable, with new admissions rising in many regions."" ""Despite unprecedented levels of infection, there is hope on the horizon,"" she added. Dr Doyle urged members of the public to ""continue to play our part in stopping the spread of the virus"" as the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is rolled out. Hospitals in Wales, Scotland and the south of England have reported rising pressure on their services as the number of Covid patients increases. Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, south-east London, said on Monday that an ""internal incident"" over its ""high number of Covid-positive patients"" had been ongoing since Sunday. ""All our patients have received the treatment they need, including intensive care treatment for Covid-19 and oxygen therapy as required. ""We are continuing to monitor the situation to ensure that this remains the case,"" a spokesperson for Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust said. Two stats stand out today and underline the extent of the pressure on the NHS. One is the more than 20,000 Covid patients in English hospitals, more than the peak in the first wave in April. In many ways it is even tougher for hospitals now, as they are trying to clear the backlog on non-urgent operations and procedures cancelled in the first wave - as well as cope with the surge in Covid numbers. It is worth pointing out though that one reason for the high level of patients is that some are there thanks to drugs and therapies discovered in the past year who might not have survived in the first wave. The other key statistic is the 41,385 new daily reported cases - by far the highest number since the testing system was fully established in the summer. Some sadly will become seriously ill after a week or so which points to even greater strain on hospitals in the new year. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said she saw ""wall to wall Covid"" when she worked at one London hospital on Christmas Day. Dr Katherine Henderson told the BBC there was a ""great deal of difficulty"" getting patients into wards. She added: ""The chances are that we will cope, but we cope at a cost - the cost is not doing what we had hoped, which is being able to keep non-Covid activities going."" Covid hospital pressures in Wales 'incredibly challenging' NHS faces being 'overwhelmed' warn health leaders Danny Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, told BBC News disruption to non-urgent care in both hospitals and other health services was ""inevitable"" as infections rise. About half of the health boards in Wales have already cancelled non-urgent care, according to the director of the Welsh NHS Confederation. Darren Hughes told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the situation in Welsh hospitals was ""incredibly serious, and worsening"", with some intensive care units already at capacity. Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar said large numbers of patients, and staff sickness, have createdan ""incredibly challenging"" situation. And doctors have warnedScotland's health system is ""severely stretched"". Infection rates in England are currently highest in areas of Essex, London and other parts of the South East. Parts of Essex haverecorded the highest weekly coronavirus case ratessince the pandemic began. In the week leading up to 21 December, Brentwood, Epping Forest and Thurrock all had rates of more than 1,350 cases per 100,000 people. Tracey Fletcher, the chief executive of Homerton hospital in east London, said her staff were ""extremely busy"" andurged people to comply,externalwith the tier four restrictions in force. As of 24 December, London, the South East, and the East of England had the greatest proportion of new variant cases Patricia Marquis, regional director of the Royal College of Nursing in south-east England, said the number of beds and staff available at hospitals in her area was ""really close to the edge"". ""We are getting to the point where it does feel like there is a possibility that hospitals will become overrun,"" she told Radio 4's PM programme. Ms Marquis said the strain on staffing meant nurses were looking after ""far more patients"" than usual and ""it does feel unsafe at times for them"". The South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) said it has warned the military and fire service that paramedics may soon need their support. SCAS, which serves Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire, said it had seen a threefold increase in 111 calls over the Christmas period, along with a 60-70% increase in staff absences as a result of showing Covid symptoms or having to self-isolate. This chart, using data up to 23 December, shows how hospital admissions had been rising in London Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government's tiered system for coronavirus rules in England was the ""right strategy"" to tackle coronavirus, but accepted the NHS was under pressure and there were ""difficult months ahead"". Some 24 million people in the south-east and east of England - about 43% of the population - are now living under the strictest tier four rules and a review on 30 December could see more areas placed under the restrictions. Mainland Scotland entered level four restrictions from Saturday for three weeks, and similar rules are in place in Wales. Northern Ireland has also entered a new six-week lockdown. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? London 999 calls as high as Covid first wave peak The BBC has been told the London Ambulance Service (LAS) received7,918 emergency calls on 26 December- as many as at the height of the first wave of Covid-19. An LAS memo said the rising demand was down to the ""rapid spread of the new variant of the Covid-19 virus"". Figures seen by the BBC show at one London hospital on Sunday morning, ambulance crews were typically waiting nearly six hours to hand over patients to staff.

South Africa passes one million Covid casesThe rise in cases comes after a new variant of coronavirus is identified in the country.Africa,"South Africa is seeing a steady increase in cases driven by the new coronavirus variant South Africa has become the first country on the continent to register more than one million Covid-19 cases. It comes just days after authorities confirmed that a new, faster-spreading, coronavirus variant had been detected. Some hospitals and medical centres have reported a huge rise in admissions, putting a heavy strain on resources. President Cyril Ramaphosa is widely expected to announce tougher restrictions to prevent the virus from spreading further. The latest milestone was announced on Sunday by South Africa's Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize. The country has now confirmed 1,004,413 Covid-19 infections and 26,735 deaths since the outbreak began in March. Last week, South Africa recorded a daily average of 11,700 new infections - a rise of 39% on the previous week - and from Wednesday to Friday, the daily number of new cases was above 14,000. A new coronavirus variant - known as 501.V2 - is believed to be driving the surge in infections. It was identified by a network of South African scientists in the Eastern Cape province and then rapidly spread to other parts of the country. Coronavirus variants: The science explained UK has two cases of variant linked to South Africa Fresh air: The forgotten coronavirus weapon Earlier this week,the UK banned travel from South Africabecause of the new variant.Another new Covid variant has already been detected in the UK, although they have evolved separately. Both have a mutation - called N501Y - which is in a crucial part of the virus that it uses to infect the body's cells, but appear unrelated to each other. Hospitals and clinics in South Africa are under strain as the numbers of new cases rise After South Africa, the worst hit country on the African continent is Morocco, which has seen 432,079 cases and 7,240 deaths. They are followed by Egypt with 131,315 cases and 7,352 deaths and Tunisia with 130,230 infections and 4,426 deaths. In other Covid developments around the world: The ambulance service in the UK capital, London, received as many emergency calls on Saturday as it did at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, the BBC has learned.

Your post-Christmas guide to staying positive this winterTips on how to stay positive through winter - in the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.,"The last few months have been awful for so many people, with millions dealing with grief, stress, financial difficulties, job losses and isolation caused by the pandemic. Now, a new lockdown in England and similar restrictions across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are adding to the gloom of winter - a season that can be tough for many people even in normal times. But the country's leading mental health experts say there are things that many of us can do to give ourselves a lift. Here are some of their tips. Getting outdoors for exercise can be difficult in winter, but pretty much all experts agree that it's a great way to boost your mood. ""Our minds and bodies are completely inseparable"", says Dr Brendon Stubbs, of King's College London. Exercise triggers the release of endorphins into the bloodstream, relieving pain and producing a feeling of well-being. Research by Dr Stubbs has also shown that exercise also increases electrical activity in the emotional processing areas of the brain, particularly the hippocampus and the pre-frontal cortex. ""It's vital to keep active to improve your mental health and stimulate your brain including those areas"", he says. ""If you don't exercise, the activity drops."" That's one of the reasons why a lack of exercise increases your risk of anxiety and depression. Exercise can also boost the production of a protein, BDNF, or brain derived neurotrophic factor, which is crucial for brain health. ""You can think of it as a kind of brain fertiliser - it helps parts of your brain regenerate,"" says Dr Stubbs. Even short periods of exercise - just 10 minutes - can help. ""Anything that leaves you slightly out of breath, like a brisk walk, or something like gardening, or a cycle ride, will do."" How to exercise safely in the winter Adopting helpful habits to stop you over-thinking is one of the best things you can do, says psychologist Prof Jennifer Wild of Oxford University. She calls it ""getting out of your head."" People often dwell on problems, going over and over the same negative thoughts, and Prof Wild has some simple suggestions to stop that happening. ""If you've been worrying about a problem for 30 minutes or more without coming up with a plan of action, or you've been going over questions with no answers, it's time to stop"", she says. The main thing is to shift your focus from worries to practical problem-solving. So stop and ask yourself what steps you can take to address the problem. It's not easy, of course, to stop yourself dwelling on problems. Some recommend physical activity to help you shift mental gears. In any case, it takes some training. It's perfectly normal to worry, but many of our worries never materialise.One study,externalof patients with anxiety found only around one in 10 worries ever turn out to be real problems. One explanation is the way we have evolved. It has made us highly tuned to negativity and danger, as a defence against threats which led to death or serious injury. Danger is ""over-encoded in our brains"", says Prof Wild. ""You can make yourself feel much calmer if you recognise that you're over-thinking, stop and focus on facts."" How can I overcome my anxiety? ""Setting a new goal or target, can really help pull you through,"" says Cardiff neuroscientist, Dr Dean Burnett. That could be a big project like learning a language or something as small as trying out a new recipe. If big ideas are too much, start small. The point is that if it's outside your comfort zone, and it's pushing you forward, it gives you a focus and a sense of control. For many people that's hugely helpful for their mental state. ""Novelty is fundamentally rewarding,"" says Dr Burnett. ""Learning to do new things is frequently how we acquire self-worth"", he adds. ""Goal-motivated behaviour is one of the most fundamental ways that we operate."" Covid-19 has made it a lot harder to be with others in person, and winter can make it harder still. That's a big issue for millions of people and the mental health consequences for some will be serious. So it's a good idea to maximise the little social contact that is available. ""We're not really designed to be on our own,"" says Prof Emerita Elizabeth Kuipers, of King's College London. ""We're socially-oriented. We feel better with social contact."" Talking problems over when you can is a good idea, but the key thing is how it's done, she says. ""Going over problems again and again, just rehearsing how terrible you feel, may not help at all. Talking things through with someone who can help you reframe your problems, and help you move through them can be much more helpful."" Isolated people are more likely to focus on themselves, says Prof Kuipers, and that can make things worse. So reach out when you can, and if Covid-19 means you can't do that in person, make that phone call to a friend, or arrange to talk online. Optimists live longer, have better relationships and better immune systems, says Olivia Remes of Cambridge University. And the good news is you can cultivate optimism: an inner sense that you can make a difference to your life, and that it's not all down to things outside your control. How? Her number one tip is the principle of""do it badly,external"". In other words don't wait to do things perfectly at the right time on the right day. That's even more important in winter when gloomy weather might make you think twice about doing something. ""Our inner voice of criticism continually stops us from doing worthwhile things"", she says. ""Jump straight into action. Do things and accept that they might initially be done badly. When you do that, most of the time the results are actually not that bad - and they're almost always better than doing nothing."" Olivia's other tips include writing down three things each day that you're grateful about, to force yourself to focus on what's gone well and why.  It'll fire up the left hand side of your brain which is associated with positivity. ""Emotions are contagious"", she says, so ""if you can, gently steer away from negative, miserable people who are constantly complaining"", because you'll find yourself becoming one of those people too.

"Doctor 'has shed more tears than ever' over CovidBut intensive care consultant Bethan Gibson says the vaccine is a ""light"" at the end of the tunnel.Wales","This video can not be played Dr Bethan Gibson is hoping for some kind of normality by Easter A senior intensive care doctor says she has shed more tears during the pandemic than in her entire career as staff struggle to cope with demand. Dr Bethan Gibson, from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, said the Christmas lockdown was ""vital"" amid rising critical care numbers. She said the pandemic had been ""relentless"" on staff, with many taking time off with burnout or stress. But she hopes vaccination is a signal for some kind of ""normality"" by Easter. The hospital, in Llantrisant, is one of the general hospitals in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board,which has recorded the most coronavirus-related deaths(949) in Wales. Dr Gibson said the scale of the problem has taken a toll on staff. ""I don't think anyone can really appreciate what it's like to be an ITU nurse in particular at this current time,"" she said. ""They've got the pressures of more work because there's more patients.

Urgent plea for critical care help at hospital New coronavirus variant: What do we know? NHS staff sickness having 'huge impact' on care Shortages of staff is more problematic than a shortage of beds, with many staff forced to take time off for shielding, isolation, burnout or post-traumatic stress. ""There's no point having a bed and a ventilator without a nurse and some medical professionals to help with looking after that patient, and that's what we're really struggling with, our staffing,"" she said. Dr Gibson added Covid-19 has changed the way intensive care staff have interacted with patients, who are generally conscious on the ward despite being very sick. Medical staff are seeing the ""fear in the eyes"" of patients who are conscious, but being told they may not survive the illness. ""That's one bit I've personally struggled with,"" she said. ""Usually if they're really sick and need intensive care, they're barely conscious. ""With Covid... their numbers are really, really sick, they're hypoxic, you're scared they're going to arrest and yet they're fully awake, they're not really in distress, they're able to talk to you.

First Aboriginal cricketer inducted to Hall of FameJohnny Mullagh was one of the stars of the first Australian cricket tour of England in 1868.,"Johnny Mullagh, standing second from right with a pocket handkerchief, was the standout performer of the first Australian cricket team One of the stars of the first Australian cricket tour of England has become the first Aboriginal inducted to the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. Johnny Mullagh was part of the 1868 Aboriginal team that became the country's first sporting team to tour internationally. The Hall of Fame chairman said Mullagh contributed to Australia's identity. It was an ""oversight"" not to have recognised the importance of the 1868 team before now, Peter King added. The selection panel agreed to change the criteria to allow Mullagh to be inducted, as he had not played Test cricket. It said it wanted to acknowledge the impact of indigenous players. ""Johnny Mullagh and the 1868 Aboriginal team paved the way for so many future Australians to showcase their skill and talent on the world stage,"" Mr King said. ""To consider the team's feats were in an era dictated by inequality, makes their story even more remarkable and worthy of recognition."" The unheralded story of Australia's indigenous cricketers Born in about 1841, Johnny Mullagh - also known by the traditional name Unaarrimin - was a Jardwadjali man from what is now the state of Victoria. He learned to play cricket working on a nearby farm. He was among 13 Aboriginal men picked to form a team who were brought to London in 1868 by a former first-class cricketer, Charles Lawrence, an expat who had been living in Sydney. Mullagh is credited with being a skilful all-rounder. He played in 45 of the 47 matches on the 1868 England tour, scoring 1,698 runs at an average of 23.65 and taking 245 wickets at 10. He also played in the third cricket match ever staged at Australia's most famous ground, the MCG. The best player duringthis week's Boxing Day Test between Australia and India in Melbournewill receive the newly created Mullagh Medal in his honour. Johnny Mullagh, pictured holding a cricket ball, defied colonial orders to live on state-controlled reserves Aboriginal Australians, who had inhabited the continent for tens of thousands of years prior to British colonisation, were subjected to severe discrimination in the 19th Century and afterwards. Mullagh was a passionate advocate of indigenous rights, refusing to live on state-controlled reserves. He continued to play cricket, despite colonial restrictions on the movement of Aboriginal people, and continued to do so up until the months before his death in 1891. Australian cricket has belatedly made efforts to recognise indigenous players, but only fast bowler Jason Gillespie has represented the country in tests in the men's game. There will be a further two inductees to the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame announced in February 2021.

Brexit traffic measures introduced at portContraflow is put in place on the A55 at Holyhead as the UK and EU prepare for new trading rules.Wales,"Holyhead's port sees an estimated five million tonnes of freight every year Traffic measures have been introduced on a major road leading to Holyhead port as the UK prepares to enter its new trading relationship with the EU. The Welsh Government has said the plans are aimed at ""minimising any possible disruption to the port, town and wider community"". Freight turned away from the port due to incorrect documentation will be sent on to the westbound A55. The UK Government has predicted this could be 40-70% of freight. Quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal What just happened with Brexit? Holyhead is the second busiest roll-on/roll-off port in the UK, behind only Dover. Around 600 lorries and trailers leave the port on ferries bound for Dublin every day. A trade deal between the EU and UKhas now been agreedand will take effect from 1 January, but the changes in the trading relationship between the two parties mean there could besome disruption. The Welsh Government added it expected the peak of traffic issues to be in mid-January. The eastbound carriageway between junction two and four of the A55 will run with contraflow. The Welsh Government said,external: ""All HGVs turned away from the port will be redirected back to the contraflow to turn off at Junction 4 and join the westbound carriageway which is reserved for redirected HGVs."" Lorries will be stacked if there is no other site available. It said work is already under way to prepare Plot 9 of Parc Cybi in Holyhead and the site due to be ready to accept HGVs by mid-January. When asked if stacked lorry drivers would have access to toilets and food and drink, the Welsh Government said ""appropriate welfare facilities"" would be provided. Economy Minister Ken Skates said: ""We need to implement these contingency plans in order to do what we can to minimise any possible disruption for the port, community of Holyhead and wider area. ""We have never faced this kind of situation before and we have a duty to prepare for the worst possible scenario."" The EU is implementing border controls from 1 January TheKent port has seen gridlock over recent weeksas Britain approached the end of its transition period with the EU and France banned all Channel crossings over the new coronavirus variant in the south-east of England. Chair of the CBI in North Wales Kinza Sutton told BBC Radio Wales: ""We anticipate that there will be delays. ""Certainly the changes to documentation is going to cause huge changes for everybody, so certainly during January I'd imagine there will be delays as everyone gets used to the new systems."" Aplan to buy a truck stop as part of post-Brexit inbound customs checks was scrapped on Christmas Eve. Border customs checks on inbound lorries and trailers will be implemented from July. On Monday, a Welsh Government spokeswoman said along with the UK government it had determined other potential sites on Parc Cybi would be a more suitable alternative. ""This would also offer the opportunity for the truck stop to remain open, protecting jobs and providing a service for its customers, should it wish to do so,"" she said, adding further details would be provided in due course. Anglesey Councillor and Executive member for Highways Robert G Parry said Parc Cybi was the ""ideal place"" for lorries. The Plaid councillor for the Canolbarth MÃ´n Ward said: ""It means that they don't get off the A55 at allâ¦ and there's plenty of room there."" But he said the Welsh Government needed to ""speed things up"". ""They've left it until the last minute,"" he said. ""Of course there is the difference now that the deal has been made but they've been too slow in moving forward to provide these facilities. ""Only time will tell. What happens during the next two days will show us what will happen."" Local traffic will be diverted on to the A5 through the village of Caergeiliog, which was the original route to the port before the A55 was extended in 2001. Councillor Gwilym O Jones said he had been ""assured"" measures including a lower speed limit and enforcement would be in place. ""I'm very pleased that people are listening to what I've been asking for,"" he added.

Britons warned to prepare for Brexit 'disruption',"There will be ""bumpy moments"" for UK businesses and travellers as they get to grips with new EU rules, says government minister Michael Gove. He said there would be ""practical and procedural changes"" when the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. Mr Gove also urged people going to the EU to make extra checks, including mobile phone roaming charges. EU ambassadors have approved the post-Brexit trade deal,paving the way for it to take effect on 1 January. Under EU rules it can take effect provisionally, though the European Parliament will vote on it in January. In the UK, MPs will vote on the deal on Wednesday. Meanwhile, UK International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said she expects to sign a continuity trade agreement with Turkey this week - a move that was not possible until the deal with the EU was struck. Quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal How Brexit will change your holidays in 2021 What will happen to mobile roaming charges? Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ""I'm sure there will be bumpy moments but we are there in order to try to do everything we can to smooth the path."" He warned businesses that time was ""very short"" to make the final preparations before the transition period ends. ""The nature of our new relationship with the EU - outside the Single Market and Customs Union - means that there are practical and procedural changes that businesses and citizens need to get ready for,"" he said. ""We know that there will be some disruption as we adjust to new ways of doing business with the EU, so it is vital that we all take the necessary action now."" Businesses have been urged to make sure they understand the new rules on importing and exporting goods, including the different rules that apply to trade with Northern Ireland, and to consider how they will make customs declarations on EU trade. Mr Gove also encouraged travellers to EU destinations from 1 January to take out comprehensive travel insurance, check their mobile phone provider's roaming charges and make sure they have at least six months left on their passports. Measures are being put in place around the UK as it prepares to enter its new trading relationship with the EU. The Scottish government has signed a leaseto use a former military airfield in Dumfries and Galloway as an emergency lorry parkfor up to 240 vehicles if there is disruption at Cairnryan port near Stranraer. In Wales,traffic measures have been introduced on a major road leading to Holyhead port. Meanwhile,travellers from Great Britain will need to declare cash of â¬10,000 (Â£9,049) or more when entering Northern Irelandfrom 1 January. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work What happens next with Brexit? The trade deal was reached after months of fraught talks on issues including fishing rights and business rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would provide new legislative and regulatory freedoms to""deliver for people who felt left behind"". But fishermen's leaders have accused him of ""caving in"" and sacrificing their interests. Labour called it a ""thin deal"" that needed ""more work"" to protect UK jobs. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the ""bumpy moments"" Mr Gove warned about were of the government's own making because it waited to strike the deal ""so close to the wire"". She said the government had refused to engage with business on preparations, while dodging questions for months about the recruitment of customs agents and the development of IT systems. ""The government is treating its own incompetence as inevitable,"" she said. The SNP said it was ""the understatement of the century"" that the UK would face disruption, adding that millions of businesses would now face ""a mountain of extra costs, red tape, bureaucracy and barriers to trade in just four days' time"". Conservative grandee Lord Heseltine has urged MPs and peers to abstain when voting on the deal, warning it will inflict ""lasting damage"" on the UK. The former deputy prime minister said he would ""in no way share the endorsement of the legislation"", but that he would not vote against it because the consequences of a no-deal would be even graver. Political parties in Northern Ireland that take their seats in Westminster - the DUP, the Alliance and the SDLP - areset to vote against the deal. The DUP, which supports Brexit, said its eight MPs would oppose the deal because it did not address ""damaging"" issues caused by introducing customs checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. This video can not be played Brexit deal: How did we get here? Over the weekend, Chancellor Rishi Sunak sought to reassure the City of London that it will not be damaged by the deal. He said they would be ""doing a few things a bit differently"" and looking at ""how we make the City of London the most attractive place to list new companies anywhere in the world"". The chancellor said the deal was ""an enormously unifying moment for our country"" and it brought reassurance to those who were concerned about the impact on businesses.

London 999 calls near April peak,"Patient demand in London is ""now arguably greater"" than in the first wave of the pandemic, according to the service London Ambulance Service (LAS) received as many emergency calls on 26 December as it did at the height of the first wave of Covid-19, the BBC has learned. Nearly 8,000 calls were received, a 40% increase on a typical ""busy"" day. Patient demand was ""now arguably greater"" than during the first wave, an internal message to all staff said. LAS said it was ""working urgently"" to reduce delays. It urged people only to dial 999 with genuine life-threatening emergencies and to use 111 if possible. The rapid spread of the new variant of Covid-19 was said to be the cause of the increased demand, according to the message. The UK reported another30,501 positive tests on Sunday, and 316 deaths of people who had tested positive within the past 28 days. Meanwhile South Central Ambulance Service - which serves Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire - said it was ""extremely busy"" and asked peopleonly to dial 999 in a ""life-threatening or serious emergency"",external. One London paramedic told the BBC that some patients were being treated in ambulance bays upon arrival at hospital, due to a lack of beds inside. ""It's been a horrendous time,"" the paramedic said. ""Ambulance staff are finding the whole situation very stressful."" Figures seen by the BBC show that at one London hospital on Sunday morning, ambulance crews were typically waiting nearly six hours to hand over patients to hospital staff. Levels of patient demand were equal ""and now arguably greater"" than those seen during the first wave of the pandemic, according to the all-staff message sent by LAS chief executive Garrett Emmerson. On 26 December, LAS received 7,918 calls, while on 16 March - one of its busiest ever days - it received marginally more. ""The demand is occurring because of the rapid spread of the new variant of the Covid-19 virus, initially in north-east London, but now spreading into north central London and predicted to spread further across the rest of the capital in the coming days and weeks"", the memo read. As of 24 December, London, the South East, and the East of England had the greatest proportion of new variant cases The NHS 111 service was twice as busy as usual in London, the message added. London Ambulance Service said it was working to find ways of alleviating pressures. It said private ambulance services, student paramedics, volunteers and the London Fire Brigade had been recruited to supplement its crews in order to provide as many ambulances as possible with two staff members. LAS was also receiving assistance from South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS), East of England Ambulance Service and St John Ambulance. Non-patient facing colleagues with clinical skills have also been moved to work frontline shifts. A separate message sent to ambulance crews on 26 December requested them, when it was safe to do so, to transport all patients to hospital on blue flashing lights in order to ""reduce travel times"". Usually only the most seriously unwell patients are taken to hospital in this way. In a statement, LAS said: ""Like NHS organisations across the country, demand for our services has risen sharply over the past weeks. ""Our colleagues in emergency departments are also under pressure receiving our patients as quickly as they can. We are working urgently with NHS partners to reduce any delays. ""The public can support us by only calling 999 for life-threatening emergencies. For urgent medical advice go to: 111.nhs.uk."" Thecapital has the highest coronavirus infection rate of any UK region,with 794.6 cases per 100,000 people over the last seven days. On Sunday, it reported another 9,719 infections.

Chinese games billionaire dies 'after poisoning',"A Chinese tycoon who died on Christmas Day was poisoned, Shanghai police say. Lin Qi, 39, was the chairman and chief executive of games developer Yoozoo, best known for the Game of Thrones: Winter Is Coming strategy game. The Shanghai police statement pointed to one of Mr Lin's colleagues - identified only by his surname Xu - as the main suspect. Mr Lin was believed to have a net worth of around 6.8bn yuan (Â£960m), according to the Hurun China Rich List. Many employees and ex-employees gathered outside Yoozoo's office on Friday to mourn his death. The businessman was a star of China's lucrative gaming market and had also made a foray into film production. He founded Yoozoo in 2009 and successfully led the company through a period where the gaming industry saw substantial changes towards mobile gaming. GoT makers adapt Chinese sci-fi saga for Netflix China imposes video game curfew for minors How online gaming has become a social lifeline - BBC Worklife The company also issued an emotional statement on its official Weibo microblog. ""Goodbye youth,"" it said, adding, ""We will be together, continue to be kind, continue to believe in goodness, and continue the fight against all that is bad."" The post attracted thousands of comments while the topic has been viewed more than 290 million times on Weibo. Many of the tributes featured calligraphy as Mr Lin was an avid calligrapher along with being a poetry enthusiast. Details are scant but Mr Lin is believed to have been poisoned, based on police statements. Yoozoo released its own statement, saying Mr Lin had admitted himself to hospital after feeling unwell but was in a stable condition. Things took a dramatic turn on Friday when the company announced its founder had died. According to local media reports, the person in custody could be Xu Yao, who heads Yoozoo's movie production arm. There was also some speculation among local media that Mr Lin had been poisoned via aged pu'er tea, a fermented Chinese drink. Apart from its Game of Thrones game, Yoozoo is also the co-publisher of Supercell's smash-hit game Brawl Stars along with China's Tencent Holdings. The company is also known for its connection with the Chinese sci-fi novel Three-Body Problem as it holds the rights for its film adaptation. But its expansion into the motion picture business wasn't as successful as the company had hoped and the project to adapt the book into six films by Yoozoo Pictures never took off. In September, it granted US streaming platform Netflix the right to adapt the sci-fi novel for television. The book is the first instalment of the trilogy Remembrance of Earth's Past by writer Liu Cixin and has received critical acclaim, counting both former US President Barack Obama and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg among its fans.

West Brom earn point at LiverpoolSemi Ajayi scores a dramatic late equaliser against leaders Liverpool to earn struggling West Brom their first point since Sam Allardyce took charge.,"This video can not be played Analysis: How West Brom stopped champions Liverpool Semi Ajayi scored a dramatic late equaliser against leaders Liverpool to earn struggling West Brom their first point since Sam Allardyce took charge. Jurgen Klopp's side looked to be going five points clear at the top of the table when Sadio Mane chested down Joel Matip's long ball forward and fired past Sam Johnstone. Liverpool dominated for long periods without adding to their lead but the Baggies improved after the break and equalised in the 83rd minute. Ajayi leapt high above the home defence to send a header in off the post to spark jubilant celebrations from the away team at Anfield. West Brom keeper Johnstone made a superb save to deny Roberto Firmino a winner near the end. Reaction from Anfield and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action Klopp denies Salah is unhappy claims How big is the task facing West Brom boss Allardyce? There was a deep sense of frustration at full-time from Liverpool's players after they dropped league points at Anfield for the first time this season. Klopp, who was booked during the second-half by referee Kevin Friend for protesting a decision, walked to the Kop to acknowledge the 2,000 fans allowed into the ground as the home team headed for the dressing room knowing they had let two points slip. It has been a monumental 2020 with the Reds ending a 30-year wait for a league title, but this was not the result they wanted in their final home game of 2020.West Brom earn point at Liverpool Klopp's side dominated the first half, enjoying 84% possession, but were unable to add to a sumptuous finish by Senegal forward Mane. This video can not be played West Brom deserved the point - Jurgen Klopp Their dominance was highlighted by captain Jordan Henderson, who completed 39 more passes (85) than West Brom as a team (46) before half-time. But the visitors were livelier after the break and, after Liverpool lost defender Joel Matip to injury, the hosts allowed West Brom a way back. Alisson did well to keep out Karlan Grant after the forward had got the better of Rhys Williams before Ajayi's equaliser. Johnstone's save to keep out Firmino at the end only added to Liverpool's frustration, their lead at the top now three points. It looked like it was going to be a long afternoon for West Brom when Mane struck early but the Baggies dug deep to return to the Black Country with a crucial point. This result will give Allardyce, the last opposition manager to win a Premier League game at Anfield, with Crystal Palace in April 2017, huge encouragement as he looks to keep his new team in the Premier League. A week after being beaten 3-0 at home by Aston Villa in his first game in charge, West Brom refused to go under against the leaders and showed the spirit and character needed in a relegation battle. Having drawn 1-1 at Manchester City in Slaven Bilic's final game in charge, the Baggies have now taken points off last season's top two clubs. Allardyce, whose side are still five points from safety, will need help when the transfer market opens next month. But this result against a Liverpool side which had won the previous eight home league games will lift morale ahead of Tuesday's home game with Leeds. This video can not be played 'That wasn't just luck' - Allardyce praises 'superb' West Brom Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:""It does feel like a defeat, but we have a point more than before so it is completely fine. ""It's our fault but they deserved the point. In the first half it looked like 90:10 possession - it's a massive challenge to stay on track and do it again but we should have done it."" West Brom boss Sam Allardyce:""We've got a point against Liverpool, which no-one outside of us in the dressing room thought we'd get. ""When the first goal went in I think a lot of people thought how many was it going to be today, particularly after they knocked seven past Palace (last weekend). ""The players were so good today in their discipline, defending as a team, and finding a way in the second half to attack Liverpool when they got the opportunity."" Liverpool have failed to win six of their 15 Premier League games this season, as many as they did in the entire 2019-20 season. Having picked up just one point from their opening six away league games this season, West Brom have since earned two from their last two on the road away to Manchester City and Liverpool. This was the first time Liverpool failed to win a Premier League home game against a side starting the day in the relegation zone - despite taking the lead - since a 2-2 draw with Slaven Bilic's West Ham in December 2016. Among defenders since the start of the 2018-19 season, only Virgil van Dijk and Aaron Pierre (both nine) have scored more headed league goals in England's top four tiers than West Brom's Semi Ajayi (eight). Sadio Mane scored his 69th Premier League goal for Liverpool, moving him level with Luis SuÃ¡rez and behind only Robbie Fowler (128), Steven Gerrard (120), Michael Owen (118) and Mohamed Salah (86) for most goals in the competition for the Reds.

"Britons warned to prepare for Brexit 'disruption'Ministers warn of ""practical and procedural changes"" when the Brexit transition period ends this week.UK","There will be ""bumpy moments"" for UK businesses and travellers as they get to grips with new EU rules, says government minister Michael Gove. He said there would be ""practical and procedural changes"" when the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. Mr Gove also urged people going to the EU to make extra checks, including mobile phone roaming charges. EU ambassadors have approved the post-Brexit trade deal,paving the way for it to take effect on 1 January. Under EU rules it can take effect provisionally, though the European Parliament will vote on it in January. In the UK, MPs will vote on the deal on Wednesday. Meanwhile, UK International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said she expects to sign a continuity trade agreement with Turkey this week - a move that was not possible until the deal with the EU was struck. Quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal How Brexit will change your holidays in 2021 What will happen to mobile roaming charges? Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ""I'm sure there will be bumpy moments but we are there in order to try to do everything we can to smooth the path."" He warned businesses that time was ""very short"" to make the final preparations before the transition period ends. ""The nature of our new relationship with the EU - outside the Single Market and Customs Union - means that there are practical and procedural changes that businesses and citizens need to get ready for,"" he said. ""We know that there will be some disruption as we adjust to new ways of doing business with the EU, so it is vital that we all take the necessary action now."" Businesses have been urged to make sure they understand the new rules on importing and exporting goods, including the different rules that apply to trade with Northern Ireland, and to consider how they will make customs declarations on EU trade. Mr Gove also encouraged travellers to EU destinations from 1 January to take out comprehensive travel insurance, check their mobile phone provider's roaming charges and make sure they have at least six months left on their passports. Measures are being put in place around the UK as it prepares to enter its new trading relationship with the EU. The Scottish government has signed a leaseto use a former military airfield in Dumfries and Galloway as an emergency lorry parkfor up to 240 vehicles if there is disruption at Cairnryan port near Stranraer. In Wales,traffic measures have been introduced on a major road leading to Holyhead port. Meanwhile,travellers from Great Britain will need to declare cash of â¬10,000 (Â£9,049) or more when entering Northern Irelandfrom 1 January. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work What happens next with Brexit? The trade deal was reached after months of fraught talks on issues including fishing rights and business rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would provide new legislative and regulatory freedoms to""deliver for people who felt left behind"". But fishermen's leaders have accused him of ""caving in"" and sacrificing their interests. Labour called it a ""thin deal"" that needed ""more work"" to protect UK jobs. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the ""bumpy moments"" Mr Gove warned about were of the government's own making because it waited to strike the deal ""so close to the wire"". She said the government had refused to engage with business on preparations, while dodging questions for months about the recruitment of customs agents and the development of IT systems. ""The government is treating its own incompetence as inevitable,"" she said. The SNP said it was ""the understatement of the century"" that the UK would face disruption, adding that millions of businesses would now face ""a mountain of extra costs, red tape, bureaucracy and barriers to trade in just four days' time"". Conservative grandee Lord Heseltine has urged MPs and peers to abstain when voting on the deal, warning it will inflict ""lasting damage"" on the UK. The former deputy prime minister said he would ""in no way share the endorsement of the legislation"", but that he would not vote against it because the consequences of a no-deal would be even graver. Political parties in Northern Ireland that take their seats in Westminster - the DUP, the Alliance and the SDLP - areset to vote against the deal. The DUP, which supports Brexit, said its eight MPs would oppose the deal because it did not address ""damaging"" issues caused by introducing customs checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. This video can not be played Brexit deal: How did we get here? Over the weekend, Chancellor Rishi Sunak sought to reassure the City of London that it will not be damaged by the deal. He said they would be ""doing a few things a bit differently"" and looking at ""how we make the City of London the most attractive place to list new companies anywhere in the world"". The chancellor said the deal was ""an enormously unifying moment for our country"" and it brought reassurance to those who were concerned about the impact on businesses.

Chinese games billionaire dies after poisoning,"A Chinese tycoon who died on Christmas Day was poisoned, Shanghai police say. Lin Qi, 39, was the chairman and chief executive of games developer Yoozoo, best known for the Game of Thrones: Winter Is Coming strategy game. The Shanghai police statement pointed to one of Mr Lin's colleagues - identified only by his surname Xu - as the main suspect. Mr Lin was believed to have a net worth of around 6.8bn yuan (Â£960m), according to the Hurun China Rich List. Many employees and ex-employees gathered outside Yoozoo's office on Friday to mourn his death. The businessman was a star of China's lucrative gaming market and had also made a foray into film production. He founded Yoozoo in 2009 and successfully led the company through a period where the gaming industry saw substantial changes towards mobile gaming. GoT makers adapt Chinese sci-fi saga for Netflix China imposes video game curfew for minors How online gaming has become a social lifeline - BBC Worklife The company also issued an emotional statement on its official Weibo microblog. ""Goodbye youth,"" it said, adding, ""We will be together, continue to be kind, continue to believe in goodness, and continue the fight against all that is bad."" The post attracted thousands of comments while the topic has been viewed more than 290 million times on Weibo. Many of the tributes featured calligraphy as Mr Lin was an avid calligrapher along with being a poetry enthusiast. Details are scant but Mr Lin is believed to have been poisoned, based on police statements. Yoozoo released its own statement, saying Mr Lin had admitted himself to hospital after feeling unwell but was in a stable condition. Things took a dramatic turn on Friday when the company announced its founder had died. According to local media reports, the person in custody could be Xu Yao, who heads Yoozoo's movie production arm. There was also some speculation among local media that Mr Lin had been poisoned via aged pu'er tea, a fermented Chinese drink. Apart from its Game of Thrones game, Yoozoo is also the co-publisher of Supercell's smash-hit game Brawl Stars along with China's Tencent Holdings. The company is also known for its connection with the Chinese sci-fi novel Three-Body Problem as it holds the rights for its film adaptation. But its expansion into the motion picture business wasn't as successful as the company had hoped and the project to adapt the book into six films by Yoozoo Pictures never took off. In September, it granted US streaming platform Netflix the right to adapt the sci-fi novel for television. The book is the first instalment of the trilogy Remembrance of Earth's Past by writer Liu Cixin and has received critical acclaim, counting both former US President Barack Obama and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg among its fans.

Hospitals under 'pressure' as Covid cases rise,"London Ambulance Service received as many emergency calls on 26 December as it did at the height of the first wave of Covid-19 England's ""very high"" Covid infection level is a ""growing concern"" as the NHS struggles to cope with rising patient numbers, a health official has said. On Monday, a record 41,385 Covid cases and 357 deathswere reported in the UK,external. NHS England said the number of people being treated for the virus in hospital is now 20,426, which is higher than the previous peak of about 19,000 in April. Health officials in Wales and Scotland have also said they are at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Monday's figure for new cases is the highest daily number reported by the UK government, and the first time the daily total has surpassed 40,000. It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in April, but testing capacity was too limited to detect the true number. Some data over the Christmas period is incomplete, as a result of certain services being paused. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said Monday's figure included some infections where reporting was delayed, but that officials did not deny there had been a significant increase in infections. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""This very high level of infection is of growing concern at a time when our hospitals are at their most vulnerable, with new admissions rising in many regions."" ""Despite unprecedented levels of infection, there is hope on the horizon,"" she added. Dr Doyle urged members of the public to ""continue to play our part in stopping the spread of the virus"" as the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is rolled out. Hospitals in Wales, Scotland and the south of England have reported rising pressure on their services as the number of Covid patients increases. Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, south-east London, said on Monday that an ""internal incident"" over its ""high number of Covid-positive patients"" had been ongoing since Sunday. ""All our patients have received the treatment they need, including intensive care treatment for Covid-19 and oxygen therapy as required. ""We are continuing to monitor the situation to ensure that this remains the case,"" a spokesperson for Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust said. Two stats stand out today and underline the extent of the pressure on the NHS. One is the more than 20,000 Covid patients in English hospitals, more than the peak in the first wave in April. In many ways it is even tougher for hospitals now, as they are trying to clear the backlog on non-urgent operations and procedures cancelled in the first wave - as well as cope with the surge in Covid numbers. It is worth pointing out though that one reason for the high level of patients is that some are there thanks to drugs and therapies discovered in the past year who might not have survived in the first wave. The other key statistic is the 41,385 new daily reported cases - by far the highest number since the testing system was fully established in the summer. Some sadly will become seriously ill after a week or so which points to even greater strain on hospitals in the new year. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said she saw ""wall to wall Covid"" when she worked at one London hospital on Christmas Day. Dr Katherine Henderson told the BBC there was a ""great deal of difficulty"" getting patients into wards. She added: ""The chances are that we will cope, but we cope at a cost - the cost is not doing what we had hoped, which is being able to keep non-Covid activities going."" Covid hospital pressures in Wales 'incredibly challenging' NHS faces being 'overwhelmed' warn health leaders Danny Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, told BBC News disruption to non-urgent care in both hospitals and other health services was ""inevitable"" as infections rise. About half of the health boards in Wales have already cancelled non-urgent care, according to the director of the Welsh NHS Confederation. Darren Hughes told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the situation in Welsh hospitals was ""incredibly serious, and worsening"", with some intensive care units already at capacity. Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar said large numbers of patients, and staff sickness, have createdan ""incredibly challenging"" situation. And doctors have warnedScotland's health system is ""severely stretched"". Infection rates in England are currently highest in areas of Essex, London and other parts of the South East. Parts of Essex haverecorded the highest weekly coronavirus case ratessince the pandemic began. In the week leading up to 21 December, Brentwood, Epping Forest and Thurrock all had rates of more than 1,350 cases per 100,000 people. Tracey Fletcher, the chief executive of Homerton hospital in east London, said her staff were ""extremely busy"" andurged people to comply,externalwith the tier four restrictions in force. As of 24 December, London, the South East, and the East of England had the greatest proportion of new variant cases Patricia Marquis, regional director of the Royal College of Nursing in south-east England, said the number of beds and staff available at hospitals in her area was ""really close to the edge"". ""We are getting to the point where it does feel like there is a possibility that hospitals will become overrun,"" she told Radio 4's PM programme. Ms Marquis said the strain on staffing meant nurses were looking after ""far more patients"" than usual and ""it does feel unsafe at times for them"". The South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) said it has warned the military and fire service that paramedics may soon need their support. SCAS, which serves Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire, said it had seen a threefold increase in 111 calls over the Christmas period, along with a 60-70% increase in staff absences as a result of showing Covid symptoms or having to self-isolate. This chart, using data up to 23 December, shows how hospital admissions had been rising in London Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government's tiered system for coronavirus rules in England was the ""right strategy"" to tackle coronavirus, but accepted the NHS was under pressure and there were ""difficult months ahead"". Some 24 million people in the south-east and east of England - about 43% of the population - are now living under the strictest tier four rules and a review on 30 December could see more areas placed under the restrictions. Mainland Scotland entered level four restrictions from Saturday for three weeks, and similar rules are in place in Wales. Northern Ireland has also entered a new six-week lockdown. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? London 999 calls as high as Covid first wave peak The BBC has been told the London Ambulance Service (LAS) received7,918 emergency calls on 26 December- as many as at the height of the first wave of Covid-19. An LAS memo said the rising demand was down to the ""rapid spread of the new variant of the Covid-19 virus"".

London 999 calls near first wave peak,"Patient demand in London is ""now arguably greater"" than in the first wave of the pandemic, according to the service London Ambulance Service (LAS) received as many emergency calls on 26 December as it did at the height of the first wave of Covid-19, the BBC has learned. Nearly 8,000 calls were received, a 40% increase on a typical ""busy"" day. Patient demand was ""now arguably greater"" than during the first wave, an internal message to all staff said. LAS said it was ""working urgently"" to reduce delays. It urged people only to dial 999 with genuine life-threatening emergencies and to use 111 if possible. The rapid spread of the new variant of Covid-19 was said to be the cause of the increased demand, according to the message. The UK reported another30,501 positive tests on Sunday, and 316 deaths of people who had tested positive within the past 28 days. Meanwhile South Central Ambulance Service - which serves Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire - said it was ""extremely busy"" and asked peopleonly to dial 999 in a ""life-threatening or serious emergency"",external. One London paramedic told the BBC that some patients were being treated in ambulance bays upon arrival at hospital, due to a lack of beds inside. ""It's been a horrendous time,"" the paramedic said. ""Ambulance staff are finding the whole situation very stressful."" Figures seen by the BBC show that at one London hospital on Sunday morning, ambulance crews were typically waiting nearly six hours to hand over patients to hospital staff. Levels of patient demand were equal ""and now arguably greater"" than those seen during the first wave of the pandemic, according to the all-staff message sent by LAS chief executive Garrett Emmerson. On 26 December, LAS received 7,918 calls, while on 16 March - one of its busiest ever days - it received marginally more. ""The demand is occurring because of the rapid spread of the new variant of the Covid-19 virus, initially in north-east London, but now spreading into north central London and predicted to spread further across the rest of the capital in the coming days and weeks"", the memo read. As of 24 December, London, the South East, and the East of England had the greatest proportion of new variant cases The NHS 111 service was twice as busy as usual in London, the message added. London Ambulance Service said it was working to find ways of alleviating pressures. It said private ambulance services, student paramedics, volunteers and the London Fire Brigade had been recruited to supplement its crews in order to provide as many ambulances as possible with two staff members. LAS was also receiving assistance from South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS), East of England Ambulance Service and St John Ambulance. Non-patient facing colleagues with clinical skills have also been moved to work frontline shifts. A separate message sent to ambulance crews on 26 December requested them, when it was safe to do so, to transport all patients to hospital on blue flashing lights in order to ""reduce travel times"". Usually only the most seriously unwell patients are taken to hospital in this way. In a statement, LAS said: ""Like NHS organisations across the country, demand for our services has risen sharply over the past weeks. ""Our colleagues in emergency departments are also under pressure receiving our patients as quickly as they can. We are working urgently with NHS partners to reduce any delays.

"UK records 30,000 new Covid-19 cases","A further 30,501 positive tests for coronavirus were reported on Sunday, as hospitals in parts of the UK warn they are at risk of being overwhelmed. Another 316 people died within 28 days of a positive test, bringing the total to 70,752. The true numbers are likely to be higher as some parts of the UK are not reporting data over Christmas. Northern Ireland has not reported cases or deaths and Scotland has not reported deaths. It comes asdoctors in Scotland warned that the health system was ""severely stretched""and a Welsh hospital madean urgent appeal for help with Covid-19 patientson Saturday night. Wales recorded 70 deaths on Sundayof people who had contracted coronavirus. Meanwhile, London Ambulance Service said it had beendealing with more than 400 calls an hour,externalon Sunday afternoon and urged people to only call 999 in an emergency. Withalmost 8,000 calls on Boxing Day, demand for ambulances in London almost matched 16 March, one of the service's busiest ever days. Crews arriving at one London hospital had a typical wait of six hours before they could hand over patients to overstretched hospital staff. One paramedic told the BBC that some patients had been treated in ambulance bays because of a shortage of beds. An LAS memo said the rising demand was down to the ""rapid spread of the new variant of the Covid-19 virus"". Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said hospitals in London and the south of England were under ""real pressure"" due to demand from Covid-19 and other conditions, as well as staff absence. ""The public should be under no illusions that this is one of the most challenging times for the NHS,"" she said. Meanwhile, NHS England said coronavirus vaccinations had been paused on Christmas Day and over the weekend but would resume on Monday. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Breaking|Breaking newsTrump signs Covid relief and spending packageThe measure restores unemployment benefits and averts a partial US government shutdown.ÂUS & Canada,"This video can not be played Trump asked Congress to amend the Covid aid bill earlier this week US President Donald Trump has belatedly signed into law a coronavirus relief and spending package bill, averting a partial government shutdown. Mr Trump had previously refused to sign the bill, criticising ""wasteful spending"" and calling for higher payouts to people hit by the pandemic. The delay meant that millions temporarily lost unemployment benefits. The relief package worth $900bn (Â£665bn) was approved by Congress after months of negotiation. It is part of a $2.3tn spending package that includes $1.4tn for normal federal government spending. Republican and Democratic Party lawmakers had been pleading with the president to sign it before a budget deadline of midnight on Monday. If he had not, some government agencies would have had to close, unless legislators could pass a stopgap bill. About 14 million Americans faced a lapse in unemployment benefit payments and new stimulus cheques. Unemployment benefits will now be restored. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home After the coronavirus aid relief bill overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives and Senate last Monday, Mr Trump issued an implied veto threat, describing the package as a ""disgrace"" and full of ""wasteful"" items. The bill includes a payment of $600 to Americans earning less than $75,000 a year. Mr Trump said he wanted Americans to receive $2,000 - but Republicans in Congress refused to agree to the change. Mr Trump also baulked at the annual aid money for other countries in the federal budget, arguing that those funds should instead go to struggling Americans. The economic effect of the pandemic has left millions of Americans reliant on food aid and other assistance His demand to send the measure back to Capitol Hill stunned lawmakers since he had largely stayed out of the negotiations. His top economic adviser, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, had proposed the $600 payments early this month, and many questioned why the president had waited so long to object. It was not immediately clear why Mr Trump - who is in Florida - finally decided to sign the bill into law on Sunday. He said he was signing the bill with ""a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed"". He leaves office on 20 January after losing November's election to Mr Biden, although he has refused to admit defeat. Republican Senator Mitt Romney said he was ""relieved"" that the legislation had at last become law. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, Republican Senator Pat Toomey said the president risked being remembered for ""chaos, misery and erratic behaviour"". US President-elect Joe Biden had warned of ""devastating consequences"" if Mr Trump continued to refuse to sign. In a strongly worded statement published on the transition website on Saturday, Mr Biden described Mr Trump's refusal to sign the bill as an ""abdication of responsibility"". ""It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don't know if they'll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump's refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority,"" Mr Biden said.

West Brom get late equaliser to draw at LiverpoolSemi Ajayi scores a dramatic late equaliser against leaders Liverpool to earn struggling West Brom their first point since Sam Allardyce took charge.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Analysis: How West Brom stopped champions Liverpool Semi Ajayi scored a dramatic late equaliser against leaders Liverpool to earn struggling West Brom their first point since Sam Allardyce took charge. Jurgen Klopp's side looked to be going five points clear at the top of the table when Sadio Mane chested down Joel Matip's long ball forward and fired past Sam Johnstone. Liverpool dominated for long periods without adding to their lead but the Baggies improved after the break and equalised in the 83rd minute. Ajayi leapt high above the home defence to send a header in off the post to spark jubilant celebrations from the away team at Anfield. West Brom keeper Johnstone made a superb save to deny Roberto Firmino a winner near the end. Reaction from Anfield and the rest of Sunday's Premier League action Klopp denies Salah is unhappy claims How big is the task facing West Brom boss Allardyce? There was a deep sense of frustration at full-time from Liverpool's players after they dropped league points at Anfield for the first time this season. Klopp, who was booked during the second-half by referee Kevin Friend for protesting a decision, walked to the Kop to acknowledge the 2,000 fans allowed into the ground as the home team headed for the dressing room knowing they had let two points slip. It has been a monumental 2020 with the Reds ending a 30-year wait for a league title, but this was not the result they wanted in their final home game of 2020.West Brom earn point at Liverpool Klopp's side dominated the first half, enjoying 84% possession, but were unable to add to a sumptuous finish by Senegal forward Mane. This video can not be played West Brom deserved the point - Jurgen Klopp Their dominance was highlighted by captain Jordan Henderson, who completed 39 more passes (85) than West Brom as a team (46) before half-time. But the visitors were livelier after the break and, after Liverpool lost defender Joel Matip to injury, the hosts allowed West Brom a way back. Alisson did well to keep out Karlan Grant after the forward had got the better of Rhys Williams before Ajayi's equaliser. Johnstone's save to keep out Firmino at the end only added to Liverpool's frustration, their lead at the top now three points. It looked like it was going to be a long afternoon for West Brom when Mane struck early but the Baggies dug deep to return to the Black Country with a crucial point. This result will give Allardyce, the last opposition manager to win a Premier League game at Anfield, with Crystal Palace in April 2017, huge encouragement as he looks to keep his new team in the Premier League. A week after being beaten 3-0 at home by Aston Villa in his first game in charge, West Brom refused to go under against the leaders and showed the spirit and character needed in a relegation battle. Having drawn 1-1 at Manchester City in Slaven Bilic's final game in charge, the Baggies have now taken points off last season's top two clubs. Allardyce, whose side are still five points from safety, will need help when the transfer market opens next month. But this result against a Liverpool side which had won the previous eight home league games will lift morale ahead of Tuesday's home game with Leeds. This video can not be played 'That wasn't just luck' - Allardyce praises 'superb' West Brom Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:""It does feel like a defeat, but we have a point more than before so it is completely fine. ""It's our fault but they deserved the point. In the first half it looked like 90:10 possession - it's a massive challenge to stay on track and do it again but we should have done it."" West Brom boss Sam Allardyce:""We've got a point against Liverpool, which no-one outside of us in the dressing room thought we'd get. ""When the first goal went in I think a lot of people thought how many was it going to be today, particularly after they knocked seven past Palace (last weekend). ""The players were so good today in their discipline, defending as a team, and finding a way in the second half to attack Liverpool when they got the opportunity."" Liverpool have failed to win six of their 15 Premier League games this season, as many as they did in the entire 2019-20 season. Having picked up just one point from their opening six away league games this season, West Brom have since earned two from their last two on the road away to Manchester City and Liverpool. This was the first time Liverpool failed to win a Premier League home game against a side starting the day in the relegation zone - despite taking the lead - since a 2-2 draw with Slaven Bilic's West Ham in December 2016. Among defenders since the start of the 2018-19 season, only Virgil van Dijk and Aaron Pierre (both nine) have scored more headed league goals in England's top four tiers than West Brom's Semi Ajayi (eight). Sadio Mane scored his 69th Premier League goal for Liverpool, moving him level with Luis SuÃ¡rez and behind only Robbie Fowler (128), Steven Gerrard (120), Michael Owen (118) and Mohamed Salah (86) for most goals in the competition for the Reds. Liverpool's festive programme continues at Newcastle on Wednesday (20:00 GMT), while West Brom host Leeds United on Tuesday (18:00 GMT).
