Suspect 'told police' he made Tube bomb,"Ahmed Hassan denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life The man accused of planting a bomb on a London Tube train admitted to police he made the device, a court has heard. Ahmed Hassan was arrested the day after the bomb partially detonated on a District Line train at Parsons Green on 15 September 2017, injuring many of the 93 passengers on board. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Det Con James Charalambous said Mr Hassan told him he made the bomb and no-one else was involved. Prosecutors say Ahmed Hassan built the device and set the timer, before leaving it on the train one stop earlier. Explosives expert Sarah Wilson said, had the device fully detonated, it had the potential to be ""lethal"". She told the court the bomb contained 400g of an explosive that with just one gram could cause ""serious injury"". The device partially detonated on the carriage at Parsons Green Det Con Charalambous told the Old Bailey he interviewed Mr Hassan at the Port of Dover - where he was arrested - at around 10:15 GMT on 16 September. The Metropolitan Police counter terrorism officer asked the 18-year-old: ""Who made the Tube bomb?"" He is said to have replied: ""I did."" The officer said that Mr Hassan told police they may also find a small amount of explosives at his home in Sudbury, Surrey. The court then heard that over the next four days the suspect was interviewed seven more times and answered ""no comment"". However, on one occasion he read a prepared statement, which repeated his claim that no-one else was involved in the attack. Earlier, Ms Wilson told the court that tests on the remains of the device showed the explosive chemical compound TATP had been used. The jury heard how just one gram of the chemical compound could cause ""serious injury to people or property"", but that the device had contained around 400g, along with 2.2kg of shrapnel to cause further damage. Ms Wilson described TATP as a ""sensitive primary high explosive"" which is ""very unstable and unpredictable"" - so is not produced for commercial or military use - and the bomb could be detonated just by being dropped. It would have taken several hours to create that amount of the substance, she said, along with the small amount that was discovered at Mr Hassan's foster home in Sunbury, Surrey. The court heard how the device contained 2.2kg of shrapnel Ms Wilson said all the elements necessary for making the bomb were there, but there could have been ""a number of factors"" around why it did not work properly, including whether it was made correctly or if it had become wet. She said: ""My conclusion was there had been a partial explosion. Obviously this device had not fully detonated but something quite violent happened. ""It was likely to be a rapid burn rather than a detonation. ""The initiator mechanism, the battery, has functioned but the main charge had failed to function fully."" Another witness, counter terrorism officer Det Con Matt Rogers, told the court his team discovered the word ""bored"" written repeatedly on the door of Mr Hassan's bedroom when they searched his home on the day after the attack. Officers found a bottle of hydrogen peroxide on his wardrobe, which prosecutors allege he used to make the bomb, and parts of a soldering kit were found underneath his bed. They also discovered a ruler and supermarket loyalty card with traces of TATP on it behind a sofa in the house. On Thursday, the court heard from a number of witnesses to the explosion who described a ""rolling fireball"" coming towards them. The jury also heard about injuries to some of the passengers, including hair being set on fire and clothes melting, after the device partially detonated. This video can not be played CCTV of Parson's Green Tube bomb fireball On Wednesday, the prosecution also said that Mr Hassan had told Home Office officials, 20 months before the Parsons Green attack, that he had been ""trained to kill"". Prosecutor Alison Morgan said he was interviewed in Croydon in January 2016, where he is alleged to have told officials he had been taken by force by the so-called Islamic State group, who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. The jury has been sent home for the weekend and the trial will continue on Monday.

Jail for 'most hated man in US' Shkreli,"Martin Shkreli, the former drug firm executive found guilty of defrauding investors, has been sentenced to seven years in prison. The 34-year-old wept at a hearing as a federal court judge in Brooklyn, New York, handed down the prison term. Shkreli was convicted last year of sending fake account statements to investors while concealing huge losses from two hedge funds he ran. He first became notorious in 2015 for hiking the price of a lifesaving drug. His lawyers had asked the judge to impose a sentence of 12 to 18 months, while prosecutors were seeking at least 15 years. Attorney Benjamin Brafman arrives for a hearing for his client, former drug company executive Martin Shkreli, ""I've got my begging voice on,"" Shkreli's lawyer Benjamin Brafman told the judge on Friday, while acknowledging his client could be annoying. ""There are times when I want to hug him and hold him and comfort him and there are times when I want to punch him in the face,"" said Mr Brafman. 'The most hated man in America'? Wrong medicine? The pressure for US healthcare reform An uncharacteristically apologetic Shkreli said in court: ""There is no conspiracy to take down Martin Shkreli. ""I took down Martin Shkreli with my disgraceful and shameful actions."" In 2015 the youthful executive made headlines after he founded Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim and raised its price by 5,000% to $750 (Â£540) per pill. The medication is used to treat Aids patients, the pregnant and elderly. Price gouging is not illegal or even unusual in the US pharmaceutical industry. But Shkreli became a poster boy for corporate excess, and was dubbed ""Pharma Bro"" and the ""most hated man in America"". In December 2015, he was charged with securities fraud charges and looting millions of dollars from two hedge funds he operated, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare. He was convicted of those charges, as well as scheming to prop up the stock price of Retrophin, the drug company he founded in 2011. Before his sentencing, Mr Brafman told the judge that Shkreli is a ""somewhat broken"" person who suffered from depression and an anxiety disorder. Mr Brafman said the US government would like to just ""throw away"" his client. 'The most hated man in America'? 'Pharma Bro' jailed over Hillary hair post During the trial last year, Shkreli called the prosecution ""junior varsity"" in off-the-cuff remarks to reporters covering his trial. Prosecutors sought a gag order on him after that outburst, but the judge denied their application. After a jury found him guilty in August last year, Shkreli was allowed to remain free pending sentencing. But a month later he offered social media followers $5,000 if they could bring him hair from former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who repeatedly criticised him during her campaign. A judge revoked bail and Shkreli was jailed. Prosecutors moved to seize $7.4m of his assets, including a single copy of an album by American hip hop group the Wu-Tang Clan that the disgraced executive is said to have paid $2m for at auction in 2015.

Burger-flipping robot taken offline,"This video can not be played WATCH: Flippy the burger robot gets to work Flippy the burger-flipping robot that started work this week in a California restaurant has been forced to take a break because it was too slow. The robot was installed at a Cali Burger outlet in Pasadena and replaced human cooks. But after just one day at work the robot has been taken offline so it can be upgraded to work faster. Its human helpers are also getting extra training to help the robot keep up with demand. USA Today reported thatthe robot was still in place behind the grill,externalat the burger joint but was switched off. A sign said the robot would be ""cooking soon"" but gave no date for when it would once again be flipping hamburger patties. The robot is believed to have been given time off because news about it spread widely, and led to more interest and orders than the restaurant could handle. In a statement Miso Robotics, which made Flippy, said it was testing the code that controls the robot to ensure that it can cook quickly enough to fulfil orders at peak times. Prior to starting work, Flippy was said to be capable of cooking up to 2,000 burgers a day. Quiz: What's Meghan Markle done this week? Amazon promises fix for creepy Alexa laugh KFC returns to former chicken distributor Cali Burger said it was also working with staff to show them the best way to prepare and place the raw patties and other ingredients in its burgers to ensure Flippy works as fast as possible. Anthony Lomelino, head of technology at Cali Burger, told USA Today that kitchen staff needed to learn to ""choreograph"" their movements around the motions of the mobile, spatula-fitted arm which Flippy uses to cook. Cali said that it started to use the robot to get around the problems it has recruiting staff. The high turnover rate among staff in fast-food restaurants meant it often spent time and money training people to prepare food only to have them leave after a few months. Eventually, said the chain, burger-flipping robots will be installed in up to 50 of its restaurants. Burger-flipping robot begins first shift.

Bosses' group head quits amid race claims,"Leading businesswoman Lady Judge has resigned after allegations of racism, sexism, and bullying. The chairwoman of the bosses' group the Institute of Directors (IoD) had been suspended pending an investigation into the claims. Deputy chairman Sir Ken Olisa has also resigned, citing ""powerful forces"" within the organisation. A recording of controversial remarks made by Lady Judge, and heard by the BBC, indicates she supports diversity. However, the IoD director general Stephen Martin called her resignation a ""victory for ordinary staff members"". Lady Judge's resignation letter said: ""It is with great sadness and concern that I hereby tender my resignation as chair from the Institute of Directors with immediate effect. ""I continue to strongly refute the allegations made against me and remain deeply disturbed by the gross and conspiratorial mishandling of the process which has led to the damaging circumstances in which I and the Institute are now placed,"" she said. Lady Judge particularly objected to a draft report containing the allegations being leaked to the press. One of the main concerns of the business lobby group is to promote good corporate governance. But she said: ""The continuing failure to follow the most basic of principles of natural justice demonstrates individuals within the Institute that have no understanding as to what amounts to good governance, which only serves to utterly undermine any credibility the organisation may lay claim on such issues. ""It is not an organisation I wish to be part of."" Lady Judge said the recording was made to entrap her. But the BBC understands the IoD's position is that the recording was made by the business lobby group's director general, Mr Martin, because he thought she might make racist remarks. Mr Martin made the recording without her knowledge. In a discussion about cutting the number of the IoD secretariat, she told Mr Martin that ""the problem is we have one black and one pregnant woman [on the IoD secretariat] and that is the worst combination we could possibly [have]... two blacks and one pregnant woman"". Lady Judge said on Friday she wanted to make clear that she was seeking to have those individuals removed from their positions ""solely on the basis of their performance"" rather than their ethnicity or gender. Other parts of the recording indicate she is in favour of promoting diversity. Earlier in the recording, Lady Judge said she had arranged women-only ""cocktail party"" networking events, and she participated in IoD women's conferences. ""It's all part of this agenda, which is to bring in more women,"" she said. Mr Martin then says in the recording: ""One of the other things we're trying to do as well is improve diversity not just for women but for disability, for everything else."" Lady Judge responds: ""We want to do that too... I think you're doing a great job. I think everybody appreciates the fact that things are getting done. They want change."" The recording was obtained by the BBC's Joe Lynam. Sir Ken said: ""Bizarrely, her [Lady Judge's] success and evident commitment to diversity and modernisation seem to have encouraged fervent opposition."" However Mr Martin welcomed the departure of Lady Judge and said: ""This is a victory for ordinary staff members, who had the courage to risk jeopardising their careers, to speak out and make complaints about the conduct and language of people in very senior positions. ""This is a victory also for good governance. Our HR department took these complaints seriously and instigated a truly independent process through an external law firm, which fully and fairly considered the allegations before producing their conclusion in a final report that the majority of the allegations were true."" Trump wins order to silence porn actress Foster parents cleared in Easter Bunny row Quiz: What's Meghan Markle done this week? Of the IoD secretaries, Lady Judge said earlier: ""My acknowledgment that issues of race and pregnancy could complicate their removal both legally and from the standpoint of public perception is an observation I believe most lawyers would make, and that many non-lawyers also know to be true. I was addressing the likely consequences of their dismissal, not the reasons for it."" Lady Judge apologised for the way she had expressed herself in that conversation: ""I realise I expressed myself in a way that sounds crude and insensitive. I regret that and apologise for it."" She added: ""I am a woman lawyer who has broken many glass ceilings and who has advocated for women and minority rights my entire life, I'm glad that's the case."" Her term as chair was due to expire in May, and she was not seeking re-election. In December 2017, Caroline Prosser, an employment lawyer from Hill Dickinson, started to gather evidence in an independent investigation of allegations of racism, sexism, and bullying against Lady Judge. Ms Prosser spoke to 14 complainants, who made 41 allegations.

Judge suggests Trump mute Twitter critics,"The US president has more than 48 million followers on Twitter A judge has advised US President Donald Trump to mute rather than block his Twitter critics after users of the service filed a lawsuit against him. Seven people sued Mr Trump after he blocked them from seeing his tweets, arguing that it was unconstitutional. But District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald suggested the president mute the accounts he does not want to see. ""Isn't the answer he just mutes the person he finds personally offensive?"" she asked the court in New York. ""He can avoid hearing them by muting them,"" she added. People on Twitter are unable to see or respond to tweets from accounts that block them. But if Mr Trump muted an account, he would not see that user's tweets but the user could still see and respond to his. The president is an avid user of the social media forum, and has more than 48 million followers on his @realDonaldTrump account which he uses to praise allies and lambast critics.

The hearing on Thursday came after a lawsuit was filed in July by theKnight First Amendment Institute,external, a free speech group at Columbia University. The seven Twitter users involved in the legal action say their accounts were blocked by the president, or his aides, after they replied to his tweets with mocking or critical comments. The complaint argues that by blocking these individuals, Mr Trump has barred them from joining the online conversation. The government says the president can choose who he interacts with on Twitter. Trump's year on Twitter Trump, Twitter and his 'filter bubble' Twitter is paralysed by Trump's tweeting Katie Fallow, an attorney representing the Twitter users, said the president had blocked people ""simply because they criticise him"". She said this represented ""viewpoint discrimination that violates the First Amendment"", which guarantees free speech under the US constitution. One of the users, Philip Cohen, said Mr Trump blocked him after he responded to one of his tweets with a mocked up image that labelled the president a ""corrupt incompetent authoritarian"". ""At first I was kind of proud, like 'oh he cares about me,'"" he told AFP news agency. ""But then very quickly I realized that a lot fewer people were seeing my tweets and my political efficacy, my ability to speak to my fellow citizens, was impaired by that.

But US Department of Justice attorney Michael Baer said that the president was free to decide who he interacted with. ""The president has an associational interest in deciding who he's going to spend his time with in that setting,"" he said. Lawyers on both sides said they would consider muting as a possible solution to the lawsuit. ""If there is a settlement that serves the interests of both parties, it is often considered the wiser way to go,"" Judge Buchwald said towards the end of the hearing.

"Man, 85, 'died due to A&E overcrowding'","The hospital's A&E unit has seen an average of 400 patients a day attending over the past few months An 85-year-old man died while waiting in an accident and emergency unit because of ""dangerous overcrowding"", a hospital boss has said. An email leaked from Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust to the Health Service Journal said the patient died after going to A&E with stomach pain on Wednesday afternoon. He died after suffering a cardiac arrest early on Thursday morning. The hospital said the long wait for treatment was ""unacceptable"". The man was initially seen and assessed within an hour, and was waiting on a chair to be seen by senior staff after a blood test suggested he may have had heart problems. But he deteriorated and suffered a cardiac arrest. The email from the trust's medical director, Matthew Metcalfe, said: ""Last night a patient died due entirely to the dangerous overcrowding of the department. ""The risk we have all been aware of, but may have felt hypothetical, has just happened."" The man died after suffering a cardiac arrest early on Thursday morning at Northampton General Hospital A spokeswoman for the hospital trust said the email was sent to all consultants ""to ensure they were fully aware of the seriousness of the position in our emergency department and also the importance of their ongoing support to our patients attending the department"". ""Ideally this patient would not have waited so long, would have been reviewed sooner by a senior consultant and might have been in a hospital bed on a ward at the time of his deterioration,"" the trust said in a statement. ""We don't yet know what difference this would have made to the final outcome."" The hospital's A&E unit has seen an average of 400 patients a day attending over the past few months, an increase of almost 30% on the same period last year. The trust has apologised to the family of the man, and said it would carry out a full investigation into his death.

Saudi Arabia nears Typhoon jet deal with BAE,"BAE's Typhoon fighter jet Saudi Arabia has moved closer to a deal to buy 48 Typhoon fighter jets, UK aerospace giant BAE Systems has said. A memorandum of intent on the deal was signed after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. BAE Systems said the signing was ""a positive step towards agreeing a contract for our valued partner"". Downing Street said a target of Â£65bn worth of trade and investment had been agreed during the UK visit. The preliminary order comes two months after BAE announced around 2,000 job cuts because demand for the Typhoon had slowed. The announcement of this proposed deal is both a shot in the arm for Britain's aerospace industry and a metaphorical punch on the nose to human rights and anti-war protesters. They have strongly opposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia both on the grounds of its poor human rights record at home and more urgently because Saudi-led air strikes on Yemen are blamed for the majority of civilian casualties there. Theresa May is reported to have raised Britain's concerns on both these issues at a private dinner with the Saudi Crown Prince last night. But whatever was said has clearly not obstructed a proposed deal worth billions of pounds and thousands of jobs. Shares in BAE Systems closed up more than 2% in the wake of the announcement although the value of the preliminary deal was not disclosed. Aerospace, defence and security industry body ADS welcomed this first step in what would be a multi-billion pound deal. ADS Chief Executive Paul Everitt said: ""The Memorandum of Intent is welcome news for BAE Systems and its UK supply chain, which has a 37.5% workshare on the Typhoon programme."" BAE chief executive Charles Woodburn said: ""We are committed to supporting the Kingdom as it modernises the Saudi Armed Forces and develops key industrial capabilities critical to the delivery of Vision 2030.""

Don't label me as BME - Priti Patel,"Former cabinet minister Priti Patel says she has warned Conservative colleagues not to ""label me as BME"". She told BBC Radio Kent she found the commonly used abbreviation for Black and Minority Ethnic ""patronising"" and ""insulting"". The former international development secretary and leading Brexiteer did not rule out a bid for the Conservative leadership at some point. She quit the cabinet last November after a row over unauthorised meetings. Profile: Priti Patel She said she was ""not sure"" if Britain would ever see a prime minister from a minority community. There was a lot of ""patronage"" in the British political system and lot of institutional barriers, she told Radio Kent, but she would ""love to see it"" as it would show the country was a ""true meritocracy"". Asked if it could be her, she said: ""Who knows?"" The Witham MP said she wanted to encourage more people from Indian backgrounds to follow in her footsteps and get involved in politics. But she said it would be a ""regressive step"" for any political party or government to put people in posts ""just because they are women or because they represent a minority group"". ""I don't like the labelling of people. I don't like the term BME. I'm British first and foremost, because I was born in Britain. ""I challenge all my colleagues in the Conservative Party and in Westminster: Don't label me as a BME. I've said that to people in the cabinet. I've said that to civil servants. I think it's patronising and insulting."" She said the term was ""totally unhelpful because we are people and everybody wants to be recognised for their individual merits"". Born:29 March, 1972, in London Education:Watford Grammar School; economics degree from Keele University, postgraduate study in British government and politics at University of Essex Family:Born to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the 1960s. Married with a seven-year-old son Career:Elected Witham MP in 2010. Became Treasury minister in 2014 and Minister for Employment in 2015. Appointed Secretary of State for International Development in July 2016. Resigned in November 2017. Ms Patel was forced to quit the government after admitting she had unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials. She said the ""whole thing was incredibly messy"" but she had been ""very clear with the prime minister and also I took responsibility for what she felt was not acceptable, so I think I did the right thing"". She was speaking at a Conservative event in Broadstairs for International Women's Day.

Human genome pioneer Sulston dies,"Sir John had laboratories named after him at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute British genome pioneer Sir John Sulston has died aged 75. He came to prominence as the British face of the international project to decode the human genome. Sir John won a Nobel Prize in 2002,externalfor his work on the development of cells within a humble worm, which paved the way for innovations in cancer research. He was known as a passionate believer in pushing the boundaries of science and in making data on the human genome available to all. He helped found the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute at Hinxton near Cambridge, and the laboratories there bear his name. Prof Sir Mike Stratton, director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said the scientist had a burning and unrelenting commitment to making genome data open to all without restriction. ""We all feel the loss today of a great scientific visionary and leader who made historic, landmark contributions to knowledge of the living world, and established a mission and agenda that defines 21st century science,"" he said. Sir John was known as a brilliant scientist with a modest manner Jeremy Farrar, director of the biomedical research charity, Wellcome, said Prof Sulston's leadership was critical to the Human Genome Project, one of the most important scientific endeavours of the past century. ""His dedication to free access to scientific information was the basis of the open access movement, and helped ensure that the reference human genome sequence was published openly for the benefit of all humanity,"" he said. Sir John Sulston will be remembered as one of the greatest scientists of our time. His great adversary was Prof Craig Venter, who led private efforts to sequence and patent human genes, leading to a race between the two. In 2002, Prof Venter hit out at John Sulston, claiming that his efforts had actually held back the development of the technology. ""John wanted to sequence the human genome, I wanted to sequence the human genome,"" Prof Venter said. ""I can't fault him for wanting to do that. But it was more important to him to be the one to do it than to enable it to get done quickly."" Every gene the public sector discovered was a gene that Prof Venter couldn't patent. But Prof Sulston, a proud socialist, said that his efforts were for the public good. ""I suppose I am anti-capitalist to the point that I feel that the companies are completely unnecessary. I think we'd all get on very well if we did all that discovery in universities, frankly. ""I think all the debilitating diseases of Africa and other developing countries cannot be dealt with on a capitalist basis because there is no market - there is no money."" The UK sequenced about a third of the genome, with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) contributing most of the remainder. But lobbyists working on behalf of private companies, placed pressure on the Clinton Administration to withdraw funds from the public effort. Prof Sulston's work, sponsored by the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council, strengthened the hand of  those arguing for the NIH's continued involvement. As an individual, Prof Sulston was unassuming, often seen wandering the labs in sandals and chatting with young researchers. We are already benefiting from his research - with the emergence of new medicines for many cancers. We also know the genetic basis of more than 6,000 disorders, allowing treatments to be better tailored. The revolution that John Sulston helped start has only just begun, and will transform medicine and our understanding of the human body. The son of a vicar, Sir John was born in 1942. He studied for his degree in organic chemistry and PhD in nucleotide chemistry at the University of Cambridge in the 1960s. After a stint studying in the US, he returned to Cambridge in 1969. He was recognised with the Nobel Prize in 2002 for his contribution to the understanding of how genes control cell division and death in the nematode worm. It was a groundbreaking discovery, resulting from three decades of studying the organism. However, Prof Sulston is perhaps best known for his biggest academic pursuit - spearheading the international project to map the human genome. The effort became a race between the public and the private sector, which led to a draft being published in 2001. Both the US President, Bill Clinton, and the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, spoke at the press conferences held in Washington and London to announce that the draft sequence was complete. In 2017, Sir John was made a Companion of Honour by the Queen in her birthday honours for his contribution to science and society.

UK to seek exemption from US steel tariffs,"This video can not be played US tariffs: What do we need to know? The UK will seek an exemption from President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US, according to Trade Secretary Liam Fox. Mr Fox says he will travel to Washington next week when he will discuss the new duties. He said: ""We will, of course, be looking to see how we can maximise the UK's case for exemption under these particular circumstances."" Steel imports will carry a 25% tariff while aluminium will have a 10% duty. UK Steel says 7% of its steel exports go to  the US, worth Â£360m. The European Union says it will be asking for an exemption to the tariffs, a move that includes all 28 countries, including, of course, the UK. President Trump claims that the US has suffered from ""unfair trade"" and that the tariffs will boost the domestic market. Mr Fox said: ""We understand the anxieties about steel over-production that the United States has but we believe there are other ways to tackle that on a multilateral basis."" US chided over hefty import tariffs US tariffs: What do we need to know? What impact will steel tariffs really have? Wales criticises Trump steel move Mr Trump's decision, which comes into effect in two weeks' time, has provoked widespread condemnation from the likes of China and France. This video can not be played Liam Fox seeks UK exemption from US steel tariff It also prompted the resignation of Mr Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn. Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: ""Slapping a 25% tax on steel from British companies is going to hit us hard."" He added: ""It worries me that I don't think the Trump administration has quantified what it can supply from its own market and what it can't. Therefore, it is actually shooting itself in the foot by increasing costs to the US steel sector and US manufacturing sector by 25%."" Trump wins order to silence porn actress John Lewis staff bonus cut again Empty-nesters 'resent boomerang kids' A spokesman for steelmaker ArcelorMittal said the industry faced a number of problems: ""The steel industry has been characterised in recent years by overcapacity, high levels of imports and unfair trade. ""We have appreciated the efforts made by governments to address unfair imports in support of a level playing field.  Fundamentally a solution must be found to address the high level of overcapacity that still exists.  This is particularly important given steel's globally traded nature."" UK exports of aluminium to the US are tiny, but the UK's Aluminium Federation fears a trade war all the same. Aluminium Federation president Giles Ashmead said: ""The proposed 10% tariff on aluminium entering the US is regrettable. ""While the US is not a major export market for UK-produced aluminium, indiscriminate tariffs are a hindrance to free trade, and do little to secure a 'level playing field' for global commerce."" Canada and Mexico will be exempt from the tariffs while negotiations continue over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The final round of Nafta talks is due to be held this spring in the US. US tariffs: What do we need to know? Video, 00:01:53US tariffs: What do we need to know?

Saudi Arabia nears Typhoon jet deal with BAESaudi Arabia moves closer to a deal for 48 jets as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wraps up a UK visit.23m23 minutes agoBusiness,"BAE's Typhoon fighter jet Saudi Arabia has moved closer to a deal to buy 48 Typhoon fighter jets, UK aerospace giant BAE Systems has said. A memorandum of intent on the deal was signed after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. BAE Systems said the signing was ""a positive step towards agreeing a contract for our valued partner"". Downing Street said a target of Â£65bn worth of trade and investment had been agreed during the UK visit. The preliminary order comes two months after BAE announced around 2,000 job cuts because demand for the Typhoon had slowed. The announcement of this proposed deal is both a shot in the arm for Britain's aerospace industry and a metaphorical punch on the nose to human rights and anti-war protesters. They have strongly opposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia both on the grounds of its poor human rights record at home and more urgently because Saudi-led air strikes on Yemen are blamed for the majority of civilian casualties there. Theresa May is reported to have raised Britain's concerns on both these issues at a private dinner with the Saudi Crown Prince last night. But whatever was said has clearly not obstructed a proposed deal worth billions of pounds and thousands of jobs. Shares in BAE Systems closed up more than 2% in the wake of the announcement although the value of the preliminary deal was not disclosed. Aerospace, defence and security industry body ADS welcomed this first step in what would be a multi-billion pound deal. ADS Chief Executive Paul Everitt said: ""The Memorandum of Intent is welcome news for BAE Systems and its UK supply chain, which has a 37.5% workshare on the Typhoon programme."" BAE chief executive Charles Woodburn said: ""We are committed to supporting the Kingdom as it modernises the Saudi Armed Forces and develops key industrial capabilities critical to the delivery of Vision 2030.""

M25 rapist dies in prison aged 63,"Antoni Imiela died at HMP Wakefield on Thursday A serial sex attacker dubbed the M25 rapist has died in prison. Antoni Imiela, 63, who preyed upon women and girls across south-east England, was given seven life terms in 2004. In January, it emerged he was being considered for release after serving a total of 14 years in jail. The Prison Service said Imiela, who is understood to have had a heart condition, died at HMP Wakefield on Thursday. There were no suspicious circumstances, it added. Antoni Imiela's criminal history The previous attacks of the M25 rapist Imiela moved to Appledore, near Ashford in Kent, in 1996 after serving a prison sentence for a series of robberies. Five years later he began a campaign of attacks - raping three girls and four women in 2001 and 2002. The locations of his attacks, in Kent, Surrey, Hertfordshire and west London, earned him the M25 rapist moniker. Imiela's trial at Maidstone Crown Court in 2004 heard how he targeted strangers - dragging his victims into secluded areas where he threatened to kill them. In March 2004,Imiela was convicted of the seven rapes,,externalalong with the kidnap, indecent assault and attempted rape of a 10-year-old girl in Birmingham, leading to seven life sentences. Imiela was arrested in 2002 and initially charged with raping a 16-year-old girl Speaking in July 2004, one of his victims, who wished to remain anonymous, said he hadraped her at knifepoint,externaland punched her in the face when she tried to look at him. She said she finally regained a sense of control after looking Imiela in the eye in court. ""When I saw him... it just totally took that terror away. I just thought he looked pathetic,"" she told the BBC. Imiela, who is originally from Newton Aycliffe, in County Durham, was arrested on the M20 in 2002 after aneighbour contacted the BBC's Crimewatch programme,externalsaying he knew him ""by sight"", after a broadcast appeal for information. Speaking to the BBC after his conviction in 2004, Imiela's wife,Christine Imiela, said she still loved him,external, but described her husband as ""a sick man who needs help"". ""He had raped people and obviously been with prostitutes,"" she said. ""I cannot feel the same, but deep down I do still love him and I want to support him because I am sure he is ill. ""Anyone that is ill, I do not think they should just be discarded."" While in prison, a cold case review took place into an attack in 1987 on a 31-year-old woman, which found a DNA match to Imiela. In 2012, he was sentenced to a further 12 years in prison after being found guilty of the attack. The jury was told he grabbed the woman off the street in Sydenham in south-east London, put his hand over her mouth, dragged her on to waste ground and sexually assaulted her, before threatening her with a brick. Sentencing Imiela, Judge John Bevan told him: ""You are wholly unrepentant about your life of guns, rape and general violence and, despite having served eight years of your life sentence, you have not expressed one jot of remorse."" The victim died before her attacker was brought to justice. Speaking after the 2012 case, detectives said they believed it was likely Imiela had attacked further victims. A Prison Service spokeswoman said: ""As with all deaths in custody, there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.""

Bosses' group suspends chair after racism row,"The chairwoman of the Institute of Directors (IoD), Lady Judge, has been suspended pending an investigation into allegations of racist, sexist and bullying behaviour. Lady Judge contests the allegations, and has accused the IoD of smearing her reputation. The IoD met on Thursday to discuss the contents of a report it commissioned into her alleged behaviour. The IoD frequently calls for better corporate governance in UK firms. Lady Judge reportedly made a number of derogatory comments to colleagues. She allegedly told the IoD's director general last April that ""the problem is we have one black and one pregnant woman [on the IoD secretariat] and that is the worst combination we could possibly have"". Lady Judge said she wanted to make clear that she was seeking to have those individuals removed from their positions ""solely on the basis of their performance"". Trump wins order to silence porn actress Foster parents cleared in Easter Bunny row Quiz: What's Meghan Markle done this week? She said: ""My acknowledgment that issues of race and pregnancy could complicate their removal both legally and from the standpoint of public perception is an observation I believe most lawyers would make, and that many non-lawyers also know to be true. I was addressing the likely consequences of their dismissal, not the reasons for it."" Lady Judge apologised for the way she had expressed herself in that conversation: ""I realise I expressed myself in a way that sounds crude and insensitive. I regret that and apologise for it."" The Institute of Directors has frequently presented itself as an arbiter of good practice in Britain's boardrooms. Now we have the spectacle of this highly influential organisation tearing itself apart over allegations of racist and sexist behaviour at the top. It's not just embarrassing, it threatens to hamstring the IoD in future and enrage its members. And there seems little chance of the agony ending any time soon. Lady Judge has made it clear that she will defend herself robustly and expose what she says is a flawed investigation. A spokesman for Lady Judge said the conversation was recorded by IoD director general Stephen Martin in a private conversation without her knowledge. Lady Judge added: ""I, a woman lawyer who has broken many glass ceilings and who has advocated for women and minority rights my entire life, I'm glad that's the case."" Her term as chair was due to expire in May, and she was not seeking re-election. The IoD's investigation was conducted by Caroline Prosser, an employment lawyer from Hill Dickinson. She started to gather evidence for the IoD report in December 2017. Ms Prosser spoke to 14 complainants, who made 41 allegations.

US surprise at 'dramatic' N Korea shift,"This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies North Korea's decision to meet US President Donald Trump proves the US strategy of isolating North Korea is working, US Vice-President Mike Pence says. The US has made ""zero concessions"", he said,,externaland would maintain pressure until denuclearisation was achieved. The agreement to hold an unprecedented summit stunned observers. But the White House later said North Korea would have to take ""concrete steps"" before any meeting. Only months ago, Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un were hurling insults at each other. But now Mr Trump has agreed to the summit following an invitation delivered by South Korea. No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader.

Earlier he has hailed the move as ""great progress"",but he said sanctions would remain in place,externaluntil a denuclearisation deal was reached. The North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks, only to resume them when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded, analysts say. Some expressed concern the Trump regime could ""fall into the North Korean trap"" of granting concessions with nothing tangible in return. This video can not be played The South's Chung Eui-yong talks to reporters at the White House Later, White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders said the president would demand ""concrete steps and concrete actions"" from North Korea before any meeting took place. She did not specify what those steps were, nor repeat previous assertions that the meeting would take place by May. There has been no mention of the developments as yet on North Korean state media. In Sweden, meanwhile, local diplomatic sources were quoted as saying the North's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho would be visiting his Swedish counterpart soon. The Swedish embassy in Pyongyang represents US, Canadian and Australian diplomatic interests there. Analysis by the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul South Korean President Moon Jae-in has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. His approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off, it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel Peace Prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship. Read Laura's piece in full The South Korean envoys met Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week. It was the culmination of a rapprochement that began at the New Year and saw the Koreas marching together at the Winter Olympics. The envoys then travelled to Washington to brief Mr Trump. North Korean cheerleaders with a unified Korean flag at the Winter Olympics Speaking outside the White House after the meeting, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong said Mr Kim was prepared to sit down with the US president and was now ""committed to denuclearisation"". In a statement sent to the Washington Post, North Korea's UN ambassador said the ""courageous decision"" of Mr Kim would help secure ""peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the East Asia region"".,external How to talk to the world's most secretive country What could happen now? There is no indication yet of where the Trump-Kim talks might take place, but the Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as likely options. Clearly for the US, South Korea and allied nations, denuclearisation is the key issue. North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. The North has carried out six nuclear testsand has missiles that could reach the US. However, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un The North's well-documented human rights abuses are also a key issue for the US. So what does the North want? An easing, if not removal, of sanctions certainly. Perhaps a peace treaty to finally end the Korean War and a promise that if North Korea denuclearised then the US would finally withdraw its troops from South Korea. Did sanctions push North Korea into talks? Asian markets rally on US-NK talks hopes What missiles does North Korea have? The US has tens of thousands of military personnel there and the massive annual joint war games infuriate the North because it believes they are preparation for invasion. The UN was among the most positive, with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres commending the ""leadership and vision"" of all concerned. Chinese President Xi Jinping telephoned Donald Trump on Friday to welcome the development and urge all sides to avoid doing anything that could impede the improving situation. Russia, Germany, the EU and the IAEA all voiced hope that talks would reduce the risk of conflict erupting. This video can not be played Former British ambassador to N Korea warns of dangers of Trump/Kim meeting Other countries, such as Japan and the UK, vowed to keep up the pressure on the North to give up its nuclear ambitions. In the US, reaction was divided - not least in Mr Trump's own party. ""The North Korean racket for decades now has been to offer talks in exchange for bribes or other advantages.Then we pay them, and make an agreement, and when they cheat it all breaks down - until the next time,"" Elliott Abrams, foreign policy adviser to Ronald Reagan and George W Bush, told CBS News,,external ""I hope we are not about to fall into their trap yet again."" But Senator Lindsey Graham told the same news outlet that although he was ""not naive"", President Trump's ""strong stand against North Korea and its nuclear aggression gives us the best hope in decades to resolve this threat peacefully"".

Military deployed after spy poisoning,"The military personnel are experts in chemical warfare and decontamination About 180 military personnel have been deployed to Salisbury to help in the investigation into the attempted murder of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter. The personnel - from the Army, Royal Marines and RAF - are experts in chemical warfare and decontamination. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition after being exposed to a nerve agent. Home Secretary Amber Rudd will chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, on Saturday. She has described Sunday's attack as ""outrageous"". Those deployed include instructors from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre and the 29 Explosive Ordnance Group, who are experts in bomb disposal. Eighteen vehicles have also been sent. Russian spy: What we know so far What are nerve agents? State TV anchor warns 'traitors' Members of the military were seen covering over a police car that has been at Salisbury Hospital since Sunday, before men dressed in white hazardous materials suits examined it. It was later towed away from the hospital, covered by a tarpaulin, on the back of an Army truck. Officers are also expected to secure Mr Skripal's car. The police car was towed away from the hospital on an Army truck Specialist officers have also put up a tent over the grave of Mr Skripal's son, who died last year, at Salisbury cemetery. The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance ""to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene"", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims. The public should not be alarmed and there is no evidence to suggest a wide public health risk at this time, the police added. The military personnel in Salisbury are mostly from the Army, but also from the Royal Marines and RAF Military personnel were pictured making preparations at Winterbourne Gunner, Wiltshire, before deployment to Salisbury Valery Morozov, a Russian exile, told BBC News that Mr Skripal was working in cyber security. The former Russian military security colonel and his daughter remain in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday -  is conscious but ""very anxious"" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said Mr Bailey was in a serious but stable condition. Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. Former Russian military security colonel Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent Some of the 180 military personnel who have been sent to help the investigation are specialists in chemical biological radiological and nuclear (CBRN) warfare. They include Falcon Squadron from the Royal Tank Regiment, which uses specialist Fuchs vehicles - effectively mobile laboratories - to carry out tests and decontamination. ""Sensitive Site Exploitation"" will look for any further traces of the nerve agent. Royal Marines from 40 Commando have also just completed the UK's biggest chemical warfare exercise -  called Toxic Dagger - involving 300 personnel and including scientists from Porton Down. The existence of these units - some of which had suffered under defence cuts - highlights a growing concern in the military about the use of chemical weapons by individuals, terrorist groups and ""rogue states"". But the public is being told not to be alarmed. Many of the military personnel will be working behind the scenes and helping the police with relatively straightforward tasks, such as securing sites and removing objects, including ambulances, for decontamination. Ms Rudd visited some of the sites cordoned off by counter-terrorism police in Salisbury on Friday. She also visited Salisbury District Hospital where Mr Skripal, his daughter, and Mr Bailey are being treated. The home secretary, who met Mr Bailey in hospital, would not give any further details of the nerve agent used or how it was administered.

The gamble of the century,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in - dupe or genius? South Korean leader Moon Jae-in is either a diplomatic genius or a communist set on destroying his country and US President Donald Trump is either a master of brinkmanship or a pawn in a more devious game - depending on who you speak to. But it is the other actor in this saga, Kim Jong-un, the only one who has yet to make a direct statement, who may just be the most significant player in this most extraordinary of political gambles. From the moment he extended an apparent olive branch to the South in his new year message to the cordial delegations to Pyeongchang for the Winter Olympics, it became clear that Kim Jong-un had mastered the most sophisticated crafts of propaganda. Some will viewhis personal invitation to Mr Trump to hold talks with him- as well as the commitment to freeze further nuclear tests - as the real diplomatic masterstroke after a year that was unprecedented for the level of naked hostility the US and the North bared toward one another. But the risk here belongs to both Moon Jae-in and Donald Trump. In a situation where neither can claim sole mastery of the narrative, without a clear exit strategy, and when there are so many definitions for both success and failure, a lot is at stake. Mr Moon is viewed by his supportersas the negotiator-in-chief who has now skilfully managed to get Mr Kim to at least talk about getting rid of nuclear weapons. He is the one who spotted the opportunity duringthe North Korean leader's speech in January- which offered a glimmer of hope that the reclusive state was willing to engage with the South - and grabbed it with both hands. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un The dizzying level of diplomacy and a frenzy of visits between North and South has now delivered - it seems. ""People are calling this the North Korean charm offensive, I actually think this is a South Korean charm offensive. This is something President Moon Jae-in clearly wanted,"" John Delury from Yonsei University said to me even before the talks were announced. Mr Moon knew his envoys would have to extract the word ""denuclearisation"" from Mr Kim when they visited Pyongyang. He also knew having two of his top level government ministers looking cosy with the North Korean leader would not go down well in Washington or Tokyo. But it was worth the risk. The US would not have considered talking to the communist state without that meeting. His chosen delegates got what they needed. The South Korean leader is also attempting the role of honest broker, handling Mr Trump and Mr Kim at the same time. He is choosing his words carefully and keeping his cards close to his chest while flattering those who respond to the spotlight. Is North Korea just playing the US? US ties any N Korea talks to nuclear arms In his New Year's address he said Mr Trump deserved ""huge credit"" for talks between the two Koreas, knowing it would please him. He is also using language that will reassure a concerned Republican administration.The language of the South Korean statement announcing the talkswas also fulsome in its admiration for Trump's handling of the situation leading up to this moment. Sanctions will stay in place, Mr Moon had said earlier, and Mr Trump has now confirmed that. But everybody knows it wasn't always like that. Just six months ago Mr Trump waspromising to rain down ""fire and fury like the world has never seen""on North Korea if it dare threaten the US. Prof Haksoon Paik, lead researcher at the Sejong Institute, said that threat level felt ""totally unprecedented"". ""President Moon was very much concerned about nuclear threat of war. Kim Jong-un was in the same situation. We were hearing from the likes of the US Senator Lindsay Graham that lives will be lost over here. Donald Trump's unorthodox and unstable leadership had both Korean leaders worried about the potential of military options."" The US has always maintained that the permanent denuclearisation of North Korea is the endgame. Even with all the surprises up to this point, few believe Mr Kim would agree to that so if they don't achieve that what options does Trump have? South Korean officials held a landmark meeting with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang this week So is Moon Jae-in - and indeed Donald Trump - being manipulated by a North Korea which has fooled the world before? ""By dangling before the US once again 'denuclearization of the Korean peninsula' and 'moratorium on nuclear and missile tests', Kim seeks to weaken sanctions, pre-empt US military pre-emption, and condition the world into accepting North Korea as a legitimate nuclear state,"" says Prof Lee Sung-yoon from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University. For Mr Trump this could be about one of the boldest and most historic moves a US leader has made in foreign relations. If this gamble works out, Mr Trump could credit himself as the president who sorted out North Korea. His administration has had very few victories, despite promising his voters there would ""so much winning."" He believes his ""maximum pressure"" strategy and his work to get China on side and help squeeze Pyongyang economically is working. Protesters in Seoul called for peace talks between the US and North Korea in November Reporters say he casually mentioned in the White House briefing room that he hoped they would give him credit for Kim Jong-un's offer. His voters certainly will. But meeting Mr Kim risks treating the communist leader as an equal. It could be a PR disaster. The date set is also only a few months away - a short time frame to achieve diplomatic goals with a leaderhe mocked as ""little rocket man"" just a few months ago. Prof Robert E Kelly at Busan University in South Korea tweeted: ""Trump doesn't study or even read. He tends to fly wildly off script. And May means there's almost no time for all the staff prep necessary."" Pyongyang has been playing this game for decades. Mr Trump is new to it. He may see a big win on the horizon, but his Art of the Deal book will not be the guide he needs to deal with Kim Jong-un. For Mr Moon this is about history and it is also personal. He played a part in previous attempts to negotiate with North Korea as chief of staff to President Roh Moo-hyun when he met Mr Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, in 2007. That was the last time the leaders of the two Koreas held a summit. A satellite launch by Pyongyang ended the talks. By then around $4.5bn of aid had been sent North during the policy of engagement. Critics believe that money helped to accelerate the weapons programme. North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? The politics behind the 'peace Olympics' Having failed once before, Mr Moon is trying to complete the work he started, says Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Forum. ""He's basically following the same playbook as his two liberal predecessors. It's exactly the kind of thing he would want to pick up and continue."" The border between the North and South is demarcated at the truce village of Panmunjom As a son of refugees from the North, Mr Moon is also aware of the effects of conflict on the peninsula. His parents fled North Korea aboard a UN supply ship in 1950 at the start of the Korean War alongside thousands of other refugees. He told reporters during his election campaign: ""My father fled from the North, hating communism. I myself hate the communist North Korean system. That doesn't mean I should let the people in the North suffer under an oppressive regime."" North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Meet North Korea's first family President Moon has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. Duyeon Kim believes there is a high probability that at the end of this negotiating process, all parties will fail, and North Korea will decide it wants to keep its nuclear weapons. And yet... ""You just don't know. I don't think it's ever a lost cause, in spite of all the doubts and scepticism all parties should go in with clear eyes, but negotiate hard."" North Korea says its long-range missiles protect all of Korea from ""US aggressors"" President Moon's approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. He may suffer politically if this fails but maybe for him, this is not about scoring political points. This is what he told Time magazine last year when he was presidential candidate: ""My mother is the only one [of her family] who fled to the South. [She] is 90 years old. Her younger sister is still in the North alive. My mother's last wish is to see her again."" These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel peace prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship.

Tube bomb had 400g of 'unstable explosive',"Ahmed Hassan denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life The man accused of planting a bomb on a London Tube train admitted to police he made the device, a court has heard. Ahmed Hassan was arrested the day after the bomb partially detonated on a District Line train at Parsons Green on 15 September 2017, injuring many of the 93 passengers on board. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Det Con James Charalambous said Mr Hassan told him he made the bomb and no-one else was involved. Prosecutors say Ahmed Hassan built the device and set the timer, before leaving it on the train one stop earlier. Explosives expert Sarah Wilson said, had the device fully detonated, it had the potential to be ""lethal"". She told the court the bomb contained 400g of an explosive that with just one gram could cause ""serious injury"". The device partially detonated on the carriage at Parsons Green Det Con Charalambous told the Old Bailey he interviewed Mr Hassan at the Port of Dover - where he was arrested - at around 10:15 GMT on 16 September. The Metropolitan Police counter terrorism officer asked the 18-year-old: ""Who made the Tube bomb?"" He is said to have replied: ""I did."" The officer said that Mr Hassan told police they may also find a small amount of explosives at his home in Sudbury, Surrey. The court then heard that over the next four days the suspect was interviewed seven more times and answered ""no comment"". However, on one occasion he read a prepared statement, which repeated his claim that no-one else was involved in the attack. Earlier, Ms Wilson told the court that tests on the remains of the device showed the explosive chemical compound TATP had been used. The jury heard how just one gram of the chemical compound could cause ""serious injury to people or property"", but that the device had contained around 400g, along with 2.2kg of shrapnel to cause further damage. Ms Wilson described TATP as a ""sensitive primary high explosive"" which is ""very unstable and unpredictable"" - so is not produced for commercial or military use - and the bomb could be detonated just by being dropped. It would have taken several hours to create that amount of the substance, she said, along with the small amount that was discovered at Mr Hassan's foster home in Sunbury, Surrey. The court heard how the device contained 2.2kg of shrapnel Ms Wilson said all the elements necessary for making the bomb were there, but there could have been ""a number of factors"" around why it did not work properly, including whether it was made correctly or if it had become wet. She said: ""My conclusion was there had been a partial explosion. Obviously this device had not fully detonated but something quite violent happened. ""It was likely to be a rapid burn rather than a detonation. ""The initiator mechanism, the battery, has functioned but the main charge had failed to function fully."" Another witness, counter terrorism officer Det Con Matt Rogers, told the court his team discovered the word ""bored"" written repeatedly on the door of Mr Hassan's bedroom when they searched his home on the day after the attack. Officers found a bottle of hydrogen peroxide on his wardrobe, which prosecutors allege he used to make the bomb, and parts of a soldering kit were found underneath his bed. They also discovered a ruler and supermarket loyalty card with traces of TATP on it behind a sofa in the house. On Thursday, the court heard from a number of witnesses to the explosion who described a ""rolling fireball"" coming towards them. The jury also heard about injuries to some of the passengers, including hair being set on fire and clothes melting, after the device partially detonated. This video can not be played CCTV of Parson's Green Tube bomb fireball On Wednesday, the prosecution also said that Mr Hassan had told Home Office officials, 20 months before the Parsons Green attack, that he had been ""trained to kill"". Prosecutor Alison Morgan said he was interviewed in Croydon in January 2016, where he is alleged to have told officials he had been taken by force by the so-called Islamic State group, who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. The jury has been sent home for the weekend and the trial will continue on Monday.

Asian markets rally,"Asian markets rallied on Friday, on hopes that North Korean nuclear tensions might be easing. Investors responded toUS President Donald Trump accepting an invitation for face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. There was already some optimism on the markets after Mr Trump earlierleft the door open for possible exemptions to US tariffs on steel and aluminium. South Korea and Japan's main markets began well but later shed some gains. Seoul's Kospi index finished 1.1% ahead. Meanwhile Japan's Nikkei 225 index - which initially rose by 2.5% - closed only 0.5% higher. Analysis: The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting in full Analysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia Business Correspondent Investors in the region have been watching the potential conflict between the US and North Korea for months now. And news that the two could meet by May of this year is being greeted with a sigh of relief by many.  And that shouldn't come as a surprise. Nobody wants a conflict on the Korean peninsula to break out, especially between arguably two of the world's most volatile leaders. East Asian economies would be almost certainly be hit,because of integrated supply chains in the region. It's a region central to global shipping and manufacturing, so any escalation of the current tensions could disrupt trade and economic activity. But perhaps what's more interesting, is what a potential meeting between ""Rocket Man"" and the ""Dotard"" says about just how badly the North Korean economy may be doing as sanctions bite. Read more from Karishma:Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended 1.1% higher, while China's mainland indexes also made small gains. The South Korean won climbed slightly, while the Japanese yen slipped against the US dollar. That is not unexpected given the yen is a safe haven currency, with investors tending to seek out riskier assets with better returns when things appear more stable.

Kim-Trump talks in 400 words,"This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies Friday has been a landmark day in the history of the Korean tensions. Here's your very brief guide to what has just happened Two South Korean officials had dinner with Kim Jong-un this week in North Korea - that was itself significant. They then flew to the US with a message from Mr Kim - he wanted to meet US President Donald Trump and was prepared to give up his nuclear weapons. Mr Trump accepted the offer- they might now meet as soon as May. The two leaders have hurled insults and threatsat each other over the past year, like ""Little Rocket Man"" and ""dotard"". South Korea - with which North Korea is still, on paper, at war - said this news ""came like a miracle"". BecauseNorth Korea's nuclear weapons programme has worried the world for decades. It has conducted six illegal underground nuclear tests and fired off numerous long-distance missiles. It says it could hit the US with a nuke - though that's still not certain. It could definitely attack its neighbours. Giving up the weapons would be seismic. It's not clear. It could be thatyears of sanctions designed to force it to talk are working. It could be it sees Donald Trump as someone it can manipulate. Or it could think now is its chance to finally be recognised as a serious nuclear state. Complicated diplomacy, and the clock is ticking. We don't yet know where any talks will take place, nor who will be involved along with the leaders. We also don't know what North Korea wants in exchange for a meeting. North Korea hasn't actually committed to anything yet. If it does agree to throw out its nukes, the main issue will be how to prove it. It has reneged on agreements before. As our correspondent says,it's the political gamble of the century. The other main players are: Japan, which neighbours the Koreas. It is cautiously optimistic but wants North Korea to give up nuclear weapons before anything happens. China, North Korea's main financial backer. It has always pushed for everyone to talk, and said things were ""heading in the right direction"". Russia, which has a tiny border with the North. It called it ""a step in the right direction"". The gamble of the century Strange optics of announcement Did sanctions push Kim to talks? US-N Korea talks: What could happen now?

What could happen now?,"The meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim comes just months after the pair exchanged deeply personal insults US President Donald Trump has accepted an invitation to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in what appears to be a breakthrough after months of insults, threats and mutual hostility. It could happen as early as May which leaves little time to get things organised, from venues to core negotiations. So it's perhaps not surprising that there are many questions about what happens next. The talks would be unprecedented, marking the first face-to-face meeting between sitting leaders of North Korea and the US.  Former US presidents have met North Korean leaders before, but they were all out of office at that point. ""The [significance of this] could almost be compared to President Nixon meeting China's Chairman Mao, to a lesser degree,"" analyst Michael Madden of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins SAIS told the BBC. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un Not much. The White House has confirmed that Trump will meet Kim ""by May"", but an exact time and location is yet to be determined. According to Mr Madden, there's a ""speculative chance"" that the meeting might take place at the North Korean truce village of Panmunjom, which sits at the demilitarised zone between the North and the South. However, Dr John Park of the Korea Working Group says that he believes the meeting might instead be held ""in a neutral location"". This could be in China or elsewhere. Analysis: The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting in full Are North and South Korea friends again? This is the first time the US has been in direct talks with North Korea about its nuclear program since 2012. Kim Jong-un has never met another foreign leader until now, though he is scheduled to meet South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in April at Panmunjom. Denuclearisation will undoubtedly be the biggest issue that the meeting will hope to address. But while Mr Kim says he is ""committed to denuclearisation"", North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. ""The US will be pushing for total denuclearisation and South Korea has also said that it is their main objective,"" said Bruce Bennett, an analyst at the RAND Corporation. ""But it's important to remember that Mr Kim has said over and over again that they will not give up their nuclear weapons."" North Korea has rapidly advanced its nuclear missile programme Other points that might be brought up are: US pushing for Americans held in Pyongyang to be brought home, North Korea looking for recognition as a nuclear-capable state and a possible peace treaty being signed. ""A peace treaty would give North Korea reassurance and deprive them of one of the key rationales behind their nuclear program [that they have to defend themselves],"" said Mr Madden. But one of the terms of a potential peace treaty could be the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, a move which could prove deeply problematic. ""I think Mr Kim anticipates that if a peace treaty is signed, that after say 10 years most of the US troops in South Korea could be withdrawn,"" said Mr Bennett. ""Then maybe if later on he then wanted to forcefully reunify South Korea, [it would be easier] as the US troops would be gone. This would be the safest way to reach his objective."" Analysts agree that it is hard to predict the extent to which sanctions will be lifted or eased, adding that it is dependent on how successful the talks are. ""North Korea is definitely looking for sanctions relief, that will be a key demand of theirs,"" said Mr Bennett. ""The question is, would we lift sanctions in an incremental manner or are we going to insist on total denuclearisation before we lift?"" Mr Bennett also believes that the harsh sanctions placed on North Korea had real effect in bringing them to the table. ""There were reports that North Korea was going to possibly run out of hard currency by this October. So I think the campaign was really causing some pain in the North."" A successful meeting would see an ""agreement"" being signed by all parties, according to Mr Madden. ""If they can reach a point that has certain tangible achievements, like North Korea agreeing to a freeze in nuclear test activities and letting international inspectors in to the country to view their nuclear facilities that would be a success,"" said Mr Madden. But Mr Bennett argues that it is more likely that both sides would reach a compromise where they had ""given things up but also gained"". ""The worst case scenario is North Korea walking out of talks and claiming it's because Trump is being totally unresponsive and the US is being difficult,"" said Mr Bennett. South Korean delegates had earlier met Mr Kim in Pyongyang But a more plausible scenario is the US and North Korea simply failing to make any progress at all. ""I call it the 'kick the can down the road' policy, we just delay discussing this until further down the line with another US President,"" said Mr Bennett. ""By say 2030, North Korea could have 200 nuclear weapons and what happens then if they force the South to surrender? If we kick the can again we're going to have a bigger problem a few years down the road.""

Wagamama fined for minimum wage failure,"Restaurant chains Wagamama and TGI Fridays have each been fined an undisclosed amount for failing to pay staff the National Minimum Wage. They were among 43 employers in the hospitality sector on the government's latest list of firms breaking the law. Wagamama has repaid an average of Â£50 to 2,630 employees. TGI Friday's had to repay Â£25 each to 2,300 staff. Wagamama blamed ""an inadvertent misunderstanding"" of the rules on staff uniforms for the blunder. The company said it had asked front-of-house staff to wear black jeans or a black skirt with their Wagamama-branded top. This was considered as asking them to buy a form of uniform, ""and so we should have paid them for it,"" it said. ""We have gladly made payments to current and previous employees who missed out dating back from 2016 to 2013. We have also updated our uniform policy and we now pay a uniform supplement to cover the black jeans."" Just before Christmas, Wagamama had to apologise after a note was seen in one of its London restaurants, apparently banning staff from taking sick days. Wagamama apologises for banning sick days Minimum wage increases 'could cost jobs' A TGI Fridays statement said the firm had reimbursed team members for a shoe allowance. The firm added: ""This is a historic payment which was paid last year, and we have since reimbursed team members for the purchase of their black uniform shoes."" In total, 179 employers were fined Â£1.3m by the government for underpaying their staff. And they were warned that minimum pay rates will increase again on 1 April. Empty-nesters 'resent boomerang kids' John Lewis staff bonus cut again Amazon promises fix for creepy Alexa laugh The hotel chain Marriott was also fined. It underpaid 279 of its staff over Â£250 each on average. The company apologised and said it was committed to paying the National Minimum Wage. ""When an error was identified by a routine HMRC audit in 2015, we co-operated fully with HMRC and promptly reimbursed all those affected,"" it said. Other companies fined included the fashion chain Karen Millen, Birmingham and Stoke City Football Clubs, and St Helens Rugby Club. In its response to the Matthew Taylor Review of the gig economy, calledGood Work,external, the government has already announced plans to give all workers the right to a payslip. It said that would make it easier for 300,000 workers to check that they were being paid the legal minimum. Later this month, the government will launch an awareness campaign for the new minimum wage rates. Employers can be fined up to twice the total wage shortfall, subject to a maximum of Â£20,000 per worker.

Burger-flipping robot takes time off,"This video can not be played WATCH: Flippy the burger robot gets to work Flippy the burger-flipping robot that started work this week in a California restaurant has been forced to take a break because it was too slow. The robot was installed at a Cali Burger outlet in Pasadena and replaced human cooks. But after just one day at work the robot has been taken offline so it can be upgraded to work faster. Its human helpers are also getting extra training to help the robot keep up with demand. USA Today reported thatthe robot was still in place behind the grill,externalat the burger joint but was switched off. A sign said the robot would be ""cooking soon"" but gave no date for when it would once again be flipping hamburger patties. The robot is believed to have been given time off because news about it spread widely, and led to more interest and orders than the restaurant could handle. In a statement Miso Robotics, which made Flippy, said it was testing the code that controls the robot to ensure that it can cook quickly enough to fulfil orders at peak times. Prior to starting work, Flippy was said to be capable of cooking up to 2,000 burgers a day. Quiz: What's Meghan Markle done this week? Amazon promises fix for creepy Alexa laugh KFC returns to former chicken distributor Cali Burger said it was also working with staff to show them the best way to prepare and place the raw patties and other ingredients in its burgers to ensure Flippy works as fast as possible. Anthony Lomelino, head of technology at Cali Burger, told USA Today that kitchen staff needed to learn to ""choreograph"" their movements around the motions of the mobile, spatula-fitted arm which Flippy uses to cook. Cali said that it started to use the robot to get around the problems it has recruiting staff. The high turnover rate among staff in fast-food restaurants meant it often spent time and money training people to prepare food only to have them leave after a few months. Eventually, said the chain, burger-flipping robots will be installed in up to 50 of its restaurants. Burger-flipping robot begins first shift.

Trump accepts 'milestone' meeting with Kim,"This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump are to meet in person by May, it has been announced, an extraordinary overture after months of mutual hostility. News of the meeting was delivered by South Korean officials after talks with Mr Trump at the White House. They passed a verbal message from Mr Kim, saying the North Korean leader was ""committed to denuclearisation"". Mr Trump hailed ""great progress"" but said sanctions would remain in place. Analysis: The political gamble of the 21st Century US-North Korea talks: What could happen now? South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the news ""came like a miracle"". ""If President Trump and Chairman Kim meet following an inter-Korean summit, complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula will be put on the right track in earnest,"" he said. This video can not be played Envoy Chung Eui-yong speaks to reporters outside the White House China has welcomed the development, saying the Korean peninsula issue was ""heading in the right direction"" and calling for ""political courage"". However, correspondents say the North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks, only to resume them when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded. The latest announcement came days after the South Korean delegation met Mr Kim in Pyongyang. The strange optics of the North Korea announcement The South Korean envoys behind a diplomatic breakthrough Speaking outside the White House after briefing Mr Trump, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong said he had passed on a message that Mr Kim was ""committed to denuclearisation"" and had ""pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests"". In a statement sent to the Washington Post,,externalNorth Korea's UN ambassador said the ""courageous decision"" of Mr Kim would help secure ""peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the East Asia region"". There is no indication yet of where the Trump-Kim talks might take place, but the Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as likely options. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it would take ""some weeks"" to arrange the talks and admitted the US had been ""surprised"" at Kim Jong-un's ""forward-leaning"" stance. Just a day earlier, Mr Tillerson had said the US was ""a long way"" from negotiations with the North. Analysis by BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul President Moon Jae-in has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. His approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off, it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel Peace prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship. Read Laura's piece in full North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws.

It has carried out six nuclear tests,and has missiles that could reach the US. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics gave an unexpected window for diplomacy. South Korea thenheld landmark talks with Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week, returning home saying the North was willing to give up its nuclear weapons if it felt it had no reason to keep them. Analysis: Did sanctions push North Korea into talks? Asian markets rally on US-NK talks hopes What missiles does North Korea have? There were four main elements to the statement delivered by Mr Chung: Mr Kim is prepared to sit down with the US president North Korea is ""committed to denuclearisation"" It will halt all nuclear and missile tests It understands that US-South Korean military drills ""must continue"". South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting in full The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. North Korea's charm offensive during the Winter Olympics included deploying its famed cheerleading squad at matches It also remains unclear exactly what it is asking for in return. North Korea: Does a nuclear test mean war? Are North and South Korea friends again? Mr Trump has repeatedly belittled Kim Jong-un, andlast year threatened him with ""fire and fury"" if North Korea continued to threaten the US. He has at times said there is no point in talking to North Korea. But Mr Chung made a point of saying it was Mr Trump's ""maximum pressure policy"" which had brought the parties to this point, a gesture which the president is likely to appreciate. Our correspondent says Kim Jong-un has also scored a propaganda win, first with the Olympics and now by being seen to reach out to the US. Former British ambassador to North Korea, John Everard, told the BBC there must be a suspicion that Mr Kim might be trying to play Mr Trump, to try to ""get him to say across the table things that North Korea has been asking for for a long time"". The South Korean-US drills are a source of intense frustration for Pyongyang These could include a peace treaty to finally end the Korean War and a promise that if North Korea denuclearised then the US would finally withdraw its troops from South Korea. The US has tens of thousands of military personnel there and the massive annual joint war games infuriate the North, because it believes they are preparation for invasion. President Moon, who is due to meet Mr Kim in April, said the Trump-Kim meeting ""will be recorded as a historic milestone that realised peace on the Korean peninsula"". The South's statement also credited ""international solidarity"" for the breakthrough, probably in part a reference to the ever-increasing international sanctions on North Korea. The heavily guarded DMZ has been the location of landmark talks in the past China, North Korea's main economic supporter, has in recent months toughened up its dealings with Pyongyang, including on key areas like petroleum and oil. This is thought to be putting a major strain on the North. Beijing has consistently pushed for all parties to talkand on Friday, China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said it welcomed the ""positive signals"" from the US and North Korea. ""We're glad that they have finally made this first step... The next key step is for all parties to maintain this momentum,"" Mr Geng said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the development was a ""step in the right direction"". ""It should not just be a meeting, it should open up a way to resuming a fully fledged diplomatic process to find a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue,"" he said. Japan, which saw North Korean missiles fly over its territory twice last year, responded with cautious optimism. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would ""keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearisation"", and said he hoped to meet Mr Trump ahead of the Kim summit. No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme. A number of bids to restart the talks also collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a ""leap day"" (29 February) agreement with the US that had promised food aid in return for inspections and a moratorium on missile tests.

Tube bomb had 400g of 'unstable explosive'The court hears that just a gram of the explosive used at Parsons Green could cause 'serious injury'.2m2 minutes agoUK,"Ahmed Hassan denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life The man accused of planting a bomb on a London Tube train admitted to police he made the device, a court has heard. Ahmed Hassan was arrested the day after the bomb partially detonated on a District Line train at Parsons Green on 15 September 2017, injuring many of the 93 passengers on board. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. Det Con James Charalambous said Mr Hassan told him he made the bomb and no-one else was involved. Prosecutors say Ahmed Hassan built the device and set the timer, before leaving it on the train one stop earlier. Explosives expert Sarah Wilson said, had the device fully detonated, it had the potential to be ""lethal"". She told the court the bomb contained 400g of an explosive that with just one gram could cause ""serious injury"". The device partially detonated on the carriage at Parsons Green Det Con Charalambous told the Old Bailey he interviewed Mr Hassan at the Port of Dover - where he was arrested - at around 10:15 GMT on 16 September. The Metropolitan Police counter terrorism officer asked the 18-year-old: ""Who made the Tube bomb?"" He is said to have replied: ""I did."" The officer said that Mr Hassan told police they may also find a small amount of explosives at his home in Sudbury, Surrey. The court then heard that over the next four days the suspect was interviewed seven more times and answered ""no comment"". However, on one occasion he read a prepared statement, which repeated his claim that no-one else was involved in the attack. Earlier, Ms Wilson told the court that tests on the remains of the device showed the explosive chemical compound TATP had been used. The jury heard how just one gram of the chemical compound could cause ""serious injury to people or property"", but that the device had contained around 400g, along with 2.2kg of shrapnel to cause further damage. Ms Wilson described TATP as a ""sensitive primary high explosive"" which is ""very unstable and unpredictable"" - so is not produced for commercial or military use - and the bomb could be detonated just by being dropped. It would have taken several hours to create that amount of the substance, she said, along with the small amount that was discovered at Mr Hassan's foster home in Sunbury, Surrey. The court heard how the device contained 2.2kg of shrapnel Ms Wilson said all the elements necessary for making the bomb were there, but there could have been ""a number of factors"" around why it did not work properly, including whether it was made correctly or if it had become wet. She said: ""My conclusion was there had been a partial explosion. Obviously this device had not fully detonated but something quite violent happened. ""It was likely to be a rapid burn rather than a detonation. ""The initiator mechanism, the battery, has functioned but the main charge had failed to function fully."" Another witness, counter terrorism officer Det Con Matt Rogers, told the court his team discovered the word ""bored"" written repeatedly on the door of Mr Hassan's bedroom when they searched his home on the day after the attack. Officers found a bottle of hydrogen peroxide on his wardrobe, which prosecutors allege he used to make the bomb, and parts of a soldering kit were found underneath his bed. They also discovered a ruler and supermarket loyalty card with traces of TATP on it behind a sofa in the house. On Thursday, the court heard from a number of witnesses to the explosion who described a ""rolling fireball"" coming towards them. The jury also heard about injuries to some of the passengers, including hair being set on fire and clothes melting, after the device partially detonated. This video can not be played CCTV of Parson's Green Tube bomb fireball On Wednesday, the prosecution also said that Mr Hassan had told Home Office officials, 20 months before the Parsons Green attack, that he had been ""trained to kill"". Prosecutor Alison Morgan said he was interviewed in Croydon in January 2016, where he is alleged to have told officials he had been taken by force by the so-called Islamic State group, who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. The jury has been sent home for the weekend and the trial will continue on Monday.

"Row erupts over Frida Kahlo Barbie dollMattel rejects claims from Kahlo's relatives that it was ""not authorised"" to produce a Kahlo doll.12h12 hours agoLatin America & Caribbean","Frida Kahlo is in a new Barbie range launched by Mattel this week - to coincide with International Women's Day - celebrating ""Inspiring Women"" A row has broken out between relatives of the late Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and the corporation which claims it holds the rights to her image. It comes after the toy company Mattel launched a range of new Barbie dolls based on ""Inspiring Women"" - Kahlo among them. In a statement, the family insisted Mattel was not authorised to base a doll on Kahlo. But both the Frida Kahlo Corporation and Mattel have rejected the claims. The artist with the famous unibrow was famous for her self-portraits and became a feminist icon. Since she died in 1954, her image has generated an array of consumer products, from tequila to lip gloss. This is not the first time that the commercial activities of the Frida Kahlo Corporation are said to have angered some of Kahlo's descendants. ""Mrs Mara Romeo, great-niece of Frida Kahlo, is the sole owner of the rights of the image of the illustrious Mexican painter Frida Kahlo,"" the family said in a statement. Frida Kahlo broke boundaries and challenged norms - and later spawned an array of consumer products Mrs Romeo told AFP news agency that the problem was not confined to image rights. ""I would have liked the doll to have traits more like Frida's, not this doll with light-coloured eyes,"" she said. But Mattel said the company had the correct permission to produce the likeness. ""Mattel has worked in close partnership with the Frida Kahlo Corporation, the owner of all rights related to the name and identity of Frida Kahlo, on the creation of this doll,"" a spokesperson said. ""In addition to the Frida Kahlo Corporation being an important part of the doll development process, we have their permission and a legally binding agreement to make a doll in the likeness of the great Frida Kahlo."" Mattel also provided a statement from the Frida Kahlo Corporation in which it said it derived its rights to reproduce Kahlo's image from Kahlo's niece, Isolda Pinedo Kahlo.

UK in power bid on devolved areas,"This video can not be played David Lidington said: ""What will not help is to have different sets of food labelling or food hygiene safety regulations."" The UK government has named 24 devolved areas where it wants to temporarily retain power following Brexit. Ministers in the Scottish and Welsh governments want subjects such as food labelling and animal welfare to come under their control. However, UK ministers are bidding to oversee those areas, andothers on the list,external, when the UK leaves the EU. The Scottish government has accused the UK government of a power grab and has introduced its own Brexit legislation. Ministers at Westminster insist that ""the vast majority of powers returning from Brussels will start off in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast"". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, who is conducting talks with the devolved governments, said: ""There is a much smaller group of powers where the devolved governments will be required to follow current EU laws for a little bit longer while we work out a new UK approach."" The 24 policy areas expected to require a UK legislative approach for a temporary period include: Animal health and traceability Food and feed safety and hygiene law Food labelling Chemical regulation Mr Lidington told BBC Scotland that if these policy areas were not incorporated into UK-wide frameworks then there would be a loss of jobs and ""probably a higher price for consumers"". He explained: ""What will not help either customers or producers is to have different sets of food labelling or food hygiene or safety regulations in different parts of the UK. ""All that does is add to costs, loss of jobs amongst producers and it leads to less choice, probably a higher price for consumers. ""The same applies with manufacturers, if you're a paint manufacturer in Wales you've got to stick to some chemical standards in producing your paint, but you want those to be the same as the paint standards in Scotland or Northern Ireland because you are a customer there. It just makes sense that we do so much trade in internal borders in the UK that we have a set of common sense rules agreed. ""I hope between the different governments, laid out in legislation, that means producers and consumers will benefit."" First Ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones are due to hold talks with the prime minister next week. Both the Scottish and Welsh governments have produced plans for continuity bills as a fallback option to deal with legal uncertainties caused by Brexit if they cannot agree to consent to the UK government's legislation. Responding to the publication, Scottish Brexit minister Mike Russell said: ""This list simply confirms the UK government's plans for a power grab. ""Under the EU Withdrawal Bill the UK will have the right to take control of any of the powers on this list. ""However, the publication of the categories demonstrates the threat is most immediate in key devolved areas such as agriculture, GM crops, fishing, environmental policy, public procurement, food standards and a range of other areas. ""Unless the bill is changed Westminster could soon be in control of these policies amounting to a major power grab and a re-writing of the devolution settlement the people of Scotland voted for so decisively."" The UK government's analysis paper, which was published on Friday, detailed 49 policy areas where no further action was required; 82 policy areas where non-legislative common frameworks might be required and 24 policy areas that are ""subject to more detailed discussion to explore whether legislative common framework arrangements might be needed, in whole or in part"". There was confusion at the Scottish Labour conference in Dundee when MP Lesley Laird demanded that the ""shroud of secrecy"" over the row be lifted, three hours after the full list of powers had been published.

Troops deployed after Russian spy poisoning,"The military personnel are experts in chemical warfare and decontamination About 180 military personnel have been deployed to Salisbury to help in the investigation into the attempted murder of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter. The personnel - from the Army, Royal Marines and RAF - are experts in chemical warfare and decontamination. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition after being exposed to a nerve agent. Home Secretary Amber Rudd will chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, on Saturday. She has described Sunday's attack as ""outrageous"". Those deployed include instructors from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre and the 29 Explosive Ordnance Group, who are experts in bomb disposal. Eighteen vehicles have also been sent. Russian spy: What we know so far What are nerve agents? State TV anchor warns 'traitors' Members of the military were seen covering over a police car that has been at Salisbury Hospital since Sunday, before men dressed in white hazardous materials suits examined it. It was later towed away from the hospital, covered by a tarpaulin, on the back of an Army truck. Officers are also expected to secure Mr Skripal's car. The police car was towed away from the hospital on an Army truck Specialist officers have also put up a tent over the grave of Mr Skripal's son, who died last year, at Salisbury cemetery. The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance ""to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene"", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims. The public should not be alarmed and there is no evidence to suggest a wide public health risk at this time, the police added. The military personnel in Salisbury are mostly from the Army, but also from the Royal Marines and RAF Military personnel were pictured making preparations at Winterbourne Gunner, Wiltshire, before deployment to Salisbury Valery Morozov, a Russian exile, told BBC News that Mr Skripal was working in cyber security. The former Russian military security colonel and his daughter remain in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday -  is conscious but ""very anxious"" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said Mr Bailey was in a serious but stable condition. Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. Former Russian military security colonel Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent Some of the 180 military personnel who have been sent to help the investigation are specialists in chemical biological radiological and nuclear (CBRN) warfare. They include Falcon Squadron from the Royal Tank Regiment, which uses specialist Fuchs vehicles - effectively mobile laboratories - to carry out tests and decontamination. ""Sensitive Site Exploitation"" will look for any further traces of the nerve agent. Royal Marines from 40 Commando have also just completed the UK's biggest chemical warfare exercise -  called Toxic Dagger - involving 300 personnel and including scientists from Porton Down. The existence of these units - some of which had suffered under defence cuts - highlights a growing concern in the military about the use of chemical weapons by individuals, terrorist groups and ""rogue states"". But the public is being told not to be alarmed. Many of the military personnel will be working behind the scenes and helping the police with relatively straightforward tasks, such as securing sites and removing objects, including ambulances, for decontamination. Ms Rudd visited some of the sites cordoned off by counter-terrorism police in Salisbury on Friday. She also visited Salisbury District Hospital where Mr Skripal, his daughter, and Mr Bailey are being treated. The home secretary, who met Mr Bailey in hospital, would not give any further details of the nerve agent used or how it was administered. This video can not be played Valery Morozov: ""Skripal and Putin are both targets"" Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a ""spy swap"". Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair said the ""extraordinary attack in Salisbury"" is a good reason to investigate whether there is a pattern of former British intelligence collaborators dying in the UK. This video can not be played Amber Rudd praises Salisbury police response Former First Sea Lord and security minister Lord West said: ""If it is a nation which has done it, it is completely unacceptable. It's almost like an act of war. ""To actually allow something like a nerve agent to be used in another country for some reason is outrageous."" Russian foreign ministerSergei Lavrov has denied his country's involvement in the attempted murder of the ex-spy. This video can not be played BBC Rewind looks back at cases of high-profile Russians targeted on foreign soil The attempted murder of Mr Skripal has drawn comparisons to the2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinenko,who ingested the rare and highly radioactive Polonium 210 in London. On Tuesday Labour MP Yvette Cooper asked the home secretary to review 14 other deaths that had not been treated as suspicious by UK police, but havereportedly been identified by US intelligence sources as being connected to the Russian state.,external Ms Rudd has refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on ""facts, not rumour"".

Bercow among MPs named in bullying claimsSpeaker John Bercow and two other MPs deny claims they mistreated Commons employees.3h3 hours agoUK Politics,"Complaints that MPs bullied, harassed and intimidated House of Commons staff have been uncovered in an investigation by BBC Two's Newsnight. Female workers described aggressive and threatening behaviour, saying complaints were not taken seriously. Among those accused of bullying was Speaker John Bercow, whose private secretary left her job in 2011. His spokeswoman rejects the allegation he behaved in such a manner, ""either eight years ago, or at any other time"". ""Any suggestion to the contrary is simply untrue,"" he said. The House of Commons said it did not tolerate bullying or harassment, however Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson called for a ""thorough, independent investigation"". Newsnight has been investigating claims of bullying and harassment by MPs of members of the House of Commons Service - a group commonly known in Westminster as ""clerks"". It found that women working in the House said they had been pushed against walls, forcibly kissed, groped and slapped by MPs. They told Newsnight their complaints had not been taken seriously, and that they fear that when complaints are made it is the clerks who are made to move jobs while the MPs are left in place. Since 2014, when the current HR processes were introduced, no complaints raised by staff members have been escalated to formal channels, such as mediation. One of the stories that emerged was that of Kate Emms - who worked as a private secretary to Mr Bercow, starting in mid-2010. Colleagues who spoke to Newsnight claimed that Mr Bercow, who is also the MP for Buckingham, had shouted at her and undermined her in front of other staff. This left her unable to continue working in what was a key Commons post, they said. She was signed off sick in early 2011 and then returned to a new post elsewhere in Parliament. Commons authorities were told that she had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. This video can not be played ""It wasn't so much harassment that damaged my career, it was reporting it"" Two other MPs named in the investigation were Labour's Paul Farrelly and Conservative Mark Pritchard. Witnesses told Newsnight that Mr Farrelly's continued criticism over several years of Emily Commander, a clerk on two committees that the MP sat on, made her job impossible. One witness recalled his behaviour on a science committee trip to Italy in 2004, saying: ""He was a complete and utter bully. ""He wound her up like a screw and reduced her to tears. The more he upset her, the more he enjoyed it, the more he kept turning the screw. He was very aggressive. It felt like no one had the ability or authority to intervene. Everybody knew it was wrong."" The two crossed paths again when Mr Farrelly was on the culture, media and sport committee in 2010. Paul Farrelly has been the Labour MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme since 2001 Documents obtained by Newsnight show she complained then of a campaign of continual belittling and undermining and that she told her bosses that she had ""repeated nightmares about going on Committee visits with Mr Farrelly and being criticised by him for having neglected tiny details"". Newsnight also spoke to several clerks about Mr Pritchard, MP for the Wrekin, who say he was notorious for shouting at and berating clerks. One witness told how he ""exploded"" at a female staff member ahead of a trip to California because he was unhappy with the choice of hotel he had been booked into. He then angrily swore at the same woman on the trip itself. Mr Farrelly and Mr Pritchard have denied all allegations against them. Conservative Mark Pritchard has represented The Wrekin since May 2005 Mr Farrelly told Newsnight: ""In 2012 allegations were made about me having bullied a clerk to the committee during the compilation of the phone-hacking report. These allegations were investigated and not upheld."" ""Despite this, I apologised if I had inadvertently upset the clerk who had suffered stress. The policy under which they were investigated was considered to be so unfair to those complained about that it was immediately withdrawn and replaced by another policy."" Mr Pritchard said: ""I understand, over the past several years the House authorities have addressed numerous complaints about MPs, but they have also informed me they have no record of any complaints against me, and if they had, I would have been notified."" Writing on Twitter,,externalLabour MP Jess Phillips, said Commons staff had told her of similar experiences and the claims ""must be investigated, independently and fairly"". Allow Twitter content?

Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson also called for the allegations to be thoroughly investigated. She told Newsnight the claims raised ""very significant questions"" about the Respect policy, which was designed to prevent bullying and harassment by MPs and their staff. Ms Swinson, a member of the cross-party working group on an independent complaints and grievance policy, said the suggestion was Parliament ""doesn't have modern and professional standards... [and] many MPs see themselves as above other members of staff"". The House of Commons said in a statement: ""The House of Commons takes pride in being a responsible and supportive employer, and does not tolerate bullying or harassment of any kind."" It added the House had introduced the revised Respect policy in 2014, which aimed to combat bullying and harassment by MPs or their staff. The House said several measures had been put in place alongside the policy including training managers on how to address reports of bullying or harassment and a team of trained contacts for staff to approach if they have concerns.

Burger-flipping robot takes time offThe automated cook has been switched off while upgrades are prepared to help it cook more quickly.16m16 minutes agoTechnology,"This video can not be played WATCH: Flippy the burger robot gets to work Flippy the burger-flipping robot that started work this week in a California restaurant has been forced to take a break because it was too slow. The robot was installed at a Cali Burger outlet in Pasadena and replaced human cooks. But after just one day at work the robot has been taken offline so it can be upgraded to work faster. Its human helpers are also getting extra training to help the robot keep up with demand. USA Today reported thatthe robot was still in place behind the grill,externalat the burger joint but was switched off. A sign said the robot would be ""cooking soon"" but gave no date for when it would once again be flipping hamburger patties. The robot is believed to have been given time off because news about it spread widely, and led to more interest and orders than the restaurant could handle. In a statement Miso Robotics, which made Flippy, said it was testing the code that controls the robot to ensure that it can cook quickly enough to fulfil orders at peak times. Prior to starting work, Flippy was said to be capable of cooking up to 2,000 burgers a day. Quiz: What's Meghan Markle done this week? Amazon promises fix for creepy Alexa laugh KFC returns to former chicken distributor Cali Burger said it was also working with staff to show them the best way to prepare and place the raw patties and other ingredients in its burgers to ensure Flippy works as fast as possible. Anthony Lomelino, head of technology at Cali Burger, told USA Today that kitchen staff needed to learn to ""choreograph"" their movements around the motions of the mobile, spatula-fitted arm which Flippy uses to cook. Cali said that it started to use the robot to get around the problems it has recruiting staff. The high turnover rate among staff in fast-food restaurants meant it often spent time and money training people to prepare food only to have them leave after a few months. Eventually, said the chain, burger-flipping robots will be installed in up to 50 of its restaurants. Burger-flipping robot begins first shift.

Russia 'willing to help' spy attack inquiry,"Former Russian military security colonel Sergei Skripal, right, and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday Russia was not involved in the attempted murder of an ex-spy and is willing to help with a UK inquiry, the country's foreign minister has said. Sergei Lavrov said Russia has not yet been approached by UK authorities investigating the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the pair remained in a ""very serious"" condition. Ms Rudd is visiting Salisbury, where they were exposed to a nerve agent in an ""outrageous"" attack on Sunday.

State TV anchor warns 'traitors' On Thursday afternoon there was a ""flurry of activity"" in Salisbury as investigators wearing protective suits went into Mr Skripal's house, as they try to ascertain where the pair were exposed to the nerve agent.

Three-year pay deal for NHS staff 'close',"NHS chiefs and health unions in England are understood to be close to agreeing a three-year pay deal. Talks on an award for all health staff - except for doctors and dentists - are said to be constructive and going well. The government has already said it would scrap the 1% cap on public sector pay, with the chancellor indicating more funding for higher wages. Health unions are keen to negotiate a pay deal well above the cap imposed by ministers in recent years. But BBC health editor Hugh Pym says he understands that the Department of Health and Social Care, and NHS Employers - the group representing healthcare bosses - are concerned about recruitment problems and ready to agree an award that makes up some of the lost ground. It is believed that there have been positive talks between the two sides and a deal is not far off. But reports of a 6.5% pay award over three years in return for NHS staff losing a day's holiday have been described as premature. Any outline agreement between the two sides will need final approval from ministers. The Treasury has indicated that in return for extra money to fund the pay deal some updating of working practices may be required. In September, unions representing nurses and other NHS staff wrote to the chancellor to demand a 3.9% pay rise and an extra Â£800 to make up for the ""cut"" they had seen in recent years. They said pay has fallen by 15% since 2010 once inflation is taken into account. It came after ministers agreed to give police officers a 1% rise plus a 1% bonus, with prison officers getting a 1.7% rise - both funded from existing budgets. NHS workers demand 3.9% pay rise NHS Budget plan not enough, say bosses NHS 'short of vital front-line staff' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

UK ministers in power bid on devolved areas,"This video can not be played David Lidington said: ""What will not help is to have different sets of food labelling or food hygiene safety regulations."" The UK government has named 24 devolved areas where it wants to temporarily retain power following Brexit. Ministers in the Scottish and Welsh governments want subjects such as food labelling and animal welfare to come under their control. However, UK ministers are bidding to oversee those areas, andothers on the list,external, when the UK leaves the EU. The Scottish government has accused the UK government of a power grab and has introduced its own Brexit legislation. Ministers at Westminster insist that ""the vast majority of powers returning from Brussels will start off in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast"". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, who is conducting talks with the devolved governments, said: ""There is a much smaller group of powers where the devolved governments will be required to follow current EU laws for a little bit longer while we work out a new UK approach."" The 24 policy areas expected to require a UK legislative approach for a temporary period include: Animal health and traceability Food and feed safety and hygiene law Food labelling Chemical regulation Mr Lidington told BBC Scotland that if these policy areas were not incorporated into UK-wide frameworks then there would be a loss of jobs and ""probably a higher price for consumers"". He explained: ""What will not help either customers or producers is to have different sets of food labelling or food hygiene or safety regulations in different parts of the UK. ""All that does is add to costs, loss of jobs amongst producers and it leads to less choice, probably a higher price for consumers. ""The same applies with manufacturers, if you're a paint manufacturer in Wales you've got to stick to some chemical standards in producing your paint, but you want those to be the same as the paint standards in Scotland or Northern Ireland because you are a customer there. It just makes sense that we do so much trade in internal borders in the UK that we have a set of common sense rules agreed. ""I hope between the different governments, laid out in legislation, that means producers and consumers will benefit."" First Ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones are due to hold talks with the prime minister next week. Both the Scottish and Welsh governments have produced plans for continuity bills as a fallback option to deal with legal uncertainties caused by Brexit if they cannot agree to consent to the UK government's legislation. Responding to the publication, Scottish Brexit minister Mike Russell said: ""This list simply confirms the UK government's plans for a power grab. ""Under the EU Withdrawal Bill the UK will have the right to take control of any of the powers on this list. ""However, the publication of the categories demonstrates the threat is most immediate in key devolved areas such as agriculture, GM crops, fishing, environmental policy, public procurement, food standards and a range of other areas. ""Unless the bill is changed Westminster could soon be in control of these policies amounting to a major power grab and a re-writing of the devolution settlement the people of Scotland voted for so decisively."" The UK government's analysis paper, which was published on Friday, detailed 49 policy areas where no further action was required; 82 policy areas where non-legislative common frameworks might be required and 24 policy areas that are ""subject to more detailed discussion to explore whether legislative common framework arrangements might be needed, in whole or in part"".

Row erupts over Frida Kahlo Barbie doll,"Frida Kahlo is in a new Barbie range launched by Mattel this week - to coincide with International Women's Day - celebrating ""Inspiring Women"" A row has broken out between relatives of the late Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and the corporation which claims it holds the rights to her image. It comes after the toy company Mattel launched a range of new Barbie dolls based on ""Inspiring Women"" - Kahlo among them. In a statement, the family insisted Mattel was not authorised to base a doll on Kahlo. But both the Frida Kahlo Corporation and Mattel have rejected the claims. The artist with the famous unibrow was famous for her self-portraits and became a feminist icon. Since she died in 1954, her image has generated an array of consumer products, from tequila to lip gloss. This is not the first time that the commercial activities of the Frida Kahlo Corporation are said to have angered some of Kahlo's descendants. ""Mrs Mara Romeo, great-niece of Frida Kahlo, is the sole owner of the rights of the image of the illustrious Mexican painter Frida Kahlo,"" the family said in a statement. Frida Kahlo broke boundaries and challenged norms - and later spawned an array of consumer products Mrs Romeo told AFP news agency that the problem was not confined to image rights. ""I would have liked the doll to have traits more like Frida's, not this doll with light-coloured eyes,"" she said. But Mattel said the company had the correct permission to produce the likeness. ""Mattel has worked in close partnership with the Frida Kahlo Corporation, the owner of all rights related to the name and identity of Frida Kahlo, on the creation of this doll,"" a spokesperson said. ""In addition to the Frida Kahlo Corporation being an important part of the doll development process, we have their permission and a legally binding agreement to make a doll in the likeness of the great Frida Kahlo."" Mattel also provided a statement from the Frida Kahlo Corporation in which it said it derived its rights to reproduce Kahlo's image from Kahlo's niece, Isolda Pinedo Kahlo.

"UK parents help less with homeworkAn international survey says UK parents value teachers, but put in fewer hours supporting lessons at home.7h7 hours agoFamily & Education","Parents in the UK admire their children's teachers, but they are too busy to help with the homework Parents in the UK are much less likely to spend more than an hour per day helping with their children's homework compared with parents in other countries, a survey suggests. A survey of 27,830 parents in 29 countries found only 11% of UK parents spent an hour per day helping their children, far behind 62% in India. But 87% of UK parents valued the quality of their children's teachers. This was among the highest levels of any of the surveyed countries. Kenyan parents had the most positive view of their teachers, with 92% rating them as good. The survey, commissioned by the Varkey Foundation, which organises the annual Global Teacher Prize, has compared the attitudes and priorities of parents in a range of different countries. There were many common attitudes - with parents concerned about whether their children would get good jobs and careers. But in terms of worries about their children's future, parents in the UK were well above average in being concerned about terrorism and conflict, a pattern also seen in France and Germany. When deciding on the type of school they wanted for their children, UK parents prioritised a sense of ""ethos"" and high academic results. But compared with other countries, parents in the UK were also likely to put a high emphasis on ""happiness"" for children in school. Poor pupils get less tutoring and homework help - study Is homework really necessary? Scottish primary school stops setting homework Why do Finnish pupils succeed with less homework? Parents in countries such as China and Vietnam were much less likely to make happiness a priority, with greater concern for the quality of teaching. In terms of funding, parents in the UK said they would put any extra education budget into hiring and paying teachers, rather than technology or facilities. In terms of optimism over whether schools are better than a decade ago, countries such as China, India, South Korea and Vietnam were much more likely to think schools had improved. But parents in France, Germany, Italy and the UK were more likely to be pessimistic and see schools as slipping backwards. Vikas Pota, chief executive of the Varkey Foundation, said that despite pressure on school budgets it is ""heartening to see that parents are among the most confident in the world about the quality of teaching in their child's school"". But he said it was ""sobering"" that parents in the UK are ""spending so little time helping their child with their education - lagging behind almost every other country we surveyed"".

Strange optics of announcement,"The three South Koreans strode across the lawn to meet reporters to deliver the statement When South Korea's national security adviser stood on the front lawn of the White House and delivered the news that North Korea's Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump would meet by May, a piece of history was made. But analyst Ankit Panda's dissection of that moment and the extraordinary statement shows that all may not be as it seems. There was something profoundly odd about the optics of this announcement. Three South Koreans - National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong, Suh Hoon the top spy chief, and the ambassador to the US Cho Yoon-je - stood shoulder-to-shoulder speaking to eagerly-gathered reporters outside the West Wing. Without any American officials present, it very much placed this entire diplomatic initiative in South Korea's hands. One could easily walk away sensing that the United States wasn't entirely enthusiastic about this endeavour. It followed a curious and historic week of Korean peninsula news showing that shuttle diplomacy is back in a big way, with the South Koreans in the driver's seat. This video can not be played Chung Eui-yong addresses news conference Two of the South Koreans on the White House lawn, Mr Chung and Mr Suh,had just been received by reclusive North Korean leader himself, before speedily making their way to the US where they briefly met President Trump. Analysis: The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting in full Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? Following that meeting, Mr Chung delivered another statement, outside the West Wing of the White House, on a street with a gaggle of eager reporters before him. In this he announced - on behalf of Donald Trump - thatthe US president would accept an invitation to meet the North Korean leader. In the span of just three days, South Korean envoys had spoken for Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump on both sides of the world. This is what Mr Chung read to reporters: 1. ""Today I had the privilege of briefing President Trump on my recent visit to North Korea. I'd like to thank President Trump, the vice-president and his wonderful national security team including my close friend General McMaster."" The South Koreans briefed Mr Trump days after their meeting in Pyongyang Mr Chung will meet Gen HR McMaster on Friday to presumably hammer out a path forward. It's notable that the US national security adviser chose not to accompany his counterpart, creating the awkward optics of the South Koreans going it alone in arranging the US-North Korea summit. 2. ""I explained to President Trump that his leadership and his maximum pressure policy together with international solidarity brought us to this  juncture. I expressed President Moon Jae-in's personal gratitude for President Trump's leadership."" The South Koreans have realised that Trump responds well to flattery. Seoul has to acknowledge the US-backed policy of ""maximum pressure"", which has produced at least some results.Kim Jong-un acknowledged the biting effect of sanctions during his New Year's Day address- the same speech where he extended the Winter Olympics olive branch to the South. 3. ""I told President Trump that in our meeting, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he is committed to denuclearisation. Kim pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests."" This is repetition of what Mr Chung had announced in Seoul on his return from Pyongyang. Mr Chung, however, did not repeat that Mr Kim included a conditional in his offer to denuclearise, which is that his regime's security would have to be assured. The North Koreans have also long called for the end of the United States' ""hostile policy"" toward them, which may include the departure of US troops from South Korea. What missiles does North Korea have? North Korea: Does a nuclear test mean war? Are North and South Korea friends again? 4. ""He understands that the routine joint military exercise between the Republic of Korea and the United States must continue and he expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible."" This is an important assurance in the context of the US-South Korea alliance, but it's a highly uncharacteristic statement from a North Korean leader. Pyongyang's behaviour once the postponed exercises - which infuriate the North - begin on 31 March will be far more telling of its actual feelings about the exercises. Last year, North Korea conducted multiple ballistic missile launches during this period. The image of the envoys with North Koreans in Pyongyang earlier this week marked the beginning of a week of shuttle diplomacy 5. ""President Trump appreciated the briefing and said he would meet Kim Jong-un by May to achieve permanent denuclearisation."" This is where the headlines have focused and it is the big piece of substantively new information in Mr Chung's announcement in Washington. A venue and an agenda are both left ambiguous - presumably for the United States and North Korea to hammer out in the coming weeks. 6. ""The Republic of Korea, the United States and our many partners around the world remain fully and resolutely committed to the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Along with President Trump we are optimistic about continuing a diplomatic process to test the possibility of a peaceful resolution. ""The Republic of Korea, the United States, and our partners stand together in insisting that we not repeat the mistakes of the past, and that the pressure will continue until North Korea matches his words with concrete actions. Thank you."" Mr Chung's statement concludes with optimistic boilerplate, but noticeably does not include any affirmation of the alliance with the United States directly. The US is grouped along with ""partners"". Curiously, he refers to Kim Jong-un's ""words"", even though all of North Korea's words regarding this supposed diplomatic breakthrough have come through South Korea. The announcement is undoubtedly significant and a Trump-Kim summit would make the history books, but it's far from clear that North Korea has committed to what South Korea has assured the United States it has committed to, or that Washington is ready for a productive diplomatic process with Pyongyang.

US chided over hefty import tariffs,"Angela Merkel says she is concerned about President Trump's decision to impose new tariffs German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for the European Union to be exempted from new US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. ""The best option would be [for the EU] to be excluded,"" she told business leaders gathered in Munich. Ms Merkel warned that no one could win a ""race to the bottom"" and said the tariffs risked ""hurting everyone"". President Donald Trump says the US has suffered from ""unfair trade"" and that the tariffs will boost industry. The import duties - 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium - will go into effect in 15 days, although Canada and Mexico will be exempt while negotiations continue over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). What links Trump, Lincoln and Ferris Bueller? Why Trump is hanging tough on trade Five reasons Why trade wars aren't easy to win Mr Trump signed the declaration in a White House ceremony attended by American workers from both industries. This video can not be played Why is Trump envious of Merkel? China'ssteel and metals associations demanded retaliation, urging the government to target US imports including coal, agricultural products and electronics. Japansaid the import duties would have a ""big impact"" on bilateral ties, whileSouth Koreathreatened to take the issue to the World Trade Organization. Canada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminium to the US, welcomed its exemption but said it would continue to press Washington to drop the tariffs. Mexico'sEconomy Minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, insisted the tariffs could not be linked to talks on Nafta. TheEUis seeking talks on the issue and has denounced the tariffs. European Commissioner Jyrki Katainen called for an exemption, and insisted that EU companies were ""not a source of unfair trade"". TheUKgovernment said it would work with EU partners to consider ""the scope for exemptions"" while ""robustly"" supporting UK industries. DutchPrime Minister Mark Rutte said Mr Trump's tariff decision was ""very disappointing"". He warned that the Netherlands was prepared to take ""counter-measures"". AustralianPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the US could have ""no complaints"" about their bilateral trading relationship and his government would be ""relentless"" in pursuing an exemption from the tariffs. This video can not be played Trump tariffs: Three takeaways on trade bombshell There was strong opposition from within Mr Trump's own Republican Party, which is traditionally in favour of free trade. US House Speaker Paul Ryan denounced the new measures and said he feared ""unintended consequences"". Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he believed the president had been ""misled"" by those advising him at the White House. Another Republican Senator,  Jeff Flake,  said he would draft and introduce a bill to nullify the tariffs, adding: ""I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy."" However, those who backed Mr Trump's move included Democratic Senator Joe Manchin who said it was ""past time to defend our interests, our security and our workers in the global economy"". In his election campaign, Mr Trump pledged to protect American workers and to rebuild the steel and aluminium industries. The two metals are ""the backbone of our nation... the bedrock of our defence-industrial base"", the president said at Thursday's signing ceremony. Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? ""Our greatest presidents from [George] Washington, to [Andrew] Jackson, to [Abraham] Lincoln, to [William] McKinley and others - they protected our country from outside influence, from other countries coming in and stealing our wealth and stealing our jobs and stealing our companies,"" he said. ""And we're going to be very fair, we're going to be very flexible, but we're going to protect the American worker, as I said I would do in my campaign."" Correspondents say Mr Trump is aiming to appeal to blue-collar voters in states such as Pennsylvania who turned away from the Democrats to support him in 2016. This video can not be played Trump laughs off awkward slip-up with steelworkers Mr Trump has said that the US would ""win big"" in any trade war. Some countries are likely to take the US to court, arguing that the decision violates World Trade Organization rules. The White House, however, says that the national security rationale for the move is ""unassailable"" and national security considerations are allowed under WTO rules. The director of UK Steel said the tariffs would have a profound and detrimental impact on the UK steel sector. ""Imposing such measures on US allies in the name of national security is difficult to comprehend,"" Gareth Stace added.

Ministers question 'latte levy' on cups,"A proposal to impose a so-called latte levy on throwaway coffee cups has been questioned by the government. MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC)had suggested a charge of 25pfor disposable coffee cups to reduce their use. But ministers say it is better for shops to offer voluntary discounts to customers bringing their own cups. The EAC says the government's response suggests it is not serious about its promise to tackle plastic litter. Committee chairwoman Mary Creagh said: ""The UK's throwaway culture is having a devastating impact on our streets, beaches and seas. Our report recommended practical solutions to the disposable packaging crisis. Four ideas to tackle coffee cup waste ""The government's response shows that despite warm words they plan no real action."" She said evidence to the committee showed charges work better than discounts for reducing the use of non-recyclable materials - as was the case with the plastic bag charge. ""By choosing to favour voluntary discounts, the government is ignoring the evidence about what works,"" she said. The government said it was serious about the issue - but did not want to jump to hasty conclusions. This video can not be played Some fear the cost of the levy will be passed on to the consumer Addressing the EAC's view that charges were more effective than discounts, the government acknowledged that the 5p cost of plastic bags had resulted in fewer being sold. This was the kind of incentive it ""could consider"". But it added: ""We are pleased that major coffee retail chains are taking action to reduce single-use coffee cups by offering discounts to customers with reusable cups and are putting in place the infrastructure to ensure cups can be collected for recycling. ""The government would like to see this service offered by all businesses selling disposable coffee cups."" In its response, it also said: ""Coffee cups make up 0.7% of total paper packaging waste in the UK. We believe it is important to look at the packaging and waste management system as a whole."" The government did signal an intent to reform what's known as the ""producer responsibility"" system in which packaging firms chip in towards the cost of recycling technology. A report this week from the waste consultancy Eunomia said the industry was exaggerating the waste it recycles and paying far too little towards the Â£2.8bn cost to households of collecting and dealing with waste. Many of the large coffee shop chains in the UK nowoffer customers incentivesto use reusable cups rather than the throwaway kind. Pret a Manger for example offers a 50p discount while Costa Coffee and Starbucks will knock 25p off. But studies suggest people are more likely to respond to extra charges, for example the plastic bag charge, than they are to discounts. With this in mind, Starbucks is also running a three month trial in some of its central London stores charging those using throwaway cups an extra 5p. Other possible alternatives includemaking the throwaway cups easier to recycle or creating edible ones. The National Audit Office is launching a review of the government's oversight of the system, following a request from the Environmental Audit Committee, which has concerns that it is opaque, and could be subject to fraud and non-compliance. The government said the idea of a latte tax would be considered as part of a call for evidence on single-use plastics. That initiative was promised by the chancellor in the autumn budget but it hasn't happened yet.

UK parents help less with homework,"Parents in the UK admire their children's teachers, but they are too busy to help with the homework Parents in the UK are much less likely to spend more than an hour per day helping with their children's homework compared with parents in other countries, a survey suggests. A survey of 27,830 parents in 29 countries found only 11% of UK parents spent an hour per day helping their children, far behind 62% in India. But 87% of UK parents valued the quality of their children's teachers. This was among the highest levels of any of the surveyed countries. Kenyan parents had the most positive view of their teachers, with 92% rating them as good. The survey, commissioned by the Varkey Foundation, which organises the annual Global Teacher Prize, has compared the attitudes and priorities of parents in a range of different countries. There were many common attitudes - with parents concerned about whether their children would get good jobs and careers. But in terms of worries about their children's future, parents in the UK were well above average in being concerned about terrorism and conflict, a pattern also seen in France and Germany. When deciding on the type of school they wanted for their children, UK parents prioritised a sense of ""ethos"" and high academic results. But compared with other countries, parents in the UK were also likely to put a high emphasis on ""happiness"" for children in school. Poor pupils get less tutoring and homework help - study Is homework really necessary? Scottish primary school stops setting homework Why do Finnish pupils succeed with less homework? Parents in countries such as China and Vietnam were much less likely to make happiness a priority, with greater concern for the quality of teaching. In terms of funding, parents in the UK said they would put any extra education budget into hiring and paying teachers, rather than technology or facilities. In terms of optimism over whether schools are better than a decade ago, countries such as China, India, South Korea and Vietnam were much more likely to think schools had improved. But parents in France, Germany, Italy and the UK were more likely to be pessimistic and see schools as slipping backwards. Vikas Pota, chief executive of the Varkey Foundation, said that despite pressure on school budgets it is ""heartening to see that parents are among the most confident in the world about the quality of teaching in their child's school"". But he said it was ""sobering"" that parents in the UK are ""spending so little time helping their child with their education - lagging behind almost every other country we surveyed"".

Poor rural Victorians 'had best diet',"Locally-produced potatoes would have been a staple in Victorian times Poor, rural societies which ate high-quality foods bought locally had the best diet and health in mid-Victorian Britain, a new report has revealed. The healthiest regions, measured by low mortality rates, were often the most isolated. In those areas, people would have consumed plenty of locally-produced potatoes, whole grains, vegetables, fish and milk. There were also fewer deaths there from pulmonary tuberculosis. This suggests people had better diets, the researchers writing inJRSM Open,externalsuggest. They found the most nutritious diets were enjoyed in isolated, rural areas of England, the mainland and islands of Scotland and the west of Ireland - which was at that time part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. How to eat like a Victorian Dripping, apples and milk: Making curry the Victorian way Victorian-inspired toast sandwich UK's 'cheapest meal' Dr Peter Greaves, study author from the Leicester Cancer Research Centre, said: ""The fact that these better-fed regions of Britain also showed lower mortality rates is entirely consistent with recent studies that have shown a decreased risk of death, following improvement towards a higher Mediterranean dietary standard. ""The rural diet was often better for the poor in more isolated areas because of payment in kind, notably in grain, potatoes, meat, milk or small patches of land to grow vegetables or to keep animals. Isolated communities in rural England had some of the best diets ""Unfortunately, these societies were in the process of disappearing under the pressure of urbanisation, commercial farming and migration."" Dr Greaves said these changes in Victorian society led to worse diets among poor, rural populations and resulted in locally-produced food becoming less diverse - something that has since occurred across the world. Coca-Cola to launch alcoholic drink Oldest message in a bottle found on beach First UK polar bear cub in 25 years emerges In the middle of the 19th Century, fewer than half of the near 19 million people in England and Wales were living in large urban centres. Among the three million population of Scotland, only one million lived in town districts, while fewer than 30% of the 5.5 million population of Ireland was urban. For many poor people across Britain, white bread made from bolted wheat flour was the staple component of the diet. When they could afford it, people would supplement this with vegetables, fruit and animal-derived foods such as meat, fish, milk, cheese and eggs - a Mediterranean-style diet. Poor people living in wealthier farming districts who were usually paid in cash often had great difficulty getting these foods on a regular basis, but in more isolated areas of Britain milk and fish were more accessible. A good number of country dwellers lived to ripe old ages, the researchers said. In the poor rural districts of Connaught in the west of Ireland, for example, nearly 20% of people reached the age of 65 or more and some reached the age of 95 or even 100.

""The government would like to see this service offered by all businesses selling disposable coffee cups."" In its response, it also said: ""Coffee cups make up 0.7% of total paper packaging waste in the UK. We believe it is important to look at the packaging and waste management system as a whole."" The government did signal an intent to reform what's known as the ""producer responsibility"" system in which packaging firms chip in towards the cost of recycling technology. A report this week from the waste consultancy Eunomia said the industry was exaggerating the waste it recycles and paying far too little towards the Â£2.8bn cost to households of collecting and dealing with waste. Many of the large coffee shop chains in the UK nowoffer customers incentivesto use reusable cups rather than the throwaway kind. Pret a Manger for example offers a 50p discount while Costa Coffee and Starbucks will knock 25p off. But studies suggest people are more likely to respond to extra charges, for example the plastic bag charge, than they are to discounts. With this in mind, Starbucks is also running a three month trial in some of its central London stores charging those using throwaway cups an extra 5p. Other possible alternatives includemaking the throwaway cups easier to recycle or creating edible ones. The National Audit Office is launching a review of the government's oversight of the system, following a request from the Environmental Audit Committee, which has concerns that it is opaque, and could be subject to fraud and non-compliance. The government said the idea of a latte tax would be considered as part of a call for evidence on single-use plastics. That initiative was promised by the chancellor in the autumn budget but it hasn't happened yet.

Imagine being blind and crashing at 70mph," By Beth Rose, BBC Ouch:PyeongChang Conditions are good. Nineteen-year-old Millie Knight is preparing for a race that will see her hit speeds of 115km/h (71mph). Registered blind, she will rely on her guide, Brett Wild, to talk her down the mountain. They are a team. Fist bump. Ritual. A whispered chant from Irish band, The Script: “You could be the greatest, you can be the best, you can be the King Kong banging on your chest.” Into the gates. “Three, two, one.” Wild pushes off. “Go.” Knight follows. The mountain falls away. The cut of skis on snow and the intense exchange of instructions is all that can be heard as Wild shouts out the course. Spectators stand silent, forbidden to make noise. Knight only has 5% vision. It is peripheral and blurry but she catches glints of Wild’s orange jacket, which keeps her on track. Twists and turns. Rhythmic. And then the final stretch, downhill, skis straight, body tucked. All out until they're over the line. The mountain's silence is broken by cheering. Knight and Wild have become champions in the World Para Alpine Skiing Championships. It's a first for Britain at such an event. But Knight fails to stop. She crashes at 115km/h. “I heard her on the comms screaming,” says Wild. “I looked back and could tell instantly how bad it was. She was getting rag-dolled and there was blood all over the snow. She slid on the ice and it ripped her face.” Knight had skidded under an inflatable barrier, which re-inflated on top of her. “She was saying she couldn't breathe,” says Wild. Sports psychologist Kelley Fay watched the crash unfold. “Brett was frantic. Millie wouldn't have known what was happening,” she says. Knight was taken to hospital. Besides cuts and bruises, she was apparently unharmed and discharged in time for the medal ceremony. Knight's injuries The next day the pair returned to compete in the Super G - a form of slalom. But as psychologist Fay took up her position at the bottom of the course, she felt uneasy. “I knew Millie’s head wasn't in the right place,” she says. “So I radioed up and we pulled her out of the race. She was really cross, but in the end she could see we'd made the right decision for her.” It was the first sign that all was not well with the teenager. “We'd been skiing together for over a year and she'd never crashed,” says Wild. “Millie was known for staying on her feet.” That was January 2017. A month later, in South Korea at a test event for the Paralympics, the blind skier found herself in hospital again. “It was at the finish line again,” Knight says. “I flipped and landed on my head a couple of times and we were blue-lighted off to hospital.” A diagnosis of concussion would take her off the ski slopes. Recuperation included light gym sessions, but too much exertion could wipe her out for days. That's when fear crept in.” Knight's brain scan Unable to confront the mountains, the fear started to eat away at her. She threw herself into her school work - A-levels were looming - and her love of photography. Knight photographs people and movement - skiing rarely features - and often sells her work. “I take photos to see the world because the way I see it is very different,” she says. “It's almost like a new language to me. When I look through the camera I realise that's what everyone else sees.” Knight started to prepare for her first solo photography exhibition. But as hard as she focused, her mind kept replaying the crash. “I thought, ‘Have I lost this? Have I lost my bottle? Am I not going to be as good as I was?’” Knight had always been known for her fearlessness. She has skied since she was six - the same age that she was left with 5% vision. As a baby, an infection scarred the retina of her right eye. Five years later the sight was gone in her left eye, too. “I don't remember having sight,” she says. “It's not an event in my life and my mum never made a big deal about it.” “She was a massive skier, so she just put me into ski school and didn't tell them I couldn't see.” Knight stayed close to the instructor and became a natural follower on the snow. Millie Knight The family took annual ski holidays. It was something to create memories with and a chance to feel speed - after all, Knight would never ride a bike or drive a car. “I can see about two to three metres in front of me but it's unclear and foggy,” she says. “Within that, I don't really have depth perception, so I don't know how far away things are.” Millie Knight and her mother Suzanne In 2012, when she was 12, Knight attended the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics. “That was the moment I was like, ‘Wow I want to be one of those athletes.’” Back at home in Canterbury, she contacted Disability Snowsport UK and began to focus on ski training. Her mother Suzanne acted as her guide. At 13, Knight made it on to the UK development team and just two years later qualified for the Sochi Paralympics. She became ParalympicsGB's youngest Winter Games athlete and was nominated as flag-bearer to lead the team into the Fisht Olympic Stadium. Knight carries the flag “I was thinking, ‘Why am I here, it's crazy’. I was so starstruck,” she says. She was too young to compete in all the ski events but came fifth in the slalom and the giant slalom. After the Games, Knight’s guide retired from the sport to go to university. Good guides are hard to come by, partly because of the expense. Unless they are at the top of their game, guides pay their own way. Others retire due to injury. Over the following season, Knight went through eight guides. None was quite right. Then in 2016, Knight’s development coach Euan Bennett, heard about a young Royal Navy skier who had represented Scotland at a junior level and thought he’d be worth a trial. Brett Wild had joined the Royal Navy when he was 19. He grew up in Scotland where his dad managed Glasgow Ski Centre and his mum was an instructor. They put Wild on the snow aged three and he competed for Scotland as a teenager. He travelled the world to training camps and competitions and almost went full time in his final year of school. Brett Wild Bennett told Wild that as a guide, he would need to ski a couple of metres ahead of Knight, but they wouldn't be tethered. They would communicate via Bluetooth headsets. He would need to be proficient in five disciplines - Downhill, Super-G, Giant Slalom, Slalom and Super Combined, which is made up of one downhill run and a slalom event. Wild was up for it and flew to Austria for a trial. Knight was less sure. She had been used to older guides who took control and made decisions. Wild was just 23 and had no idea what he was doing. But he took to it quickly and easily. Knight and Wild As they descend a slope, Wild is expected to describe the terrain from the start gate to the finish line. A “steep here”, a “flatter” there, as well as the snow conditions - “bumpy”, “icy”, “soft”. He will also instruct Knight to turn at every gate for the rhythmical changes. If she can’t catch sight of his orange jacket in front of her, she will let him know by saying “off”. “I was told her life is in my hands and that she’s my responsibility until she has her skis off,” says Wild. After a week’s training, Knight threw Wild into the deep end by asking him to guide for her at an international competition in Aspen, Colorado, US. The Navy agreed Wild could go but only if he returned immediately for a nine-month tour of duty. Waiting for him in Aspen was Knight’s sports psychologist Kelley Fay. She wanted to ensure that her young charge would be in good hands. “I could see his potential but he was just a boy. So I pulled him aside and had a stern conversation with him about what he needed to do,” she says. “He said I frightened the life out of him, but I wanted him to hit the ground running.” The pep talk worked. By the end of the competition, the pair had picked up seven medals including three golds. “It was hard to get my head around,” Wild says. “The week before I was pleased to win a bronze medal at the Inter-Service Championships. Then I had three gold World Cup medals to bring home.” PyeongChang beckoned and the Navy agreed to release Wild for two years, on a reduced salary, to take Knight to the Winter Games. But the crash a year later in South Korea changed everything for Knight. With just over 12 months to go, the blind skier was gripped with the fear of racing down a mountainside. Her Paralympic hopes hung in the balance. “Before my crash, I was confident because I had nothing to fear. But afterwards I was thinking, ‘Why am I doing this if it is going to cause me injuries?’” “My performance is 80% psychological and 20% talent because when you’re standing there and you have that second of doubt - that's when things start to go wrong.” Psychologist Fay says Knight was the most confident ski racer she had worked with. “She wasn’t cocky but had a lot of self belief in what she could achieve. She had no anxiety before the crashes. “After the first one we got her on her skis very quickly but the second one meant she was removed from that ski world. That made this particularly difficult to overcome,” she says. Kelly Fay with Knight and Wild Fay spent up to 90 minutes a day with Knight. Sometimes they would talk during a 10-minute ski-lift ride to redirect Knight's thoughts before the next run, or discuss her body language to make her look and feel more confident. “You could see she was willing to do whatever it took, but whenever she put her speed skis on it just freaked her out,” Fay says. “Even when we were doing a gentle slope, she’d be saying ‘I can't do this’. She was that frightened. “That was when we knew it was very serious.” As time ticked away, they needed a breakthrough. Kelly speaks to Knight and Wild Fay accompanied Knight to Chile to the ParaGB training camp, in the hope she could establish where Knight's fear came from and why both crashes happened in the finish area. They started with the basics - how to stop. “The guys are 100% committed all the way down for speed. But the last few gates are normally straight, so a lot of them switch off because it's just ‘go go go’,” says Fay. “We worked a lot to make sure she was staying fully engaged until they were stopped, but even that didn’t take the fear away.” Then Fay had another idea - they would return to the site of the crash and face Knight's fears head-on. The trio went back to the exact spot where the crash happened, where Knight's confidence had been shattered. “It was about reprogramming my brain into thinking differently about it,” Knight says. “Changing my emotions towards it.” Fay says: “It was getting her to accept that this is speed racing, so there's an element of risk involved. But if we did A, B and C that would minimise it.” Knight and Wild Wild, naturally, blamed himself for the crash and Knight’s subsequent loss of confidence. As her guide he was meant to be her eyes. “I think of Millie as a little sister and I feel very protective of her,” he says. “I felt useless that I couldn’t help. All I could do was stay positive when she was losing belief in herself. There were times when she was upset and I didn't know what to do. “I tried to stay positive, but it was out of my control. The problems were in Millie’s head.” Knight's crash and loss of confidence had set them and their training back and they needed to make up ground on the snow. Knight weight training The got stuck into training. They needed to work on their trust and relationship both on and off the slopes. Daily training would begin at 05:00. They practised relentlessly, eradicating any potential for error “When I'm skiing all I can hear is Brett and his skis,” says Knight. “I'm only aware of following Brett's commands, I totally zone in and that's all I’m focused on.” Learning how to fall, gracefully. However, I'm not best known for being graceful, especially when it comes to falling...😬 A post shared byMillie Knight(@knight_millie) onAug 5, 2017 at 10:04am PDT In January 2018 news came through that the pair had made the GB team for PyeongChang. But the physical and mental hurdle of returning to the slopes in competition remained. Had Knight's fears finally be conquered? The pair were to find out at a pre-Games competition in Canada. They were faultless. Three bronze medals out of four. But the top accolade went to Knight and Wild’s team-mates - Menna Fitzpatrick and guide Jennifer Kehoe - who won two golds and a silver. Their fight back to the top was not yet over. Menna Fitzpatrick and guide Jennifer Kehoe “Canada was good,” says Wild. “I don't think it's exactly where we wanted to be, but we're now back in the mix. We were about a second off the fastest girl so we are close enough. It’s just whether we can bring it all together on race day.” But Knight saw it as proof her fears had dissipated. “I think now I'm much stronger mentally. When I think about my crash I smile, I don't think of it and get worried any more.” Knight and Wild A gold medal hangs in the balance. But so does the partnership the pair has effortlessly formed. The two years that Wild was granted by the Navy is almost up. He’s still part of the armed forces ski team but isn’t sure whether he will be allowed to continue working with Knight on another Paralympic cycle. A gold medal might just swing it - and keep the pair together. “I wouldn't want to follow anyone else down a mountain,” Knight says. “It would be devastating if we couldn’t ski together again.” Built with Shorthand"
Bercow among MPs named in bullying claims,"Complaints that MPs bullied, harassed and intimidated House of Commons staff have been uncovered in an investigation by BBC Two's Newsnight. Female workers described aggressive and threatening behaviour, saying complaints were not taken seriously.

The House of Commons said it did not tolerate bullying or harassment, however Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson called for a ""thorough, independent investigation"". Newsnight has been investigating claims of bullying and harassment by MPs of members of the House of Commons Service - a group commonly known in Westminster as ""clerks"". It found that women working in the House said they had been pushed against walls, forcibly kissed, groped and slapped by MPs. They told Newsnight their complaints had not been taken seriously, and that they fear that when complaints are made it is the clerks who are made to move jobs while the MPs are left in place. Since 2014, when the current HR processes were introduced, no complaints raised by staff members have been escalated to formal channels, such as mediation.

Colleagues who spoke to Newsnight claimed that Mr Bercow, who is also the MP for Buckingham, had shouted at her and undermined her in front of other staff.

Three-year pay deal for NHS staff 'close'Unions want a deal well above the 1% public sector pay cap imposed by ministers in recent years.9m9 minutes agoHealth,"NHS chiefs and health unions in England are understood to be close to agreeing a three-year pay deal. Talks on an award for all health staff - except for doctors and dentists - are said to be constructive and going well. The government has already said it would scrap the 1% cap on public sector pay, with the chancellor indicating more funding for higher wages. Health unions are keen to negotiate a pay deal well above the cap imposed by ministers in recent years. But BBC health editor Hugh Pym says he understands that the Department of Health and Social Care, and NHS Employers - the group representing healthcare bosses - are concerned about recruitment problems and ready to agree an award that makes up some of the lost ground. It is believed that there have been positive talks between the two sides and a deal is not far off. But reports of a 6.5% pay award over three years in return for NHS staff losing a day's holiday have been described as premature. Any outline agreement between the two sides will need final approval from ministers. The Treasury has indicated that in return for extra money to fund the pay deal some updating of working practices may be required. In September, unions representing nurses and other NHS staff wrote to the chancellor to demand a 3.9% pay rise and an extra Â£800 to make up for the ""cut"" they had seen in recent years. They said pay has fallen by 15% since 2010 once inflation is taken into account. It came after ministers agreed to give police officers a 1% rise plus a 1% bonus, with prison officers getting a 1.7% rise - both funded from existing budgets. NHS workers demand 3.9% pay rise NHS Budget plan not enough, say bosses NHS 'short of vital front-line staff' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Imagine being blind and crashing at 70mphMillie Knight is a blind skier who hopes to win Winter Paralympic gold in PyeongChang.," By Beth Rose, BBC Ouch:PyeongChang Conditions are good. Nineteen-year-old Millie Knight is preparing for a race that will see her hit speeds of 115km/h (71mph). Registered blind, she will rely on her guide, Brett Wild, to talk her down the mountain. They are a team. Fist bump. Ritual. A whispered chant from Irish band, The Script: “You could be the greatest, you can be the best, you can be the King Kong banging on your chest.” Into the gates. “Three, two, one.” Wild pushes off. “Go.” Knight follows. The mountain falls away. The cut of skis on snow and the intense exchange of instructions is all that can be heard as Wild shouts out the course. Spectators stand silent, forbidden to make noise. Knight only has 5% vision. It is peripheral and blurry but she catches glints of Wild’s orange jacket, which keeps her on track. Twists and turns. Rhythmic. And then the final stretch, downhill, skis straight, body tucked. All out until they're over the line. The mountain's silence is broken by cheering. Knight and Wild have become champions in the World Para Alpine Skiing Championships. It's a first for Britain at such an event. But Knight fails to stop. She crashes at 115km/h. “I heard her on the comms screaming,” says Wild. “I looked back and could tell instantly how bad it was. She was getting rag-dolled and there was blood all over the snow. She slid on the ice and it ripped her face.” Knight had skidded under an inflatable barrier, which re-inflated on top of her. “She was saying she couldn't breathe,” says Wild. Sports psychologist Kelley Fay watched the crash unfold. “Brett was frantic. Millie wouldn't have known what was happening,” she says. Knight was taken to hospital. Besides cuts and bruises, she was apparently unharmed and discharged in time for the medal ceremony. Knight's injuries The next day the pair returned to compete in the Super G - a form of slalom. But as psychologist Fay took up her position at the bottom of the course, she felt uneasy. “I knew Millie’s head wasn't in the right place,” she says. “So I radioed up and we pulled her out of the race. She was really cross, but in the end she could see we'd made the right decision for her.” It was the first sign that all was not well with the teenager. “We'd been skiing together for over a year and she'd never crashed,” says Wild. “Millie was known for staying on her feet.” That was January 2017. A month later, in South Korea at a test event for the Paralympics, the blind skier found herself in hospital again. “It was at the finish line again,” Knight says. “I flipped and landed on my head a couple of times and we were blue-lighted off to hospital.” A diagnosis of concussion would take her off the ski slopes. Recuperation included light gym sessions, but too much exertion could wipe her out for days. That's when fear crept in.” Knight's brain scan Unable to confront the mountains, the fear started to eat away at her. She threw herself into her school work - A-levels were looming - and her love of photography. Knight photographs people and movement - skiing rarely features - and often sells her work. “I take photos to see the world because the way I see it is very different,” she says. “It's almost like a new language to me. When I look through the camera I realise that's what everyone else sees.” Knight started to prepare for her first solo photography exhibition. But as hard as she focused, her mind kept replaying the crash. “I thought, ‘Have I lost this? Have I lost my bottle? Am I not going to be as good as I was?’” Knight had always been known for her fearlessness. She has skied since she was six - the same age that she was left with 5% vision. As a baby, an infection scarred the retina of her right eye. Five years later the sight was gone in her left eye, too. “I don't remember having sight,” she says. “It's not an event in my life and my mum never made a big deal about it.” “She was a massive skier, so she just put me into ski school and didn't tell them I couldn't see.” Knight stayed close to the instructor and became a natural follower on the snow. Millie Knight The family took annual ski holidays. It was something to create memories with and a chance to feel speed - after all, Knight would never ride a bike or drive a car. “I can see about two to three metres in front of me but it's unclear and foggy,” she says. “Within that, I don't really have depth perception, so I don't know how far away things are.” Millie Knight and her mother Suzanne In 2012, when she was 12, Knight attended the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics. “That was the moment I was like, ‘Wow I want to be one of those athletes.’” Back at home in Canterbury, she contacted Disability Snowsport UK and began to focus on ski training. Her mother Suzanne acted as her guide. At 13, Knight made it on to the UK development team and just two years later qualified for the Sochi Paralympics. She became ParalympicsGB's youngest Winter Games athlete and was nominated as flag-bearer to lead the team into the Fisht Olympic Stadium. Knight carries the flag “I was thinking, ‘Why am I here, it's crazy’. I was so starstruck,” she says. She was too young to compete in all the ski events but came fifth in the slalom and the giant slalom. After the Games, Knight’s guide retired from the sport to go to university. Good guides are hard to come by, partly because of the expense. Unless they are at the top of their game, guides pay their own way. Others retire due to injury. Over the following season, Knight went through eight guides. None was quite right. Then in 2016, Knight’s development coach Euan Bennett, heard about a young Royal Navy skier who had represented Scotland at a junior level and thought he’d be worth a trial. Brett Wild had joined the Royal Navy when he was 19. He grew up in Scotland where his dad managed Glasgow Ski Centre and his mum was an instructor. They put Wild on the snow aged three and he competed for Scotland as a teenager. He travelled the world to training camps and competitions and almost went full time in his final year of school. Brett Wild Bennett told Wild that as a guide, he would need to ski a couple of metres ahead of Knight, but they wouldn't be tethered. They would communicate via Bluetooth headsets. He would need to be proficient in five disciplines - Downhill, Super-G, Giant Slalom, Slalom and Super Combined, which is made up of one downhill run and a slalom event. Wild was up for it and flew to Austria for a trial. Knight was less sure. She had been used to older guides who took control and made decisions. Wild was just 23 and had no idea what he was doing. But he took to it quickly and easily. Knight and Wild As they descend a slope, Wild is expected to describe the terrain from the start gate to the finish line. A “steep here”, a “flatter” there, as well as the snow conditions - “bumpy”, “icy”, “soft”. He will also instruct Knight to turn at every gate for the rhythmical changes. If she can’t catch sight of his orange jacket in front of her, she will let him know by saying “off”. “I was told her life is in my hands and that she’s my responsibility until she has her skis off,” says Wild. After a week’s training, Knight threw Wild into the deep end by asking him to guide for her at an international competition in Aspen, Colorado, US. The Navy agreed Wild could go but only if he returned immediately for a nine-month tour of duty. Waiting for him in Aspen was Knight’s sports psychologist Kelley Fay. She wanted to ensure that her young charge would be in good hands. “I could see his potential but he was just a boy. So I pulled him aside and had a stern conversation with him about what he needed to do,” she says. “He said I frightened the life out of him, but I wanted him to hit the ground running.” The pep talk worked. By the end of the competition, the pair had picked up seven medals including three golds. “It was hard to get my head around,” Wild says. “The week before I was pleased to win a bronze medal at the Inter-Service Championships. Then I had three gold World Cup medals to bring home.” PyeongChang beckoned and the Navy agreed to release Wild for two years, on a reduced salary, to take Knight to the Winter Games. But the crash a year later in South Korea changed everything for Knight. With just over 12 months to go, the blind skier was gripped with the fear of racing down a mountainside. Her Paralympic hopes hung in the balance. “Before my crash, I was confident because I had nothing to fear. But afterwards I was thinking, ‘Why am I doing this if it is going to cause me injuries?’” “My performance is 80% psychological and 20% talent because when you’re standing there and you have that second of doubt - that's when things start to go wrong.” Psychologist Fay says Knight was the most confident ski racer she had worked with. “She wasn’t cocky but had a lot of self belief in what she could achieve. She had no anxiety before the crashes. “After the first one we got her on her skis very quickly but the second one meant she was removed from that ski world. That made this particularly difficult to overcome,” she says. Kelly Fay with Knight and Wild Fay spent up to 90 minutes a day with Knight. Sometimes they would talk during a 10-minute ski-lift ride to redirect Knight's thoughts before the next run, or discuss her body language to make her look and feel more confident. “You could see she was willing to do whatever it took, but whenever she put her speed skis on it just freaked her out,” Fay says. “Even when we were doing a gentle slope, she’d be saying ‘I can't do this’. She was that frightened. “That was when we knew it was very serious.” As time ticked away, they needed a breakthrough. Kelly speaks to Knight and Wild Fay accompanied Knight to Chile to the ParaGB training camp, in the hope she could establish where Knight's fear came from and why both crashes happened in the finish area. They started with the basics - how to stop. “The guys are 100% committed all the way down for speed. But the last few gates are normally straight, so a lot of them switch off because it's just ‘go go go’,” says Fay. “We worked a lot to make sure she was staying fully engaged until they were stopped, but even that didn’t take the fear away.” Then Fay had another idea - they would return to the site of the crash and face Knight's fears head-on. The trio went back to the exact spot where the crash happened, where Knight's confidence had been shattered. “It was about reprogramming my brain into thinking differently about it,” Knight says. “Changing my emotions towards it.” Fay says: “It was getting her to accept that this is speed racing, so there's an element of risk involved. But if we did A, B and C that would minimise it.” Knight and Wild Wild, naturally, blamed himself for the crash and Knight’s subsequent loss of confidence. As her guide he was meant to be her eyes. “I think of Millie as a little sister and I feel very protective of her,” he says. “I felt useless that I couldn’t help. All I could do was stay positive when she was losing belief in herself. There were times when she was upset and I didn't know what to do. “I tried to stay positive, but it was out of my control. The problems were in Millie’s head.” Knight's crash and loss of confidence had set them and their training back and they needed to make up ground on the snow. Knight weight training The got stuck into training. They needed to work on their trust and relationship both on and off the slopes. Daily training would begin at 05:00. They practised relentlessly, eradicating any potential for error “When I'm skiing all I can hear is Brett and his skis,” says Knight. “I'm only aware of following Brett's commands, I totally zone in and that's all I’m focused on.” Learning how to fall, gracefully. However, I'm not best known for being graceful, especially when it comes to falling...😬 A post shared byMillie Knight(@knight_millie) onAug 5, 2017 at 10:04am PDT In January 2018 news came through that the pair had made the GB team for PyeongChang. But the physical and mental hurdle of returning to the slopes in competition remained. Had Knight's fears finally be conquered? The pair were to find out at a pre-Games competition in Canada. They were faultless. Three bronze medals out of four. But the top accolade went to Knight and Wild’s team-mates - Menna Fitzpatrick and guide Jennifer Kehoe - who won two golds and a silver. Their fight back to the top was not yet over. Menna Fitzpatrick and guide Jennifer Kehoe “Canada was good,” says Wild. “I don't think it's exactly where we wanted to be, but we're now back in the mix. We were about a second off the fastest girl so we are close enough. It’s just whether we can bring it all together on race day.” But Knight saw it as proof her fears had dissipated. “I think now I'm much stronger mentally. When I think about my crash I smile, I don't think of it and get worried any more.” Knight and Wild A gold medal hangs in the balance. But so does the partnership the pair has effortlessly formed. The two years that Wild was granted by the Navy is almost up. He’s still part of the armed forces ski team but isn’t sure whether he will be allowed to continue working with Knight on another Paralympic cycle. A gold medal might just swing it - and keep the pair together. “I wouldn't want to follow anyone else down a mountain,” Knight says. “It would be devastating if we couldn’t ski together again.” Built with Shorthand"
Ministers reject 'latte levy' on cupsThe government says it is better for coffee shops to offer discounts to those who bring their own cups.2h2 hours agoScience & Environment,"A proposal to impose a so-called latte levy on throwaway coffee cups has been questioned by the government. MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC)had suggested a charge of 25pfor disposable coffee cups to reduce their use. But ministers say it is better for shops to offer voluntary discounts to customers bringing their own cups. The EAC says the government's response suggests it is not serious about its promise to tackle plastic litter. Committee chairwoman Mary Creagh said: ""The UK's throwaway culture is having a devastating impact on our streets, beaches and seas. Our report recommended practical solutions to the disposable packaging crisis. Four ideas to tackle coffee cup waste ""The government's response shows that despite warm words they plan no real action."" She said evidence to the committee showed charges work better than discounts for reducing the use of non-recyclable materials - as was the case with the plastic bag charge. ""By choosing to favour voluntary discounts, the government is ignoring the evidence about what works,"" she said. The government said it was serious about the issue - but did not want to jump to hasty conclusions. This video can not be played Some fear the cost of the levy will be passed on to the consumer Addressing the EAC's view that charges were more effective than discounts, the government acknowledged that the 5p cost of plastic bags had resulted in fewer being sold. This was the kind of incentive it ""could consider"". But it added: ""We are pleased that major coffee retail chains are taking action to reduce single-use coffee cups by offering discounts to customers with reusable cups and are putting in place the infrastructure to ensure cups can be collected for recycling. ""The government would like to see this service offered by all businesses selling disposable coffee cups."" In its response, it also said: ""Coffee cups make up 0.7% of total paper packaging waste in the UK. We believe it is important to look at the packaging and waste management system as a whole."" The government did signal an intent to reform what's known as the ""producer responsibility"" system in which packaging firms chip in towards the cost of recycling technology. A report this week from the waste consultancy Eunomia said the industry was exaggerating the waste it recycles and paying far too little towards the Â£2.8bn cost to households of collecting and dealing with waste. Many of the large coffee shop chains in the UK nowoffer customers incentivesto use reusable cups rather than the throwaway kind. Pret a Manger for example offers a 50p discount while Costa Coffee and Starbucks will knock 25p off. But studies suggest people are more likely to respond to extra charges, for example the plastic bag charge, than they are to discounts. With this in mind, Starbucks is also running a three month trial in some of its central London stores charging those using throwaway cups an extra 5p. Other possible alternatives includemaking the throwaway cups easier to recycle or creating edible ones. The National Audit Office is launching a review of the government's oversight of the system, following a request from the Environmental Audit Committee, which has concerns that it is opaque, and could be subject to fraud and non-compliance. The government said the idea of a latte tax would be considered as part of a call for evidence on single-use plastics. That initiative was promised by the chancellor in the autumn budget but it hasn't happened yet.

US chided over hefty import tariffsKey trading nations have hit out after Donald Trump signed off import duties on steel and aluminium.5m5 minutes agoUS & Canada,"Angela Merkel says she is concerned about President Trump's decision to impose new tariffs German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for the European Union to be exempted from new US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. ""The best option would be [for the EU] to be excluded,"" she told business leaders gathered in Munich. Ms Merkel warned that no one could win a ""race to the bottom"" and said the tariffs risked ""hurting everyone"". President Donald Trump says the US has suffered from ""unfair trade"" and that the tariffs will boost industry. The import duties - 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium - will go into effect in 15 days, although Canada and Mexico will be exempt while negotiations continue over the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). What links Trump, Lincoln and Ferris Bueller? Why Trump is hanging tough on trade Five reasons Why trade wars aren't easy to win Mr Trump signed the declaration in a White House ceremony attended by American workers from both industries. This video can not be played Why is Trump envious of Merkel? China'ssteel and metals associations demanded retaliation, urging the government to target US imports including coal, agricultural products and electronics. Japansaid the import duties would have a ""big impact"" on bilateral ties, whileSouth Koreathreatened to take the issue to the World Trade Organization. Canada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminium to the US, welcomed its exemption but said it would continue to press Washington to drop the tariffs. Mexico'sEconomy Minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, insisted the tariffs could not be linked to talks on Nafta. TheEUis seeking talks on the issue and has denounced the tariffs. European Commissioner Jyrki Katainen called for an exemption, and insisted that EU companies were ""not a source of unfair trade"". TheUKgovernment said it would work with EU partners to consider ""the scope for exemptions"" while ""robustly"" supporting UK industries. DutchPrime Minister Mark Rutte said Mr Trump's tariff decision was ""very disappointing"". He warned that the Netherlands was prepared to take ""counter-measures"". AustralianPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the US could have ""no complaints"" about their bilateral trading relationship and his government would be ""relentless"" in pursuing an exemption from the tariffs. This video can not be played Trump tariffs: Three takeaways on trade bombshell There was strong opposition from within Mr Trump's own Republican Party, which is traditionally in favour of free trade. US House Speaker Paul Ryan denounced the new measures and said he feared ""unintended consequences"". Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he believed the president had been ""misled"" by those advising him at the White House. Another Republican Senator,  Jeff Flake,  said he would draft and introduce a bill to nullify the tariffs, adding: ""I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy."" However, those who backed Mr Trump's move included Democratic Senator Joe Manchin who said it was ""past time to defend our interests, our security and our workers in the global economy"". In his election campaign, Mr Trump pledged to protect American workers and to rebuild the steel and aluminium industries. The two metals are ""the backbone of our nation... the bedrock of our defence-industrial base"", the president said at Thursday's signing ceremony. Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? ""Our greatest presidents from [George] Washington, to [Andrew] Jackson, to [Abraham] Lincoln, to [William] McKinley and others - they protected our country from outside influence, from other countries coming in and stealing our wealth and stealing our jobs and stealing our companies,"" he said. ""And we're going to be very fair, we're going to be very flexible, but we're going to protect the American worker, as I said I would do in my campaign."" Correspondents say Mr Trump is aiming to appeal to blue-collar voters in states such as Pennsylvania who turned away from the Democrats to support him in 2016. This video can not be played Trump laughs off awkward slip-up with steelworkers Mr Trump has said that the US would ""win big"" in any trade war. Some countries are likely to take the US to court, arguing that the decision violates World Trade Organization rules. The White House, however, says that the national security rationale for the move is ""unassailable"" and national security considerations are allowed under WTO rules. The director of UK Steel said the tariffs would have a profound and detrimental impact on the UK steel sector. ""Imposing such measures on US allies in the name of national security is difficult to comprehend,"" Gareth Stace added.

Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks?,"As you'd expect,Asian markets have reacted pretty positivelyto North Korean leader Kim Jong-un'sunprecedented offer to US President Donald Trump to sit down for talks. That's hardly a surprise. After all, the prospect of that dialogue - and  reports that Mr Kim has agreed to halt nuclear and missile tests and was ""committed to denuclearisation"" - can only be good for stability globally. And it would be especially welcome in East Asia, where escalating conflict would inevitably hit economiesbecause of integrated supply chains in the region. But what's more interesting, is what the potential upcoming meeting between ""Rocket Man"" and the ""Dotard"" says about just how badly the North Korean economy may be doing. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un As I wrote earlier this year, data shows that North Korea's economy has been taking a hit from sanctions. North Korean exports may have declined by 30% last year,  and in particular exports to China, North Korea's biggest trading partner, are down as much as 35%. That's a third of the regime's economy wiped out. The regime's elite, who Kim Jong-un needs to keep on side for his legitimacy, won't like that. But more unnerving for Pyongyang could well be how much worse things may become. This video can not be played Was your T-shirt made in North Korea? ""Many of the tougher measures will take more time, widespread and rigorous implementation to be fully effective,"" William Newcomb, a former member of the UN Panel of Experts told me. ""Early indications of what is in store in the future are likely becoming more apparent to Pyongyang."" And so that new sanctions-induced reality check could be why North Korea is now willing to talk about denuclearisation - a stance that seemed impossible just weeks ago. ""The sanctions have been extraordinary,"" says Christopher Hill, a former US assistant secretary of state during the George W Bush years. ""The Chinese have really participated in these sanctions as never before...that certainly begins to hurt."" Analysis: The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting in full Kim Jong-un had conceded in his New Year's address that sanctions were beginning to bite. But just because North Korea's economy may be hurting, doesn't mean Mr Kim's invitation to Donald Trump should be seen as an act of weakness. ""There will be a cost to the US for any negotiation with North Korea over denuclearisation,"" Ankit Panda of the Diplomat told me. ""This is a meeting - in Kim Jong-un's mind at least - that will take place between two equals, and more importantly, two nuclear powers.""

Asian markets rally on US-NK talks hopes,"Asian markets rallied on Friday, on hopes that North Korean nuclear tensions might be easing. Investors responded toUS President Donald Trump accepting an invitation for face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. There was already some optimism on the markets after Mr Trump earlierleft the door open for possible exemptions to US tariffs on steel and aluminium. South Korea and Japan's main markets began well but later shed some gains. Seoul's Kospi index finished 1.1% ahead. Meanwhile Japan's Nikkei 225 index - which initially rose by 2.5% - closed only 0.5% higher. Analysis: The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting in full Analysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia Business Correspondent Investors in the region have been watching the potential conflict between the US and North Korea for months now. And news that the two could meet by May of this year is being greeted with a sigh of relief by many.  And that shouldn't come as a surprise. Nobody wants a conflict on the Korean peninsula to break out, especially between arguably two of the world's most volatile leaders. East Asian economies would be almost certainly be hit,because of integrated supply chains in the region. It's a region central to global shipping and manufacturing, so any escalation of the current tensions could disrupt trade and economic activity. But perhaps what's more interesting, is what a potential meeting between ""Rocket Man"" and the ""Dotard"" says about just how badly the North Korean economy may be doing as sanctions bite. Read more from Karishma:Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended 1.1% higher, while China's mainland indexes also made small gains. The South Korean won climbed slightly, while the Japanese yen slipped against the US dollar. That is not unexpected given the yen is a safe haven currency, with investors tending to seek out riskier assets with better returns when things appear more stable.

Building Stonehenge 'was a celebration',"Celebrating the building of Stonehenge may have been as important to Neolithic people as worshipping there The arduous task of building Stonehenge may have been part of a ceremonial celebration, claim historians. The circle in Wiltshire was built more than 4,000 years ago using bluestones from south Wales - a decision which has long baffled experts. Susan Greaney, from English Heritage, said they now believed that Neolithic people did not want to make ""things as easy and quick as possible"". Building the monument was as important as ""its final intended use,"" she added. Experts have tried to discover why the people who built Stonehenge chose to use some stones from the Preseli Hills, about 155 miles (250km) away. The stones were probably transported via water networks and hauled over land, using a huge amount of labour over the long and difficult journey. Experts now believe the construction of the monument was just as important to Neolithic people as worshipping in it. ""In contemporary Western culture, we are always striving to make things as easy and quick as possible, but we believe that for the builders of Stonehenge this may not have been the case,"" said Ms Greaney. English Heritage also thinks people may have gone on a kind of celebration pilgrimage to help construct the monument. A photo of a stone-pulling ceremony on Nias in Indonesia in 1915 show people celebrating the move The new theory follows the discovery of a feasting site at nearbyDurrington Walls settlement, which attracted people from all over the country to help build Stonehenge. Historians think holding ceremonial feasts close to the Stonehenge site to celebrate the build ""was potentially a powerful tool in demonstrating the strength of the community to outsiders"". English Heritage believe this theory is backed up by a photograph taken during a stone-pulling ceremony on the island of Nias, Indonesia, in 1915. It shows people in ceremonial dress ""revelling in the seemingly arduous task of moving enormous monoliths by hand, taking part in feasts and associated dances"". Ms Greaney added: ""As soon as you abandon modern preconceptions which assume Neolithic people would have sought the most efficient way of building Stonehenge, questions like why the bluestones were brought from so far away - the Preseli Hills of south Wales - don't seem quite so perplexing."" In order to test the celebration theory, English Heritage will begin moving a replica stone on Friday using teams of volunteers in an ""experiential archaeology"" project. In a statement it said the aim was to see how Neolithic people may have cooperated to build the monument and suggests ""visitors abandon 21st-century thinking to understand how the monument was built"". The first monument at Stonehenge was a circular earthwork enclosure with a ring of 56 timber or stone posts, built in about 3000BC. This was replaced in about 2500BC with sarsen stones and smaller bluestones. Most archaeologists believe the sarsen stones were brought from the Marlborough Downs, 20 miles (32km) away. The sarsens weigh on average 25 tonnes, with the largest stone, the Heel Stone, weighing about 30 tonnes. The smaller bluestone came from the Preseli Hills, 155 miles (250km) away in south-west Wales. The stones, which weigh between two and five tonnes each, were probably carried via water networks and hauled over land.

'Extreme spring clean' at Cheddar Gorge,"Don't look down: The Cheddar gorge is up to 400ft (121m) deep in places A team of abseilers has been roped in to give the Cheddar Gorge an ""extreme spring clean"". The 400ft-deep, three-mile long ravine - England's largest- need to be cleared of loose rocks and other hazards. A team of 15 ""rope access technicians"", suspended up to 121m off the ground, will spend six weeks ridding the Somerset landmark of unwanted detritus. The Longleat Estate, which manages the gorge, said about 37,500 sq m of rock face would be cleared. Building Stonehenge 'was a celebration' Why did Victorians censor the Bayeux Tapestry? Ascot bans Bardot tops in new style guide Members of the team will also work above the B3135, which runs through the chasm, to stabilise the rock face with mesh and wire. They will also be inserting monitoring studs into parts of the rock to try and track any rock movement. Time to lean, time to clean: Mesh and wire is being used to stabilise and tie back areas of the rock face The gorge is home to a large number of rare and important native plants and flowers Leon Troake, Cheddar Gorge's operations manager, said the rock can now be maintained and managed ""in situ"" rather than ""having to prise large chunks off. ""In the past we would have had to close the entire gorge in order for the work to be undertaken,"" he said. ""This remedial work means we can also begin to remove invasive species including ivy, red valerian and ash trees which will provide more growing space for endemic species like the Cheddar pink which is only found here.""

Wagamama fined for minimum wage failureTGI Fridays and Marriott Hotels were also among 43 employers in the hospitality sector which broke the law.2h2 hours agoBusiness,"Restaurant chains Wagamama and TGI Fridays have each been fined an undisclosed amount for failing to pay staff the National Minimum Wage. They were among 43 employers in the hospitality sector on the government's latest list of firms breaking the law. Wagamama has repaid an average of Â£50 to 2,630 employees. TGI Friday's had to repay Â£25 each to 2,300 staff. Wagamama blamed ""an inadvertent misunderstanding"" of the rules on staff uniforms for the blunder. The company said it had asked front-of-house staff to wear black jeans or a black skirt with their Wagamama-branded top. This was considered as asking them to buy a form of uniform, ""and so we should have paid them for it,"" it said. ""We have gladly made payments to current and previous employees who missed out dating back from 2016 to 2013. We have also updated our uniform policy and we now pay a uniform supplement to cover the black jeans."" Just before Christmas, Wagamama had to apologise after a note was seen in one of its London restaurants, apparently banning staff from taking sick days. Wagamama apologises for banning sick days Minimum wage increases 'could cost jobs' A TGI Fridays statement said the firm had reimbursed team members for a shoe allowance. The firm added: ""This is a historic payment which was paid last year, and we have since reimbursed team members for the purchase of their black uniform shoes."" In total, 179 employers were fined Â£1.3m by the government for underpaying their staff. And they were warned that minimum pay rates will increase again on 1 April. Empty-nesters 'resent boomerang kids' John Lewis staff bonus cut again Amazon promises fix for creepy Alexa laugh The hotel chain Marriott was also fined. It underpaid 279 of its staff over Â£250 each on average. The company apologised and said it was committed to paying the National Minimum Wage. ""When an error was identified by a routine HMRC audit in 2015, we co-operated fully with HMRC and promptly reimbursed all those affected,"" it said. Other companies fined included the fashion chain Karen Millen, Birmingham and Stoke City Football Clubs, and St Helens Rugby Club. In its response to the Matthew Taylor Review of the gig economy, calledGood Work,external, the government has already announced plans to give all workers the right to a payslip. It said that would make it easier for 300,000 workers to check that they were being paid the legal minimum. Later this month, the government will launch an awareness campaign for the new minimum wage rates. Employers can be fined up to twice the total wage shortfall, subject to a maximum of Â£20,000 per worker.

"Parsons Green victim 'engulfed in flames'A man tells Ahmed Hassan's trial of the ""blinding flash"" from a bomb on an underground train.10h10 hours agoUK","Ahmed Hassan denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life A witness to the Parsons Green bombing told the Old Bailey how his head was ""engulfed in flames"" during the attack. Stephen Nash was on the District Line underground train on 15 September 2017 when the device went off. CCTV allegedly shows Ahmed Hassan - who prosecutors said built the bomb and set the timer - leaving the train one stop earlier at Putney Bridge station, having left a bag behind. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life, The CCTV footage then showed the moment an orange fireball filled the carriage. Prosecutor Alison Morgan has said experts concluded it was simply ""luck"" that the bomb did not fully detonate. Mr Hassan was arrested at the Port of Dover the day after the attack. This video can not be played CCTV of Parson's Green Tube bomb fireball Mr Nash told the court he was was reading a newspaper, ""oblivious"" to what was going on, when the explosion happened. He said: ""At Parsons Green there was a loud bang. There was a blinding flash to my left and I was engulfed in flames."" He described an ""intense heat"", before adding: ""I thought I had lost my ears. I thought my head was on fire."" Mr Nash said he was knocked out, and when he woke up a few seconds later, he was the last person on the train. ""I called out to the Tube,"" he said. ""Just as I got to the doors, the doors started to close. ""It was a little bit scary and I called out on to the platform."" Mr Nash was among a number of witnesses giving evidence at the trial. The court heard that many of the 93 people caught in the bombing suffered burns or were crushed in the stampede to get out. Retired counter-terrorism officer Alex Beavan had boarded the train at Wimbledon and was standing near the doors when the bomb went off. ""I heard a huge popping sound,"" he said. ""Looking towards the direction of the sound, I saw a rolling fireball coming over the ceiling at the back of the train. ""I saw the rolling fireball, wall to wall, slowly coming up the ceiling."" He added: ""Everything goes in slow motion. There was chaos and I was thinking there is going to be a second attack, so I ran across the platform."" Aimee Colville, who got on the train at Parsons Green moments before the explosion, said she saw a ""wall of glass"" and flames coming towards her. She said: ""That morning I had curled my hair and I had put hairspray in my hair, so when the flames came over me my hair immediately caught fire."" Lucinda Glazebrook, who also boarded the train at Parsons Green, told the court she felt the heat from the fireball on her face. ""I kept touching my face and feeling the back of my hair and my hair was coming out in chunks,"" she said. An army officer travelling on the train turned towards the explosion because of his ""instinct"" and training. Craig Palmer told the court that he wanted to know what had happened so began walking towards where the device had partly detonated. He said: ""I had a seen the wall of faces in terror who rushed past me. ""I could see something in the corner of the train, it was burning. He added: ""There was smoke billowing out of it and the carriage was filling up with grey smoke. ""I could smell, at that point, something I categorise as being explosives."" Mr Palmer said he expected to see a ""suicide bomber"" but he discovered the bomb, which he believed to be an ""improvised explosive device"". He then took photos of it to share with special officers who arrived at the scene. A number of other videos allegedly showing Mr Hassan's movements on the day of the attack have been shown to the jury by prosecutors. The first video is said by prosecutors to show him leaving his foster home in Sunbury, Surrey, carrying a plastic bag, which they told the court contained the device that exploded on the underground train. A second then allegedly shows Mr Hassan catching a train to Wimbledon. And CCTV from the platform allegedly shows him going into the station toilets - where prosecutors said he set the timer on the device - and emerging 13 minutes later carrying the bag and heading towards the District Line platforms. Further footage was also shown, which prosecutors said showed Mr Hassan from a day before the attack going to two supermarkets - an Asda and an Aldi in Feltham - buying matches, batteries, a screw driver and screw driver bit sets, allegedly used to construct the device. Jurors were also shown a replica of the home-made bomb without the explosive, which was held in a Lidl frozen goods bag and contained 2.2kg of shrapnel. The court was told that Mr Hassan's fingerprints were found on the Tube carriage, on a white plastic bucket inside the bag, and on a pair of trousers covering the bucket. His DNA was also found at the scene. Giving evidence, explosives officer Andrew Gee said a test carried out to identify the explosive used was an ""87% hit"" for the chemical compound TATP. On Wednesday, the prosecution said that Mr Hassan had told Home Office officials, 20 months before the Parsons Green attack. that he had been ""trained to kill"" Ms Morgan said he was interviewed in Croydon in January 2016 where he is alleged to have told them he had been taken by force by Isis (the Islamic State group), who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. The court also heard he had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury, but his asylum claim was still outstanding as he planned the attack. The trial continues.

Are the Koreas friends again?,"North Korea's cheerleaders hold the Unified Korea flag during the 2018 Winter Olympics The big story of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea has been the participation of North Korea and the friendly tone struck by the two countries. So, will the Olympic legacy be permanently improved relations? As the Games began in Pyeongchang, the South Korean and North Korean athleteswalked in the opening ceremony as a joint team.,external It was a moment heavy in symbolism, with their shared flag a neutral image of a ""unified"" Korean peninsula on a white backdrop. Then, Kim Yo-jong - the sister of Kim Jong-un -went on a so-called Olympic charm offensive, a joint women's ice hockey team played and a squad ofNorth Korean cheerleaders enthralled audiencesaround the world. But will the apparent Olympic rapprochement last? The weight of expectation based on unusually friendly words has certainly been high. Widespread news coverage - both in South Korea and around the world - has seen suggestions of abreakthrough in inter-Korean relations.,external South Korea's liberal media has spoken of an ""Olympic spirit"" smoothing talks with the North, as has the liberal administration of President Moon Jae-in. But not everyone is quite so happy. Conservatives are so unnerved, that editorials in South Korea's right-wing media regularly argue against conceding too much to Pyongyang in any discussions. One concern is that the North could ask for a halt to joint South Korean and US military exercises, in exchange for a vague promise of a freeze to its missile or nuclear programmes, on which it will then cheat. What a 'casual' photo tells us about North Korea Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon North Korean cheerleaders mesmerise crowds The reality is that expectations may be misplaced on all sides, with a return to the status quo perhaps most likely. A sporting event is unlikely to have much bearing on the deep political divides between the two countries. Decades of talks have not yet brought reconciliation and, at the risk of sounding excessively gloomy, the likelihood is that relations will return to form - tense, uncomfortable and worrisome, but also stable. The Korean status quo has been remarkably constant since the end of theKorean War 65 years ago.,external Kim Yo-jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, watches a performance with South Korean President Moon Jae-in North Korea remains arguably the world's most dangerous state, itsnuclear weapons programmeonly increasing the risk it poses. The possibility of talks when it shows interest -as it suddenly did in January- is always going to raise hopes in a world desperate to find a way to rein in Pyongyang without conflict. However, previous negotiations have collapsed and - happy atmospherics of the Olympics aside - little has changed. The North Koreans are canny, tough negotiators. They fight for every inch and get deep into the weeds on specifics. Any concessions the US and South Korea might be asked to make are interpreted as widely as possible, while any that might be expected of them are defined as narrowly as possible. Implementation of deals with the North have stumbled time and again on thorny issues of interpretation and timing. The likelihood that an Olympic spirit of bonhomie will bring about some serious concession from Pyongyang is almost zero. That would be very out of character with the regime's past negotiating behaviour. The left in South Korea may also hope to see some kind of gesture from its government. It often sees the North more as ethnic kinsmen, unfairly separated by the Cold War, than as ideological opponents. But President Moon was elected with 41% of the vote and may not have the political space to make a major, unilateral, Olympic concession. The South Korean right would be apoplectic, with some conservatives already concerned that President Moon is desperate to make a deal, having long argued that talks are the way to improve relations with North Korea. The US would also be deeply unimpressed, particularly given the hawkishness of the Trump administration on North Korea. South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, left, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il toast in North Korea in 2000 President Moon may indeed go to Pyongyang in the coming months, as perthe North's Olympic invitation- hand-delivered by Kim Yo-jong at a landmark meeting in Seoul. Although there has not yet been a formal agreement, Mr Moon said the Koreas should ""make it happen"" and encouraged the North to return to negotiations with the US. But this too is ultimately atmospherics: a summit does not necessarily mean true progress and little has been said about exactly what would be discussed. There is also the risk that the North will spin a visit as the South's recognition that North Korea is a real state - rather than an aberrant part of South Korea. Opinion in the South would be divided as President Moon's base wants dialogue, but conservatives fear appeasement. Previous summits - in2000,externaland2007,external- did not really help. It even transpired that, ahead of the 2000 summit,$500m (Â£357m) was remitted to North Korea,externalby the Hyundai group, with the knowledge of the South's government, leading critics to say the meeting had been ""bought"". Now, the most likely outcome is a return to talks similar to those of the past: a long, hard slog characterised by deep distrust and micro-detail. But talking is progress of a kind, one might argue, and after last year's fears of war, at least the two sides are engaging. However, other events in 2018 threaten to slow that engagement to a crawl, if not derail it. For example, every year, theUS and South Korea hold joint military exercises,to which the North typically responds with rhetoric aboutannihilating its enemies. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea: How are countries defending themselves? What have North Korea's nuclear tests achieved? It is unlikely that it will be able to contain itself as the exercises resume after the end of the Olympics. Similarly, the North has widening nuclear and missile programmes. It may hold off tests to keep talks rolling, but if it does test, conservative criticism of President Moon as naive dilettante will be crushing. Past negotiations have broken on the rocks of such regular pressure points in the relationship. The Korean women's ice hockey team includes players from North and South Korea Perhaps this time is different and the North will make a real concession - in the Olympic spirit - to jump-start talks and overcome massive global scepticism about its intentions. But it is more likely that it will try to separate South Korea from the US, playing on the deep dislike in South Korea for President Trump. There is also the possibility that it will make demands which the South can never meet - such as its recent request for the return of defectors. So, while the hope remains that things will be different after the Olympics, the reality is that it's better not to raise hopes too high.

Is North Korea just playing the US?,"Protesters in Seoul called for peace talks between the US and North Korea in November They were called the ""peace Olympics"", but let me tell you, there was no peace in Pyeongchang. There was a constant cacophony from the crowds inside and outside the stadiums. An atmosphere of excitement and wonder at what medals could be won. In contrast, the huge diplomatic efforts surrounding the Winter Games are discussed in uncertain whispers. Did you see North Korean President Kim Jong-un's sister? Do you think the South Korean president will go to Pyongyang? What could happen next? South Koreans have endured over 60 years of dramatic ups and downs with the North and have learned to speak quietly about any hopes of a breakthrough. But there now appears to be a small window of opportunity - the first in many years. But it may not last long. Are North and South Korea friends again? Japan's worries about the Korean detente North Korea is sitting down regularly with the South, and did not walk away when the subject of nuclear weapons arose. The South Korean Unification Minister, Cho Myoung-gyon, made that clear to me. ""We did convey the message to North Korea multiple times that in order to improve relations between the two countries we need to see a denuclearisation of the peninsula,"" he said. ""It is necessary that North Korea talk to the United States to solve this in a peaceful manner."" North Korea has also announced it is willing to talk to the US. But what does America want to do? ""We want to talk,"" US President Donald Trump said on Monday, but then he added: ""only under the right conditions."" He failed to specify what those conditions were. Then, just hours later came a potential problem. Joseph Yun, one of the US state department's most experienced diplomats on North Korea announced his decision to retire. He told reporters that ""the time was right"" and denied that it had anything to do with differences on White House policy. Analysts believe Joseph Yun was very much in favour of compromise and diplomacy. His departure could handicap the Trump administration's progress with North Korea just as Pyongyang has made the rare decision to take part in talks. Joseph Yun leaves his post as a US special representative for North Korea policy without a successor Professor John Delury from Yonsei University in Seoul said this was a bad sign. ""Why is he retiring without a replacement? Any self-respecting CEO would not allow a key member of staff to resign without announcing their replacement. It's standard business practice."" Building even the crudest relationship with North Korea is difficult and will take expert handling. And right now, the Trump administration has failed to nominate a US ambassador to South Korea, let alone a point man on North Korea. Prof Delury added: ""There are no resources for basic diplomacy. The Trump administration has said North Korea is its top national security priority and yet they are not staffing it. ""You can't rely on maximum pressure alone. You can continue to squeeze them and pressure has a place but you have to combine it with talking to them, and this is at least a chance to start."" US ties any N Korea talks to nuclear arms White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has tried to clarify the US position. ""Let us be completely clear,"" she said. ""Denuclearisation must be the result of any dialogue with North Korea. Until then, the United States and the world must continue to make it known that North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes are a dead end."" While the US appears to lack the staff, South Korean President Moon Jae-in appears to be doing most of the work. President Moon campaigned on a promise to engage with North Korea and seized on the opportunity offered by President Kim Jong-un during his New Year's speech. His approval ratings have bounced back after his decision to integrate ice hockey players from the North into the national women's team. In fact, there were tears at the airport when the two sides said goodbye. Strong attachments were formed during the Winter Olympics But now President Moon is battling the clock and has asked the US to lower the bar for talks with North Korea. He seems eager to try to get some progress before joint military exercises are due to resume after the end of the Paralympic Games. These inflame Pyongyang, and have often prompted missile tests in response. If real progress is to be made, he needs the US and North Korea to sit down before then. Professor Kim Jang-ho from Hankuk University believes that for this reason, the detente won't last. He is also sceptical of President Moon's motives and doesn't believe there has been any breakthrough with North Korea. ""President Moon is trying to buy some time so that he can achieve a summit meeting with Kim Jong-un. North Korea to field Paralympics team US ties any N Korea talks to nuclear arms ""Our president wants to meet him to symbolically say that North Korea is a normal nation and they are capable of talking. It automatically propels him to the list for the Nobel Peace Prize. But the US and Japan will pressure us to go ahead with military exercises as soon as possible, late April maybe. ""I think certainly with those exercises continuing, and they will go ahead definitely before May, we will go from the thaw to tension all over again."" Many doubt North Korea's willingness to discuss getting rid of its nuclear weapons with the US. Kim Jong-un has tried to reassure Seoul by saying his missiles are not pointing at South Koreans, they're pointing instead at the ""US aggressors"", and that they could be used to protect all of Korea. I put it to Professor Bong Young-shik that North Korea would never give up its missiles. The research fellow at Yonsei University disagreed. ""The North Korean regime's ultimate goal is survival and security,"" the expert in North Korea said. North Korea says its long-range missiles protect all of Korea from ""US aggressors"" ""If having nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles don't guarantee the survival of the regime and in fact, eventually threaten the very goal of the regime, then the regime will abandon its nuclear weapons and missiles. That is the whole point of the maximum-pressure strategy employed by the Trump administration."" However, he adds this rather important caveat: ""The maximum pressure imposed by the US may also compel North Korea to use those weapons as a last resort for survival, so it is kind of a high-risk, high-stake poker game between Washington and Pyongyang."" South Korea is at the centre of this poker game which is now at a critical moment. President Moon has taken things as far as he can without other key players getting involved. It is time for the US to show its hand.

Paul Newman took pay cut for SarandonThe actress says Paul Newman gave up part of his salary for her when their pay was unequal.11h11 hours agoUK,"This video can not be played Actress and director of documentary, Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story Hollywood actress Susan Sarandon has revealed that the late Paul Newman once gave her part of his salary. It's believed to have happened when they starred together in the 1998 film Twilight, which also featured Gene Hackman. Sarandon told BBC 5 live that she discovered that her two male co-stars were getting paid the same as each other - and more than her. She said Newman stepped in and said: ""Well I'll give you part of mine."" Paul Newman died in 2008 In an interview to mark the release of her new project, Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story, Sarandon told 5 live:  ""Emma Stone once came forward and said she got equal pay, because her male stars insisted upon it and gave up something of theirs. ""That happened to me with Paul Newman at one point, when I did a film with him ages ago."" She continued:  ""They said it was 'favoured nations', but they only meant the two guys. ""He stepped forward and said, 'Well I'll give you part of mine'.  So, yeah, he was a gem."" The term ""favoured nations"" is an agreement between a producer and an actor, which ensures the actors are given the same terms as their co-stars. In Twilight, all three stars were given equal billing on the poster, but Sarandon has now revealed that only Newman and Hackman benefited from the favoured nations arrangement. Susan Sarandon On International Women's Day, Susan Sarandon also told 5 live that there will ""always be a casting couch"" in Hollywood. ""I think what will go away is the unwanted exchange. ""But I think that giving yourself sexually, or being drawn to power and wanting to have sex with someone that's in power, is also a choice. ""What we don't want to have is being exploited and have the Harvey Weinsteins of the world holding it over your head and holding it over your project. ""That is the most despicable.""
