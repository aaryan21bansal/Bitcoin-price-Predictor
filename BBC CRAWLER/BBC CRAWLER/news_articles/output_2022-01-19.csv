Council chief says cuts and tax rises 'inevitable',"Scottish councils face having to cut back services even while raising local taxes to balance the books, a leading councillor has claimed. Alison Evison, who leads council umbrella body Cosla, said not enough funding is on offer from Holyrood. She said the only question over council tax rises was how big they would be, and that it was ""probably inevitable"" that services would face cuts too. The Scottish government insists it has treated local authorities fairly. Public finance minister Tom Arthur told MSPs on Wednesday that the government did not ""underestimate the challenges"" to local government, but questioned where additional funds would come from when the full budget has been allocated. Council leaders seek 'urgent' talks over budgets Ending freeze 'will see council tax bills soar' Councils need to set their tax and spending plans in the coming weeks, with the Scottish Parliament also moving through its annual budget process. The plans set out by Finance Secretary Kate Forbes in December are sure to pass, with the SNP's partnership arrangement with the Greens giving the government a majority at Holyrood. However, councils have hit out at the settlement offered to them as part of the budget, with leaders expressing ""extreme disappointment"" with the ""totally unacceptable"" proposals. There has been dispute over the exact figures involved, with the government pointing to an increase in the core settlement in cash terms, while councils contend that this does not account for inflation or ring-fenced funds. And while town halls are to be givencomplete control over council tax ratesfor the first time since the SNP took office in 2007, opposition MSPs say the government has put councils in an ""arm-lock"" ahead of local elections in May. Alison Evison said the ""constant squeeze"" on council finances was ""not sustainable"" In an interview with BBC Scotland, Ms Evison said councils were facing ""tough choices"". She said: ""There will be increases to council tax this year. It's obviously up to each local council in terms of their own circumstances how big that increase will be. ""Councils want to be able to deliver services to their local communities and they need to look at the levers they have in order to deliver those services."" Asked if cuts or tax rises were inevitable, she added: ""I think both are probably inevitable, in that councils have to be able to deliver local services to vulnerable people and to everyone across our local communities, and it needs to have money in order to be able to give those services. Ms Evison - a Labour councillor in Aberdeenshire - said local government had been underfunded for a decade, and that ""the constant squeeze on our finances every year is not sustainable"". She said: ""On paper we've got more money, but a lot of that money is ring-fenced to meet Scottish government priorities. ""Even when you look at the increase there and the priorities we are meant to be delivering, the money doesn't cut it - it's Â£100m short for delivering those essential priorities from the Scottish government. ""They are the priorities we agree are important across our communities, but they desperately need to be funded and the cash increase we have got doesn't cut that, and it also doesn't cover things like increased costs in our communities."" Food and energy bills are already rising sharply and the prospect of higher council tax bills on top of that from April will only add to the pressure on household budgets. Ministers have, in previous years, protected the public from that by funding a council tax freeze. That's now being lifted to give councils more flexibility. It is of course up to individual local authorities to decide if the tax goes up and if so by how much and council elections on 5 May could have a restraining influence. But Scotland's top councillor clearly thinks a mixture of tax increases and service cuts is all but inevitable because of what she sees as a lack of funding from the Scottish government. Alison Evison wants a more generous settlement and will make that case at a meeting with the first minister next week. What's not clear is where the Scottish government could find more money from without squeezing the cash available to other key public services. A Holyrood debate on council funding was held on Wednesday, with the Conservatives calling for a new system which would guarantee councils a set percentage of the Scottish government budget each year. Local government spokesman Miles Briggs said underfunding councils would not help local services recover from the pandemic, saying there was ""increasing concern over the long-term sustainability of local government finances"". He added: ""Put simply, council leaders across Scotland have nothing else they can cut to save money or balance their books. ""We want to see a fair deal where the funding the Scottish government receives is adequately handed on to local authorities as well."" Labour has also been critical of the settlement, with MSP Mark Griffin describing it as a ""devastating raid on council budgets"". He said: ""It's simply unsustainable for the SNP to continue cutting council budgets to the bone, services are already at breaking point."" Mr Arthur said the overall settlement for local authorities amounted to Â£12.5bn when funds from other portfolios are included. He said: ""We cannot inflation-proof any part of the Scottish budget, given the nature of inflation right now. We do not underestimate the challenges this allocation presents, but it is simply not possible to inflation-proof all budget lines when the overall budget is not inflation-proofed. ""If opposition parties do not agree they are fully entitled to propose alternative but balanced funding proposals ahead of the budget bill next week.""

Brewdog flouted US laws over beer imports,"James Watt (right) and co-founder Martin Dickie at the BrewDog brewery in Ellon in May 2020 Scottish beer giant Brewdog sent multiple shipments of beer to the US, in contravention of US federal laws, a BBC investigation has found. Staff at its Ellon brewery told the BBC they were put under pressure in 2016 and 2017 to ship beer with ingredients that had not been legally approved. One US-based importer said they had been deceived by Brewdog. In a social media post on Wednesday, Brewdog CEO James Watt admitted to ""taking shortcuts"" with the process. BBC Scotland's Disclosure programme has been told that staff at the Ellon brewery in Aberdeenshire knew that two of its flagship products, Elvis Juice and Jet Black Heart, contained extracts which were not approved in the US. One former worker told the investigation: ""The pressure was enormous. 'Just make it happen', that was the culture. It was clear to us this was coming from the top - from James [Watt]."" Another said: ""We were continually told to ship beer to the USA, despite everyone knowing the beers hadn't been approved. ""Everyone was worried they'd be [fired] if they didn't do what was asked."" The BBC has seen evidence that suggests US treasury officials from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) were given false information on at least five occasions during a six-month period, which meant that potentially hundreds of kegs of beer were sent with incorrect labelling - a violation of TTB laws. Elvis juice was one of the beers that contained extracts which would not be approved in the US All beer imported to the US needs to be declared to the TTB and given an official label before being shipped. UK breweries provide the details of their beers to a US-based importer, who make the label application on the brewery's behalf. If the beer has any unusual ingredients, like flavourings or extracts, these need to be declared so that a special label, referencing the beer's formula, can be approved before it can be shipped. Each extract needs to be deemed safe for consumption in the US before an approval is granted, and this process can sometimes take months. False information provided to the TTB can be prosecuted under US perjury laws. The beer was imported to Brewdog's new US brewery which it was setting up in Ohio Brewdog sources have told the BBC that the only way to have shipped Elvis Juice and Jet Black Heart to the US in that period was to not declare the extracts. Former TTB labelling specialist Battle Martin said: ""I think it's serious. There's a lot of people out there putting a lot of effort into complying with the regulations. ""There has been a deception here,"" he said. ""In my view, based on the number of products and based on the number of times this has happened, I think it warrants further investigation, because it shows a pattern."" The claims are to be broadcast as part of a 60-minute documentary on BBC One Scotland on Monday 24 January at 19:00. The BBC wrote to Brewdog last week detailing its allegations. In a LinkedIn post on Wednesday - entitled My Biggest Mistakes As Brewdog CEO - Mr Watt said: ""We made some mistakes with the paperwork on the first few shipments [to the US] â¦all taxes were paid in full, but the paperwork was not always correct."" ""In hindsight, there were oversights ... due to the fact we were trying to run a growing business on one side of the Atlantic and start a new business on the other."" Mr Watt said the company self-reported the issue to the TTB, who told Brewdog there would be no further action taken. It is not clear if Brewdog self-reported the issue at the time, or after the BBC wrote to them. The TTB told the BBC that a three-year statute of limitations prevented any enforcement action being taken, and in any case, it would have to have been initiated against the US-based importer, who is legally responsible for the shipments. Importers face losing their import licence for serious breaches of TTB regulations. Mr Watt said Brewdog had consulted a lawyer who believed the errors made would not risk an importer's licence. Daniel Shelton, who imported one shipment for BrewDog, said he was deceived by the company Daniel Shelton, who imported one shipment for Brewdog, said he was deceived by the company. He said: ""I was misled. I had every reason to believe that they would tell the truth. ""We believed what we were told and we weren't told what was actually going on. ""They did lead somebody in my company to falsify documents. And, of course, I'm not happy about that; I don't respect that, I don't like it."" Another importer, Massachusetts-based MHW, told the BBC: ""Our focus is to comply with all Federal and State laws and we rely on all our suppliers for whom we import to provide truthful and accurate information as to all the ingredients in their products so we can determine the required Federal compliance processes to be executed. ""Regarding the two products in question, we executed the Federal compliance based on the information provided by the supplier at the time, which we believed to be truthful and accurate.""

Russia could attack Ukraine at short notice - US,"Belarus's defence ministry released photos showing Russian troops and tanks arriving for drills US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said Russia could attack Ukraine ""on very short notice"" and warned again of tough sanctions if it did. He was speaking on a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv after months of tension over a Russian military build-up near Ukraine's borders. Stressing the US's close ties with Ukraine, Mr Blinken vowed ""relentless"" diplomacy to stop Russian aggression. Moscow has denied any plans to attack or invade. Russia has made a raft of demands to Western governments, including that Ukraine should never join Nato and that the defensive alliance's military activities should be limited in member states including Poland. Talks between the West and Russia last week failed to reach a breakthrough, with some of Moscow's demands rejected as non-starters. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 after the overthrow of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine. It has supported pro-Russian rebels who control parts of eastern Ukraine after they fought a bloody war with government forces. There are fears that the conflict, which cost at least 13,000 lives and caused at least two million people to flee their homes, may reignite, with the Russian military openly intervening. Mr Blinken said Russia had built up troops near Ukraine's borders with ""no provocation, no reason"". ""We know that there are plans in place to increase that force even more on very short notice, and that gives President [Vladimir] Putin the capacity, also on very short notice, to take further aggressive action against Ukraine,"" he said. He accused Russia of trying to weaken Ukraine's diplomatic institutions and divide Ukrainian society ""using everything from election interference to disinformation to cyber attacks"". He pledged ""relentless diplomatic efforts to prevent renewed aggression and to promote dialogue and peace"", and repeated a warning of tough sanctions against Russia in the event of an invasion. Mr Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart in Geneva on Friday, after talks with European allies in Berlin. Antony Blinken met Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv A picture, they say, is worth a thousand words. So on a day when the White House warned that a Russian attack on Ukraine could come ""at any point"", American Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew almost 8,000km to appear in front of cameras with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and reiterate the close ties between the two nations. He cautioned Russian President Vladimir Putin that there would be severe consequences if he opted for military action and promised continued defensive and financial support for the Ukrainian government. Given evidence of a Russian disinformation campaign to convince Ukrainians that the US is abandoning the Eastern European nation - drawing comparisons to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan - such a show of support was particularly welcomed by senior Ukrainian officials. Meanwhile, on the streets of Kyiv, everyday life is continuing as normal. Pedestrians waved and took photographs of Mr Blinken's motorcade as it passed along ice-encrusted streets. There is no sense of panic or undue concern even amid headlines of Russian troops amassing along the nation's borders. Time may tell whether this is mass denial or a sense of steely resolve for the challenges that lie ahead. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led recent negotiations with the US in Geneva, said his country did not ""intend to take any aggressive actions"". ""We will not strike, attack or invade Ukraine,"" he said at a meeting on Moscow. He said the US could not force Moscow to move its troops away from the Ukrainian border. ""They are on our territory and we won't be making any changes to their movement because of external pressure,"" he added. Mr Ryabkov also called on Washington to stop its military support for Ukraine, which he said posed a direct threat to Russian security. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Mr Blinken's visit to Kyiv was described as a bid to ""reinforce the United States' commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"", before talks in Berlin on Thursday with German, French and British counterparts. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who visited Moscow on Tuesday, has warned that any further military escalation ""would carry a high price for the Russian regime - economic, political and strategic"". Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov has urged Western governments to impose immediate sanctions on Moscow. Speaking to the BBC's HardTalk programme, he warned that a Russian invasion of the country could lead to bloodshed and a refugee crisis for Europe. A consignment of light anti-tank missiles arrived in Kyiv from the UK on Tuesday as British ministers urged Moscow to reflect on the brink of a potential conflict in which thousands could die. In an essay published this week,external, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace accused Russia of using Nato as a ""strawman"" to justify an invasion of Ukraine, accusing President Putin of being motivated by ""ethnonationalism"".

Welsh Tory MP says PM's apology may not be enoughStephen Crabb says reports of rule breaking left him 'genuinely let down'.Wales politics,"This video can not be played Watch how Boris Johnson reacts when asked if apologising to the Queen was a moment of shame Boris Johnson's apology for attending a drinks event might not be enough, a Welsh MP has said. Attitudes among Tory MPs against the prime minister have reportedly hardened after Mr Johnson ""categorically"" denied he was warned a drinks party broke Covid rules. Stephen Crabb told a constituent that he felt ""genuinely let down"" by reports of ""blatant breaches"" of restrictions. His comments emerged before a Tory MP defected to the Labour Party. Christian Wakefordwas among the MPs to have written a letter of no confidence in the prime minister, following revelations about lockdown parties in Downing Street. In Prime Minister's Questions, backbench Tory MP and former Brexit secretaryDavid Davis called for Boris Johnson to quit, accusing him of failing to take responsibility for the actions he had taken. ""I take full responsibility for everything done in this government,"" Mr Johnson told him. Mr Crabb's message to his constituent, published by BBCNewsnight journalist Lewis Goodall on Twitter,external, said the Preseli Pembrokeshire MP had ""made the prime minister aware of the strength of feeling that exists in my own community about the events that have taken place at Downing Street"". The former Welsh secretary's comments are the most critical to have come from a Welsh Conservative MP. Stephen Crabb criticised the prime minister in a letter to a constituent The backbencher said he looked forward to seeing the investigation by Sue Gray and he had ""confidence in the work she is doing"". But he said the inquiry is ""limited to certain matters"" and may not be as ""conclusive as some might want"". Of the prime minister, he commented: ""While he may not have attended some of the gatherings being reported, he does have a special responsibility in setting the culture and standards at the heart of government. ""He was right to apologise earlier this week but this may not be a sufficient response given the seriousness of these matters."" Mr Crabb said it was ""incredibly difficult to vote in favour of some of the Covid restrictions over the last two years knowing the impact they would have on families up and down the country"". ""Seeing reports now of blatant breaches of these rules by some of those working within the government I support makes me feel extremely disappointed and genuinely let down."" He added that he was ""discussing this further with my parliamentary colleagues and I will have more to say on this matter in due course"". Cerys Thomas questioned if the Tories had a good alternative to Boris Johnson At the last election in 2019 the constituency of Delyn backed the Conservatives, ousting the Labour incumbent. On Wednesday, at the busy twice-weekly market in Mold, some voters said they still back Boris Johnson - but others want to see him go. John Ryder, from nearby Ruthin, said: ""I'm a Conservative voter. I personally wouldn't have chosen him in the first place, but I think he's had a really hard time with Covid and Brexit going on at the same time. I can understand him making mistakes."" Coming out of a cafe on the High Street, Mold resident Owen Healy said that he doesn't think that Mr Johnson is ""doing very well"". ""It takes the mick a bit how he was going to parties and I wasn't allowed to see my parents. I don't agree with him at all and I think he should be thrown out, to be honest."" Others feel that the situation reflects badly on the political class more widely. Cerys Thomas added: ""I think it reflects badly on politics all round, and that's a shame because there are a lot of people working hard to make good and positive change, and really it makes everybody cynical about it. I think the Conservative Party is struggling to find a good alternative - if there was a good alternative, he'd be gone by now."" This video can not be played In the name of God, go, David Davis tells Boris Johnson In the Commons Newport East MP Jessica Morden questioned why ""is it so hard for this prime minister to admit that he made the rules, so he should know the rules and he should follow the rules"". ""And if he had any shred of compassion for all those out there who've suffered through this he'd go."" Mr Johnson responded: ""I entirely understand people's feelings and I entirely support what she says about obeying the rules when you make the rules, she's completely right."" He urged her to wait to the outcome of the civil service investigation into the allegations. Plaid Cymru Arfon MP Hywel Williams said: ""It's a well known fact that Boris Johnson lies. He was a proven liar before he got to Number 10 and he will continue lying after he's been kicked out of Number 10."" On Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme, former aide to Boris Johnson Guto Harri said it felt like the end was near for the prime minister. ""It sounds like the interview BJ did... has affected the little faith left in him amongst a number of people who won their seats in the last election. ""They were expected to be most faithful because none of them would have won their seats without his presence last time. But it does seem like they are now turning on him."" Delyth Miles, membership secretary of Grassroots Conservatives, called on Conservative MPs to ""pause and think very very carefully about what action they take"". A poll carried out by the organisation suggested that 68% of their members were opposed to Boris Johnson resigning. Only 38% supported the vote of no confidence. Speaking on Newsnight, Ms Miles, a Tory chairwoman in Clacton in Essex, said that it was ""incredibly disappointing"" that some members were calling on the prime minister to go. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies met Mr Johnson and other cabinet ministers in London on Tuesday to ""stress the importance of tackling the priorities of the Welsh public such as the cost of living and ensuring moving forward we learn to live with Covid free from restrictions that hold back our economy"".

PG Tips maker will not raise Â£50bn bid for rival,"Consumer goods giant Unilever has said it ""will not increase"" its Â£50bn offer for GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) healthcare arm after the bid was rejected. The PG Tips and Dove soap maker said it had considered evidence from GSK, but said it had not changed its view on the value of the business. GSK's health products business owns brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste, Panadol and Centrum vitamins. Unilever had previously said a deal would be a ""strong strategic fit"". The Marmite manufacturer says it wants a bigger slice of the health and hygiene sectors. But in a statement on Wednesday, the company said it would ""not increase our offer above Â£50bn"". ""We note the recently shared financial assumptions from the current owners of GSK Consumer Healthcare and have determined that it does not change our view on fundamental value,"" it added. Unilever said it was committed to ""maintaining strict financial discipline"" to ensure that ""acquisitions create value for our shareholders"". Unilever looks set to continue pursuing mega deal Marmite-owner Unilever bids for GSK consumer arm Shares in Unilever rose 4.5% after Wednesday's announcement, having fallen sharply on Monday. Unilever is the third largest company on London's FTSE 100 index and is worth around Â£100bn. A deal would see it take over one of the biggest divisions of the FTSE 100's fifth biggest company. GSK, which runs its healthcare operation in a joint venture with US drug maker Pfizer, has previously said it wants to offload the division. The company has rejected three Unilever offers, saying the proposals ""fundamentally failed"" to reflect the value of the business.

Face mask rules and Covid passes to end in England,"This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister announces plans to end Plan B measures in England England's Plan B measures are to end from next Thursday, with mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports both dropped, Boris Johnson has announced. The prime minister also said the government would immediately drop its advice for people to work from home. The PM said England was reverting to ""Plan A"" due to boosters and how people had followed Plan B measures. He told MPs scientists believed the Omicron wave had peaked nationally. At a Downing Street press conference, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This is a moment we can all be proud of. ""It's a reminder of what this country can accomplish when we all work together."" But, he said, this should not be seen as the ""finish line"" because the virus and future variants cannot be eradicated - instead ""we must learn to live with Covid in the same way we live with flu"". He urged people to continue taking steps to keep the virus at bay, including hand washing, ventilating rooms and self-isolating if positive - and pressed those who were unvaccinated to come forward to get their jabs. Earlier, in a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, the prime minister said: Mandatory Covid passports for entering nightclubs and large events would end, though organisations could choose to use the NHS Covid pass if they wished People would no longer be advised to work from home and should discuss their return to offices with employers Face masks will no longer be mandated, though people are still advised to wear coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces and when meeting strangers From Thursday, secondary school pupils will no longer have to wear face masks in classrooms and government guidance on their use in communal areas would be removed ""shortly"" Further announcements on the easing of travel rules and restrictions on care home visits in England are expected in the coming days, Boris Johnson added. 'Plan B was a catastrophe for our coffee shop' Covid infections falling across the UK, says ONS How are Covid rules changing next week? The prime minister also said the government intended to end the legal requirement for people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate - and replace it with advice and guidance. The current regulations around self-isolation expire on 24 March. Mr Johnson said he expected not to renew them then - and suggested that date could be brought forward if the data allows. Citing thelatest infection study by the Office for National Statistics,external, Mr Johnson said its data showed that infections levels were falling in England. He also said hospital admissions had stabilised and scientists believed ""it is likely that the Omicron wave has now peaked nationally"". However, he said he did expect cases to continue rising in primary schools and pointed to significant pressures on the NHS in north-east and north-west England. Looking ahead, Mr Johnson said the government would set out its long-term strategy for living with coronavirus. He urged people to ""remain cautious"" during the last weeks of winter as there were still ""significant pressures"" on the NHS and the pandemic was ""not over"". In response, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would back lifting Plan B measures ""as long as the science says it is safe"" and accused the prime minister of being ""too distracted"" to have a ""robust plan to live well with Covid"". School leaders' unions said Covid remained a challenge for schools, with high numbers of staff and pupils absent. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the end of face coverings in classrooms, but warned the government risked giving the impression the crisis was over when there was still huge disruption in education. And the Royal College of Nursing said dropping Plan B would do ""nothing to ease the pressure on the NHS"". ""We can't rely on the vaccine alone when the situation is still so precariously balanced,"" its chief executive Pat Cullen said. But for the hospitality sector, which suffered as people worked from home and were cautious over Omicron, there was relief. Industry group UKHospitality said businesses could now begin their revival and recovery. The whole of Plan B is going. But is it too soon? Infections levels, while falling, are still well above what they were last winter. And hospital admissions have only just started coming down. The fact remains that England - and the rest of the UK for that matter - is one of the best protected nations when you combine the immunity built up by vaccination and previous infection. This does not mean people will not catch the virus in the future, but it does limit how many will become seriously ill. What's more, this Omicron wave appears to have peaked at just over 2,000 hospital admissions a day - very much best-case scenario territory. This has given both ministers and the scientists advising them confidence that it's at least time to ease restrictions. Others will argue this is going too far, too quickly. But in the end it comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. And certainly you have to wonder what impact the politics involved in this has had - the Tory backbenchers were unlikely to vote to keep any part of Plan B. But in the end it also comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. There is a trade-off that has to be made between the costs of such restrictions and the benefits they bring. With the worst of the Omicron wave almost certainly over, the benefits were reducing. The latest Covid restrictions were first introduced in December to try to slow the spread of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant and allow time for the booster vaccine rollout. UK daily infections remain high but are falling - on Wednesday, the UK recorded 108,069 new cases. Dr Susan Hopkins, the UK Health Security Agency's chief medical adviser, said case rates would largely decline but ""may plateau at some point"". Vaccine uptake and mask wearing around strangers would determine how quickly that happens, she added. Hospital admissions also appear to be decreasing. However, there is a lag between people catching the virus and becoming seriously ill so deaths are continuing to rise - and are up 14.7% on last week. On Wednesday, 359 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded. Nearly 37 million boosters have been given across the UK so far. RULES:What are the latest rules in the UK?

In Wales, crowds will return to sporting events from Friday and nightclubs can reopen the following week. In Northern Ireland, nightclubs remain closed and indoor standing events are not allowed.

How Boris Johnson's future hangs in the balance,"The prime minister will face Sir Keir Starmer again in the Commons at lunchtime. Boris Johnson will know, though, that some of his fiercest critics will be sitting behind, and not in front of, him. Half a dozen of his own MPs have publicly called for him to go, and some others are privately of the same view. He will, of course, expect to hear cheers from supporters and from some other colleagues who want to rally round in the face of Labour attacks. Perhaps more crucially, though, are a disparate group of MPs that you might call ""considerers"". They are weighing up whether to submit letters of no confidence, which would trigger a leadership contest. They will be listening closely to his answers. So what - for now - is holding them back? Most Conservative MPs will say they will await the conclusion of the investigation into the gatherings in Downing Street by the senior civil servant Sue Gray before deciding how to proceed. One of those who has already called for Mr Johnson's departure has urged his colleagues ""to grow some"". He said he had 1,500 hostile letters from constituents and ""this can't go on"". But in truth some of those colleagues tell me they are merely awaiting the completion of ""due process"". Virtually irrespective of what Sue Gray says, they will join the cacophonous chorus calling for him to go in due course. One of them said he was simply waiting for other colleagues to ""catch up"" with the conclusion he had reached. For others, though, it matters hugely what Ms Gray says. Although she won't sit in judgement of the prime minister, and will simply set out the facts, it will be important to some leadership-sceptics which facts she sets out. One of them told me that if she can substantiate Dominic Cummings's claim that the prime minister was told about the nature of the event on 20 May 2020 - that was a social not a work gathering - then more letters of no confidence were likely to go in as MPs would feel they had been misled by the prime minister. Sue Gray's report could come out soon This, of course, may not materialise - the prime ministerhimself denied again on Tuesdaythat he was warned the event could be against the rules. Dominic Cummings has allegedin his blog,externalthat the prime minister had been told. This, too, puts pressure on Sue Gray to investigate the claims, and avoid any impression of a whitewash. That said, if Sue Gray merely uncovers evidence that the civil servant Martin Reynolds was warned about proceeding with the event, some MPs will be content to see a clear-out of No 10 officials, and their potential rebellion could fade. One well-placed MP declared ""she is not going to throw the prime minster under a bus"" - and that a plan was in place for staffing changes at No 10. And a former cabinet minister told me he expected ""deputy heads to roll"" in order to save the prime minister. He did not believe Mr Johnson could remain in No 10 until the next election, but that he could stave off an immediate threat. For some Conservative MPs there are other considerations. One MP told me he was on the verge of sending a no-confidence email, but key figures in his constituency association - the grassroots Tories who selected him and campaigned for him - wanted to support the prime minister - and, more widely, there is polling which suggests he has retained more support amongst activists than voters. However, there is significant pressure from Conservative voters. At least one constituency association has been checking negative letters and emails against the list of supporters that they would canvass at election time, and that has made grim reading. Many MPs say the incoming criticism goes beyond ""the usual suspects"". And this in turn could yet tip the balance against the prime minister. So far cabinet ministers are staying solid. But the thin blue line of junior ministers is under strain. Maria Caulfield is one minister who has been critical of her boss the prime minister Junior minister Maria Caulfield posted on Facebook that she ""fully appreciates the depth of anger on this issue"" amongst her constituents and that ""it is clear the spirit of the rules"" was broken. Science minister George Freeman made clear that he was angry about staff in No 10 holding parties - though he would not pass judgment at this stage on the prime minister. And privately another junior minister has said that her postbag isn't just critical of the prime minister but increasingly hostile to her. She is not - even off the record - calling for the prime minister to go yet - but the prospect of ""party-gate"" sullying the reputations of those who had nothing to do with the gatherings has touched a raw nerve. If the prime minister's future is in the balance, this may in due course put more weight on the ""go"" rather than ""stay"" scale. It's been suggested that some sceptical MPs will rally round because they do not want to indulge a ""Dominic Cummings coup"" against an elected leader. And that this could perhaps move the balance back in the PM's favour. But that he is the source of some - and by no means all - of the allegations against the PM isn't weighing heavily on the minds of some of the considerers. One of the 2019 intake was under no illusions about Mr Cummings' role, but nonetheless felt that his attacks would have misfired if the prime minister himself had not given him the ammunition. A former minister told me: ""Just because he is the source of a story is not a reason to ignore the story."" And there are concerns that Mr Cummings will come forward with more claims even after Sue Gray reports, and this will be corrosive if the prime minister stays in No 10. So far it's been fellow Brexiteers - such as Andrew Bridgen and Tim Loughton - who have publicly urged the prime minister to go. Worryingly for him, these also tend to be people sceptical of lockdown measures. So one aspect of his fightback - the lifting of restrictions in England later this month - won't suddenly get them to reverse their view. But what of those who were perhaps more sceptical of Boris Johnson all along? TheOne Nation group,externalof MPs met behind closed doors on Monday night. They had gathered to hear from the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson on Northern Ireland - a party which has had its own leadership problems - and the question of Conservative leadership came up in the second half of the meeting. MPs shared tales of dismal postbags and I'm told there was an ""intense"" discussion on what to do. While broadly there was a feeling of ""inevitability"", there were different views on timing. One MP told me he was against triggering a confidence vote now, because he feared ""Boris Johnson could win"" and ""we would be stuck with him for the next two years"". But one of his colleagues favoured a swifter move because he felt that unless Mr Johnson won a confidence vote convincingly ""he will be handed the pearl-handled revolver"". ANALYSIS:What was really going on in No 10 during lockdown? LAURA KUENSSBERG:Is 'pork pie plot' a serious threat to the PM? REALITY CHECK:The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held PROFILE:What is Sue Gray investigating? TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings How the timing of a contest would play with the public is weighing on some people's minds - would it look less indulgent to move after potentially poor local elections in May rather than in the midst of a pandemic? And would it be better if Mr Johnson took the hit for national insurance rises and increased energy costs in the spring rather than his successor? ""It's all about the pace at which this occurs"" - and not whether it will occur - according to a former minister. But some MPs are already mulling over what would come next. One MP who has not been publicly critical of the prime minister is simply concerned that any replacement would not be as effective at appealing to first-time Conservative voters. ""Do we really want a dull manager as leader?"" he mused. And those who are likely to seek to replace him do not seem to be in an immediate rush. Letters of no confidence are sent to Sir Graham Brady - the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. He is the very personification of discretion so estimates of how many letters he has received - 54 would lead to a confidence vote, which in turn would trigger a leadership contest if the prime minister loses that vote - are hugely speculative. One former minister believes the sheer volume of public complaint makes it likely that more letters may have been, or will be, quietly submitted by his colleagues without much flourish or co-ordination. And just 24 hours before PMQs a group of around 20 MPs elected at the 2019 election met behind closed doors at Westminster, where the mood was said to be hardening - with the possibility that more no-confidence letters are submitted after PMQs. Will two Tory tribes go to war with the PM? The Northern Research Group of MPs also met privately on Tuesday afternoon. So it may take little more to tip the balance. But, of course, letters can be withdrawn as well as submitted - so the prime minister's performance at PMQs, and then the tone of his response to Sue Gray, may yet tip the balance back in his favour. And while Labour is publicly claiming it is in the ""national interest"" for Mr Johnson to go, privately shadow ministers believe it's in their party interest if he continues in office. So if Sir Keir Starmer succeeds in further wounding the prime minister, it will be his own MPs who will have to decide whether it's better to then move in for the kill.

'Plan B was catastrophe for our coffee shop',"James Greenhalgh says Plan B restrictions were ""a disaster"" for his cafe Working-from-home guidance has been lifted but the owner of one coffee shop that relies on office workers says he's still nervous about the future. ""Ask me in a month how I'm doing,"" says James Greenhalgh, the owner of Leeds-based Flamingos Coffee House. He believes it will take months before confidence comes back. Other firms are more positive about the changes in England, with one nightclub saying his customers will feel happier once Covid passes have been dropped. Advice for people towork from home if they can in England has been droppedimmediately. The requirement for mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports will both be dropped from next Thursday. Stephen Spensley, one of the directors of Stereo nightclub in Middlesbrough, said removing the need to show a Covid pass at the door would make his customers feel more welcome. Customers had worried about the passes, sharply reducing the numbers coming to his 300-capacity club in the run-up to Christmas, Mr Spensley said. While concern about the virus had eased in January, the requirement to show proof of either vaccination or a recent negative lateral flow test was still putting some customers off, he said. ""I think our demographic of 18 to 25-year-old clients will feel a lot freer, because a lot of them are hesitant about getting the vaccine,"" Mr Spensely said. Meanwhile, Mr Greenhalgh said the reintroduction of working-from-home guidance in December had been ""a catastrophe"" for his coffee shop and ""custom went off a cliff"". December is normally his busiest trading period, and sustains the shop in the early part of the next year. ""These are normally the busiest days of the year, and there were days when we were stood around, and no-one came in,"" he said. ""It's been a disaster."" Face mask rules and Covid passes to end in England Thousands of hospitality businesses have been hit hard by the pandemic, and Plan B restrictions helped push many into trouble, according to insolvency firm Real Business Rescue. In December, for example, more than 6,100 bars and pubs were in ""significant financial distress"" it said, more than a fifth more than in the same period last year. Restaurant owner David Abrahamovitch says his physical shops were hit hard by restrictions But some cafÃ© businesses have managed to diversify. One coffee business that has expanded into e-commerce is Grind, which has eight shops in London. It started selling compostable Nespresso-compatible coffee pods before the pandemic, and business has taken off, according to founder and chief executive David Abrahamovitch. ""That side of the business was helped by Plan B,"" he says. ""If people are working at home they are more likely to drink [coffee] at home."" He is expecting the business to have made Â£20m in sales for the year, and has plans to expand into the US and Europe after a cash injection of Â£22m, mainly from UK investor Richard Koch. Stereo nightclub in Middlesbrough lost custom due to Covid passes, Stephen Spensley says Michael Kill, of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), said clubs in England had lost around 20% of their footfall while Covid passes were in place. The ""debilitating restrictions"" had meant queues outside clubs were longer, he said, because security staff were trying to check Covid passes on top of checking people's age ID, in low lighting. ""What we're finding when people come up is there's frustration, from the challenges around exemptions, to civil liberties, accusations of discrimination."" Mr Kill said without question the sector would need further financial support from the government. Mr Spensely said the extra Covid pass checks had added 20% to his staffing costs because he needs twice the number of security staff at the entrance. ""Its an extra layer of bureaucracy"" said Mr Spensely ""It slows the queue right down."" Peter Marks, chief executive of Rekom, which has 42 venues including chains Pryzm, Bar&Beyond, Eden and Fiction, said vaccine passports ""took 30% off our business"". ""I'm not as critical as you'd think of Covid passports,"" he said. ""It's better than being shut, but it definitely affected us."" Tristan Moffat, operations director of The Piano Works, which has two late night live music venues in central London, said ""there'll be a lot of jubilation"" about Wednesday's announcement. ""We're certainly delighted about it,"" he said. While Covid passes had caused frustration among some customers, others had found them reassuring. But other aspects of the Plan B restrictions, such as working from home guidance, had taken a ""huge toll"" on the business, as mid-week trade had fallen away, he said. Industry group UK Hospitality said the removal of restrictions was ""a key milestone on the road to recovery for the sector"". ""Lifting the working from home recommendation is a particularly important move as it enables town and city centres, and the businesses that are their lifeblood, to begin their revival and recovery,"" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls.

US and UK finally agree talks on steel tariffs,"The US and UK have begun formal negotiations over Trump-era tariffs on UK steel and aluminium exports. Trade officials in both countries said they were committed to an ""expeditious outcome"" that would help preserve metals manufacturers in both markets. The trade dispute has been a longstanding thorn in relations between the two allies. The US reached a deal to remove border taxes on European metals shipments last year. Under the Trump administration, the US imposed a 25% duty on foreign steel and 15% tax on foreign aluminium, setting off a firestorm of criticism - especially from allies, including the UK, who imposed tariffs on some US goods, such as whiskey, in retaliation. The US has since lifted some of the measures, which were supported by many steel-makers in the US. Under President Joe Biden, it has reached a deal with Europe and has started negotiations on the issue with Japan. But British exporters continue to face the border taxes. One UK steel exporter has already said it is shifting production to Spain as a result. United Cast Bar Limitedtold the BBCit was unlikely to move production back to the UK once it had been moved, unless an agreement was reached with the US very quickly. UK steel future uncertain without US tariffs deal US will remove steel tariffs 'when time is right' In a statement announcing the start of talks, UK and US trade officials said: ""Both parties are committed to working towards an expeditious outcome that ensures the viability of steel and aluminium industries in both markets against the continuing shared challenge of global excess capacity and strengthens their democratic alliance."" The statement followed a virtual meeting between UK Secretary of State for International Trade Anne-Marie Trevelyan and United States Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai also signed onto the statement. Ms Trevelyan called Wednesday's meeting ""productive"", and said ""we want a resolution as soon as possible which supports UK businesses and further strengthens our trading relationship"". The UK steel lobby welcomed the news. It said the existing tariffs had reduced UK exports by nearly 50%. ""That a few weeks into 2022 a resolution appears to be in sight is hugely welcome news to the steel sector and steelworkers across the UK,"" UK Steel said. ""Given the competitive disadvantage created by the EU deal, it is vital that these talks are concluded swiftly to limit any additional damage to UK producers."" The industry body added that it hoped the UK would be able to get an even better deal with the US than the European Union as it ""put its new independent trade powers to full use"". American whiskey-makers, whose exports to the UK have dropped by more than half since UK retaliatory tariffs came into effect in 2018, also said they hoped a deal would come soon. ""Securing the immediate removal of the UK's 25% tariff on American whiskeys helps support U.S. jobs as the economy seeks to recover from the harsh economic impacts and significant supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Rob Maron of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. The statement from the US and UK said joint measures to address over-production in China would be a focus of future discussions. They blamed the country for creating ""excess capacity"", which they said had created ""distortions that...pose a serious threat to market-oriented steel and aluminium industries in the United Kingdom and the United States, and to the workers in those industries"". They said the talks were focused on finding a way to partner ""to promote high standards, address shared concerns and hold countries that practise harmful market-distorting policies to account"". After this ministerial meeting, talks between UK and US officials begin on Thursday and the UK side is keen for them to progress at pace and be wrapped up in weeks, not months. The joint statement gives them something to work on. It puts the blame for global excess capacity in the steel and aluminium industries ""largely"" on China, and says the distortion that causes poses a problem for companies and workers in both the UK and the US. Neither side wants their trade dispute to worsen, so pointing a finger at a rival third party is one way out. UK steel companies are also desperately keen to get the 25% tariffs on their exports removed as soon as possible - it puts them at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to their EU counterparts. But there are other political considerations. There is still concern in Washington about the entirely separate negotiations on Northern Ireland between the UK and the EU, and British threats to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Put it this way: if the talks on Northern Ireland take a negative turn, that will certainly not make a resolution of the steel dispute any easier. So, it will be interesting to see whether the Americans share the British desire to get this sorted within weeks. If they do, that will be welcome news in London. If they don't, pressure on the UK government to step up its retaliatory measures will intensify.

LiveLiveCovid rules being eased but this is not the end - Javid4 minutes ago,"Omicron is ""in retreat"", Health Secretary Sajid Javid says, with the UK now marking the start of a new chapter in the fight against Covid-19 This is a ""major milestone"" but not the finish line, he tells a No 10 press conference, adding: ""We must learn to live with Covid"" Earlier Boris Johnson announced an end to Plan B Covid restrictions in England Working from home guidance ends today and from tomorrow, face masks will no longer be required in any classrooms From next Thursday, masks will not be mandated anywhere and Covid passes will no longer be needed at large events People who test positive for Covid will still have to self-isolate but Javid said that could not continue forever The UK has reported 108,069 new daily Covid cases and 359 deaths with Covid on Wednesday Edited by Emma Owen and George Bowden We're ending our live coverage of coronavirus developments today. Thank you for joining us. Your writers were Adam Durbin, Malu Cursino, Chris Giles, Doug Faulkner and George Wright. The page was edited by Emma Owen, George Bowden and Kevin Ponniah. As we draw our live coverage to a close - here's a summary of the key coronavirus developments: Elsewhere, and a folk singer from the Czech Republic has died after deliberately catching Covid, her son has told the BBC. Hana Horka, 57, was unvaccinated and had posted on social media that she was recovering after testing positive, but died two days later. Her son, Jan Rek, said she got infected on purpose when he and his father had the virus, so she could get a recovery pass to access certain venues. The Czech Republic reported a record number of cases on Wednesday. Read the full story here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the consequences of seeing so much infection, so much spread of the virus, is that we're seeing a growing number of what are called ""coincidental deaths"". This is where people test have tested positive but they haven't been sick with the virus. Then they have died within 28 days of that positive test but it is nothing to do with the positive test and we're beginning to see more of this. I think the Office of National Statistics is going to have a look at this so we have a real idea of just how many people are dying due to the virus. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Away from changes to restrictions - an inquiry is being launched into children who are not attending school in the wake of national lockdowns, the children's commissioner for England has said. Dame Rachel de Souza toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programmeabout 95% of children were usually in school at this time of year - but now, this figure was about 87%. Some absences were down to illness and Covid, she said, but other children had simply failed to return following classroom closures during the pandemic. In addition, between 80,000 and 100,000 children were not on any school rolls at all, she said. ""Literally, I am going to go out and find them,"" she added. The Department for Education said its ""top priority"" was supporting children to attend school and college. You canread the full story here. For anyone just catching up with our coverage, you can watch some of the key moments from Health Secretary Sajid Javid speaking at the news conference about the end of Plan B in England. This video can not be played UK Covid: End of Plan B in England 'not the finish', says Sajid Javid Sajid Javid has just hosted a news conference at Downing Street. Here are the key points: Meanwhile, the UK has reported 108,069 new daily Covid cases and 359 deaths with Covid on Wednesday.  The Financial Times asks about the ""ongoing anger"" in the UK over Downing Street parties, and Javid says he has also been angered and pained by the revelations. He adds Boris Johnson has rightly apologised and reiterates calls for people to wait for the outcome of an investigation into the lockdown gatherings in No 10 and other government departments. In response to a follow up question about evidence for decision making, the health secretary says the government has been transparent throughout the pandemic and would will continue to be so. Javid adds the government is looking at expanding the definition of fully vaccinated to three doses of a vaccine, rather than the current two jabs. The news conference ends. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says Covid case numbers have declined and adds âitâs peopleâs behaviour that is going to make the difference over the next four weeksâ. She says people need to be careful when returning to the office and also take care using public transport, indoor spaces and in crowded places. She recommends people continue to wear face coverings, even thought they wonât be mandatory and to ensure they are fully vaccinated. She says the more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we will see mass Covid transmission. The health secretary is challenged by Jane Merrick from the i newspaper as to whether Boris Johnson just ""got lucky"" that Plan B worked. The journalist says the PM wanted stronger restrictions but was blocked by members of his cabinet and Tory MPs. Javid responds by saying Johnson ""has shown leadership throughout"" and that he has had to balance conflicting issues and come to a judgement over restrictions. ""The decision that he made to absolutely focus on boosters has been vindicated,"" he says. Asked if he can rule out the return of Plan B if a new variant of concern emerges, Javid says ""this pandemic is still with us"" and ""this is not the end of the road"". ""There will be future variants,"" he warns. On whether the current daily Covid death toll of 359 is something the country needs to be comfortable with in the future, the health secretary says vaccines have meant the death rate has fallen dramatically. He adds the Omicron variant is milder than previous variants and if you look at the average daily death rate, it is around 200 people. Javid says it is important to point out that around 40% of people with Covid in hospital are there not because they have Covid, but have tested positive after being admitted. Asked whether the UK will be effectively be living with no restrictions by the end of March, Javid points out that a third of all UK cases since the pandemic began are linked to Omicron. He says that there will still be some requirements and restrictions, including lateral flow tests for those arriving in England. ""But we are going to have to find a way to remove almost all of these restrictions and get life back to normal with one or two things there for a while,"" Javid adds, citing annual vaccinations for some of those most at risk, as well as testing and anti-virals. Asked by Sky News about plans to end self-isolation rules entirely, Sajid Javid says no decision has yet been taken. He adds it is important to keep this in place for the moment, but the evidence will be under constant review. It is reasonable that the government will eventually no longer legally require people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate, he says, making the point that people with flu are not asked to do so. Earlier Javid said the UK needed to learn to live with Covid in the long-term, as it does with flu. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks Sajid Javid: ""How can the PM continue to lead the country when one of his most senior MPs in the Commons has called on him to resign?"" Javid says that ""what we've seen in the last few weeks... has caused a lot of pain and anger"". He says that he absolutely understands this and that Johnson has rightly apologised and asked for time and space for an investigation to be completed. The PM will be happy to be scrutinised when the facts have been established, Javid adds.  Michelle from Lincolnshire asks about the reduction of the self-isolation period to 5 days with two negative tests. In response Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says people with two negative tests can be released earlier as it allows people to return to work and school. She explains the change is in response to emerging evidence. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency has been outlining the NHS' successful booster campaign. She says: âWe have now got, compared to comparable countries across Europe and North America, the highest rate of boosters in our population overall.â She adds âthe strongest defence we have against the Omicron wave that weâre now experiencing and any future waves of variantsâ¦ is vaccination.â Christina from Berkshire asks Javid if, given the increasing number of hospitalisation of children with Covid-19, there are plans to vaccinate children under 12. Javid says the focus at the moment is on children over 12, but that she is right to raise younger children. He says that the advice from independent experts is that the under-12s who are at risk should be vaccinated. But the experts are considering whether to widen this advice to all under-12s like in other countries. Javid says the NHS is still facing ""significant pressure"" and says the country must ""proceed with caution"". ""A pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint"", he says. The health secretary reiterates calls for people to continue to get vaccinated and boosted, adding it was ""the jabs that have got us this far and the jabs can keep us here too"". Laying out the plans for removing Plan B restrictions, Javid says the government is also looking at removing mandatory self-isolation for people who contract Covid-19. He adds they intend to set out plans to reduce restrictions on visiting care homes soon. The health secretary adds that removing restrictions is a ""major milestone but not the end of the road"" and the government intends to set out its plan for living with Covid in the coming weeks. ""We shouldnât
see this as the finish line,"" he says. ""We cannot eradicate this virus and its future variants."" Javid says Plan B succeeded giving the government extra time to combat Omicron and the newest data shows Omicron is ""in retreat"". The health secretary adds that hospitalisations have fallen and patients in intensive care are at the same levels as they were in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

US accuses Russia of seeking to weaken Ukraine,"Belarus's defence ministry released photos showing Russian troops and tanks arriving for drills US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said Russia could attack Ukraine ""on very short notice"" and warned again of tough sanctions if it did. He was speaking on a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv after months of tension over a Russian military build-up near Ukraine's borders. Stressing the US's close ties with Ukraine, Mr Blinken vowed ""relentless"" diplomacy to stop Russian aggression. Moscow has denied any plans to attack or invade. Russia has made a raft of demands to Western governments, including that Ukraine should never join Nato and that the defensive alliance's military activities should be limited in member states including Poland. Talks between the West and Russia last week failed to reach a breakthrough, with some of Moscow's demands rejected as non-starters. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 after the overthrow of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine. It has supported pro-Russian rebels who control parts of eastern Ukraine after they fought a bloody war with government forces. There are fears that the conflict, which cost at least 13,000 lives and caused at least two million people to flee their homes, may reignite, with the Russian military openly intervening. Mr Blinken said Russia had built up troops near Ukraine's borders with ""no provocation, no reason"". ""We know that there are plans in place to increase that force even more on very short notice, and that gives President [Vladimir] Putin the capacity, also on very short notice, to take further aggressive action against Ukraine,"" he said. He accused Russia of trying to weaken Ukraine's diplomatic institutions and divide Ukrainian society ""using everything from election interference to disinformation to cyber attacks"". He pledged ""relentless diplomatic efforts to prevent renewed aggression and to promote dialogue and peace"", and repeated a warning of tough sanctions against Russia in the event of an invasion. Mr Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart in Geneva on Friday, after talks with European allies in Berlin. Antony Blinken met Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv A picture, they say, is worth a thousand words. So on a day when the White House warned that a Russian attack on Ukraine could come ""at any point"", American Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew almost 8,000km to appear in front of cameras with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and reiterate the close ties between the two nations. He cautioned Russian President Vladimir Putin that there would be severe consequences if he opted for military action and promised continued defensive and financial support for the Ukrainian government. Given evidence of a Russian disinformation campaign to convince Ukrainians that the US is abandoning the Eastern European nation - drawing comparisons to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan - such a show of support was particularly welcomed by senior Ukrainian officials. Meanwhile, on the streets of Kyiv, everyday life is continuing as normal. Pedestrians waved and took photographs of Mr Blinken's motorcade as it passed along ice-encrusted streets. There is no sense of panic or undue concern even amid headlines of Russian troops amassing along the nation's borders. Time may tell whether this is mass denial or a sense of steely resolve for the challenges that lie ahead. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led recent negotiations with the US in Geneva, said his country did not ""intend to take any aggressive actions"". ""We will not strike, attack or invade Ukraine,"" he said at a meeting on Moscow. He said the US could not force Moscow to move its troops away from the Ukrainian border. ""They are on our territory and we won't be making any changes to their movement because of external pressure,"" he added. Mr Ryabkov also called on Washington to stop its military support for Ukraine, which he said posed a direct threat to Russian security. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Mr Blinken's visit to Kyiv was described as a bid to ""reinforce the United States' commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"", before talks in Berlin on Thursday with German, French and British counterparts. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who visited Moscow on Tuesday, has warned that any further military escalation ""would carry a high price for the Russian regime - economic, political and strategic"". Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov has urged Western governments to impose immediate sanctions on Moscow. Speaking to the BBC's HardTalk programme, he warned that a Russian invasion of the country could lead to bloodshed and a refugee crisis for Europe. A consignment of light anti-tank missiles arrived in Kyiv from the UK on Tuesday as British ministers urged Moscow to reflect on the brink of a potential conflict in which thousands could die. In an essay published this week,external, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace accused Russia of using Nato as a ""strawman"" to justify an invasion of Ukraine, accusing President Putin of being motivated by ""ethnonationalism"".

Hana Horka, 57, was unvaccinated and had posted on social media that she was recovering after testing positive, but died two days later. Her son, Jan Rek, said she got infected on purpose when he and his father had the virus, so she could get a recovery pass to access certain venues. The Czech Republic reported a record number of cases on Wednesday. Read the full story here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the consequences of seeing so much infection, so much spread of the virus, is that we're seeing a growing number of what are called ""coincidental deaths"". This is where people test have tested positive but they haven't been sick with the virus. Then they have died within 28 days of that positive test but it is nothing to do with the positive test and we're beginning to see more of this. I think the Office of National Statistics is going to have a look at this so we have a real idea of just how many people are dying due to the virus.

Dame Rachel de Souza toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programmeabout 95% of children were usually in school at this time of year - but now, this figure was about 87%. Some absences were down to illness and Covid, she said, but other children had simply failed to return following classroom closures during the pandemic. In addition, between 80,000 and 100,000 children were not on any school rolls at all, she said. ""Literally, I am going to go out and find them,"" she added.

For anyone just catching up with our coverage, you can watch some of the key moments from Health Secretary Sajid Javid speaking at the news conference about the end of Plan B in England. This video can not be played UK Covid: End of Plan B in England 'not the finish', says Sajid Javid Sajid Javid has just hosted a news conference at Downing Street. Here are the key points: Meanwhile, the UK has reported 108,069 new daily Covid cases and 359 deaths with Covid on Wednesday.  The Financial Times asks about the ""ongoing anger"" in the UK over Downing Street parties, and Javid says he has also been angered and pained by the revelations. He adds Boris Johnson has rightly apologised and reiterates calls for people to wait for the outcome of an investigation into the lockdown gatherings in No 10 and other government departments. In response to a follow up question about evidence for decision making, the health secretary says the government has been transparent throughout the pandemic and would will continue to be so. Javid adds the government is looking at expanding the definition of fully vaccinated to three doses of a vaccine, rather than the current two jabs. The news conference ends. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says Covid case numbers have declined and adds âitâs peopleâs behaviour that is going to make the difference over the next four weeksâ. She says people need to be careful when returning to the office and also take care using public transport, indoor spaces and in crowded places. She recommends people continue to wear face coverings, even thought they wonât be mandatory and to ensure they are fully vaccinated. She says the more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we will see mass Covid transmission. The health secretary is challenged by Jane Merrick from the i newspaper as to whether Boris Johnson just ""got lucky"" that Plan B worked. The journalist says the PM wanted stronger restrictions but was blocked by members of his cabinet and Tory MPs. Javid responds by saying Johnson ""has shown leadership throughout"" and that he has had to balance conflicting issues and come to a judgement over restrictions. ""The decision that he made to absolutely focus on boosters has been vindicated,"" he says. Asked if he can rule out the return of Plan B if a new variant of concern emerges, Javid says ""this pandemic is still with us"" and ""this is not the end of the road"". ""There will be future variants,"" he warns. On whether the current daily Covid death toll of 359 is something the country needs to be comfortable with in the future, the health secretary says vaccines have meant the death rate has fallen dramatically. He adds the Omicron variant is milder than previous variants and if you look at the average daily death rate, it is around 200 people. Javid says it is important to point out that around 40% of people with Covid in hospital are there not because they have Covid, but have tested positive after being admitted. Asked whether the UK will be effectively be living with no restrictions by the end of March, Javid points out that a third of all UK cases since the pandemic began are linked to Omicron. He says that there will still be some requirements and restrictions, including lateral flow tests for those arriving in England. ""But we are going to have to find a way to remove almost all of these restrictions and get life back to normal with one or two things there for a while,"" Javid adds, citing annual vaccinations for some of those most at risk, as well as testing and anti-virals. Asked by Sky News about plans to end self-isolation rules entirely, Sajid Javid says no decision has yet been taken. He adds it is important to keep this in place for the moment, but the evidence will be under constant review. It is reasonable that the government will eventually no longer legally require people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate, he says, making the point that people with flu are not asked to do so. Earlier Javid said the UK needed to learn to live with Covid in the long-term, as it does with flu. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks Sajid Javid: ""How can the PM continue to lead the country when one of his most senior MPs in the Commons has called on him to resign?"" Javid says that ""what we've seen in the last few weeks... has caused a lot of pain and anger"". He says that he absolutely understands this and that Johnson has rightly apologised and asked for time and space for an investigation to be completed.

Thanks for joining us on a frantic day in Westminster. The live page today was brought to you by Paul Seddon, Joshua Nevett, Jen Meierhans, George Bowden, Malu Cursino, Dulcie Lee and Jennifer Scott. The page was edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Kevin Ponniah. From all of us, goodnight and take care. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News British politics, particularly Prime Ministerâs Questions, is often compared to a theatre. But like many great dramas, itâs
often a surprising character who provides the plot twist. Todayâs defection to Labour from
the, formerly Tory, MP Christian Wakeford has managed to unite Boris Johnsonâs
critics and supporters on his backbenches. One former minister, who has
strongly criticised the handling of parties in Downing Street, said Wakeford
had provided an âalternative target for rageâ and calmed the mood in the Tory
party. Peers of Christian Wakeford,
elected alongside him in 2019, have described feeling burned - âbetrayedâ, âlet
downâ and upset by his actions. In a party where loyalties were
all over the place last night - Tory MPs have united in feeling his behaviour
was perhaps âdisloyalty gone one step too farâ. But this distraction doesnât
mean Boris Johnson is out of the woods. More than a dozen Tory MPs are believed
to have submitted letters of no confidence in him. The exact number is
still unknown. More Tory MPs are waiting until Sue Grayâs report is published
before expressing their anger publicly. Wakefordâs defection may have
stuck a plaster over some of the Tory party fractures â but last nightâs
briefing war between different groups of the party shows just how fragile the
situation still is for Boris Johnson. Speaking during the No 10 Covid briefing that's going on at the moment, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says ""we have all been pained and angered"" by photos and videos of parties at Downing Street during lockdown - but it is right that Boris Johnson responds after the investigation is concluded. Javid says the prime minister has apologised, and there needs to be ""time and space for the investigation to be completed"". As Boris Johnson battles an attempt from some of his own MPs to end his leadership, it's worth recapping what exactly his Tory critics will have to do to oust him. Under Tory party rules, forcing a vote on his leadership would require 15% of the party's MPs - that's 54 out of 359 - to submit letters of no confidence in him. The letters have to be sent to the chair of the backbench 1922 committee, who by convention does not disclose how many have been sent in unless the threshold is reached. If more than 50% of Tory MPs then approved a motion of no confidence in him, a leadership contest to replace him would then follow. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Douglas Ross has broken ranks with Boris Johnson's government over the Downing Street parties The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, has said he thinks the trigger point for a no confidence vote in Boris Johnsonâs leadership is ânearâ and âgetting closerâ. Ross said he submitted a letter calling for a vote last week and would need 53 other Tory MPs to do the same for that to go ahead. The prime ministerâs spokesperson has confirmed Johnson would fight a formal attempt to oust him. Asked why his calls for the PM to go had not been echoed by other Scottish Tory MPs, Ross said it was âperfectly legitimateâ for them to reach their own conclusions. The Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has said heâs backing Johnson 100% and expressed hope that Ross could change his view if the PM was âexoneratedâ. Health secretary Sajid Javid is giving a Covid-19 briefing Health Secretary Sajid Javid is currently holding a news conference in Downing Street to outline the latest update to Covid guidelines. The conference followsBoris Johnson's announcement to lift Plan B Covid restrictions in England, made earlier today in the House of Commons.

Many here told me that it was not Brexit that persuaded voters to turn to the Conservatives, but the anti-Semitism row, which persuaded them to turn away from Labour at the last general election. One gentleman told me he doesnât think itâs wise of Christian Wakeford to defect to Labour, as he can't see the Jewish community in the constituency - which make up around a fifth of the population - welcoming the move. A couple of loyally Conservative-voting women told me they âreally likeâ Wakeford as an MP. They said that he is very engaged within the community. But one of them told me that she simply cannot stomach voting for him again, as she âcould never vote labourâ. However, a lifelong Labour supporter said she would now give him her vote, and believes his defection reflected well on him. These responses from the people of Prestwich might be predictably party loyal. But what will be interesting is whether voters feel that Labour has done enough to distance itself from the anti-Semitism row, or whether that remains an obstacle to their support for their newly Labour MP. The Labour Party's youth wing has not welcomed the decision to accept MP Christian Wakeford. In a tweet, Young Labour said that Wakeford had ""consistently voted against the interests of working-class people"". Since the announcement from Wakeford and the Labour Party earlier today, there have been several calls for a by-election. In 2020,Wakeford supported a backbench bill,external, which called for any MP who switches parties to face a recall petition. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

the last election. âI am disgusted,â she tells me. âI voted for the party. He should resign and we should
have an election.â Her husband Fred agrees: âHe should not have the right to go to Labour."" On the table next to them is 51-year-old Maxine Ballington. She

Asked if the prime minister still thought he was the best man for the job, his press secretary replied: ""Yes."" She said the prime minister would continue meeting with MPs this afternoon. She also denied reports that Johnson had been in tears at a meeting yesterday and said that he was ""entirely focused on his job and on delivering for the British people"".

Asked if, as far as Sir Keir Starmer is concerned, there is no principle requiring anyone who defects from one party to another to stand for re-election, the spokesman said: ""Correct."" On whether Wakeford will face a trigger ballot in the coming months, the spokesman added: ""We'll set out all of the process, obviously, once we've had a chance to speak to people, the relevant people that vote in the local party and nationally, and we'll happily set out the process at that point.

Pressure for change after young teacher's killing,"At vigils in Ashling Murphy's memory there have been calls to address violence against women The killing of Ashling Murphy has amplified calls in Ireland for more to be done to tackle violence against women. The country's justice minister has said she intends to publisha new national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence,externalin March. Women's groups have said they are optimistic that progress is being made. But they have also warned of the need to be alert to a ""backlash"" and attempts to frustrate change. The new strategy has been in the works since July when the Irish government published an independent audit on how responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was dealt with across different agencies and departments. Among the audit's recommendations were the setting up of a dedicated office to deal with the issue and that all funding and commissioning of services should fall under the Department of Justice. Justice Minister Helen McEntee said: ""We must come together to demand zero tolerance of violence against women. As minister for justice, I am working to ensure we have a society that does not tolerate this any longer."" ClÃ­ona SaidlÃ©ar, executive director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland, told BBC News NI it was ""critical"" to have a single focus point. ""As terrible as Covid has been, it has also helped [collaboration] because we worked really closely across the statutory and the NGO sector around responding to that crisis,"" she said. ""What we have learned there is that it has to be a collaborative effort."" Teacher's killing a 'depraved act of violence' 'Community is needed to overcome such evil' 'Only something powerful can come out of this' But Dr SaidlÃ©ar added that while it was important to have a ""checklist"" of changes within agencies and professions, there was also a bigger picture that needed to be addressed. ""We need to think big - because actually what we are doing here is to transform the culture, we are trying to socially engineer our whole culture out of a habit of generations into something new,"" she said. ""When misogyny is overcome, then we can actually look at gender equality in a serious way and look at lasting and substantial changes there."" SiobhÃ¡n says more people are talking about harassment and violence against women since Ashling Murphy's murder Ashling Murphy's killing brought back memories of a sinister encounter for Galway woman SiobhÃ¡n O'Riordan, who shared her story in the days following the young teacher's death. When SiobhÃ¡n was younger, she was chatting to someone online who claimed to be her age, but when she felt something ""off"" about them, she stopped the conversation. Later that day, when she went for a walk, she was approached by a middle-aged man she had never met, who knew her name. Feeling worried and on edge, she spotted one of her friends' mothers and shouted to her, which she said startled the man and he walked away. ""Back then I thought nothing really happened, what am I supposed to say, 'someone came and talked to me?'"" the 25-year-old said. ""But looking back on it I think, that was really bad, I should have spoken about it more and said something."" SiobhÃ¡n moved to London two months ago, but said her sister and friends often tell stories of being followed by men. ""I hear it all the time, but they say nothing has ever been done about it,"" she said. She said harassment and violence towards women tended to be spoken about within friendship groups, but after the murder of Ashling Murphy, it felt different. ""Everyone is talking about it, it's on the news everywhere,"" she said. ""It is being talked about, it is just very unfortunate circumstances to make people talk about it and make people realise there is a problem."" Official figures from Ireland's Central Statistics Office showed that in 2020 - the most recent full year figures are available for - 79% of victims of sexual violence were women. That represents 2,006 incidents of crimes recorded to An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police) so the true number is likely to be higher. In 2019, 99.4% of suspected offenders of sexual violence were men. Women were much less likely to be the victims in cases of murder or manslaughter than men, with six women killed in 2020 - representing 16% of victims - compared to 32 men. In 2019, the percentage of women killed in such circumstances was 18.4%, in 2018 it was 22.5% and in 2017 it was 35.2%. In Northern Ireland, meanwhile, police recently released statistics that showed over the Christmas period - from 14 December to 1 January - officers received 1,959 calls for help from victims of domestic abuse, a rise of 12% compared to the previous year. Women's Aid, which has been recording violent deaths of women at the hands of men in Ireland since 1996, points out that women are more likely to be killed in their own homes than anywhere else. Its Femicide Factsheet for 2020 recorded 236 women killed by men between 1996 and November 2020. It stated that 55% of those women were killed by a partner or ex-partner and that 87% of victims knew their killer. Ashling Murphy was a teacher and talented folk musician Sarah Benson, Women's Aid Ireland chief executive, said the nature of Ms Murphy's murder in broad daylight had shaken many women. ""We know it's far more common that a woman's own home will be the more dangerous place for her - quite different to men's experience of extreme violence - but what this has done has really shaken every woman and every teenage girl,"" she told the BBC. ""Any measure we take has to take a completely zero-tolerance strategy, that no man has the right to lay hands on any woman. ""We must focus on the behaviour and attitudes of perpetrators of violence in order to dismantle them and work with men as allies in order to model healthy, respectful behaviours. ""We really feel like there is a momentum now and I really want to be able to look back in a year's time and say yes, this is just appalling and unthinkable but it was not for absolutely nothing, we have taken on some of the lessons and moved forward."" Teacher's killing a 'depraved act of violence' In pictures: Mourners line the streets for Ashling Murphy 'What happened to her could have happened to me' The new strategy will be the third national strategy in Irish history, so it is not the first time attempts have been made to tackle an issue which has not gone away. So is there any feeling that things might be different this time around? ""I hope and I really do feel that there is a momentum here, I feel we must not squander it,"" Ms Benson said. Dr SaidlÃ©ar is also optimistic about progress but sounded a warning. ""The experience of the feminist movement, one thing we know for certain is there's always a backlash, we know there is always a pushback, we know that the status quo is the patriarchy and we always see hints of it,"" she said. ""We always have to remain alert and we have to remain dynamic.""

Tory MP defects as ex-minister tells Johnson to go,"Boris Johnson is facing fresh pressure to resign after being accused of misleading MPs about lockdown parties In the Commons, veteran Conservative MP and former minister David Davis tells the PM: ""In the name of God, go"" Tory MP Christian Wakeford says leaving the Conservatives was ""the hardest decision on my life"" after joining Labour in another dramatic moment Labour leader Keir Starmer accuses Johnson of providing ""absurd"" defences over parties The PM apologises for ""misjudgements"" but again says MPs should wait for the results of an inquiry About 10 Tory MPs elected in 2019 are believed to have submitted letters of no confidence in Johnson Other MPs have done the same but 54 letters are required to trigger a leadership vote and the total remains unknown Edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman We're ending our live politics coverage for now. Thanks for joining us on a frantic day in Westminster. The live page today was brought to you by Paul Seddon, Joshua Nevett, Jen Meierhans, George Bowden, Malu Cursino, Dulcie Lee and Jennifer Scott. The page was edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Kevin Ponniah. From all of us, goodnight and take care. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News British politics, particularly Prime Ministerâs Questions, is often compared to a theatre. But like many great dramas, itâs
often a surprising character who provides the plot twist. Todayâs defection to Labour from
the, formerly Tory, MP Christian Wakeford has managed to unite Boris Johnsonâs
critics and supporters on his backbenches. One former minister, who has
strongly criticised the handling of parties in Downing Street, said Wakeford
had provided an âalternative target for rageâ and calmed the mood in the Tory
party. Peers of Christian Wakeford,
elected alongside him in 2019, have described feeling burned - âbetrayedâ, âlet
downâ and upset by his actions. In a party where loyalties were
all over the place last night - Tory MPs have united in feeling his behaviour
was perhaps âdisloyalty gone one step too farâ. But this distraction doesnât
mean Boris Johnson is out of the woods. More than a dozen Tory MPs are believed
to have submitted letters of no confidence in him. The exact number is
still unknown. More Tory MPs are waiting until Sue Grayâs report is published
before expressing their anger publicly. Wakefordâs defection may have
stuck a plaster over some of the Tory party fractures â but last nightâs
briefing war between different groups of the party shows just how fragile the
situation still is for Boris Johnson. Speaking during the No 10 Covid briefing that's going on at the moment, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says ""we have all been pained and angered"" by photos and videos of parties at Downing Street during lockdown - but it is right that Boris Johnson responds after the investigation is concluded. Javid says the prime minister has apologised, and there needs to be ""time and space for the investigation to be completed"". As Boris Johnson battles an attempt from some of his own MPs to end his leadership, it's worth recapping what exactly his Tory critics will have to do to oust him. Under Tory party rules, forcing a vote on his leadership would require 15% of the party's MPs - that's 54 out of 359 - to submit letters of no confidence in him. The letters have to be sent to the chair of the backbench 1922 committee, who by convention does not disclose how many have been sent in unless the threshold is reached. If more than 50% of Tory MPs then approved a motion of no confidence in him, a leadership contest to replace him would then follow. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Douglas Ross has broken ranks with Boris Johnson's government over the Downing Street parties The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, has said he thinks the trigger point for a no confidence vote in Boris Johnsonâs leadership is ânearâ and âgetting closerâ. Ross said he submitted a letter calling for a vote last week and would need 53 other Tory MPs to do the same for that to go ahead. The prime ministerâs spokesperson has confirmed Johnson would fight a formal attempt to oust him. Asked why his calls for the PM to go had not been echoed by other Scottish Tory MPs, Ross said it was âperfectly legitimateâ for them to reach their own conclusions. The Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has said heâs backing Johnson 100% and expressed hope that Ross could change his view if the PM was âexoneratedâ. Health secretary Sajid Javid is giving a Covid-19 briefing Health Secretary Sajid Javid is currently holding a news conference in Downing Street to outline the latest update to Covid guidelines. The conference followsBoris Johnson's announcement to lift Plan B Covid restrictions in England, made earlier today in the House of Commons.

So what do constituents think of the Bury South MP's dramatic defection? At Rosylee coffee house, opposite Wakeford's office, Debbie Clark, 52, says she voted Conservative for the first time at
the last election. âI am disgusted,â she tells me. âI voted for the party. He should resign and we should
have an election.â Her husband Fred agrees: âHe should not have the right to go to Labour."" On the table next to them is 51-year-old Maxine Ballington. She
also voted Conservative. She too is shocked by todayâs defection but wants Boris Johnson to resign. âIâve lost two people to Covid. People were fined for having
house parties. How can he go to a party at Downing Street?â she says. Outside Wakeford's constituency office one man told me he wasnât surprised. But as he waits to pick up his wife from a beauty salon, he insists the prime minister hadn't done anything wrong and described the defection an
overreaction. Helen CattPolitical correspondent Prime Minister Boris Johnson's press secretary has confirmed that he will fight a confidence motion, if one is called. Asked if the prime minister still thought he was the best man for the job, his press secretary replied: ""Yes."" She said the prime minister would continue meeting with MPs this afternoon. She also denied reports that Johnson had been in tears at a meeting yesterday and said that he was ""entirely focused on his job and on delivering for the British people"". A Labour spokesman has indicated the party's leader believes there will be no need to hold a by-election in Bury South following Christian Wakeford's defection. Asked if, as far as Sir Keir Starmer is concerned, there is no principle requiring anyone who defects from one party to another to stand for re-election, the spokesman said: ""Correct."" On whether Wakeford will face a trigger ballot in the coming months, the spokesman added: ""We'll set out all of the process, obviously, once we've had a chance to speak to people, the relevant people that vote in the local party and nationally, and we'll happily set out the process at that point. ""But I don't want to pre-empt that now."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Hana Horka, 57, was unvaccinated and had posted on social media that she was recovering after testing positive, but died two days later. Her son, Jan Rek, said she got infected on purpose when he and his father had the virus, so she could get a recovery pass to access certain venues. The Czech Republic reported a record number of cases on Wednesday. Read the full story here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the consequences of seeing so much infection, so much spread of the virus, is that we're seeing a growing number of what are called ""coincidental deaths"". This is where people test have tested positive but they haven't been sick with the virus. Then they have died within 28 days of that positive test but it is nothing to do with the positive test and we're beginning to see more of this. I think the Office of National Statistics is going to have a look at this so we have a real idea of just how many people are dying due to the virus. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Away from changes to restrictions - an inquiry is being launched into children who are not attending school in the wake of national lockdowns, the children's commissioner for England has said. Dame Rachel de Souza toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programmeabout 95% of children were usually in school at this time of year - but now, this figure was about 87%. Some absences were down to illness and Covid, she said, but other children had simply failed to return following classroom closures during the pandemic. In addition, between 80,000 and 100,000 children were not on any school rolls at all, she said. ""Literally, I am going to go out and find them,"" she added.

For anyone just catching up with our coverage, you can watch some of the key moments from Health Secretary Sajid Javid speaking at the news conference about the end of Plan B in England. This video can not be played UK Covid: End of Plan B in England 'not the finish', says Sajid Javid Sajid Javid has just hosted a news conference at Downing Street. Here are the key points: Meanwhile, the UK has reported 108,069 new daily Covid cases and 359 deaths with Covid on Wednesday.  The Financial Times asks about the ""ongoing anger"" in the UK over Downing Street parties, and Javid says he has also been angered and pained by the revelations. He adds Boris Johnson has rightly apologised and reiterates calls for people to wait for the outcome of an investigation into the lockdown gatherings in No 10 and other government departments. In response to a follow up question about evidence for decision making, the health secretary says the government has been transparent throughout the pandemic and would will continue to be so. Javid adds the government is looking at expanding the definition of fully vaccinated to three doses of a vaccine, rather than the current two jabs. The news conference ends. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says Covid case numbers have declined and adds âitâs peopleâs behaviour that is going to make the difference over the next four weeksâ. She says people need to be careful when returning to the office and also take care using public transport, indoor spaces and in crowded places. She recommends people continue to wear face coverings, even thought they wonât be mandatory and to ensure they are fully vaccinated. She says the more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we will see mass Covid transmission. The health secretary is challenged by Jane Merrick from the i newspaper as to whether Boris Johnson just ""got lucky"" that Plan B worked. The journalist says the PM wanted stronger restrictions but was blocked by members of his cabinet and Tory MPs. Javid responds by saying Johnson ""has shown leadership throughout"" and that he has had to balance conflicting issues and come to a judgement over restrictions. ""The decision that he made to absolutely focus on boosters has been vindicated,"" he says. Asked if he can rule out the return of Plan B if a new variant of concern emerges, Javid says ""this pandemic is still with us"" and ""this is not the end of the road"". ""There will be future variants,"" he warns. On whether the current daily Covid death toll of 359 is something the country needs to be comfortable with in the future, the health secretary says vaccines have meant the death rate has fallen dramatically. He adds the Omicron variant is milder than previous variants and if you look at the average daily death rate, it is around 200 people. Javid says it is important to point out that around 40% of people with Covid in hospital are there not because they have Covid, but have tested positive after being admitted. Asked whether the UK will be effectively be living with no restrictions by the end of March, Javid points out that a third of all UK cases since the pandemic began are linked to Omicron. He says that there will still be some requirements and restrictions, including lateral flow tests for those arriving in England. ""But we are going to have to find a way to remove almost all of these restrictions and get life back to normal with one or two things there for a while,"" Javid adds, citing annual vaccinations for some of those most at risk, as well as testing and anti-virals. Asked by Sky News about plans to end self-isolation rules entirely, Sajid Javid says no decision has yet been taken. He adds it is important to keep this in place for the moment, but the evidence will be under constant review. It is reasonable that the government will eventually no longer legally require people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate, he says, making the point that people with flu are not asked to do so. Earlier Javid said the UK needed to learn to live with Covid in the long-term, as it does with flu. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks Sajid Javid: ""How can the PM continue to lead the country when one of his most senior MPs in the Commons has called on him to resign?"" Javid says that ""what we've seen in the last few weeks... has caused a lot of pain and anger"". He says that he absolutely understands this and that Johnson has rightly apologised and asked for time and space for an investigation to be completed. The PM will be happy to be scrutinised when the facts have been established, Javid adds.  Michelle from Lincolnshire asks about the reduction of the self-isolation period to 5 days with two negative tests. In response Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says people with two negative tests can be released earlier as it allows people to return to work and school. She explains the change is in response to emerging evidence. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency has been outlining the NHS' successful booster campaign. She says: âWe have now got, compared to comparable countries across Europe and North America, the highest rate of boosters in our population overall.â She adds âthe strongest defence we have against the Omicron wave that weâre now experiencing and any future waves of variantsâ¦ is vaccination.â Christina from Berkshire asks Javid if, given the increasing number of hospitalisation of children with Covid-19, there are plans to vaccinate children under 12. Javid says the focus at the moment is on children over 12, but that she is right to raise younger children. He says that the advice from independent experts is that the under-12s who are at risk should be vaccinated. But the experts are considering whether to widen this advice to all under-12s like in other countries. Javid says the NHS is still facing ""significant pressure"" and says the country must ""proceed with caution"". ""A pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint"", he says. The health secretary reiterates calls for people to continue to get vaccinated and boosted, adding it was ""the jabs that have got us this far and the jabs can keep us here too"". Laying out the plans for removing Plan B restrictions, Javid says the government is also looking at removing mandatory self-isolation for people who contract Covid-19. He adds they intend to set out plans to reduce restrictions on visiting care homes soon. The health secretary adds that removing restrictions is a ""major milestone but not the end of the road"" and the government intends to set out its plan for living with Covid in the coming weeks. ""We shouldnât
see this as the finish line,"" he says. ""We cannot eradicate this virus and its future variants."" Javid says Plan B succeeded giving the government extra time to combat Omicron and the newest data shows Omicron is ""in retreat"". The health secretary adds that hospitalisations have fallen and patients in intensive care are at the same levels as they were in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Face mask rules and Covid passes to end in EnglandWorking from home guidance is also ending as England reverts to ""Plan A"", Boris Johnson says.UKComments","This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister announces plans to end Plan B measures in England England's Plan B measures are to end from next Thursday, with mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports both dropped, Boris Johnson has announced. The prime minister also said the government would immediately drop its advice for people to work from home. The PM said England was reverting to ""Plan A"" due to boosters and how people had followed Plan B measures. He told MPs scientists believed the Omicron wave had peaked nationally. At a Downing Street press conference, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This is a moment we can all be proud of. ""It's a reminder of what this country can accomplish when we all work together."" But, he said, this should not be seen as the ""finish line"" because the virus and future variants cannot be eradicated - instead ""we must learn to live with Covid in the same way we live with flu"". He urged people to continue taking steps to keep the virus at bay, including hand washing, ventilating rooms and self-isolating if positive - and pressed those who were unvaccinated to come forward to get their jabs. Earlier, in a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, the prime minister said: Mandatory Covid passports for entering nightclubs and large events would end, though organisations could choose to use the NHS Covid pass if they wished People would no longer be advised to work from home and should discuss their return to offices with employers Face masks will no longer be mandated, though people are still advised to wear coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces and when meeting strangers From Thursday, secondary school pupils will no longer have to wear face masks in classrooms and government guidance on their use in communal areas would be removed ""shortly"" Further announcements on the easing of travel rules and restrictions on care home visits in England are expected in the coming days, Boris Johnson added. 'Plan B was a catastrophe for our coffee shop' Covid infections falling across the UK, says ONS How are Covid rules changing next week? The prime minister also said the government intended to end the legal requirement for people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate - and replace it with advice and guidance. The current regulations around self-isolation expire on 24 March. Mr Johnson said he expected not to renew them then - and suggested that date could be brought forward if the data allows. Citing thelatest infection study by the Office for National Statistics,external, Mr Johnson said its data showed that infections levels were falling in England. He also said hospital admissions had stabilised and scientists believed ""it is likely that the Omicron wave has now peaked nationally"". However, he said he did expect cases to continue rising in primary schools and pointed to significant pressures on the NHS in north-east and north-west England. Looking ahead, Mr Johnson said the government would set out its long-term strategy for living with coronavirus. He urged people to ""remain cautious"" during the last weeks of winter as there were still ""significant pressures"" on the NHS and the pandemic was ""not over"". In response, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would back lifting Plan B measures ""as long as the science says it is safe"" and accused the prime minister of being ""too distracted"" to have a ""robust plan to live well with Covid"". School leaders' unions said Covid remained a challenge for schools, with high numbers of staff and pupils absent. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the end of face coverings in classrooms, but warned the government risked giving the impression the crisis was over when there was still huge disruption in education. And the Royal College of Nursing said dropping Plan B would do ""nothing to ease the pressure on the NHS"". ""We can't rely on the vaccine alone when the situation is still so precariously balanced,"" its chief executive Pat Cullen said. But for the hospitality sector, which suffered as people worked from home and were cautious over Omicron, there was relief. Industry group UKHospitality said businesses could now begin their revival and recovery. The whole of Plan B is going. But is it too soon? Infections levels, while falling, are still well above what they were last winter. And hospital admissions have only just started coming down. The fact remains that England - and the rest of the UK for that matter - is one of the best protected nations when you combine the immunity built up by vaccination and previous infection. This does not mean people will not catch the virus in the future, but it does limit how many will become seriously ill. What's more, this Omicron wave appears to have peaked at just over 2,000 hospital admissions a day - very much best-case scenario territory. This has given both ministers and the scientists advising them confidence that it's at least time to ease restrictions. Others will argue this is going too far, too quickly. But in the end it comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. And certainly you have to wonder what impact the politics involved in this has had - the Tory backbenchers were unlikely to vote to keep any part of Plan B. But in the end it also comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. There is a trade-off that has to be made between the costs of such restrictions and the benefits they bring. With the worst of the Omicron wave almost certainly over, the benefits were reducing. The latest Covid restrictions were first introduced in December to try to slow the spread of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant and allow time for the booster vaccine rollout. UK daily infections remain high but are falling - on Wednesday, the UK recorded 108,069 new cases. Dr Susan Hopkins, the UK Health Security Agency's chief medical adviser, said case rates would largely decline but ""may plateau at some point"". Vaccine uptake and mask wearing around strangers would determine how quickly that happens, she added. Hospital admissions also appear to be decreasing. However, there is a lag between people catching the virus and becoming seriously ill so deaths are continuing to rise - and are up 14.7% on last week. On Wednesday, 359 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded. Nearly 37 million boosters have been given across the UK so far. RULES:What are the latest rules in the UK?

Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says Covid case numbers have declined and adds âitâs peopleâs behaviour that is going to make the difference over the next four weeksâ. She says people need to be careful when returning to the office and also take care using public transport, indoor spaces and in crowded places. She recommends people continue to wear face coverings, even thought they wonât be mandatory and to ensure they are fully vaccinated. She says the more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we will see mass Covid transmission. The health secretary is challenged by Jane Merrick from the i newspaper as to whether Boris Johnson just ""got lucky"" that Plan B worked. The journalist says the PM wanted stronger restrictions but was blocked by members of his cabinet and Tory MPs. Javid responds by saying Johnson ""has shown leadership throughout"" and that he has had to balance conflicting issues and come to a judgement over restrictions. ""The decision that he made to absolutely focus on boosters has been vindicated,"" he says. Asked if he can rule out the return of Plan B if a new variant of concern emerges, Javid says ""this pandemic is still with us"" and ""this is not the end of the road"". ""There will be future variants,"" he warns. On whether the current daily Covid death toll of 359 is something the country needs to be comfortable with in the future, the health secretary says vaccines have meant the death rate has fallen dramatically. He adds the Omicron variant is milder than previous variants and if you look at the average daily death rate, it is around 200 people. Javid says it is important to point out that around 40% of people with Covid in hospital are there not because they have Covid, but have tested positive after being admitted. Asked whether the UK will be effectively be living with no restrictions by the end of March, Javid points out that a third of all UK cases since the pandemic began are linked to Omicron. He says that there will still be some requirements and restrictions, including lateral flow tests for those arriving in England. ""But we are going to have to find a way to remove almost all of these restrictions and get life back to normal with one or two things there for a while,"" Javid adds, citing annual vaccinations for some of those most at risk, as well as testing and anti-virals. Asked by Sky News about plans to end self-isolation rules entirely, Sajid Javid says no decision has yet been taken. He adds it is important to keep this in place for the moment, but the evidence will be under constant review. It is reasonable that the government will eventually no longer legally require people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate, he says, making the point that people with flu are not asked to do so. Earlier Javid said the UK needed to learn to live with Covid in the long-term, as it does with flu. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks Sajid Javid: ""How can the PM continue to lead the country when one of his most senior MPs in the Commons has called on him to resign?"" Javid says that ""what we've seen in the last few weeks... has caused a lot of pain and anger"". He says that he absolutely understands this and that Johnson has rightly apologised and asked for time and space for an investigation to be completed. The PM will be happy to be scrutinised when the facts have been established, Javid adds.  Michelle from Lincolnshire asks about the reduction of the self-isolation period to 5 days with two negative tests. In response Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says people with two negative tests can be released earlier as it allows people to return to work and school. She explains the change is in response to emerging evidence. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency has been outlining the NHS' successful booster campaign. She says: âWe have now got, compared to comparable countries across Europe and North America, the highest rate of boosters in our population overall.â She adds âthe strongest defence we have against the Omicron wave that weâre now experiencing and any future waves of variantsâ¦ is vaccination.â Christina from Berkshire asks Javid if, given the increasing number of hospitalisation of children with Covid-19, there are plans to vaccinate children under 12. Javid says the focus at the moment is on children over 12, but that she is right to raise younger children. He says that the advice from independent experts is that the under-12s who are at risk should be vaccinated. But the experts are considering whether to widen this advice to all under-12s like in other countries. Javid says the NHS is still facing ""significant pressure"" and says the country must ""proceed with caution"". ""A pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint"", he says. The health secretary reiterates calls for people to continue to get vaccinated and boosted, adding it was ""the jabs that have got us this far and the jabs can keep us here too"". Laying out the plans for removing Plan B restrictions, Javid says the government is also looking at removing mandatory self-isolation for people who contract Covid-19. He adds they intend to set out plans to reduce restrictions on visiting care homes soon. The health secretary adds that removing restrictions is a ""major milestone but not the end of the road"" and the government intends to set out its plan for living with Covid in the coming weeks. ""We shouldnât
see this as the finish line,"" he says. ""We cannot eradicate this virus and its future variants."" Javid says Plan B succeeded giving the government extra time to combat Omicron and the newest data shows Omicron is ""in retreat"". The health secretary adds that hospitalisations have fallen and patients in intensive care are at the same levels as they were in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

'It's as cold in the school as it is outside',"This video can not be played ""The staff and the children have been absolutely fantastic"" On 25 October 1918, one small school in south Wales was forced to close for weeks due to the Spanish Flu. More than a century later, head teacher Rhian Kenny spots the entry in Ysgol yr Hendy's log book as her staff and almost 200 pupils deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. They have welcomed all children back to class after Christmas despitefears about a return to online learning. But in a bid to cut the risk of infection, the Carmarthenshire school is one of hundreds in Wales taking extraordinary measures to protect pupils and their families. They include investing in raincoats to make sure pupils stay dry in their hourly outdoor breaks. Adapting to new measures put in place due to Covid has become the norm for pupils at Ysgol yr Hendy ""It's been really, really hard,"" said Mrs Kenny. ""For the last two weeks it's been really, really wet, but regardless of the weather out they've gone. ""We've purchased additional coats to make sure they are waterproof."" Mrs Kenny says staff and children have adapted well to the new measures When the school received carbon dioxide monitors they were ""red and beeping mostly"", Mrs Kenny said, indicating poor air flow. After a visit from the council's health and safety officer, they are now waiting for air purifiers. Schools have been advised to keep classes well ventilated to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading But in the meantime, pupils leave classrooms every hour so clean air can circulate before they go back indoors. Schools across Wales hadtwo planning daysat the start of term to respond to the challenges posed by the Omicron variant and put measures in place. They were also asked to look at their online learning plans, should there be a need to teach pupils remotely. Ffion (right) and Lilly miss being part of the school choir and mixing with their friends from other year groups Ffion, 9, is ""really happy"" to be back in school and, although difficult, understands why Covid measures have been put in place. ""It gets really cold in the classroom and sometimes it's hard to work because you're just shivering on your chair,"" she said. The ventilation has caused a ""tremendous problem"", Mrs Kenny said, because even with the windows and doors open ""it's just still stale air"". 'Hugely upsetting' impact of Covid on pupils Parents concerned by mask refusal in some schools Exams need to be Covid-safe and fair, union says What are the new Covid rules for Wales? ""And now the weather's changed... it's a lot colder and I can honestly say it's as cold in the school as it is outside the school. ""The heating is on every single day for it just to disappear through the windows."" Raincoats purchased by the school are used by pupils while outside to allow classrooms to ventilate But despite the additional expense, Mrs Kenny said ""it's what we have to do to make sure that the school is as safe as possible and that we're keeping the school open"". Ten-year-old Lily said of the changes: ""We have a good routine going on. ""When you've got to come out when it's pouring down with rain and it's windy, it's hard."" With limits on mixing between year groups, Lily misses seeing her friends in Years 3 and 4, adding: ""Sometimes you want to play with them or you want to have fun with them, but it is really difficult."" The school has faced challenges posed by two pandemic 100 years apart Suspended ceilings added to the original structure are partly responsible for poor air circulation at the 110-year-old school. Learning about the impact of the Spanish Flu in 1918 through the school's log book has helped pupils understand previous generations faced similar challenges. Mrs Kenny said the staff and children have been ""absolutely fantastic"" in adapting to the measures. She said she understood why restrictions may need to remain in schools for longer, even as they arerelaxed in other settings, because of the ""concentration of people in one building"". ""As long as we're kept open I don't mind because it's just lovely to hear the children - to hear their voices in school and on the school yard"".

Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high,"Prices have gone up at their fastest rate in nearly 30 years - but there is worse to come, experts have warned. Soaring food costs and the energy bill crisis drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in another blow to struggling families. The last time inflation was higher was in March 1992, when it was 7.1%. And with gas and electricity costs set to rise further in the spring, analysts predict it will reach that level again. Households have seen their energy bills kept in check by the government's price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, but this is due to be revised on 1 April. As a result, fuel bills could increase by another 50% in the next few months, the energy industry has said. Why are gas prices so high? In 90 seconds: How does inflation affect you? Petrol prices: Are we paying too much at the pump? Inflation: Seven reasons living costs are rising globally At the same time, there are signs that the high cost of food is proving too much for many people. Richard Walker, boss of supermarket chain Iceland, said he was seeing an ""alarming"" rise in the use of food banks. ""There may be some people facing a choice between heating or eating. We're losing customers to hunger,"" he said. He added that his stores served some of the UK's most deprived communities. ""Some of our customers only have Â£25 a week to spend on food, so they're already struggling to make ends meet,"" he said. ""When you have real wages falling, Universal Credit top-up withdrawal, food inflation, tax rises, that obviously will hit hard."" The latest rise was announced by the Office for National Statistics,external, which said increases in prices of furniture, food and clothing also contributed to December's rise in the cost of living. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he understood the pressures people were facing, but the opposition Labour party said working families faced an impending ""triple whammy"" of financial pressures. The latest figures will increase pressure on the government, already under fire over tax rises set to take effect in April. They will also fuel calls for the Bank of England to raise interest rates in a bid to dampen consumer spending and bring inflation closer to its 2% target. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising. If the price of a bottle of milk is Â£1 and it rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. You may not notice price rises from month to month. But right now, prices are rising so quickly that the money people earn does not go as far. Why are prices rising so quickly? Separate official figures issued on Tuesday showed that average pay rises are failing to keep up with the rise in the cost of living. Regular pay, excluding bonuses and adjusted for inflation, fell 1% in November compared with the same month in the previous year. Paul Johnson, director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said people on low incomes would be particularly hard hit by the squeeze on living standards. ""Everyone, particularly those on modest incomes, has had a long period of wages not really growing any faster than prices over the last decade, so another increase at this point is going to be particularly painful,"" he told the BBC. Inflation at this level is a new phenomenon for many young people, who were not even born when prices were last rising this fast. One worker, 24-year-old Alfie Kearns from Liverpool, told the BBC he believed inflation was making it harder to save money so that he can move out of his family home. ""Energy bills and gas and everything has been going up,"" he said. ""A big thing for me right now is I want to move out, I want my own home and that's the next step for me and it's just impossible in the current climate."" Gen Z: The people who've never seen soaring prices However, there is little sign of a respite for him and others like him, say analysts. Paul Dales of Capital Economics said inflation was now expected to hit 7% by April. ""That would be higher than the peak of 6% that the Bank of England was forecasting when it raised rates in December,"" he added. ""And although inflation will fall back thereafter, we think it will stay above 4% for all of this year and won't drop to the 2% target until April 2023."" As a result, he said, the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee was likely to raise interest rates faster than most people expected, with the next increase to 0.5% expected in February. PETROL:Are we paying too much at the pump? GAS PRICES:How can I protect myself from rising prices? IMPACT:'I'm so cold it feels like I'm sleeping outside' Already-high prices for gas, electricity, food and used cars are set to climb further in the coming months, said BBC economics editor Faisal Islam. Meanwhile, the Retail Price Index, an inflation measure which is still widely used by government and some businesses, including for wage bargaining, is already at 7.5%. The concern is not only that the predicted peak of inflation is getting higher, but that it will prove ""stickier"" than expected, he added. Kate Greig helps run the Kent Food Hub in Ashford Businesses, who face soaring wholesale prices, now face the dilemma of whether to pass on those costs to squeezed consumers. One businesswoman, Kate Greig, helps run Kent Food Hubs, a co-operative that helps traders and producers in the county to sell direct to customers. She said her suppliers are seeing increases in their material costs, as well as things such as energy bills. ""Food is more expensive, fuel is more expensive,"" she told the BBC. ""For my traders, raw materials are more expensive, whether that's the lentils to make a meal or the cardboard they use to package it."" Commenting on the crisis, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I understand the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, and we will continue to listen to people's concerns as we have done throughout the pandemic."" He said the government was providing support worth about Â£12bn this financial year and next to help families cope. Shadow Treasury secretary Pat McFadden said: ""These figures show that the cost-of-living crisis is only going to get worse in the coming months. ""Working families are already feeling the crunch. But the triple whammy of an imminent rise in the energy price cap, real wages falling and Tory tax rises coming down the tracks are going to make this crisis even worse.""

Millionaires ask to pay more tax,"The signatories included Disney heiress Abigail Disney A group of more than 100 of the world's richest people have called on governments to make them pay more tax. The group, named the Patriotic Millionaires, said the ultra-wealthy were not being forced to pay their share towards the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. ""As millionaires, we know that the current tax system is not fair,"" they said inan open letter.,external The signatories included Disney heiress Abigail Disney and Nick Hanauer. Mr Hanauer is a US entrepreneur and an early investor in online retail giant Amazon. ""Most of us can say that, while the world has gone through an immense amount of suffering in the last two years, we have actually seen our wealth rise during the pandemic - yet few if any of us can honestly say that we pay our fair share in taxes,"" the signatories said in the letter to the World Economic Forum. Millions become millionaires during Covid pandemic Wealth of 10 richest men 'doubled in pandemic' Davos business leaders' event postponed over Omicron Earlier at the forum, which is being held virtually due to Covid rather than in its normal home at Davos, charity Oxfam said the pandemic made the world's wealthiest far richer, while also leading to more people living in poverty. Its report said lower incomes for the world's poorest contributed to the death of 21,000 people each day, but added the world's 10 richest men had more than doubled their collective fortunes since March 2020. Research by Credit Suisse has also found that in 2020, the number of millionaires increased by 5.2 million to a total of 56.1 million globally. The UK branch of Patriotic Millionaires said analysis by the Fight Inequality Alliance, the Institute for Policy Studies, Oxfam and itself found a wealth tax starting at 2% annually for those with more than $5m, 3% for people with more than $50m, and 5% for billionaires could generate $2.52 trillion a year. UK entrepreneur Gemma McGough said it's time to ""right the wrongs"" The group claimed taxing the UK's wealthiest 119,000 people at such rates would raise Â£43.71bn a year. They suggested such funds could be used to eliminate plannedNational Insurance tax rises to fund social care in England,pay for the salaries of 50,000 nurses and a permanent increase of Universal Credit. It said globally, $2.52tn could lift 2.3 billion people out of poverty and make enough vaccines for the world. Gemma McGough, British entrepreneur and founding member of Patriotic Millionaires, UK said: ""For all our well-being - rich and poor alike - it's time we right the wrongs of an unequal world. It's time we tax the rich."" Ms McGough added: ""At a time when simply living will cost the average household a further Â£1,200 a year, our government cannot expect to be trusted if it would rather tax working people than wealthy people. ""If they do anything in the next few months, they should do this: rather than raising National Insurance, tax the rich - tax us - instead."" In the open letter, the signatories said business and political leaders were ""not going to find the answer in a private forum"" and were ""part of the problem"".

US urges Putin to take peaceful path on Ukraine,"Belarus's defence ministry released photos showing Russian troops and tanks arriving for drills US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said Russia could attack Ukraine ""on very short notice"" and warned again of tough sanctions if it did. He was speaking on a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv after months of tension over a Russian military build-up near Ukraine's borders. Stressing the US's close ties with Ukraine, Mr Blinken vowed ""relentless"" diplomacy to stop Russian aggression. Moscow has denied any plans to attack or invade. Russia has made a raft of demands to Western governments, including that Ukraine should never join Nato and that the defensive alliance's military activities should be limited in member states including Poland. Talks between the West and Russia last week failed to reach a breakthrough, with some of Moscow's demands rejected as non-starters. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 after the overthrow of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine. It has supported pro-Russian rebels who control parts of eastern Ukraine after they fought a bloody war with government forces. There are fears that the conflict, which cost at least 13,000 lives and caused at least two million people to flee their homes, may reignite, with the Russian military openly intervening. Mr Blinken said Russia had built up troops near Ukraine's borders with ""no provocation, no reason"". ""We know that there are plans in place to increase that force even more on very short notice, and that gives President [Vladimir] Putin the capacity, also on very short notice, to take further aggressive action against Ukraine,"" he said. He accused Russia of trying to weaken Ukraine's diplomatic institutions and divide Ukrainian society ""using everything from election interference to disinformation to cyber attacks"". He pledged ""relentless diplomatic efforts to prevent renewed aggression and to promote dialogue and peace"", and repeated a warning of tough sanctions against Russia in the event of an invasion. Mr Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart in Geneva on Friday, after talks with European allies in Berlin. Antony Blinken met Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv A picture, they say, is worth a thousand words. So on a day when the White House warned that a Russian attack on Ukraine could come ""at any point"", American Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew almost 8,000km to appear in front of cameras with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and reiterate the close ties between the two nations. He cautioned Russian President Vladimir Putin that there would be severe consequences if he opted for military action and promised continued defensive and financial support for the Ukrainian government. Given evidence of a Russian disinformation campaign to convince Ukrainians that the US is abandoning the Eastern European nation - drawing comparisons to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan - such a show of support was particularly welcomed by senior Ukrainian officials. Meanwhile, on the streets of Kyiv, everyday life is continuing as normal. Pedestrians waved and took photographs of Mr Blinken's motorcade as it passed along ice-encrusted streets. There is no sense of panic or undue concern even amid headlines of Russian troops amassing along the nation's borders. Time may tell whether this is mass denial or a sense of steely resolve for the challenges that lie ahead. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led recent negotiations with the US in Geneva, said his country did not ""intend to take any aggressive actions"". ""We will not strike, attack or invade Ukraine,"" he said at a meeting on Moscow. He said the US could not force Moscow to move its troops away from the Ukrainian border. ""They are on our territory and we won't be making any changes to their movement because of external pressure,"" he added. Mr Ryabkov also called on Washington to stop its military support for Ukraine, which he said posed a direct threat to Russian security. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Mr Blinken's visit to Kyiv was described as a bid to ""reinforce the United States' commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"", before talks in Berlin on Thursday with German, French and British counterparts. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who visited Moscow on Tuesday, has warned that any further military escalation ""would carry a high price for the Russian regime - economic, political and strategic"". Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov has urged Western governments to impose immediate sanctions on Moscow. Speaking to the BBC's HardTalk programme, he warned that a Russian invasion of the country could lead to bloodshed and a refugee crisis for Europe. A consignment of light anti-tank missiles arrived in Kyiv from the UK on Tuesday as British ministers urged Moscow to reflect on the brink of a potential conflict in which thousands could die. In an essay published this week,external, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace accused Russia of using Nato as a ""strawman"" to justify an invasion of Ukraine, accusing President Putin of being motivated by ""ethnonationalism"".

Cost of living fears as inflation at 30-year high,"Prices have gone up at their fastest rate in nearly 30 years - but there is worse to come, experts have warned. Soaring food costs and the energy bill crisis drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in another blow to struggling families.

Paul Dales of Capital Economics said inflation was now expected to hit 7% by April. ""That would be higher than the peak of 6% that the Bank of England was forecasting when it raised rates in December,"" he added. ""And although inflation will fall back thereafter, we think it will stay above 4% for all of this year and won't drop to the 2% target until April 2023."" As a result, he said, the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee was likely to raise interest rates faster than most people expected, with the next increase to 0.5% expected in February.

Cost of living rises at fastest pace for 30 years,"Prices have gone up at their fastest rate in nearly 30 years - but there is worse to come, experts have warned. Soaring food costs and the energy bill crisis drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in another blow to struggling families. The last time inflation was higher was in March 1992, when it was 7.1%. And with gas and electricity costs set to rise further in the spring, analysts predict it will reach that level again. Households have seen their energy bills kept in check by the government's price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, but this is due to be revised on 1 April. As a result, fuel bills could increase by another 50% in the next few months, the energy industry has said. Why are gas prices so high? In 90 seconds: How does inflation affect you? Petrol prices: Are we paying too much at the pump? Inflation: Seven reasons living costs are rising globally At the same time, there are signs that the high cost of food is proving too much for many people. Richard Walker, boss of supermarket chain Iceland, said he was seeing an ""alarming"" rise in the use of food banks. ""There may be some people facing a choice between heating or eating. We're losing customers to hunger,"" he said. He added that his stores served some of the UK's most deprived communities. ""Some of our customers only have Â£25 a week to spend on food, so they're already struggling to make ends meet,"" he said. ""When you have real wages falling, Universal Credit top-up withdrawal, food inflation, tax rises, that obviously will hit hard."" The latest rise was announced by the Office for National Statistics,external, which said increases in prices of furniture, food and clothing also contributed to December's rise in the cost of living. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he understood the pressures people were facing, but the opposition Labour party said working families faced an impending ""triple whammy"" of financial pressures. The latest figures will increase pressure on the government, already under fire over tax rises set to take effect in April. They will also fuel calls for the Bank of England to raise interest rates in a bid to dampen consumer spending and bring inflation closer to its 2% target. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising. If the price of a bottle of milk is Â£1 and it rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. You may not notice price rises from month to month. But right now, prices are rising so quickly that the money people earn does not go as far. Why are prices rising so quickly? Separate official figures issued on Tuesday showed that average pay rises are failing to keep up with the rise in the cost of living. Regular pay, excluding bonuses and adjusted for inflation, fell 1% in November compared with the same month in the previous year. Paul Johnson, director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said people on low incomes would be particularly hard hit by the squeeze on living standards.

"England to end Plan B Covid measures, PM confirms","This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister announces plans to end Plan B measures in England England's Plan B measures are to end from next Thursday, with mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports both dropped, Boris Johnson has announced. The prime minister also said the government would immediately drop its advice for people to work from home. The PM said England was reverting to ""Plan A"" due to boosters and how people had followed Plan B measures. He told MPs scientists believed the Omicron wave had peaked nationally. At a Downing Street press conference, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This is a moment we can all be proud of. ""It's a reminder of what this country can accomplish when we all work together."" But, he said, this should not be seen as the ""finish line"" because the virus and future variants cannot be eradicated - instead ""we must learn to live with Covid in the same way we live with flu"". He urged people to continue taking steps to keep the virus at bay, including hand washing, ventilating rooms and self-isolating if positive - and pressed those who were unvaccinated to come forward to get their jabs. Earlier, in a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, the prime minister said: Mandatory Covid passports for entering nightclubs and large events would end, though organisations could choose to use the NHS Covid pass if they wished People would no longer be advised to work from home and should discuss their return to offices with employers Face masks will no longer be mandated, though people are still advised to wear coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces and when meeting strangers From Thursday, secondary school pupils will no longer have to wear face masks in classrooms and government guidance on their use in communal areas would be removed ""shortly"" Further announcements on the easing of travel rules and restrictions on care home visits in England are expected in the coming days, Boris Johnson added. 'Plan B was a catastrophe for our coffee shop' Covid infections falling across the UK, says ONS How are Covid rules changing next week? The prime minister also said the government intended to end the legal requirement for people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate - and replace it with advice and guidance. The current regulations around self-isolation expire on 24 March. Mr Johnson said he expected not to renew them then - and suggested that date could be brought forward if the data allows. Citing thelatest infection study by the Office for National Statistics,external, Mr Johnson said its data showed that infections levels were falling in England. He also said hospital admissions had stabilised and scientists believed ""it is likely that the Omicron wave has now peaked nationally"". However, he said he did expect cases to continue rising in primary schools and pointed to significant pressures on the NHS in north-east and north-west England. Looking ahead, Mr Johnson said the government would set out its long-term strategy for living with coronavirus. He urged people to ""remain cautious"" during the last weeks of winter as there were still ""significant pressures"" on the NHS and the pandemic was ""not over"". In response, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would back lifting Plan B measures ""as long as the science says it is safe"" and accused the prime minister of being ""too distracted"" to have a ""robust plan to live well with Covid"". School leaders' unions said Covid remained a challenge for schools, with high numbers of staff and pupils absent. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the end of face coverings in classrooms, but warned the government risked giving the impression the crisis was over when there was still huge disruption in education. And the Royal College of Nursing said dropping Plan B would do ""nothing to ease the pressure on the NHS"". ""We can't rely on the vaccine alone when the situation is still so precariously balanced,"" its chief executive Pat Cullen said. But for the hospitality sector, which suffered as people worked from home and were cautious over Omicron, there was relief. Industry group UKHospitality said businesses could now begin their revival and recovery. The whole of Plan B is going. But is it too soon? Infections levels, while falling, are still well above what they were last winter. And hospital admissions have only just started coming down. The fact remains that England - and the rest of the UK for that matter - is one of the best protected nations when you combine the immunity built up by vaccination and previous infection. This does not mean people will not catch the virus in the future, but it does limit how many will become seriously ill. What's more, this Omicron wave appears to have peaked at just over 2,000 hospital admissions a day - very much best-case scenario territory. This has given both ministers and the scientists advising them confidence that it's at least time to ease restrictions. Others will argue this is going too far, too quickly. But in the end it comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. And certainly you have to wonder what impact the politics involved in this has had - the Tory backbenchers were unlikely to vote to keep any part of Plan B. But in the end it also comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. There is a trade-off that has to be made between the costs of such restrictions and the benefits they bring. With the worst of the Omicron wave almost certainly over, the benefits were reducing. The latest Covid restrictions were first introduced in December to try to slow the spread of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant and allow time for the booster vaccine rollout. UK daily infections remain high but are falling - on Wednesday, the UK recorded 108,069 new cases. Dr Susan Hopkins, the UK Health Security Agency's chief medical adviser, said case rates would largely decline but ""may plateau at some point"". Vaccine uptake and mask wearing around strangers would determine how quickly that happens, she added. Hospital admissions also appear to be decreasing. However, there is a lag between people catching the virus and becoming seriously ill so deaths are continuing to rise - and are up 14.7% on last week. On Wednesday, 359 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded. Nearly 37 million boosters have been given across the UK so far. RULES:What are the latest rules in the UK? MASKS:Where do I need to wear a face covering? COVID PASSPORTS:Where do I need to show one? SCHOOLS:What are the rules in schools? The UK's devolved nations set their own Covid restrictions andhave moved at different speeds in introducing and easing them throughout the pandemic. InScotland, some restrictions will be lifted from Monday, including allowing nightclubs to reopen and removing limits on indoor events. In Wales, crowds will return to sporting events from Friday and nightclubs can reopen the following week. In Northern Ireland, nightclubs remain closed and indoor standing events are not allowed.

Millionaires say they want to pay more tax,"The signatories included Disney heiress Abigail Disney A group of more than 100 of the world's richest people have called on governments to make them pay more tax. The group, named the Patriotic Millionaires, said the ultra-wealthy were not being forced to pay their share towards the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. ""As millionaires, we know that the current tax system is not fair,"" they said inan open letter.,external The signatories included Disney heiress Abigail Disney and Nick Hanauer. Mr Hanauer is a US entrepreneur and an early investor in online retail giant Amazon. ""Most of us can say that, while the world has gone through an immense amount of suffering in the last two years, we have actually seen our wealth rise during the pandemic - yet few if any of us can honestly say that we pay our fair share in taxes,"" the signatories said in the letter to the World Economic Forum. Millions become millionaires during Covid pandemic Wealth of 10 richest men 'doubled in pandemic' Davos business leaders' event postponed over Omicron Earlier at the forum, which is being held virtually due to Covid rather than in its normal home at Davos, charity Oxfam said the pandemic made the world's wealthiest far richer, while also leading to more people living in poverty. Its report said lower incomes for the world's poorest contributed to the death of 21,000 people each day, but added the world's 10 richest men had more than doubled their collective fortunes since March 2020. Research by Credit Suisse has also found that in 2020, the number of millionaires increased by 5.2 million to a total of 56.1 million globally. The UK branch of Patriotic Millionaires said analysis by the Fight Inequality Alliance, the Institute for Policy Studies, Oxfam and itself found a wealth tax starting at 2% annually for those with more than $5m, 3% for people with more than $50m, and 5% for billionaires could generate $2.52 trillion a year. UK entrepreneur Gemma McGough said it's time to ""right the wrongs"" The group claimed taxing the UK's wealthiest 119,000 people at such rates would raise Â£43.71bn a year. They suggested such funds could be used to eliminate plannedNational Insurance tax rises to fund social care in England,pay for the salaries of 50,000 nurses and a permanent increase of Universal Credit. It said globally, $2.52tn could lift 2.3 billion people out of poverty and make enough vaccines for the world. Gemma McGough, British entrepreneur and founding member of Patriotic Millionaires, UK said: ""For all our well-being - rich and poor alike - it's time we right the wrongs of an unequal world. It's time we tax the rich."" Ms McGough added: ""At a time when simply living will cost the average household a further Â£1,200 a year, our government cannot expect to be trusted if it would rather tax working people than wealthy people. ""If they do anything in the next few months, they should do this: rather than raising National Insurance, tax the rich - tax us - instead."" In the open letter, the signatories said business and political leaders were ""not going to find the answer in a private forum"" and were ""part of the problem"".

LGBT staff to share impact of UK military ban,"David Bonney was jailed after it was found out he was gay while serving in the RAF LGBT veterans have cautiously welcomed a review into the impact of a ban on them serving in the military, launched more than 20 years after the law was changed. Until 2000 it was illegal to be gay in the British military - a rule that is thought to have affected about 5,000 people in the armed forces. Campaigners are seeking compensation for lost livelihoods and suffering. Veterans minister Leo Docherty accepted that many had lost out financially. The veterans also hope to be offered mental health support, financial compensation, and the restoration of pensions that were taken away for those who underwent dishonourable discharge. When pressed on the issue of compensation, Mr Docherty told the BBC: ""I don't want to pre-empt the findings of the review, but I totally accept the financial impact a lot of these people suffered unjustly. So I totally accept that this is the cause of live debate."" He said he expected the reviewer to have some ""honest and frank discussions"" with veterans affected, and to bring back some recommendations that the Ministry of Defence could consider ""with humility, compassion and urgency"". 'I was marched off RAF site for being gay' LGBT in the forces: 'It was a very scary time' People with HIV to be allowed to join armed forces US Marines discharged for refusing Covid jab The law was changed in 2000 after four servicemen and women, who were sacked for being gay, won a case in the European Court of Human Rights. Before then gay, transgender and bisexual people in the military were sent to prison if their sexuality or gender identity was discovered by their bosses. The change in the military's handling of homosexuality came 33 years after homosexual acts were decriminalised between two consenting adults over the age of 21 in most cases. David Bonney served four months in a military prison in Colchester in 1995 after being convicted of ""homosexual conduct"" while working for the RAF as a medic. Although he was later freed on appeal, the conviction is still on his criminal record. He says it's had a long-lasting impact on his life. ""From the moment I admitted to [being gay], I was held in a cell separate to everyone,"" he tells BBC News. ""Handcuffs, going into a cell, treated as if I'd murdered or mugged someone."" David's conviction is still on his criminal record despite the law change in 2000 Caroline Paige, co-director of military charity Fighting With Pride, was the first openly transgender servicewoman to serve in the military. Since her retirement, she has campaigned for more to be done to lessen the impact of the pre-2000 ban. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: ""It's shameful that nothing has been done to help support them since the ban was lifted. ""It was 22 years ago but you have to bear in mind that for some of these veterans the journey has been even longer than that because they were dismissed in the 60s, 70s or 80s and have been living their lives without any kind of support. ""The review is just the start of what needs to be done."" Other gay people who managed to keep their sexuality secret felt forced to resign. Patrick Lyster-Todd was in the navy, and after his partner Dennis contracted Aids, Patrick eventually quit his job to look after him - instead of asking work for help. ""I couldn't tell them why I wanted to leave because I would have to admit I was gay,"" he says. It's unclear what support people like Patrick might receive - if any - as a result of the review. Patrick Lyster-Todd (left) and his late partner Dennis (right) took women as dates to social events in the navy to avoid suspicion The full scope of the review, which launched on Wednesday, is yet to be announced. But it's set to look at three main areas: The potential impact the ban may have had on LGBT+ veterans, including the consequences for their future lives The accessibility of veterans' services for LGBT+ people How to ensure that LGBT+ veterans are recognised and fully accepted as members of the armed forces The government says it will set out how people affected by the ban will be able to share their experiences for the review once an independent chair has been announced. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said more details will be set out in ""due course"". Once it is finished, the chair will make recommendations to the government. Armed forces minister James Heappey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The review needs to understand what the consequences were of that extraordinarily wrong-headed policy."" He added: ""We are so sorry for the fact that that was ever the case, that people who had the courage to serve in our nation's armed forces were then thrown out because they loved someone of their own sex."" He would not be drawn on whether compensation would be offered, but said ""it may be that compensation matters more"" than apologies.

Johnson set to ease England's Plan B Covid rules,"This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister announces plans to end Plan B measures in England England's Plan B measures are to end from next Thursday, with mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports both dropped, Boris Johnson has announced. The prime minister also said the government would immediately drop its advice for people to work from home. The PM said England was reverting to ""Plan A"" due to boosters and how people had followed Plan B measures. He told MPs scientists believed the Omicron wave had peaked nationally. At a Downing Street press conference, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This is a moment we can all be proud of. ""It's a reminder of what this country can accomplish when we all work together."" But, he said, this should not be seen as the ""finish line"" because the virus and future variants cannot be eradicated - instead ""we must learn to live with Covid in the same way we live with flu"". He urged people to continue taking steps to keep the virus at bay, including hand washing, ventilating rooms and self-isolating if positive - and pressed those who were unvaccinated to come forward to get their jabs. Earlier, in a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, the prime minister said: Mandatory Covid passports for entering nightclubs and large events would end, though organisations could choose to use the NHS Covid pass if they wished People would no longer be advised to work from home and should discuss their return to offices with employers Face masks will no longer be mandated, though people are still advised to wear coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces and when meeting strangers From Thursday, secondary school pupils will no longer have to wear face masks in classrooms and government guidance on their use in communal areas would be removed ""shortly"" Further announcements on the easing of travel rules and restrictions on care home visits in England are expected in the coming days, Boris Johnson added. 'Plan B was a catastrophe for our coffee shop' Covid infections falling across the UK, says ONS How are Covid rules changing next week? The prime minister also said the government intended to end the legal requirement for people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate - and replace it with advice and guidance. The current regulations around self-isolation expire on 24 March. Mr Johnson said he expected not to renew them then - and suggested that date could be brought forward if the data allows. Citing thelatest infection study by the Office for National Statistics,external, Mr Johnson said its data showed that infections levels were falling in England. He also said hospital admissions had stabilised and scientists believed ""it is likely that the Omicron wave has now peaked nationally"". However, he said he did expect cases to continue rising in primary schools and pointed to significant pressures on the NHS in north-east and north-west England. Looking ahead, Mr Johnson said the government would set out its long-term strategy for living with coronavirus. He urged people to ""remain cautious"" during the last weeks of winter as there were still ""significant pressures"" on the NHS and the pandemic was ""not over"". In response, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would back lifting Plan B measures ""as long as the science says it is safe"" and accused the prime minister of being ""too distracted"" to have a ""robust plan to live well with Covid"". School leaders' unions said Covid remained a challenge for schools, with high numbers of staff and pupils absent. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the end of face coverings in classrooms, but warned the government risked giving the impression the crisis was over when there was still huge disruption in education. And the Royal College of Nursing said dropping Plan B would do ""nothing to ease the pressure on the NHS"". ""We can't rely on the vaccine alone when the situation is still so precariously balanced,"" its chief executive Pat Cullen said. But for the hospitality sector, which suffered as people worked from home and were cautious over Omicron, there was relief. Industry group UKHospitality said businesses could now begin their revival and recovery. The whole of Plan B is going. But is it too soon? Infections levels, while falling, are still well above what they were last winter. And hospital admissions have only just started coming down. The fact remains that England - and the rest of the UK for that matter - is one of the best protected nations when you combine the immunity built up by vaccination and previous infection. This does not mean people will not catch the virus in the future, but it does limit how many will become seriously ill. What's more, this Omicron wave appears to have peaked at just over 2,000 hospital admissions a day - very much best-case scenario territory. This has given both ministers and the scientists advising them confidence that it's at least time to ease restrictions. Others will argue this is going too far, too quickly. But in the end it comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. And certainly you have to wonder what impact the politics involved in this has had - the Tory backbenchers were unlikely to vote to keep any part of Plan B. But in the end it also comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. There is a trade-off that has to be made between the costs of such restrictions and the benefits they bring. With the worst of the Omicron wave almost certainly over, the benefits were reducing. The latest Covid restrictions were first introduced in December to try to slow the spread of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant and allow time for the booster vaccine rollout. UK daily infections remain high but are falling - on Wednesday, the UK recorded 108,069 new cases. Dr Susan Hopkins, the UK Health Security Agency's chief medical adviser, said case rates would largely decline but ""may plateau at some point"". Vaccine uptake and mask wearing around strangers would determine how quickly that happens, she added. Hospital admissions also appear to be decreasing. However, there is a lag between people catching the virus and becoming seriously ill so deaths are continuing to rise - and are up 14.7% on last week. On Wednesday, 359 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded. Nearly 37 million boosters have been given across the UK so far. RULES:What are the latest rules in the UK? MASKS:Where do I need to wear a face covering? COVID PASSPORTS:Where do I need to show one? SCHOOLS:What are the rules in schools? The UK's devolved nations set their own Covid restrictions andhave moved at different speeds in introducing and easing them throughout the pandemic. InScotland, some restrictions will be lifted from Monday, including allowing nightclubs to reopen and removing limits on indoor events. In Wales, crowds will return to sporting events from Friday and nightclubs can reopen the following week. In Northern Ireland, nightclubs remain closed and indoor standing events are not allowed.

Pressure for change after young teacher's killingThe Irish government is to publish a new strategy to combat violence against women.Europe,"At vigils in Ashling Murphy's memory there have been calls to address violence against women The killing of Ashling Murphy has amplified calls in Ireland for more to be done to tackle violence against women. The country's justice minister has said she intends to publisha new national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence,externalin March. Women's groups have said they are optimistic that progress is being made. But they have also warned of the need to be alert to a ""backlash"" and attempts to frustrate change. The new strategy has been in the works since July when the Irish government published an independent audit on how responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was dealt with across different agencies and departments. Among the audit's recommendations were the setting up of a dedicated office to deal with the issue and that all funding and commissioning of services should fall under the Department of Justice. Justice Minister Helen McEntee said: ""We must come together to demand zero tolerance of violence against women. As minister for justice, I am working to ensure we have a society that does not tolerate this any longer."" ClÃ­ona SaidlÃ©ar, executive director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland, told BBC News NI it was ""critical"" to have a single focus point. ""As terrible as Covid has been, it has also helped [collaboration] because we worked really closely across the statutory and the NGO sector around responding to that crisis,"" she said. ""What we have learned there is that it has to be a collaborative effort."" Teacher's killing a 'depraved act of violence' 'Community is needed to overcome such evil' 'Only something powerful can come out of this' But Dr SaidlÃ©ar added that while it was important to have a ""checklist"" of changes within agencies and professions, there was also a bigger picture that needed to be addressed. ""We need to think big - because actually what we are doing here is to transform the culture, we are trying to socially engineer our whole culture out of a habit of generations into something new,"" she said. ""When misogyny is overcome, then we can actually look at gender equality in a serious way and look at lasting and substantial changes there."" SiobhÃ¡n says more people are talking about harassment and violence against women since Ashling Murphy's murder Ashling Murphy's killing brought back memories of a sinister encounter for Galway woman SiobhÃ¡n O'Riordan, who shared her story in the days following the young teacher's death. When SiobhÃ¡n was younger, she was chatting to someone online who claimed to be her age, but when she felt something ""off"" about them, she stopped the conversation. Later that day, when she went for a walk, she was approached by a middle-aged man she had never met, who knew her name. Feeling worried and on edge, she spotted one of her friends' mothers and shouted to her, which she said startled the man and he walked away. ""Back then I thought nothing really happened, what am I supposed to say, 'someone came and talked to me?'"" the 25-year-old said. ""But looking back on it I think, that was really bad, I should have spoken about it more and said something."" SiobhÃ¡n moved to London two months ago, but said her sister and friends often tell stories of being followed by men. ""I hear it all the time, but they say nothing has ever been done about it,"" she said. She said harassment and violence towards women tended to be spoken about within friendship groups, but after the murder of Ashling Murphy, it felt different. ""Everyone is talking about it, it's on the news everywhere,"" she said. ""It is being talked about, it is just very unfortunate circumstances to make people talk about it and make people realise there is a problem."" Official figures from Ireland's Central Statistics Office showed that in 2020 - the most recent full year figures are available for - 79% of victims of sexual violence were women. That represents 2,006 incidents of crimes recorded to An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police) so the true number is likely to be higher. In 2019, 99.4% of suspected offenders of sexual violence were men. Women were much less likely to be the victims in cases of murder or manslaughter than men, with six women killed in 2020 - representing 16% of victims - compared to 32 men. In 2019, the percentage of women killed in such circumstances was 18.4%, in 2018 it was 22.5% and in 2017 it was 35.2%. In Northern Ireland, meanwhile, police recently released statistics that showed over the Christmas period - from 14 December to 1 January - officers received 1,959 calls for help from victims of domestic abuse, a rise of 12% compared to the previous year. Women's Aid, which has been recording violent deaths of women at the hands of men in Ireland since 1996, points out that women are more likely to be killed in their own homes than anywhere else. Its Femicide Factsheet for 2020 recorded 236 women killed by men between 1996 and November 2020. It stated that 55% of those women were killed by a partner or ex-partner and that 87% of victims knew their killer. Ashling Murphy was a teacher and talented folk musician Sarah Benson, Women's Aid Ireland chief executive, said the nature of Ms Murphy's murder in broad daylight had shaken many women. ""We know it's far more common that a woman's own home will be the more dangerous place for her - quite different to men's experience of extreme violence - but what this has done has really shaken every woman and every teenage girl,"" she told the BBC. ""Any measure we take has to take a completely zero-tolerance strategy, that no man has the right to lay hands on any woman. ""We must focus on the behaviour and attitudes of perpetrators of violence in order to dismantle them and work with men as allies in order to model healthy, respectful behaviours. ""We really feel like there is a momentum now and I really want to be able to look back in a year's time and say yes, this is just appalling and unthinkable but it was not for absolutely nothing, we have taken on some of the lessons and moved forward."" Teacher's killing a 'depraved act of violence' In pictures: Mourners line the streets for Ashling Murphy 'What happened to her could have happened to me' The new strategy will be the third national strategy in Irish history, so it is not the first time attempts have been made to tackle an issue which has not gone away. So is there any feeling that things might be different this time around? ""I hope and I really do feel that there is a momentum here, I feel we must not squander it,"" Ms Benson said. Dr SaidlÃ©ar is also optimistic about progress but sounded a warning. ""The experience of the feminist movement, one thing we know for certain is there's always a backlash, we know there is always a pushback, we know that the status quo is the patriarchy and we always see hints of it,"" she said. ""We always have to remain alert and we have to remain dynamic.""

Yorkshire appoint Gibson as head coach,"Ottis Gibson (left) has worked with England on a number of occasions Yorkshire have appointed former West Indies all-rounder Ottis Gibson as their new head coach on a three-year deal. Gibson, 52, will take charge at the end of February and replaces Andrew Gale, who wassacked during the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal. The former West Indies and South Africa head coach will report to interim managing director Darren Gough. ""I'm extremely honoured and excited to be given the opportunity,"" said Gibson. The ex-England and Bangladesh bowling coach added: ""This is one of the most prestigious roles in English county cricket, and I am really looking forward to working with this talented group of players to take the club forward. ""I've spoken at length with Goughy about the direction the club is heading in and I'm excited to be a part of that future."" Gibson will have overall responsibility for the performance and management of the first team and will be supported by two assistant coaches who will be appointed shortly. The former Durham, Glamorgan and Leicestershire player will join Yorkshire once his contract with the Multan Sultans in the Pakistan Super League finishes next month. Gough, who becameinterim managing director in December, said: ""Ottis becoming head coach is an important moment for Yorkshire County Cricket Club, and we are very happy he has become part of the team. ""Ottis is one of the best coaches in the world and will be a fantastic addition. His knowledge, commitment, experience and cricket knowhow will be vital for us as we move into pre-season and get ourselves up and running. ""We were absolutely blown away by the level of interest and quality of candidates for this role, but I have no doubt he's the best person for the job and will pick up the challenge with relish."" Lord Patel, chair of Yorkshire, added: ""Ottis' playing and coaching credentials speak for themselves and he has had a distinguished career performing at the highest level. ""His character and his commitment to buying into the process that we are going through at Yorkshire County Cricket Club shone through in our discussions. ""He is someone I know will encourage dialogue and help foster a culture of inclusion at the club, as well as supporting and developing the world-class talent we have here and pushing them to the next level."" Gibson played two Test matches and 15 one-day internationals during a 17-year playing career, and was in charge of the West Indies team that won the 2012 T20 World Cup. He took 1,024 wickets and scored 8,552 runs during his career. Gale and director of cricket Martyn Moxon were among 16 people to leave Yorkshire amid the racism scandal. A report found former player Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018, was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"". Rafiq was born in Pakistan and moved to England aged 10, and he captained England teams at youth level and also led Yorkshire in 2012. However, in September 2020, following aninitial interview with Wisden,external, Rafiq toldESPN Cricinfo,external""institutional racism"" encountered while at the club left him close to taking his own life. He told BBC Sporthe dreaded ""every second"" of his career and a team-mate used a racially offensive term linked to his Pakistani heritage. Last week Rafiq saidYorkshire had taken ""a step in the right direction"" and theirsuspension from hosting England gamesshould be lifted. Meanwhile, Yorkshire has proposed amending its rules to remove the requirement that written approval from the Trustees of the Graves Trusts was required in order to appoint or remove board members. Lord Patel said the change would ""remove any misunderstanding of the role of the Trusts"". ""Lending from the Graves Trusts is incredibly important financially for Yorkshire, but Trustees are not involved in how we run the club,"" he added. ""Since I became Chair, we have had very constructive discussions with the Trustees, who are fully supportive of the steps we are taking to rebuild the club and invested in our success, but it is clear to me that they hold no influence on the decisions of the Board as this is a commercial agreement.""

"Dairylea ad banned for showing upside down eatingFourteen people complained about the advert, including one viewer who said a toddler had copied it.UK","The ad showed two girls talking about where food went when you hang upside down An advert for Dairylea cheese has been banned for encouraging unsafe behaviour, after showing a child eating while hanging upside down. The ad - which was shown on catch-up television last August - featured two girls hanging from a goalpost, with one of them eating a cheese triangle. Fourteen people complained, including one viewer who said a toddler in their family had copied the girls. Dairylea owner Mondelez argued the risk of choking was low when upside down. The company pointed to research that it said suggested someone's ability to swallow was not affected by the position they ate in - and that being in a head-down position was recommended during a choking incident. It added the ad had intended to show parents giving their children more freedom, and there were two parents supervising in the background of the ad. Mondelez also said the advert - which aired on ITV Hub, All 4 and My 5 - had been scheduled alongside programmes not directed at children, so a limited number of children would have seen it. But the Advertising Standards Authority - which regulates adverts in the UK - agreed with the viewers who complained. It said many children would be familiar with a five-a-side football goalpost and it would be easy for them to copy the ad. The ASA said it had sought expert views on child accidents, and was advised that there was a potentially a high risk of choking in that situation. ""We also noted that one complainant had reported that their three-year-old relative, after seeing the ad, ate their food whilst hanging upside down,""it said in its ruling.,external The watchdog added: ""We considered that the ad condoned and encouraged younger children to eat whilst hanging upside down, which was an unsafe practice where there was potentially a high risk of choking."" Love Islanders called out over social media ads Theme park's Halloween advert 'likely to distress' The advert must not appear again. Mondelez said it was no longer running the ad and would remove references to eating upside down if it used the ad in future. A Mondelez spokesman said: ""We recognise and will abide by the ASA's decision but we are disappointed by the ruling. It was aimed at adults (parents) rather than young children and was deliberately scheduled away from programming likely to appeal to children under 16. As such, we believe it was unlikely to encourage 'copycat' behaviour by young children. ""We remain committed to responsible advertising and work with a range of partners to make sure our marketing meets and complies with all relevant UK regulations."" In a separate ruling released on the same day, adverts for Lipton Ice Tea and Aqua Pura water have also been banned for misleadingly claiming that the bottles were made from 100% recycled materials. A poster for Lipton Ice Tea seen on a bus shelter in August read: ""Deliciously refreshing, 100% recycled*."" But the asterisk linked to small text at the bottom of the poster which said it excluded the cap and label which were not recycled. The ASA said it was misleading, but a Pepsi Lipton International spokeswoman said: ""We did not intend to mislead anyone with this ad. For complete transparency, we added a note on the ad itself to clarify that it did not include the label and cap.""

"Cost of living rises at fastest pace for 30 yearsThe UK's cost of living surged by 5.4% in the 12 months to December, hitting its highest level since 1992.","Prices have gone up at their fastest rate in nearly 30 years - but there is worse to come, experts have warned. Soaring food costs and the energy bill crisis drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in another blow to struggling families. The last time inflation was higher was in March 1992, when it was 7.1%. And with gas and electricity costs set to rise further in the spring, analysts predict it will reach that level again. Households have seen their energy bills kept in check by the government's price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, but this is due to be revised on 1 April. As a result, fuel bills could increase by another 50% in the next few months, the energy industry has said. Why are gas prices so high? In 90 seconds: How does inflation affect you? Petrol prices: Are we paying too much at the pump? Inflation: Seven reasons living costs are rising globally At the same time, there are signs that the high cost of food is proving too much for many people. Richard Walker, boss of supermarket chain Iceland, said he was seeing an ""alarming"" rise in the use of food banks. ""There may be some people facing a choice between heating or eating. We're losing customers to hunger,"" he said. He added that his stores served some of the UK's most deprived communities. ""Some of our customers only have Â£25 a week to spend on food, so they're already struggling to make ends meet,"" he said. ""When you have real wages falling, Universal Credit top-up withdrawal, food inflation, tax rises, that obviously will hit hard."" The latest rise was announced by the Office for National Statistics,external, which said increases in prices of furniture, food and clothing also contributed to December's rise in the cost of living. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he understood the pressures people were facing, but the opposition Labour party said working families faced an impending ""triple whammy"" of financial pressures. The latest figures will increase pressure on the government, already under fire over tax rises set to take effect in April. They will also fuel calls for the Bank of England to raise interest rates in a bid to dampen consumer spending and bring inflation closer to its 2% target. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising. If the price of a bottle of milk is Â£1 and it rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. You may not notice price rises from month to month. But right now, prices are rising so quickly that the money people earn does not go as far. Why are prices rising so quickly? Separate official figures issued on Tuesday showed that average pay rises are failing to keep up with the rise in the cost of living. Regular pay, excluding bonuses and adjusted for inflation, fell 1% in November compared with the same month in the previous year. Paul Johnson, director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said people on low incomes would be particularly hard hit by the squeeze on living standards. ""Everyone, particularly those on modest incomes, has had a long period of wages not really growing any faster than prices over the last decade, so another increase at this point is going to be particularly painful,"" he told the BBC. Inflation at this level is a new phenomenon for many young people, who were not even born when prices were last rising this fast. One worker, 24-year-old Alfie Kearns from Liverpool, told the BBC he believed inflation was making it harder to save money so that he can move out of his family home. ""Energy bills and gas and everything has been going up,"" he said. ""A big thing for me right now is I want to move out, I want my own home and that's the next step for me and it's just impossible in the current climate."" Gen Z: The people who've never seen soaring prices However, there is little sign of a respite for him and others like him, say analysts. Paul Dales of Capital Economics said inflation was now expected to hit 7% by April. ""That would be higher than the peak of 6% that the Bank of England was forecasting when it raised rates in December,"" he added. ""And although inflation will fall back thereafter, we think it will stay above 4% for all of this year and won't drop to the 2% target until April 2023."" As a result, he said, the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee was likely to raise interest rates faster than most people expected, with the next increase to 0.5% expected in February. PETROL:Are we paying too much at the pump? GAS PRICES:How can I protect myself from rising prices? IMPACT:'I'm so cold it feels like I'm sleeping outside' Already-high prices for gas, electricity, food and used cars are set to climb further in the coming months, said BBC economics editor Faisal Islam. Meanwhile, the Retail Price Index, an inflation measure which is still widely used by government and some businesses, including for wage bargaining, is already at 7.5%. The concern is not only that the predicted peak of inflation is getting higher, but that it will prove ""stickier"" than expected, he added. Kate Greig helps run the Kent Food Hub in Ashford Businesses, who face soaring wholesale prices, now face the dilemma of whether to pass on those costs to squeezed consumers. One businesswoman, Kate Greig, helps run Kent Food Hubs, a co-operative that helps traders and producers in the county to sell direct to customers. She said her suppliers are seeing increases in their material costs, as well as things such as energy bills. ""Food is more expensive, fuel is more expensive,"" she told the BBC. ""For my traders, raw materials are more expensive, whether that's the lentils to make a meal or the cardboard they use to package it."" Commenting on the crisis, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I understand the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, and we will continue to listen to people's concerns as we have done throughout the pandemic."" He said the government was providing support worth about Â£12bn this financial year and next to help families cope. Shadow Treasury secretary Pat McFadden said: ""These figures show that the cost-of-living crisis is only going to get worse in the coming months. ""Working families are already feeling the crunch. But the triple whammy of an imminent rise in the energy price cap, real wages falling and Tory tax rises coming down the tracks are going to make this crisis even worse.""

"Johnson set to ease England's Plan B Covid rulesThe decision on Plan B is ""finely balanced"" but current data is ""encouraging"", the government says.UKComments","This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister announces plans to end Plan B measures in England England's Plan B measures are to end from next Thursday, with mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports both dropped, Boris Johnson has announced. The prime minister also said the government would immediately drop its advice for people to work from home. The PM said England was reverting to ""Plan A"" due to boosters and how people had followed Plan B measures. He told MPs scientists believed the Omicron wave had peaked nationally. At a Downing Street press conference, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This is a moment we can all be proud of. ""It's a reminder of what this country can accomplish when we all work together."" But, he said, this should not be seen as the ""finish line"" because the virus and future variants cannot be eradicated - instead ""we must learn to live with Covid in the same way we live with flu"". He urged people to continue taking steps to keep the virus at bay, including hand washing, ventilating rooms and self-isolating if positive - and pressed those who were unvaccinated to come forward to get their jabs. Earlier, in a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, the prime minister said: Mandatory Covid passports for entering nightclubs and large events would end, though organisations could choose to use the NHS Covid pass if they wished People would no longer be advised to work from home and should discuss their return to offices with employers Face masks will no longer be mandated, though people are still advised to wear coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces and when meeting strangers From Thursday, secondary school pupils will no longer have to wear face masks in classrooms and government guidance on their use in communal areas would be removed ""shortly"" Further announcements on the easing of travel rules and restrictions on care home visits in England are expected in the coming days, Boris Johnson added. 'Plan B was a catastrophe for our coffee shop' Covid infections falling across the UK, says ONS How are Covid rules changing next week? The prime minister also said the government intended to end the legal requirement for people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate - and replace it with advice and guidance. The current regulations around self-isolation expire on 24 March. Mr Johnson said he expected not to renew them then - and suggested that date could be brought forward if the data allows. Citing thelatest infection study by the Office for National Statistics,external, Mr Johnson said its data showed that infections levels were falling in England. He also said hospital admissions had stabilised and scientists believed ""it is likely that the Omicron wave has now peaked nationally"". However, he said he did expect cases to continue rising in primary schools and pointed to significant pressures on the NHS in north-east and north-west England. Looking ahead, Mr Johnson said the government would set out its long-term strategy for living with coronavirus. He urged people to ""remain cautious"" during the last weeks of winter as there were still ""significant pressures"" on the NHS and the pandemic was ""not over"". In response, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would back lifting Plan B measures ""as long as the science says it is safe"" and accused the prime minister of being ""too distracted"" to have a ""robust plan to live well with Covid"". School leaders' unions said Covid remained a challenge for schools, with high numbers of staff and pupils absent. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the end of face coverings in classrooms, but warned the government risked giving the impression the crisis was over when there was still huge disruption in education. And the Royal College of Nursing said dropping Plan B would do ""nothing to ease the pressure on the NHS"". ""We can't rely on the vaccine alone when the situation is still so precariously balanced,"" its chief executive Pat Cullen said. But for the hospitality sector, which suffered as people worked from home and were cautious over Omicron, there was relief. Industry group UKHospitality said businesses could now begin their revival and recovery. The whole of Plan B is going. But is it too soon? Infections levels, while falling, are still well above what they were last winter. And hospital admissions have only just started coming down. The fact remains that England - and the rest of the UK for that matter - is one of the best protected nations when you combine the immunity built up by vaccination and previous infection. This does not mean people will not catch the virus in the future, but it does limit how many will become seriously ill. What's more, this Omicron wave appears to have peaked at just over 2,000 hospital admissions a day - very much best-case scenario territory. This has given both ministers and the scientists advising them confidence that it's at least time to ease restrictions. Others will argue this is going too far, too quickly. But in the end it comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. And certainly you have to wonder what impact the politics involved in this has had - the Tory backbenchers were unlikely to vote to keep any part of Plan B. But in the end it also comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. There is a trade-off that has to be made between the costs of such restrictions and the benefits they bring. With the worst of the Omicron wave almost certainly over, the benefits were reducing. The latest Covid restrictions were first introduced in December to try to slow the spread of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant and allow time for the booster vaccine rollout. UK daily infections remain high but are falling - on Wednesday, the UK recorded 108,069 new cases. Dr Susan Hopkins, the UK Health Security Agency's chief medical adviser, said case rates would largely decline but ""may plateau at some point"". Vaccine uptake and mask wearing around strangers would determine how quickly that happens, she added. Hospital admissions also appear to be decreasing. However, there is a lag between people catching the virus and becoming seriously ill so deaths are continuing to rise - and are up 14.7% on last week. On Wednesday, 359 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded. Nearly 37 million boosters have been given across the UK so far. RULES:What are the latest rules in the UK? MASKS:Where do I need to wear a face covering? COVID PASSPORTS:Where do I need to show one? SCHOOLS:What are the rules in schools? The UK's devolved nations set their own Covid restrictions andhave moved at different speeds in introducing and easing them throughout the pandemic. InScotland, some restrictions will be lifted from Monday, including allowing nightclubs to reopen and removing limits on indoor events. In Wales, crowds will return to sporting events from Friday and nightclubs can reopen the following week. In Northern Ireland, nightclubs remain closed and indoor standing events are not allowed.

How Boris Johnson's future hangs in the balanceMany Tory MPs will be listening closely to his answers as he faces Prime Minster's Questions.UK Politics,"The prime minister will face Sir Keir Starmer again in the Commons at lunchtime. Boris Johnson will know, though, that some of his fiercest critics will be sitting behind, and not in front of, him. Half a dozen of his own MPs have publicly called for him to go, and some others are privately of the same view. He will, of course, expect to hear cheers from supporters and from some other colleagues who want to rally round in the face of Labour attacks. Perhaps more crucially, though, are a disparate group of MPs that you might call ""considerers"". They are weighing up whether to submit letters of no confidence, which would trigger a leadership contest. They will be listening closely to his answers. So what - for now - is holding them back? Most Conservative MPs will say they will await the conclusion of the investigation into the gatherings in Downing Street by the senior civil servant Sue Gray before deciding how to proceed. One of those who has already called for Mr Johnson's departure has urged his colleagues ""to grow some"". He said he had 1,500 hostile letters from constituents and ""this can't go on"". But in truth some of those colleagues tell me they are merely awaiting the completion of ""due process"". Virtually irrespective of what Sue Gray says, they will join the cacophonous chorus calling for him to go in due course. One of them said he was simply waiting for other colleagues to ""catch up"" with the conclusion he had reached. For others, though, it matters hugely what Ms Gray says. Although she won't sit in judgement of the prime minister, and will simply set out the facts, it will be important to some leadership-sceptics which facts she sets out. One of them told me that if she can substantiate Dominic Cummings's claim that the prime minister was told about the nature of the event on 20 May 2020 - that was a social not a work gathering - then more letters of no confidence were likely to go in as MPs would feel they had been misled by the prime minister. Sue Gray's report could come out soon This, of course, may not materialise - the prime ministerhimself denied again on Tuesdaythat he was warned the event could be against the rules. Dominic Cummings has allegedin his blog,externalthat the prime minister had been told. This, too, puts pressure on Sue Gray to investigate the claims, and avoid any impression of a whitewash. That said, if Sue Gray merely uncovers evidence that the civil servant Martin Reynolds was warned about proceeding with the event, some MPs will be content to see a clear-out of No 10 officials, and their potential rebellion could fade. One well-placed MP declared ""she is not going to throw the prime minster under a bus"" - and that a plan was in place for staffing changes at No 10. And a former cabinet minister told me he expected ""deputy heads to roll"" in order to save the prime minister. He did not believe Mr Johnson could remain in No 10 until the next election, but that he could stave off an immediate threat. For some Conservative MPs there are other considerations. One MP told me he was on the verge of sending a no-confidence email, but key figures in his constituency association - the grassroots Tories who selected him and campaigned for him - wanted to support the prime minister - and, more widely, there is polling which suggests he has retained more support amongst activists than voters. However, there is significant pressure from Conservative voters. At least one constituency association has been checking negative letters and emails against the list of supporters that they would canvass at election time, and that has made grim reading. Many MPs say the incoming criticism goes beyond ""the usual suspects"". And this in turn could yet tip the balance against the prime minister. So far cabinet ministers are staying solid. But the thin blue line of junior ministers is under strain. Maria Caulfield is one minister who has been critical of her boss the prime minister Junior minister Maria Caulfield posted on Facebook that she ""fully appreciates the depth of anger on this issue"" amongst her constituents and that ""it is clear the spirit of the rules"" was broken. Science minister George Freeman made clear that he was angry about staff in No 10 holding parties - though he would not pass judgment at this stage on the prime minister. And privately another junior minister has said that her postbag isn't just critical of the prime minister but increasingly hostile to her. She is not - even off the record - calling for the prime minister to go yet - but the prospect of ""party-gate"" sullying the reputations of those who had nothing to do with the gatherings has touched a raw nerve. If the prime minister's future is in the balance, this may in due course put more weight on the ""go"" rather than ""stay"" scale. It's been suggested that some sceptical MPs will rally round because they do not want to indulge a ""Dominic Cummings coup"" against an elected leader. And that this could perhaps move the balance back in the PM's favour. But that he is the source of some - and by no means all - of the allegations against the PM isn't weighing heavily on the minds of some of the considerers. One of the 2019 intake was under no illusions about Mr Cummings' role, but nonetheless felt that his attacks would have misfired if the prime minister himself had not given him the ammunition. A former minister told me: ""Just because he is the source of a story is not a reason to ignore the story."" And there are concerns that Mr Cummings will come forward with more claims even after Sue Gray reports, and this will be corrosive if the prime minister stays in No 10. So far it's been fellow Brexiteers - such as Andrew Bridgen and Tim Loughton - who have publicly urged the prime minister to go. Worryingly for him, these also tend to be people sceptical of lockdown measures. So one aspect of his fightback - the lifting of restrictions in England later this month - won't suddenly get them to reverse their view. But what of those who were perhaps more sceptical of Boris Johnson all along? TheOne Nation group,externalof MPs met behind closed doors on Monday night. They had gathered to hear from the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson on Northern Ireland - a party which has had its own leadership problems - and the question of Conservative leadership came up in the second half of the meeting. MPs shared tales of dismal postbags and I'm told there was an ""intense"" discussion on what to do. While broadly there was a feeling of ""inevitability"", there were different views on timing. One MP told me he was against triggering a confidence vote now, because he feared ""Boris Johnson could win"" and ""we would be stuck with him for the next two years"". But one of his colleagues favoured a swifter move because he felt that unless Mr Johnson won a confidence vote convincingly ""he will be handed the pearl-handled revolver"".

REALITY CHECK:The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held PROFILE:What is Sue Gray investigating? TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings How the timing of a contest would play with the public is weighing on some people's minds - would it look less indulgent to move after potentially poor local elections in May rather than in the midst of a pandemic? And would it be better if Mr Johnson took the hit for national insurance rises and increased energy costs in the spring rather than his successor? ""It's all about the pace at which this occurs"" - and not whether it will occur - according to a former minister. But some MPs are already mulling over what would come next. One MP who has not been publicly critical of the prime minister is simply concerned that any replacement would not be as effective at appealing to first-time Conservative voters. ""Do we really want a dull manager as leader?"" he mused. And those who are likely to seek to replace him do not seem to be in an immediate rush. Letters of no confidence are sent to Sir Graham Brady - the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. He is the very personification of discretion so estimates of how many letters he has received - 54 would lead to a confidence vote, which in turn would trigger a leadership contest if the prime minister loses that vote - are hugely speculative. One former minister believes the sheer volume of public complaint makes it likely that more letters may have been, or will be, quietly submitted by his colleagues without much flourish or co-ordination. And just 24 hours before PMQs a group of around 20 MPs elected at the 2019 election met behind closed doors at Westminster, where the mood was said to be hardening - with the possibility that more no-confidence letters are submitted after PMQs. Will two Tory tribes go to war with the PM? The Northern Research Group of MPs also met privately on Tuesday afternoon. So it may take little more to tip the balance. But, of course, letters can be withdrawn as well as submitted - so the prime minister's performance at PMQs, and then the tone of his response to Sue Gray, may yet tip the balance back in his favour. And while Labour is publicly claiming it is in the ""national interest"" for Mr Johnson to go, privately shadow ministers believe it's in their party interest if he continues in office. So if Sir Keir Starmer succeeds in further wounding the prime minister, it will be his own MPs who will have to decide whether it's better to then move in for the kill.

Thank you for joining us. Your writers were Adam Durbin, Malu Cursino, Chris Giles, Doug Faulkner and George Wright. The page was edited by Emma Owen, George Bowden and Kevin Ponniah. As we draw our live coverage to a close - here's a summary of the key coronavirus developments: Elsewhere, and a folk singer from the Czech Republic has died after deliberately catching Covid, her son has told the BBC. Hana Horka, 57, was unvaccinated and had posted on social media that she was recovering after testing positive, but died two days later. Her son, Jan Rek, said she got infected on purpose when he and his father had the virus, so she could get a recovery pass to access certain venues. The Czech Republic reported a record number of cases on Wednesday. Read the full story here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the consequences of seeing so much infection, so much spread of the virus, is that we're seeing a growing number of what are called ""coincidental deaths"". This is where people test have tested positive but they haven't been sick with the virus. Then they have died within 28 days of that positive test but it is nothing to do with the positive test and we're beginning to see more of this. I think the Office of National Statistics is going to have a look at this so we have a real idea of just how many people are dying due to the virus. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Away from changes to restrictions - an inquiry is being launched into children who are not attending school in the wake of national lockdowns, the children's commissioner for England has said. Dame Rachel de Souza toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programmeabout 95% of children were usually in school at this time of year - but now, this figure was about 87%. Some absences were down to illness and Covid, she said, but other children had simply failed to return following classroom closures during the pandemic. In addition, between 80,000 and 100,000 children were not on any school rolls at all, she said. ""Literally, I am going to go out and find them,"" she added. The Department for Education said its ""top priority"" was supporting children to attend school and college. You canread the full story here. For anyone just catching up with our coverage, you can watch some of the key moments from Health Secretary Sajid Javid speaking at the news conference about the end of Plan B in England. This video can not be played UK Covid: End of Plan B in England 'not the finish', says Sajid Javid Sajid Javid has just hosted a news conference at Downing Street. Here are the key points: Meanwhile, the UK has reported 108,069 new daily Covid cases and 359 deaths with Covid on Wednesday.  The Financial Times asks about the ""ongoing anger"" in the UK over Downing Street parties, and Javid says he has also been angered and pained by the revelations. He adds Boris Johnson has rightly apologised and reiterates calls for people to wait for the outcome of an investigation into the lockdown gatherings in No 10 and other government departments. In response to a follow up question about evidence for decision making, the health secretary says the government has been transparent throughout the pandemic and would will continue to be so. Javid adds the government is looking at expanding the definition of fully vaccinated to three doses of a vaccine, rather than the current two jabs. The news conference ends. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says Covid case numbers have declined and adds âitâs peopleâs behaviour that is going to make the difference over the next four weeksâ. She says people need to be careful when returning to the office and also take care using public transport, indoor spaces and in crowded places. She recommends people continue to wear face coverings, even thought they wonât be mandatory and to ensure they are fully vaccinated. She says the more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we will see mass Covid transmission. The health secretary is challenged by Jane Merrick from the i newspaper as to whether Boris Johnson just ""got lucky"" that Plan B worked. The journalist says the PM wanted stronger restrictions but was blocked by members of his cabinet and Tory MPs. Javid responds by saying Johnson ""has shown leadership throughout"" and that he has had to balance conflicting issues and come to a judgement over restrictions. ""The decision that he made to absolutely focus on boosters has been vindicated,"" he says. Asked if he can rule out the return of Plan B if a new variant of concern emerges, Javid says ""this pandemic is still with us"" and ""this is not the end of the road"". ""There will be future variants,"" he warns. On whether the current daily Covid death toll of 359 is something the country needs to be comfortable with in the future, the health secretary says vaccines have meant the death rate has fallen dramatically. He adds the Omicron variant is milder than previous variants and if you look at the average daily death rate, it is around 200 people. Javid says it is important to point out that around 40% of people with Covid in hospital are there not because they have Covid, but have tested positive after being admitted. Asked whether the UK will be effectively be living with no restrictions by the end of March, Javid points out that a third of all UK cases since the pandemic began are linked to Omicron. He says that there will still be some requirements and restrictions, including lateral flow tests for those arriving in England. ""But we are going to have to find a way to remove almost all of these restrictions and get life back to normal with one or two things there for a while,"" Javid adds, citing annual vaccinations for some of those most at risk, as well as testing and anti-virals. Asked by Sky News about plans to end self-isolation rules entirely, Sajid Javid says no decision has yet been taken. He adds it is important to keep this in place for the moment, but the evidence will be under constant review. It is reasonable that the government will eventually no longer legally require people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate, he says, making the point that people with flu are not asked to do so. Earlier Javid said the UK needed to learn to live with Covid in the long-term, as it does with flu. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks Sajid Javid: ""How can the PM continue to lead the country when one of his most senior MPs in the Commons has called on him to resign?"" Javid says that ""what we've seen in the last few weeks... has caused a lot of pain and anger"". He says that he absolutely understands this and that Johnson has rightly apologised and asked for time and space for an investigation to be completed. The PM will be happy to be scrutinised when the facts have been established, Javid adds.  Michelle from Lincolnshire asks about the reduction of the self-isolation period to 5 days with two negative tests. In response Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says people with two negative tests can be released earlier as it allows people to return to work and school. She explains the change is in response to emerging evidence. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency has been outlining the NHS' successful booster campaign. She says: âWe have now got, compared to comparable countries across Europe and North America, the highest rate of boosters in our population overall.â She adds âthe strongest defence we have against the Omicron wave that weâre now experiencing and any future waves of variantsâ¦ is vaccination.â Christina from Berkshire asks Javid if, given the increasing number of hospitalisation of children with Covid-19, there are plans to vaccinate children under 12. Javid says the focus at the moment is on children over 12, but that she is right to raise younger children. He says that the advice from independent experts is that the under-12s who are at risk should be vaccinated. But the experts are considering whether to widen this advice to all under-12s like in other countries. Javid says the NHS is still facing ""significant pressure"" and says the country must ""proceed with caution"". ""A pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint"", he says. The health secretary reiterates calls for people to continue to get vaccinated and boosted, adding it was ""the jabs that have got us this far and the jabs can keep us here too"". Laying out the plans for removing Plan B restrictions, Javid says the government is also looking at removing mandatory self-isolation for people who contract Covid-19. He adds they intend to set out plans to reduce restrictions on visiting care homes soon. The health secretary adds that removing restrictions is a ""major milestone but not the end of the road"" and the government intends to set out its plan for living with Covid in the coming weeks. ""We shouldnât
see this as the finish line,"" he says. ""We cannot eradicate this virus and its future variants."" Javid says Plan B succeeded giving the government extra time to combat Omicron and the newest data shows Omicron is ""in retreat"". The health secretary adds that hospitalisations have fallen and patients in intensive care are at the same levels as they were in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Johnson set to ease England's Plan B Covid rulesThe decision on Plan B is ""finely balanced"" but current data is ""encouraging"", the government says.UK","This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister announces plans to end Plan B measures in England England's Plan B measures are to end from next Thursday, with mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports both dropped, Boris Johnson has announced. The prime minister also said the government would immediately drop its advice for people to work from home. The PM said England was reverting to ""Plan A"" due to boosters and how people had followed Plan B measures. He told MPs scientists believed the Omicron wave had peaked nationally. At a Downing Street press conference, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This is a moment we can all be proud of. ""It's a reminder of what this country can accomplish when we all work together."" But, he said, this should not be seen as the ""finish line"" because the virus and future variants cannot be eradicated - instead ""we must learn to live with Covid in the same way we live with flu"". He urged people to continue taking steps to keep the virus at bay, including hand washing, ventilating rooms and self-isolating if positive - and pressed those who were unvaccinated to come forward to get their jabs. Earlier, in a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, the prime minister said: Mandatory Covid passports for entering nightclubs and large events would end, though organisations could choose to use the NHS Covid pass if they wished People would no longer be advised to work from home and should discuss their return to offices with employers Face masks will no longer be mandated, though people are still advised to wear coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces and when meeting strangers From Thursday, secondary school pupils will no longer have to wear face masks in classrooms and government guidance on their use in communal areas would be removed ""shortly"" Further announcements on the easing of travel rules and restrictions on care home visits in England are expected in the coming days, Boris Johnson added.

The prime minister also said the government intended to end the legal requirement for people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate - and replace it with advice and guidance. The current regulations around self-isolation expire on 24 March. Mr Johnson said he expected not to renew them then - and suggested that date could be brought forward if the data allows. Citing thelatest infection study by the Office for National Statistics,external, Mr Johnson said its data showed that infections levels were falling in England. He also said hospital admissions had stabilised and scientists believed ""it is likely that the Omicron wave has now peaked nationally"". However, he said he did expect cases to continue rising in primary schools and pointed to significant pressures on the NHS in north-east and north-west England. Looking ahead, Mr Johnson said the government would set out its long-term strategy for living with coronavirus. He urged people to ""remain cautious"" during the last weeks of winter as there were still ""significant pressures"" on the NHS and the pandemic was ""not over"". In response, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would back lifting Plan B measures ""as long as the science says it is safe"" and accused the prime minister of being ""too distracted"" to have a ""robust plan to live well with Covid"". School leaders' unions said Covid remained a challenge for schools, with high numbers of staff and pupils absent. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the end of face coverings in classrooms, but warned the government risked giving the impression the crisis was over when there was still huge disruption in education. And the Royal College of Nursing said dropping Plan B would do ""nothing to ease the pressure on the NHS"". ""We can't rely on the vaccine alone when the situation is still so precariously balanced,"" its chief executive Pat Cullen said. But for the hospitality sector, which suffered as people worked from home and were cautious over Omicron, there was relief. Industry group UKHospitality said businesses could now begin their revival and recovery. The whole of Plan B is going. But is it too soon? Infections levels, while falling, are still well above what they were last winter. And hospital admissions have only just started coming down. The fact remains that England - and the rest of the UK for that matter - is one of the best protected nations when you combine the immunity built up by vaccination and previous infection. This does not mean people will not catch the virus in the future, but it does limit how many will become seriously ill. What's more, this Omicron wave appears to have peaked at just over 2,000 hospital admissions a day - very much best-case scenario territory. This has given both ministers and the scientists advising them confidence that it's at least time to ease restrictions. Others will argue this is going too far, too quickly. But in the end it comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. And certainly you have to wonder what impact the politics involved in this has had - the Tory backbenchers were unlikely to vote to keep any part of Plan B. But in the end it also comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. There is a trade-off that has to be made between the costs of such restrictions and the benefits they bring. With the worst of the Omicron wave almost certainly over, the benefits were reducing. The latest Covid restrictions were first introduced in December to try to slow the spread of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant and allow time for the booster vaccine rollout. UK daily infections remain high but are falling - on Wednesday, the UK recorded 108,069 new cases. Dr Susan Hopkins, the UK Health Security Agency's chief medical adviser, said case rates would largely decline but ""may plateau at some point"". Vaccine uptake and mask wearing around strangers would determine how quickly that happens, she added. Hospital admissions also appear to be decreasing. However, there is a lag between people catching the virus and becoming seriously ill so deaths are continuing to rise - and are up 14.7% on last week. On Wednesday, 359 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded. Nearly 37 million boosters have been given across the UK so far. RULES:What are the latest rules in the UK?

LiveLiveCovid: Ministers expected to sign off on relaxing rules2 minutes ago,"Omicron is ""in retreat"", Health Secretary Sajid Javid says, with the UK now marking the start of a new chapter in the fight against Covid-19 This is a ""major milestone"" but not the finish line, he tells a No 10 press conference, adding: ""We must learn to live with Covid"" Earlier Boris Johnson announced an end to Plan B Covid restrictions in England Working from home guidance ends today and from tomorrow, face masks will no longer be required in any classrooms From next Thursday, masks will not be mandated anywhere and Covid passes will no longer be needed at large events People who test positive for Covid will still have to self-isolate but Javid said that could not continue forever The UK has reported 108,069 new daily Covid cases and 359 deaths with Covid on Wednesday Edited by Emma Owen and George Bowden We're ending our live coverage of coronavirus developments today. Thank you for joining us. Your writers were Adam Durbin, Malu Cursino, Chris Giles, Doug Faulkner and George Wright. The page was edited by Emma Owen, George Bowden and Kevin Ponniah. As we draw our live coverage to a close - here's a summary of the key coronavirus developments: Elsewhere, and a folk singer from the Czech Republic has died after deliberately catching Covid, her son has told the BBC. Hana Horka, 57, was unvaccinated and had posted on social media that she was recovering after testing positive, but died two days later. Her son, Jan Rek, said she got infected on purpose when he and his father had the virus, so she could get a recovery pass to access certain venues. The Czech Republic reported a record number of cases on Wednesday. Read the full story here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the consequences of seeing so much infection, so much spread of the virus, is that we're seeing a growing number of what are called ""coincidental deaths"". This is where people test have tested positive but they haven't been sick with the virus. Then they have died within 28 days of that positive test but it is nothing to do with the positive test and we're beginning to see more of this. I think the Office of National Statistics is going to have a look at this so we have a real idea of just how many people are dying due to the virus. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Away from changes to restrictions - an inquiry is being launched into children who are not attending school in the wake of national lockdowns, the children's commissioner for England has said. Dame Rachel de Souza toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programmeabout 95% of children were usually in school at this time of year - but now, this figure was about 87%. Some absences were down to illness and Covid, she said, but other children had simply failed to return following classroom closures during the pandemic. In addition, between 80,000 and 100,000 children were not on any school rolls at all, she said. ""Literally, I am going to go out and find them,"" she added. The Department for Education said its ""top priority"" was supporting children to attend school and college. You canread the full story here. For anyone just catching up with our coverage, you can watch some of the key moments from Health Secretary Sajid Javid speaking at the news conference about the end of Plan B in England. This video can not be played UK Covid: End of Plan B in England 'not the finish', says Sajid Javid Sajid Javid has just hosted a news conference at Downing Street. Here are the key points: Meanwhile, the UK has reported 108,069 new daily Covid cases and 359 deaths with Covid on Wednesday.  The Financial Times asks about the ""ongoing anger"" in the UK over Downing Street parties, and Javid says he has also been angered and pained by the revelations. He adds Boris Johnson has rightly apologised and reiterates calls for people to wait for the outcome of an investigation into the lockdown gatherings in No 10 and other government departments. In response to a follow up question about evidence for decision making, the health secretary says the government has been transparent throughout the pandemic and would will continue to be so. Javid adds the government is looking at expanding the definition of fully vaccinated to three doses of a vaccine, rather than the current two jabs. The news conference ends. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says Covid case numbers have declined and adds âitâs peopleâs behaviour that is going to make the difference over the next four weeksâ. She says people need to be careful when returning to the office and also take care using public transport, indoor spaces and in crowded places. She recommends people continue to wear face coverings, even thought they wonât be mandatory and to ensure they are fully vaccinated. She says the more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we will see mass Covid transmission. The health secretary is challenged by Jane Merrick from the i newspaper as to whether Boris Johnson just ""got lucky"" that Plan B worked. The journalist says the PM wanted stronger restrictions but was blocked by members of his cabinet and Tory MPs. Javid responds by saying Johnson ""has shown leadership throughout"" and that he has had to balance conflicting issues and come to a judgement over restrictions. ""The decision that he made to absolutely focus on boosters has been vindicated,"" he says. Asked if he can rule out the return of Plan B if a new variant of concern emerges, Javid says ""this pandemic is still with us"" and ""this is not the end of the road"". ""There will be future variants,"" he warns. On whether the current daily Covid death toll of 359 is something the country needs to be comfortable with in the future, the health secretary says vaccines have meant the death rate has fallen dramatically. He adds the Omicron variant is milder than previous variants and if you look at the average daily death rate, it is around 200 people. Javid says it is important to point out that around 40% of people with Covid in hospital are there not because they have Covid, but have tested positive after being admitted. Asked whether the UK will be effectively be living with no restrictions by the end of March, Javid points out that a third of all UK cases since the pandemic began are linked to Omicron. He says that there will still be some requirements and restrictions, including lateral flow tests for those arriving in England. ""But we are going to have to find a way to remove almost all of these restrictions and get life back to normal with one or two things there for a while,"" Javid adds, citing annual vaccinations for some of those most at risk, as well as testing and anti-virals. Asked by Sky News about plans to end self-isolation rules entirely, Sajid Javid says no decision has yet been taken. He adds it is important to keep this in place for the moment, but the evidence will be under constant review. It is reasonable that the government will eventually no longer legally require people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate, he says, making the point that people with flu are not asked to do so. Earlier Javid said the UK needed to learn to live with Covid in the long-term, as it does with flu. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks Sajid Javid: ""How can the PM continue to lead the country when one of his most senior MPs in the Commons has called on him to resign?"" Javid says that ""what we've seen in the last few weeks... has caused a lot of pain and anger"". He says that he absolutely understands this and that Johnson has rightly apologised and asked for time and space for an investigation to be completed. The PM will be happy to be scrutinised when the facts have been established, Javid adds.  Michelle from Lincolnshire asks about the reduction of the self-isolation period to 5 days with two negative tests. In response Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says people with two negative tests can be released earlier as it allows people to return to work and school. She explains the change is in response to emerging evidence. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency has been outlining the NHS' successful booster campaign. She says: âWe have now got, compared to comparable countries across Europe and North America, the highest rate of boosters in our population overall.â She adds âthe strongest defence we have against the Omicron wave that weâre now experiencing and any future waves of variantsâ¦ is vaccination.â Christina from Berkshire asks Javid if, given the increasing number of hospitalisation of children with Covid-19, there are plans to vaccinate children under 12. Javid says the focus at the moment is on children over 12, but that she is right to raise younger children. He says that the advice from independent experts is that the under-12s who are at risk should be vaccinated. But the experts are considering whether to widen this advice to all under-12s like in other countries. Javid says the NHS is still facing ""significant pressure"" and says the country must ""proceed with caution"". ""A pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint"", he says. The health secretary reiterates calls for people to continue to get vaccinated and boosted, adding it was ""the jabs that have got us this far and the jabs can keep us here too"". Laying out the plans for removing Plan B restrictions, Javid says the government is also looking at removing mandatory self-isolation for people who contract Covid-19. He adds they intend to set out plans to reduce restrictions on visiting care homes soon. The health secretary adds that removing restrictions is a ""major milestone but not the end of the road"" and the government intends to set out its plan for living with Covid in the coming weeks. ""We shouldnât
see this as the finish line,"" he says. ""We cannot eradicate this virus and its future variants."" Javid says Plan B succeeded giving the government extra time to combat Omicron and the newest data shows Omicron is ""in retreat"". The health secretary adds that hospitalisations have fallen and patients in intensive care are at the same levels as they were in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Johnson set to ease England's Plan B Covid rulesThe decision on Plan B is ""finely balanced"" but current data is ""encouraging"", the government says.","This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister announces plans to end Plan B measures in England England's Plan B measures are to end from next Thursday, with mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports both dropped, Boris Johnson has announced. The prime minister also said the government would immediately drop its advice for people to work from home. The PM said England was reverting to ""Plan A"" due to boosters and how people had followed Plan B measures. He told MPs scientists believed the Omicron wave had peaked nationally. At a Downing Street press conference, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This is a moment we can all be proud of. ""It's a reminder of what this country can accomplish when we all work together."" But, he said, this should not be seen as the ""finish line"" because the virus and future variants cannot be eradicated - instead ""we must learn to live with Covid in the same way we live with flu"". He urged people to continue taking steps to keep the virus at bay, including hand washing, ventilating rooms and self-isolating if positive - and pressed those who were unvaccinated to come forward to get their jabs. Earlier, in a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, the prime minister said: Mandatory Covid passports for entering nightclubs and large events would end, though organisations could choose to use the NHS Covid pass if they wished People would no longer be advised to work from home and should discuss their return to offices with employers Face masks will no longer be mandated, though people are still advised to wear coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces and when meeting strangers From Thursday, secondary school pupils will no longer have to wear face masks in classrooms and government guidance on their use in communal areas would be removed ""shortly"" Further announcements on the easing of travel rules and restrictions on care home visits in England are expected in the coming days, Boris Johnson added.

Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Away from changes to restrictions - an inquiry is being launched into children who are not attending school in the wake of national lockdowns, the children's commissioner for England has said. Dame Rachel de Souza toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programmeabout 95% of children were usually in school at this time of year - but now, this figure was about 87%. Some absences were down to illness and Covid, she said, but other children had simply failed to return following classroom closures during the pandemic. In addition, between 80,000 and 100,000 children were not on any school rolls at all, she said. ""Literally, I am going to go out and find them,"" she added. The Department for Education said its ""top priority"" was supporting children to attend school and college. You canread the full story here. For anyone just catching up with our coverage, you can watch some of the key moments from Health Secretary Sajid Javid speaking at the news conference about the end of Plan B in England. This video can not be played UK Covid: End of Plan B in England 'not the finish', says Sajid Javid Sajid Javid has just hosted a news conference at Downing Street. Here are the key points: Meanwhile, the UK has reported 108,069 new daily Covid cases and 359 deaths with Covid on Wednesday.  The Financial Times asks about the ""ongoing anger"" in the UK over Downing Street parties, and Javid says he has also been angered and pained by the revelations. He adds Boris Johnson has rightly apologised and reiterates calls for people to wait for the outcome of an investigation into the lockdown gatherings in No 10 and other government departments. In response to a follow up question about evidence for decision making, the health secretary says the government has been transparent throughout the pandemic and would will continue to be so. Javid adds the government is looking at expanding the definition of fully vaccinated to three doses of a vaccine, rather than the current two jabs. The news conference ends. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says Covid case numbers have declined and adds âitâs peopleâs behaviour that is going to make the difference over the next four weeksâ. She says people need to be careful when returning to the office and also take care using public transport, indoor spaces and in crowded places. She recommends people continue to wear face coverings, even thought they wonât be mandatory and to ensure they are fully vaccinated. She says the more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we will see mass Covid transmission. The health secretary is challenged by Jane Merrick from the i newspaper as to whether Boris Johnson just ""got lucky"" that Plan B worked. The journalist says the PM wanted stronger restrictions but was blocked by members of his cabinet and Tory MPs. Javid responds by saying Johnson ""has shown leadership throughout"" and that he has had to balance conflicting issues and come to a judgement over restrictions. ""The decision that he made to absolutely focus on boosters has been vindicated,"" he says. Asked if he can rule out the return of Plan B if a new variant of concern emerges, Javid says ""this pandemic is still with us"" and ""this is not the end of the road"". ""There will be future variants,"" he warns. On whether the current daily Covid death toll of 359 is something the country needs to be comfortable with in the future, the health secretary says vaccines have meant the death rate has fallen dramatically. He adds the Omicron variant is milder than previous variants and if you look at the average daily death rate, it is around 200 people. Javid says it is important to point out that around 40% of people with Covid in hospital are there not because they have Covid, but have tested positive after being admitted. Asked whether the UK will be effectively be living with no restrictions by the end of March, Javid points out that a third of all UK cases since the pandemic began are linked to Omicron. He says that there will still be some requirements and restrictions, including lateral flow tests for those arriving in England. ""But we are going to have to find a way to remove almost all of these restrictions and get life back to normal with one or two things there for a while,"" Javid adds, citing annual vaccinations for some of those most at risk, as well as testing and anti-virals. Asked by Sky News about plans to end self-isolation rules entirely, Sajid Javid says no decision has yet been taken. He adds it is important to keep this in place for the moment, but the evidence will be under constant review. It is reasonable that the government will eventually no longer legally require people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate, he says, making the point that people with flu are not asked to do so. Earlier Javid said the UK needed to learn to live with Covid in the long-term, as it does with flu. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks Sajid Javid: ""How can the PM continue to lead the country when one of his most senior MPs in the Commons has called on him to resign?"" Javid says that ""what we've seen in the last few weeks... has caused a lot of pain and anger"". He says that he absolutely understands this and that Johnson has rightly apologised and asked for time and space for an investigation to be completed. The PM will be happy to be scrutinised when the facts have been established, Javid adds.  Michelle from Lincolnshire asks about the reduction of the self-isolation period to 5 days with two negative tests. In response Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says people with two negative tests can be released earlier as it allows people to return to work and school. She explains the change is in response to emerging evidence. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency has been outlining the NHS' successful booster campaign. She says: âWe have now got, compared to comparable countries across Europe and North America, the highest rate of boosters in our population overall.â She adds âthe strongest defence we have against the Omicron wave that weâre now experiencing and any future waves of variantsâ¦ is vaccination.â Christina from Berkshire asks Javid if, given the increasing number of hospitalisation of children with Covid-19, there are plans to vaccinate children under 12. Javid says the focus at the moment is on children over 12, but that she is right to raise younger children. He says that the advice from independent experts is that the under-12s who are at risk should be vaccinated. But the experts are considering whether to widen this advice to all under-12s like in other countries. Javid says the NHS is still facing ""significant pressure"" and says the country must ""proceed with caution"". ""A pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint"", he says. The health secretary reiterates calls for people to continue to get vaccinated and boosted, adding it was ""the jabs that have got us this far and the jabs can keep us here too"". Laying out the plans for removing Plan B restrictions, Javid says the government is also looking at removing mandatory self-isolation for people who contract Covid-19. He adds they intend to set out plans to reduce restrictions on visiting care homes soon. The health secretary adds that removing restrictions is a ""major milestone but not the end of the road"" and the government intends to set out its plan for living with Covid in the coming weeks. ""We shouldnât
see this as the finish line,"" he says. ""We cannot eradicate this virus and its future variants."" Javid says Plan B succeeded giving the government extra time to combat Omicron and the newest data shows Omicron is ""in retreat"". The health secretary adds that hospitalisations have fallen and patients in intensive care are at the same levels as they were in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

Johnson's future hangs in the balance,"The prime minister will face Sir Keir Starmer again in the Commons at lunchtime. Boris Johnson will know, though, that some of his fiercest critics will be sitting behind, and not in front of, him. Half a dozen of his own MPs have publicly called for him to go, and some others are privately of the same view. He will, of course, expect to hear cheers from supporters and from some other colleagues who want to rally round in the face of Labour attacks. Perhaps more crucially, though, are a disparate group of MPs that you might call ""considerers"". They are weighing up whether to submit letters of no confidence, which would trigger a leadership contest. They will be listening closely to his answers. So what - for now - is holding them back? Most Conservative MPs will say they will await the conclusion of the investigation into the gatherings in Downing Street by the senior civil servant Sue Gray before deciding how to proceed. One of those who has already called for Mr Johnson's departure has urged his colleagues ""to grow some"". He said he had 1,500 hostile letters from constituents and ""this can't go on"". But in truth some of those colleagues tell me they are merely awaiting the completion of ""due process"". Virtually irrespective of what Sue Gray says, they will join the cacophonous chorus calling for him to go in due course. One of them said he was simply waiting for other colleagues to ""catch up"" with the conclusion he had reached. For others, though, it matters hugely what Ms Gray says. Although she won't sit in judgement of the prime minister, and will simply set out the facts, it will be important to some leadership-sceptics which facts she sets out. One of them told me that if she can substantiate Dominic Cummings's claim that the prime minister was told about the nature of the event on 20 May 2020 - that was a social not a work gathering - then more letters of no confidence were likely to go in as MPs would feel they had been misled by the prime minister. Sue Gray's report could come out soon This, of course, may not materialise - the prime ministerhimself denied again on Tuesdaythat he was warned the event could be against the rules. Dominic Cummings has allegedin his blog,externalthat the prime minister had been told. This, too, puts pressure on Sue Gray to investigate the claims, and avoid any impression of a whitewash. That said, if Sue Gray merely uncovers evidence that the civil servant Martin Reynolds was warned about proceeding with the event, some MPs will be content to see a clear-out of No 10 officials, and their potential rebellion could fade. One well-placed MP declared ""she is not going to throw the prime minster under a bus"" - and that a plan was in place for staffing changes at No 10. And a former cabinet minister told me he expected ""deputy heads to roll"" in order to save the prime minister. He did not believe Mr Johnson could remain in No 10 until the next election, but that he could stave off an immediate threat. For some Conservative MPs there are other considerations. One MP told me he was on the verge of sending a no-confidence email, but key figures in his constituency association - the grassroots Tories who selected him and campaigned for him - wanted to support the prime minister - and, more widely, there is polling which suggests he has retained more support amongst activists than voters. However, there is significant pressure from Conservative voters. At least one constituency association has been checking negative letters and emails against the list of supporters that they would canvass at election time, and that has made grim reading. Many MPs say the incoming criticism goes beyond ""the usual suspects"". And this in turn could yet tip the balance against the prime minister. So far cabinet ministers are staying solid. But the thin blue line of junior ministers is under strain. Maria Caulfield is one minister who has been critical of her boss the prime minister Junior minister Maria Caulfield posted on Facebook that she ""fully appreciates the depth of anger on this issue"" amongst her constituents and that ""it is clear the spirit of the rules"" was broken. Science minister George Freeman made clear that he was angry about staff in No 10 holding parties - though he would not pass judgment at this stage on the prime minister. And privately another junior minister has said that her postbag isn't just critical of the prime minister but increasingly hostile to her. She is not - even off the record - calling for the prime minister to go yet - but the prospect of ""party-gate"" sullying the reputations of those who had nothing to do with the gatherings has touched a raw nerve. If the prime minister's future is in the balance, this may in due course put more weight on the ""go"" rather than ""stay"" scale. It's been suggested that some sceptical MPs will rally round because they do not want to indulge a ""Dominic Cummings coup"" against an elected leader. And that this could perhaps move the balance back in the PM's favour. But that he is the source of some - and by no means all - of the allegations against the PM isn't weighing heavily on the minds of some of the considerers. One of the 2019 intake was under no illusions about Mr Cummings' role, but nonetheless felt that his attacks would have misfired if the prime minister himself had not given him the ammunition. A former minister told me: ""Just because he is the source of a story is not a reason to ignore the story."" And there are concerns that Mr Cummings will come forward with more claims even after Sue Gray reports, and this will be corrosive if the prime minister stays in No 10. So far it's been fellow Brexiteers - such as Andrew Bridgen and Tim Loughton - who have publicly urged the prime minister to go. Worryingly for him, these also tend to be people sceptical of lockdown measures. So one aspect of his fightback - the lifting of restrictions in England later this month - won't suddenly get them to reverse their view. But what of those who were perhaps more sceptical of Boris Johnson all along? TheOne Nation group,externalof MPs met behind closed doors on Monday night. They had gathered to hear from the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson on Northern Ireland - a party which has had its own leadership problems - and the question of Conservative leadership came up in the second half of the meeting. MPs shared tales of dismal postbags and I'm told there was an ""intense"" discussion on what to do. While broadly there was a feeling of ""inevitability"", there were different views on timing. One MP told me he was against triggering a confidence vote now, because he feared ""Boris Johnson could win"" and ""we would be stuck with him for the next two years"". But one of his colleagues favoured a swifter move because he felt that unless Mr Johnson won a confidence vote convincingly ""he will be handed the pearl-handled revolver"". ANALYSIS:What was really going on in No 10 during lockdown? LAURA KUENSSBERG:Is 'pork pie plot' a serious threat to the PM? REALITY CHECK:The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held PROFILE:What is Sue Gray investigating? TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings How the timing of a contest would play with the public is weighing on some people's minds - would it look less indulgent to move after potentially poor local elections in May rather than in the midst of a pandemic? And would it be better if Mr Johnson took the hit for national insurance rises and increased energy costs in the spring rather than his successor? ""It's all about the pace at which this occurs"" - and not whether it will occur - according to a former minister. But some MPs are already mulling over what would come next. One MP who has not been publicly critical of the prime minister is simply concerned that any replacement would not be as effective at appealing to first-time Conservative voters. ""Do we really want a dull manager as leader?"" he mused. And those who are likely to seek to replace him do not seem to be in an immediate rush. Letters of no confidence are sent to Sir Graham Brady - the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. He is the very personification of discretion so estimates of how many letters he has received - 54 would lead to a confidence vote, which in turn would trigger a leadership contest if the prime minister loses that vote - are hugely speculative. One former minister believes the sheer volume of public complaint makes it likely that more letters may have been, or will be, quietly submitted by his colleagues without much flourish or co-ordination. And just 24 hours before PMQs a group of around 20 MPs elected at the 2019 election met behind closed doors at Westminster, where the mood was said to be hardening - with the possibility that more no-confidence letters are submitted after PMQs. Will two Tory tribes go to war with the PM? The Northern Research Group of MPs also met privately on Tuesday afternoon. So it may take little more to tip the balance. But, of course, letters can be withdrawn as well as submitted - so the prime minister's performance at PMQs, and then the tone of his response to Sue Gray, may yet tip the balance back in his favour. And while Labour is publicly claiming it is in the ""national interest"" for Mr Johnson to go, privately shadow ministers believe it's in their party interest if he continues in office. So if Sir Keir Starmer succeeds in further wounding the prime minister, it will be his own MPs who will have to decide whether it's better to then move in for the kill.

Johnson to face MPs as leadership threat grows,"This video can not be played Watch how Boris Johnson reacts when asked if apologising to the Queen was a moment of shame Boris Johnson faces more questions about his leadership at Prime Minister's Questions, as the row over lockdown parties at No 10 continues. Growing revolt among Tory MPs, including those elected in the 2019 election, poses a threat to the PM. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg says one MP claims around half of a group of 20 newer MPs submitted no confidence letters on Wednesday morning. If 54 Tory MPs submit letters, it would trigger a leadership contest. Only seven are known to have done so, but one MP told the BBC they thought the threshold could be reached shortly. But only MP Sir Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee - who receives and counts up the no-confidence requests - knows the exact number. Defence Minister James Heappey urged his Tory colleagues to show ""cool heads"", adding now was not the right time for the country to change leader. Many Conservatives have said they want to wait for civil servant Sue Gray to complete her report into gatherings in Downing Street before deciding what to do. ANALYSIS:How Boris Johnson's future hangs in the balance LAURA KUENSSBERG:Is 'pork pie plot' a serious threat to the PM? REALITY CHECK:The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held PROFILE:What is Sue Gray investigating? TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings So far, six Conservative MPs have publicly stated that they have submitted letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson to Sir Graham, while the BBC has been told a seventh - Christian Wakeford, the MP for Bury South - has also sent in a letter. One MP involved in trying to encourage others to send letters told the BBC on Tuesday: ""I think we've done it"", but added ""difficult to tell though"". It comes after a group of around 20 Tory MPs first elected at the 2019 election - and dubbed the 'pork pie plot' in a nod to one MP's constituency - met to discuss their concerns, with one Tory MP saying half of that group had now submitted letters in an attempt to trigger a ballot. The MP said that quotes from ministers that the group of newer MPs were ""idiots"" and ""fools"" had hardened their attitude, and that some of them were threatened with losing their seats under planned boundary changes. Two Tory sources told the BBC that theOwen Paterson lobbying rowover the autumn had dented the ability of the ""old guard"" on the Tory backbenches to calm anger among newer MPs. Bishop Auckland MP Dehenna Davison messaged local campaigners to say that she had been the subject of a ""fabricated"" smear by Downing Street after some newspapers reported that she had been one of this group's organisers. Conservative Chris Loder is among the 2019 intake, and said the group were simply ""sharing views and opinions"". ""I want to make sure that decency, honour and integrity are returned to the heart of government and I think that would be a good shared objective, rather than the distraction of briefing out about rebellion ringleaders."" The meeting was nicknamed by one cabinet minister as the ""pork pie plot"" because one of the attendees was Alicia Kearns, who represents Rutland and Melton (home of Melton Mowbray pies). Colleagues of Ms Kearns say she is not leading a rebellion. The meeting of 2019 MPs dubbed ""the pork pie plot"" by an irritated member of cabinet might sound like something slightly comic, but it is serious. And there is now a wider question - how many other dominoes may then fall? In the last week or so, government ministers and the prime minister have been saying, and pleading with people, to wait for the official verdict from the Sue Gray report. But some of this younger generation - not necessarily in age but in terms of time in Parliament - seem to have just lost patience with that. And it isn't just them. Remember in the darkest days for Theresa May, the Conservatives were broadly split in two - Brexiters and Remainers - with clear ring leaders on each side. But this time it is a really circus of different factions that make the complexity of the picture very hard to read. Let's take a breath though. A big part of the Tory leadership process is shrouded in secrecy, so anyone who purports to tell you with certainty what is going to happen should be treated with very healthy scepticism. It is possible that the number of letters hits the threshold required of 54 in the next couple of days. But it is also possible that the numbers may be miles off. Whatever happens in the next 48 hours, the consensus that is growing in the Conservative Party is that as every day goes by, Boris Johnson is less likely to be leading them into the general election unless he - sometimes a political Houdini - can pull off his biggest ever political comeback. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson insisted he was not warned a drinks party in No 10 on 20 May 2020 could be in breach of Covid rules. Speaking to a reporter, he said he ""humbly"" apologised to people for ""misjudgements that were made"" but added he was ""absolutely categorical"" that ""nobody said to me this is an event that is against the rules"". This contradicts the account of his former adviser Dominic Cummings who says he cautioned the prime minister about the event, billed by an official in an email invitation as ""socially distanced drinks"". He also accused his former boss of lying to Parliament about his knowledge of gatherings in Downing Street. Asked if he would resign if he was found to have misled MPs, Mr Johnson said: ""Let's see what the report says."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Heappey suggested Mr Johnson's staff were to blame for the event going ahead, adding that the PM ""doesn't really own his own diary"" and its was ""up to his team to have his back"". He says the gathering ""reflects rather poorly on those who scheduled it, and put it in the prime minister's diary"". This video can not be played Watch: Chancellor believes PM is telling truth about No 10 parties Lord Marland, a former Conservative party treasurer and Johnson ally, said MPs should ""be careful what they wish for because the alternative is probably not thinkable"". Speaking to Newsnight, he said people should not ""want to pillory a man who has led us through this crisis and create turmoil within the country"". Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns also urged people to get behind Mr Johnson, telling Channel 4: ""Boris won seats for us in that 2019 election I never imagined would fall into the Conservative column.""

Hana Horka, 57, was unvaccinated and had posted on social media that she was recovering after testing positive, but died two days later. Her son, Jan Rek, said she got infected on purpose when he and his father had the virus, so she could get a recovery pass to access certain venues. The Czech Republic reported a record number of cases on Wednesday. Read the full story here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the consequences of seeing so much infection, so much spread of the virus, is that we're seeing a growing number of what are called ""coincidental deaths"". This is where people test have tested positive but they haven't been sick with the virus. Then they have died within 28 days of that positive test but it is nothing to do with the positive test and we're beginning to see more of this. I think the Office of National Statistics is going to have a look at this so we have a real idea of just how many people are dying due to the virus.

She recommends people continue to wear face coverings, even thought they wonât be mandatory and to ensure they are fully vaccinated.

The health secretary is challenged by Jane Merrick from the i newspaper as to whether Boris Johnson just ""got lucky"" that Plan B worked.

Javid responds by saying Johnson ""has shown leadership throughout"" and that he has had to balance conflicting issues and come to a judgement over restrictions.

Asked if he can rule out the return of Plan B if a new variant of concern emerges, Javid says ""this pandemic is still with us"" and ""this is not the end of the road"". ""There will be future variants,"" he warns. On whether the current daily Covid death toll of 359 is something the country needs to be comfortable with in the future, the health secretary says vaccines have meant the death rate has fallen dramatically. He adds the Omicron variant is milder than previous variants and if you look at the average daily death rate, it is around 200 people. Javid says it is important to point out that around 40% of people with Covid in hospital are there not because they have Covid, but have tested positive after being admitted. Asked whether the UK will be effectively be living with no restrictions by the end of March, Javid points out that a third of all UK cases since the pandemic began are linked to Omicron. He says that there will still be some requirements and restrictions, including lateral flow tests for those arriving in England.

He adds it is important to keep this in place for the moment, but the evidence will be under constant review. It is reasonable that the government will eventually no longer legally require people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate, he says, making the point that people with flu are not asked to do so. Earlier Javid said the UK needed to learn to live with Covid in the long-term, as it does with flu. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks Sajid Javid: ""How can the PM continue to lead the country when one of his most senior MPs in the Commons has called on him to resign?"" Javid says that ""what we've seen in the last few weeks... has caused a lot of pain and anger"". He says that he absolutely understands this and that Johnson has rightly apologised and asked for time and space for an investigation to be completed. The PM will be happy to be scrutinised when the facts have been established, Javid adds.  Michelle from Lincolnshire asks about the reduction of the self-isolation period to 5 days with two negative tests. In response Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says people with two negative tests can be released earlier as it allows people to return to work and school. She explains the change is in response to emerging evidence. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency has been outlining the NHS' successful booster campaign. She says: âWe have now got, compared to comparable countries across Europe and North America, the highest rate of boosters in our population overall.â She adds âthe strongest defence we have against the Omicron wave that weâre now experiencing and any future waves of variantsâ¦ is vaccination.â Christina from Berkshire asks Javid if, given the increasing number of hospitalisation of children with Covid-19, there are plans to vaccinate children under 12. Javid says the focus at the moment is on children over 12, but that she is right to raise younger children. He says that the advice from independent experts is that the under-12s who are at risk should be vaccinated. But the experts are considering whether to widen this advice to all under-12s like in other countries. Javid says the NHS is still facing ""significant pressure"" and says the country must ""proceed with caution"". ""A pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint"", he says. The health secretary reiterates calls for people to continue to get vaccinated and boosted, adding it was ""the jabs that have got us this far and the jabs can keep us here too"". Laying out the plans for removing Plan B restrictions, Javid says the government is also looking at removing mandatory self-isolation for people who contract Covid-19. He adds they intend to set out plans to reduce restrictions on visiting care homes soon. The health secretary adds that removing restrictions is a ""major milestone but not the end of the road"" and the government intends to set out its plan for living with Covid in the coming weeks. ""We shouldnât
see this as the finish line,"" he says. ""We cannot eradicate this virus and its future variants."" Javid says Plan B succeeded giving the government extra time to combat Omicron and the newest data shows Omicron is ""in retreat"". The health secretary adds that hospitalisations have fallen and patients in intensive care are at the same levels as they were in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

Johnson to face MPs as leadership threat growsThe No 10 party row continues amid reports that more MPs have submitted letters of no confidence in the PM.,"This video can not be played Watch how Boris Johnson reacts when asked if apologising to the Queen was a moment of shame Boris Johnson faces more questions about his leadership at Prime Minister's Questions, as the row over lockdown parties at No 10 continues. Growing revolt among Tory MPs, including those elected in the 2019 election, poses a threat to the PM. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg says one MP claims around half of a group of 20 newer MPs submitted no confidence letters on Wednesday morning. If 54 Tory MPs submit letters, it would trigger a leadership contest. Only seven are known to have done so, but one MP told the BBC they thought the threshold could be reached shortly. But only MP Sir Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee - who receives and counts up the no-confidence requests - knows the exact number. Defence Minister James Heappey urged his Tory colleagues to show ""cool heads"", adding now was not the right time for the country to change leader. Many Conservatives have said they want to wait for civil servant Sue Gray to complete her report into gatherings in Downing Street before deciding what to do. ANALYSIS:How Boris Johnson's future hangs in the balance LAURA KUENSSBERG:Is 'pork pie plot' a serious threat to the PM? REALITY CHECK:The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held PROFILE:What is Sue Gray investigating? TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings So far, six Conservative MPs have publicly stated that they have submitted letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson to Sir Graham, while the BBC has been told a seventh - Christian Wakeford, the MP for Bury South - has also sent in a letter. One MP involved in trying to encourage others to send letters told the BBC on Tuesday: ""I think we've done it"", but added ""difficult to tell though"". It comes after a group of around 20 Tory MPs first elected at the 2019 election - and dubbed the 'pork pie plot' in a nod to one MP's constituency - met to discuss their concerns, with one Tory MP saying half of that group had now submitted letters in an attempt to trigger a ballot. The MP said that quotes from ministers that the group of newer MPs were ""idiots"" and ""fools"" had hardened their attitude, and that some of them were threatened with losing their seats under planned boundary changes. Two Tory sources told the BBC that theOwen Paterson lobbying rowover the autumn had dented the ability of the ""old guard"" on the Tory backbenches to calm anger among newer MPs. Bishop Auckland MP Dehenna Davison messaged local campaigners to say that she had been the subject of a ""fabricated"" smear by Downing Street after some newspapers reported that she had been one of this group's organisers. Conservative Chris Loder is among the 2019 intake, and said the group were simply ""sharing views and opinions"". ""I want to make sure that decency, honour and integrity are returned to the heart of government and I think that would be a good shared objective, rather than the distraction of briefing out about rebellion ringleaders."" The meeting was nicknamed by one cabinet minister as the ""pork pie plot"" because one of the attendees was Alicia Kearns, who represents Rutland and Melton (home of Melton Mowbray pies). Colleagues of Ms Kearns say she is not leading a rebellion. The meeting of 2019 MPs dubbed ""the pork pie plot"" by an irritated member of cabinet might sound like something slightly comic, but it is serious. And there is now a wider question - how many other dominoes may then fall? In the last week or so, government ministers and the prime minister have been saying, and pleading with people, to wait for the official verdict from the Sue Gray report. But some of this younger generation - not necessarily in age but in terms of time in Parliament - seem to have just lost patience with that. And it isn't just them. Remember in the darkest days for Theresa May, the Conservatives were broadly split in two - Brexiters and Remainers - with clear ring leaders on each side. But this time it is a really circus of different factions that make the complexity of the picture very hard to read. Let's take a breath though. A big part of the Tory leadership process is shrouded in secrecy, so anyone who purports to tell you with certainty what is going to happen should be treated with very healthy scepticism. It is possible that the number of letters hits the threshold required of 54 in the next couple of days. But it is also possible that the numbers may be miles off. Whatever happens in the next 48 hours, the consensus that is growing in the Conservative Party is that as every day goes by, Boris Johnson is less likely to be leading them into the general election unless he - sometimes a political Houdini - can pull off his biggest ever political comeback. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson insisted he was not warned a drinks party in No 10 on 20 May 2020 could be in breach of Covid rules. Speaking to a reporter, he said he ""humbly"" apologised to people for ""misjudgements that were made"" but added he was ""absolutely categorical"" that ""nobody said to me this is an event that is against the rules"". This contradicts the account of his former adviser Dominic Cummings who says he cautioned the prime minister about the event, billed by an official in an email invitation as ""socially distanced drinks"". He also accused his former boss of lying to Parliament about his knowledge of gatherings in Downing Street. Asked if he would resign if he was found to have misled MPs, Mr Johnson said: ""Let's see what the report says."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Heappey suggested Mr Johnson's staff were to blame for the event going ahead, adding that the PM ""doesn't really own his own diary"" and its was ""up to his team to have his back"". He says the gathering ""reflects rather poorly on those who scheduled it, and put it in the prime minister's diary"". This video can not be played Watch: Chancellor believes PM is telling truth about No 10 parties Lord Marland, a former Conservative party treasurer and Johnson ally, said MPs should ""be careful what they wish for because the alternative is probably not thinkable"". Speaking to Newsnight, he said people should not ""want to pillory a man who has led us through this crisis and create turmoil within the country"". Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns also urged people to get behind Mr Johnson, telling Channel 4: ""Boris won seats for us in that 2019 election I never imagined would fall into the Conservative column."" As well as PMQs on Wednesday, Mr Johnsonis set to update the public on England's Plan B measures.

US envoy in Ukraine as Russian tensions rise,"Belarus's defence ministry released photos showing Russian troops and tanks arriving for drills US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said Russia could attack Ukraine ""on very short notice"" and warned again of tough sanctions if it did. He was speaking on a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv after months of tension over a Russian military build-up near Ukraine's borders. Stressing the US's close ties with Ukraine, Mr Blinken vowed ""relentless"" diplomacy to stop Russian aggression. Moscow has denied any plans to attack or invade. Russia has made a raft of demands to Western governments, including that Ukraine should never join Nato and that the defensive alliance's military activities should be limited in member states including Poland. Talks between the West and Russia last week failed to reach a breakthrough, with some of Moscow's demands rejected as non-starters. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 after the overthrow of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine. It has supported pro-Russian rebels who control parts of eastern Ukraine after they fought a bloody war with government forces. There are fears that the conflict, which cost at least 13,000 lives and caused at least two million people to flee their homes, may reignite, with the Russian military openly intervening. Mr Blinken said Russia had built up troops near Ukraine's borders with ""no provocation, no reason"". ""We know that there are plans in place to increase that force even more on very short notice, and that gives President [Vladimir] Putin the capacity, also on very short notice, to take further aggressive action against Ukraine,"" he said. He accused Russia of trying to weaken Ukraine's diplomatic institutions and divide Ukrainian society ""using everything from election interference to disinformation to cyber attacks"". He pledged ""relentless diplomatic efforts to prevent renewed aggression and to promote dialogue and peace"", and repeated a warning of tough sanctions against Russia in the event of an invasion. Mr Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart in Geneva on Friday, after talks with European allies in Berlin. Antony Blinken met Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv A picture, they say, is worth a thousand words. So on a day when the White House warned that a Russian attack on Ukraine could come ""at any point"", American Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew almost 8,000km to appear in front of cameras with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and reiterate the close ties between the two nations. He cautioned Russian President Vladimir Putin that there would be severe consequences if he opted for military action and promised continued defensive and financial support for the Ukrainian government. Given evidence of a Russian disinformation campaign to convince Ukrainians that the US is abandoning the Eastern European nation - drawing comparisons to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan - such a show of support was particularly welcomed by senior Ukrainian officials. Meanwhile, on the streets of Kyiv, everyday life is continuing as normal. Pedestrians waved and took photographs of Mr Blinken's motorcade as it passed along ice-encrusted streets. There is no sense of panic or undue concern even amid headlines of Russian troops amassing along the nation's borders. Time may tell whether this is mass denial or a sense of steely resolve for the challenges that lie ahead. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led recent negotiations with the US in Geneva, said his country did not ""intend to take any aggressive actions"". ""We will not strike, attack or invade Ukraine,"" he said at a meeting on Moscow. He said the US could not force Moscow to move its troops away from the Ukrainian border. ""They are on our territory and we won't be making any changes to their movement because of external pressure,"" he added. Mr Ryabkov also called on Washington to stop its military support for Ukraine, which he said posed a direct threat to Russian security. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Mr Blinken's visit to Kyiv was described as a bid to ""reinforce the United States' commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"", before talks in Berlin on Thursday with German, French and British counterparts. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who visited Moscow on Tuesday, has warned that any further military escalation ""would carry a high price for the Russian regime - economic, political and strategic"". Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov has urged Western governments to impose immediate sanctions on Moscow. Speaking to the BBC's HardTalk programme, he warned that a Russian invasion of the country could lead to bloodshed and a refugee crisis for Europe. A consignment of light anti-tank missiles arrived in Kyiv from the UK on Tuesday as British ministers urged Moscow to reflect on the brink of a potential conflict in which thousands could die. In an essay published this week,external, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace accused Russia of using Nato as a ""strawman"" to justify an invasion of Ukraine, accusing President Putin of being motivated by ""ethnonationalism"".

Dairylea ad banned for showing upside down eating,"The ad showed two girls talking about where food went when you hang upside down An advert for Dairylea cheese has been banned for encouraging unsafe behaviour, after showing a child eating while hanging upside down. The ad - which was shown on catch-up television last August - featured two girls hanging from a goalpost, with one of them eating a cheese triangle. Fourteen people complained, including one viewer who said a toddler in their family had copied the girls. Dairylea owner Mondelez argued the risk of choking was low when upside down. The company pointed to research that it said suggested someone's ability to swallow was not affected by the position they ate in - and that being in a head-down position was recommended during a choking incident. It added the ad had intended to show parents giving their children more freedom, and there were two parents supervising in the background of the ad. Mondelez also said the advert - which aired on ITV Hub, All 4 and My 5 - had been scheduled alongside programmes not directed at children, so a limited number of children would have seen it. But the Advertising Standards Authority - which regulates adverts in the UK - agreed with the viewers who complained. It said many children would be familiar with a five-a-side football goalpost and it would be easy for them to copy the ad. The ASA said it had sought expert views on child accidents, and was advised that there was a potentially a high risk of choking in that situation. ""We also noted that one complainant had reported that their three-year-old relative, after seeing the ad, ate their food whilst hanging upside down,""it said in its ruling.,external The watchdog added: ""We considered that the ad condoned and encouraged younger children to eat whilst hanging upside down, which was an unsafe practice where there was potentially a high risk of choking."" Love Islanders called out over social media ads Theme park's Halloween advert 'likely to distress' The advert must not appear again. Mondelez said it was no longer running the ad and would remove references to eating upside down if it used the ad in future. A Mondelez spokesman said: ""We recognise and will abide by the ASA's decision but we are disappointed by the ruling. It was aimed at adults (parents) rather than young children and was deliberately scheduled away from programming likely to appeal to children under 16. As such, we believe it was unlikely to encourage 'copycat' behaviour by young children. ""We remain committed to responsible advertising and work with a range of partners to make sure our marketing meets and complies with all relevant UK regulations."" In a separate ruling released on the same day, adverts for Lipton Ice Tea and Aqua Pura water have also been banned for misleadingly claiming that the bottles were made from 100% recycled materials. A poster for Lipton Ice Tea seen on a bus shelter in August read: ""Deliciously refreshing, 100% recycled*."" But the asterisk linked to small text at the bottom of the poster which said it excluded the cap and label which were not recycled. The ASA said it was misleading, but a Pepsi Lipton International spokeswoman said: ""We did not intend to mislead anyone with this ad. For complete transparency, we added a note on the ad itself to clarify that it did not include the label and cap.""

LiveLiveCovid: Ministers expected to sign off on relaxing rules1 minute ago,"Omicron is ""in retreat"", Health Secretary Sajid Javid says, with the UK now marking the start of a new chapter in the fight against Covid-19 This is a ""major milestone"" but not the finish line, he tells a No 10 press conference, adding: ""We must learn to live with Covid"" Earlier Boris Johnson announced an end to Plan B Covid restrictions in England Working from home guidance ends today and from tomorrow, face masks will no longer be required in any classrooms From next Thursday, masks will not be mandated anywhere and Covid passes will no longer be needed at large events People who test positive for Covid will still have to self-isolate but Javid said that could not continue forever The UK has reported 108,069 new daily Covid cases and 359 deaths with Covid on Wednesday Edited by Emma Owen and George Bowden We're ending our live coverage of coronavirus developments today. Thank you for joining us. Your writers were Adam Durbin, Malu Cursino, Chris Giles, Doug Faulkner and George Wright. The page was edited by Emma Owen, George Bowden and Kevin Ponniah. As we draw our live coverage to a close - here's a summary of the key coronavirus developments: Elsewhere, and a folk singer from the Czech Republic has died after deliberately catching Covid, her son has told the BBC. Hana Horka, 57, was unvaccinated and had posted on social media that she was recovering after testing positive, but died two days later. Her son, Jan Rek, said she got infected on purpose when he and his father had the virus, so she could get a recovery pass to access certain venues. The Czech Republic reported a record number of cases on Wednesday. Read the full story here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the consequences of seeing so much infection, so much spread of the virus, is that we're seeing a growing number of what are called ""coincidental deaths"". This is where people test have tested positive but they haven't been sick with the virus. Then they have died within 28 days of that positive test but it is nothing to do with the positive test and we're beginning to see more of this. I think the Office of National Statistics is going to have a look at this so we have a real idea of just how many people are dying due to the virus. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Away from changes to restrictions - an inquiry is being launched into children who are not attending school in the wake of national lockdowns, the children's commissioner for England has said. Dame Rachel de Souza toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programmeabout 95% of children were usually in school at this time of year - but now, this figure was about 87%. Some absences were down to illness and Covid, she said, but other children had simply failed to return following classroom closures during the pandemic. In addition, between 80,000 and 100,000 children were not on any school rolls at all, she said. ""Literally, I am going to go out and find them,"" she added. The Department for Education said its ""top priority"" was supporting children to attend school and college. You canread the full story here. For anyone just catching up with our coverage, you can watch some of the key moments from Health Secretary Sajid Javid speaking at the news conference about the end of Plan B in England. This video can not be played UK Covid: End of Plan B in England 'not the finish', says Sajid Javid Sajid Javid has just hosted a news conference at Downing Street. Here are the key points: Meanwhile, the UK has reported 108,069 new daily Covid cases and 359 deaths with Covid on Wednesday.  The Financial Times asks about the ""ongoing anger"" in the UK over Downing Street parties, and Javid says he has also been angered and pained by the revelations. He adds Boris Johnson has rightly apologised and reiterates calls for people to wait for the outcome of an investigation into the lockdown gatherings in No 10 and other government departments. In response to a follow up question about evidence for decision making, the health secretary says the government has been transparent throughout the pandemic and would will continue to be so. Javid adds the government is looking at expanding the definition of fully vaccinated to three doses of a vaccine, rather than the current two jabs. The news conference ends. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says Covid case numbers have declined and adds âitâs peopleâs behaviour that is going to make the difference over the next four weeksâ. She says people need to be careful when returning to the office and also take care using public transport, indoor spaces and in crowded places. She recommends people continue to wear face coverings, even thought they wonât be mandatory and to ensure they are fully vaccinated. She says the more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we will see mass Covid transmission. The health secretary is challenged by Jane Merrick from the i newspaper as to whether Boris Johnson just ""got lucky"" that Plan B worked. The journalist says the PM wanted stronger restrictions but was blocked by members of his cabinet and Tory MPs. Javid responds by saying Johnson ""has shown leadership throughout"" and that he has had to balance conflicting issues and come to a judgement over restrictions. ""The decision that he made to absolutely focus on boosters has been vindicated,"" he says. Asked if he can rule out the return of Plan B if a new variant of concern emerges, Javid says ""this pandemic is still with us"" and ""this is not the end of the road"". ""There will be future variants,"" he warns. On whether the current daily Covid death toll of 359 is something the country needs to be comfortable with in the future, the health secretary says vaccines have meant the death rate has fallen dramatically. He adds the Omicron variant is milder than previous variants and if you look at the average daily death rate, it is around 200 people. Javid says it is important to point out that around 40% of people with Covid in hospital are there not because they have Covid, but have tested positive after being admitted. Asked whether the UK will be effectively be living with no restrictions by the end of March, Javid points out that a third of all UK cases since the pandemic began are linked to Omicron. He says that there will still be some requirements and restrictions, including lateral flow tests for those arriving in England. ""But we are going to have to find a way to remove almost all of these restrictions and get life back to normal with one or two things there for a while,"" Javid adds, citing annual vaccinations for some of those most at risk, as well as testing and anti-virals. Asked by Sky News about plans to end self-isolation rules entirely, Sajid Javid says no decision has yet been taken. He adds it is important to keep this in place for the moment, but the evidence will be under constant review. It is reasonable that the government will eventually no longer legally require people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate, he says, making the point that people with flu are not asked to do so. Earlier Javid said the UK needed to learn to live with Covid in the long-term, as it does with flu. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks Sajid Javid: ""How can the PM continue to lead the country when one of his most senior MPs in the Commons has called on him to resign?"" Javid says that ""what we've seen in the last few weeks... has caused a lot of pain and anger"". He says that he absolutely understands this and that Johnson has rightly apologised and asked for time and space for an investigation to be completed. The PM will be happy to be scrutinised when the facts have been established, Javid adds.  Michelle from Lincolnshire asks about the reduction of the self-isolation period to 5 days with two negative tests. In response Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says people with two negative tests can be released earlier as it allows people to return to work and school. She explains the change is in response to emerging evidence. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency has been outlining the NHS' successful booster campaign. She says: âWe have now got, compared to comparable countries across Europe and North America, the highest rate of boosters in our population overall.â She adds âthe strongest defence we have against the Omicron wave that weâre now experiencing and any future waves of variantsâ¦ is vaccination.â Christina from Berkshire asks Javid if, given the increasing number of hospitalisation of children with Covid-19, there are plans to vaccinate children under 12. Javid says the focus at the moment is on children over 12, but that she is right to raise younger children. He says that the advice from independent experts is that the under-12s who are at risk should be vaccinated. But the experts are considering whether to widen this advice to all under-12s like in other countries. Javid says the NHS is still facing ""significant pressure"" and says the country must ""proceed with caution"". ""A pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint"", he says. The health secretary reiterates calls for people to continue to get vaccinated and boosted, adding it was ""the jabs that have got us this far and the jabs can keep us here too"".

What's the mood among Tory MPs?,"The prime minister will face Sir Keir Starmer again in the Commons at lunchtime. Boris Johnson will know, though, that some of his fiercest critics will be sitting behind, and not in front of, him. Half a dozen of his own MPs have publicly called for him to go, and some others are privately of the same view. He will, of course, expect to hear cheers from supporters and from some other colleagues who want to rally round in the face of Labour attacks. Perhaps more crucially, though, are a disparate group of MPs that you might call ""considerers"". They are weighing up whether to submit letters of no confidence, which would trigger a leadership contest. They will be listening closely to his answers. So what - for now - is holding them back? Most Conservative MPs will say they will await the conclusion of the investigation into the gatherings in Downing Street by the senior civil servant Sue Gray before deciding how to proceed. One of those who has already called for Mr Johnson's departure has urged his colleagues ""to grow some"". He said he had 1,500 hostile letters from constituents and ""this can't go on"". But in truth some of those colleagues tell me they are merely awaiting the completion of ""due process"". Virtually irrespective of what Sue Gray says, they will join the cacophonous chorus calling for him to go in due course. One of them said he was simply waiting for other colleagues to ""catch up"" with the conclusion he had reached. For others, though, it matters hugely what Ms Gray says. Although she won't sit in judgement of the prime minister, and will simply set out the facts, it will be important to some leadership-sceptics which facts she sets out. One of them told me that if she can substantiate Dominic Cummings's claim that the prime minister was told about the nature of the event on 20 May 2020 - that was a social not a work gathering - then more letters of no confidence were likely to go in as MPs would feel they had been misled by the prime minister. Sue Gray's report could come out soon This, of course, may not materialise - the prime ministerhimself denied again on Tuesdaythat he was warned the event could be against the rules. Dominic Cummings has allegedin his blog,externalthat the prime minister had been told. This, too, puts pressure on Sue Gray to investigate the claims, and avoid any impression of a whitewash. That said, if Sue Gray merely uncovers evidence that the civil servant Martin Reynolds was warned about proceeding with the event, some MPs will be content to see a clear-out of No 10 officials, and their potential rebellion could fade. One well-placed MP declared ""she is not going to throw the prime minster under a bus"" - and that a plan was in place for staffing changes at No 10. And a former cabinet minister told me he expected ""deputy heads to roll"" in order to save the prime minister. He did not believe Mr Johnson could remain in No 10 until the next election, but that he could stave off an immediate threat. For some Conservative MPs there are other considerations. One MP told me he was on the verge of sending a no-confidence email, but key figures in his constituency association - the grassroots Tories who selected him and campaigned for him - wanted to support the prime minister - and, more widely, there is polling which suggests he has retained more support amongst activists than voters. However, there is significant pressure from Conservative voters. At least one constituency association has been checking negative letters and emails against the list of supporters that they would canvass at election time, and that has made grim reading. Many MPs say the incoming criticism goes beyond ""the usual suspects"". And this in turn could yet tip the balance against the prime minister. So far cabinet ministers are staying solid. But the thin blue line of junior ministers is under strain. Maria Caulfield is one minister who has been critical of her boss the prime minister Junior minister Maria Caulfield posted on Facebook that she ""fully appreciates the depth of anger on this issue"" amongst her constituents and that ""it is clear the spirit of the rules"" was broken. Science minister George Freeman made clear that he was angry about staff in No 10 holding parties - though he would not pass judgment at this stage on the prime minister. And privately another junior minister has said that her postbag isn't just critical of the prime minister but increasingly hostile to her. She is not - even off the record - calling for the prime minister to go yet - but the prospect of ""party-gate"" sullying the reputations of those who had nothing to do with the gatherings has touched a raw nerve. If the prime minister's future is in the balance, this may in due course put more weight on the ""go"" rather than ""stay"" scale. It's been suggested that some sceptical MPs will rally round because they do not want to indulge a ""Dominic Cummings coup"" against an elected leader. And that this could perhaps move the balance back in the PM's favour. But that he is the source of some - and by no means all - of the allegations against the PM isn't weighing heavily on the minds of some of the considerers. One of the 2019 intake was under no illusions about Mr Cummings' role, but nonetheless felt that his attacks would have misfired if the prime minister himself had not given him the ammunition. A former minister told me: ""Just because he is the source of a story is not a reason to ignore the story."" And there are concerns that Mr Cummings will come forward with more claims even after Sue Gray reports, and this will be corrosive if the prime minister stays in No 10. So far it's been fellow Brexiteers - such as Andrew Bridgen and Tim Loughton - who have publicly urged the prime minister to go. Worryingly for him, these also tend to be people sceptical of lockdown measures. So one aspect of his fightback - the lifting of restrictions in England later this month - won't suddenly get them to reverse their view. But what of those who were perhaps more sceptical of Boris Johnson all along? TheOne Nation group,externalof MPs met behind closed doors on Monday night. They had gathered to hear from the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson on Northern Ireland - a party which has had its own leadership problems - and the question of Conservative leadership came up in the second half of the meeting. MPs shared tales of dismal postbags and I'm told there was an ""intense"" discussion on what to do. While broadly there was a feeling of ""inevitability"", there were different views on timing. One MP told me he was against triggering a confidence vote now, because he feared ""Boris Johnson could win"" and ""we would be stuck with him for the next two years"". But one of his colleagues favoured a swifter move because he felt that unless Mr Johnson won a confidence vote convincingly ""he will be handed the pearl-handled revolver"". ANALYSIS:What was really going on in No 10 during lockdown? LAURA KUENSSBERG:Is 'pork pie plot' a serious threat to the PM? REALITY CHECK:The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held PROFILE:What is Sue Gray investigating? TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings How the timing of a contest would play with the public is weighing on some people's minds - would it look less indulgent to move after potentially poor local elections in May rather than in the midst of a pandemic? And would it be better if Mr Johnson took the hit for national insurance rises and increased energy costs in the spring rather than his successor? ""It's all about the pace at which this occurs"" - and not whether it will occur - according to a former minister. But some MPs are already mulling over what would come next. One MP who has not been publicly critical of the prime minister is simply concerned that any replacement would not be as effective at appealing to first-time Conservative voters. ""Do we really want a dull manager as leader?"" he mused. And those who are likely to seek to replace him do not seem to be in an immediate rush. Letters of no confidence are sent to Sir Graham Brady - the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. He is the very personification of discretion so estimates of how many letters he has received - 54 would lead to a confidence vote, which in turn would trigger a leadership contest if the prime minister loses that vote - are hugely speculative. One former minister believes the sheer volume of public complaint makes it likely that more letters may have been, or will be, quietly submitted by his colleagues without much flourish or co-ordination. And just 24 hours before PMQs a group of around 20 MPs elected at the 2019 election met behind closed doors at Westminster, where the mood was said to be hardening - with the possibility that more no-confidence letters are submitted after PMQs. Will two Tory tribes go to war with the PM? The Northern Research Group of MPs also met privately on Tuesday afternoon. So it may take little more to tip the balance. But, of course, letters can be withdrawn as well as submitted - so the prime minister's performance at PMQs, and then the tone of his response to Sue Gray, may yet tip the balance back in his favour. And while Labour is publicly claiming it is in the ""national interest"" for Mr Johnson to go, privately shadow ministers believe it's in their party interest if he continues in office. So if Sir Keir Starmer succeeds in further wounding the prime minister, it will be his own MPs who will have to decide whether it's better to then move in for the kill.

LiveLivePM to give curbs update as WHO says crisis not over4 minutes ago,"Omicron is ""in retreat"", Health Secretary Sajid Javid says, with the UK now marking the start of a new chapter in the fight against Covid-19 This is a ""major milestone"" but not the finish line, he tells a No 10 press conference, adding: ""We must learn to live with Covid"" Earlier Boris Johnson announced an end to Plan B Covid restrictions in England Working from home guidance ends today and from tomorrow, face masks will no longer be required in any classrooms From next Thursday, masks will not be mandated anywhere and Covid passes will no longer be needed at large events People who test positive for Covid will still have to self-isolate but Javid said that could not continue forever The UK has reported 108,069 new daily Covid cases and 359 deaths with Covid on Wednesday Edited by Emma Owen and George Bowden We're ending our live coverage of coronavirus developments today. Thank you for joining us. Your writers were Adam Durbin, Malu Cursino, Chris Giles, Doug Faulkner and George Wright. The page was edited by Emma Owen, George Bowden and Kevin Ponniah. As we draw our live coverage to a close - here's a summary of the key coronavirus developments: Elsewhere, and a folk singer from the Czech Republic has died after deliberately catching Covid, her son has told the BBC. Hana Horka, 57, was unvaccinated and had posted on social media that she was recovering after testing positive, but died two days later. Her son, Jan Rek, said she got infected on purpose when he and his father had the virus, so she could get a recovery pass to access certain venues. The Czech Republic reported a record number of cases on Wednesday. Read the full story here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the consequences of seeing so much infection, so much spread of the virus, is that we're seeing a growing number of what are called ""coincidental deaths"". This is where people test have tested positive but they haven't been sick with the virus. Then they have died within 28 days of that positive test but it is nothing to do with the positive test and we're beginning to see more of this. I think the Office of National Statistics is going to have a look at this so we have a real idea of just how many people are dying due to the virus. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Away from changes to restrictions - an inquiry is being launched into children who are not attending school in the wake of national lockdowns, the children's commissioner for England has said. Dame Rachel de Souza toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programmeabout 95% of children were usually in school at this time of year - but now, this figure was about 87%. Some absences were down to illness and Covid, she said, but other children had simply failed to return following classroom closures during the pandemic. In addition, between 80,000 and 100,000 children were not on any school rolls at all, she said. ""Literally, I am going to go out and find them,"" she added. The Department for Education said its ""top priority"" was supporting children to attend school and college. You canread the full story here. For anyone just catching up with our coverage, you can watch some of the key moments from Health Secretary Sajid Javid speaking at the news conference about the end of Plan B in England. This video can not be played UK Covid: End of Plan B in England 'not the finish', says Sajid Javid Sajid Javid has just hosted a news conference at Downing Street. Here are the key points: Meanwhile, the UK has reported 108,069 new daily Covid cases and 359 deaths with Covid on Wednesday.  The Financial Times asks about the ""ongoing anger"" in the UK over Downing Street parties, and Javid says he has also been angered and pained by the revelations. He adds Boris Johnson has rightly apologised and reiterates calls for people to wait for the outcome of an investigation into the lockdown gatherings in No 10 and other government departments. In response to a follow up question about evidence for decision making, the health secretary says the government has been transparent throughout the pandemic and would will continue to be so. Javid adds the government is looking at expanding the definition of fully vaccinated to three doses of a vaccine, rather than the current two jabs. The news conference ends. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says Covid case numbers have declined and adds âitâs peopleâs behaviour that is going to make the difference over the next four weeksâ. She says people need to be careful when returning to the office and also take care using public transport, indoor spaces and in crowded places. She recommends people continue to wear face coverings, even thought they wonât be mandatory and to ensure they are fully vaccinated. She says the more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we will see mass Covid transmission. The health secretary is challenged by Jane Merrick from the i newspaper as to whether Boris Johnson just ""got lucky"" that Plan B worked. The journalist says the PM wanted stronger restrictions but was blocked by members of his cabinet and Tory MPs. Javid responds by saying Johnson ""has shown leadership throughout"" and that he has had to balance conflicting issues and come to a judgement over restrictions. ""The decision that he made to absolutely focus on boosters has been vindicated,"" he says. Asked if he can rule out the return of Plan B if a new variant of concern emerges, Javid says ""this pandemic is still with us"" and ""this is not the end of the road"". ""There will be future variants,"" he warns. On whether the current daily Covid death toll of 359 is something the country needs to be comfortable with in the future, the health secretary says vaccines have meant the death rate has fallen dramatically. He adds the Omicron variant is milder than previous variants and if you look at the average daily death rate, it is around 200 people. Javid says it is important to point out that around 40% of people with Covid in hospital are there not because they have Covid, but have tested positive after being admitted. Asked whether the UK will be effectively be living with no restrictions by the end of March, Javid points out that a third of all UK cases since the pandemic began are linked to Omicron. He says that there will still be some requirements and restrictions, including lateral flow tests for those arriving in England. ""But we are going to have to find a way to remove almost all of these restrictions and get life back to normal with one or two things there for a while,"" Javid adds, citing annual vaccinations for some of those most at risk, as well as testing and anti-virals. Asked by Sky News about plans to end self-isolation rules entirely, Sajid Javid says no decision has yet been taken. He adds it is important to keep this in place for the moment, but the evidence will be under constant review. It is reasonable that the government will eventually no longer legally require people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate, he says, making the point that people with flu are not asked to do so. Earlier Javid said the UK needed to learn to live with Covid in the long-term, as it does with flu. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks Sajid Javid: ""How can the PM continue to lead the country when one of his most senior MPs in the Commons has called on him to resign?"" Javid says that ""what we've seen in the last few weeks... has caused a lot of pain and anger"". He says that he absolutely understands this and that Johnson has rightly apologised and asked for time and space for an investigation to be completed. The PM will be happy to be scrutinised when the facts have been established, Javid adds.  Michelle from Lincolnshire asks about the reduction of the self-isolation period to 5 days with two negative tests. In response Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency says people with two negative tests can be released earlier as it allows people to return to work and school. She explains the change is in response to emerging evidence. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UK Health Security Agency has been outlining the NHS' successful booster campaign. She says: âWe have now got, compared to comparable countries across Europe and North America, the highest rate of boosters in our population overall.â She adds âthe strongest defence we have against the Omicron wave that weâre now experiencing and any future waves of variantsâ¦ is vaccination.â Christina from Berkshire asks Javid if, given the increasing number of hospitalisation of children with Covid-19, there are plans to vaccinate children under 12. Javid says the focus at the moment is on children over 12, but that she is right to raise younger children. He says that the advice from independent experts is that the under-12s who are at risk should be vaccinated. But the experts are considering whether to widen this advice to all under-12s like in other countries. Javid says the NHS is still facing ""significant pressure"" and says the country must ""proceed with caution"". ""A pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint"", he says. The health secretary reiterates calls for people to continue to get vaccinated and boosted, adding it was ""the jabs that have got us this far and the jabs can keep us here too"". Laying out the plans for removing Plan B restrictions, Javid says the government is also looking at removing mandatory self-isolation for people who contract Covid-19. He adds they intend to set out plans to reduce restrictions on visiting care homes soon. The health secretary adds that removing restrictions is a ""major milestone but not the end of the road"" and the government intends to set out its plan for living with Covid in the coming weeks. ""We shouldnât
see this as the finish line,"" he says. ""We cannot eradicate this virus and its future variants."" Javid says Plan B succeeded giving the government extra time to combat Omicron and the newest data shows Omicron is ""in retreat"". The health secretary adds that hospitalisations have fallen and patients in intensive care are at the same levels as they were in July. Â© 2025 BBC.

LGBT staff to share impact of UK military banCampaigners hope the outcome of review into the pre-2000 ban will entitle them to compensation.,"David Bonney was jailed after it was found out he was gay while serving in the RAF LGBT veterans have cautiously welcomed a review into the impact of a ban on them serving in the military, launched more than 20 years after the law was changed. Until 2000 it was illegal to be gay in the British military - a rule that is thought to have affected about 5,000 people in the armed forces. Campaigners are seeking compensation for lost livelihoods and suffering. Veterans minister Leo Docherty accepted that many had lost out financially. The veterans also hope to be offered mental health support, financial compensation, and the restoration of pensions that were taken away for those who underwent dishonourable discharge. When pressed on the issue of compensation, Mr Docherty told the BBC: ""I don't want to pre-empt the findings of the review, but I totally accept the financial impact a lot of these people suffered unjustly. So I totally accept that this is the cause of live debate."" He said he expected the reviewer to have some ""honest and frank discussions"" with veterans affected, and to bring back some recommendations that the Ministry of Defence could consider ""with humility, compassion and urgency"". 'I was marched off RAF site for being gay' LGBT in the forces: 'It was a very scary time' People with HIV to be allowed to join armed forces US Marines discharged for refusing Covid jab The law was changed in 2000 after four servicemen and women, who were sacked for being gay, won a case in the European Court of Human Rights. Before then gay, transgender and bisexual people in the military were sent to prison if their sexuality or gender identity was discovered by their bosses. The change in the military's handling of homosexuality came 33 years after homosexual acts were decriminalised between two consenting adults over the age of 21 in most cases. David Bonney served four months in a military prison in Colchester in 1995 after being convicted of ""homosexual conduct"" while working for the RAF as a medic. Although he was later freed on appeal, the conviction is still on his criminal record. He says it's had a long-lasting impact on his life. ""From the moment I admitted to [being gay], I was held in a cell separate to everyone,"" he tells BBC News. ""Handcuffs, going into a cell, treated as if I'd murdered or mugged someone."" David's conviction is still on his criminal record despite the law change in 2000 Caroline Paige, co-director of military charity Fighting With Pride, was the first openly transgender servicewoman to serve in the military. Since her retirement, she has campaigned for more to be done to lessen the impact of the pre-2000 ban. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: ""It's shameful that nothing has been done to help support them since the ban was lifted. ""It was 22 years ago but you have to bear in mind that for some of these veterans the journey has been even longer than that because they were dismissed in the 60s, 70s or 80s and have been living their lives without any kind of support. ""The review is just the start of what needs to be done."" Other gay people who managed to keep their sexuality secret felt forced to resign. Patrick Lyster-Todd was in the navy, and after his partner Dennis contracted Aids, Patrick eventually quit his job to look after him - instead of asking work for help. ""I couldn't tell them why I wanted to leave because I would have to admit I was gay,"" he says. It's unclear what support people like Patrick might receive - if any - as a result of the review. Patrick Lyster-Todd (left) and his late partner Dennis (right) took women as dates to social events in the navy to avoid suspicion The full scope of the review, which launched on Wednesday, is yet to be announced. But it's set to look at three main areas: The potential impact the ban may have had on LGBT+ veterans, including the consequences for their future lives The accessibility of veterans' services for LGBT+ people How to ensure that LGBT+ veterans are recognised and fully accepted as members of the armed forces The government says it will set out how people affected by the ban will be able to share their experiences for the review once an independent chair has been announced. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said more details will be set out in ""due course"". Once it is finished, the chair will make recommendations to the government. Armed forces minister James Heappey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The review needs to understand what the consequences were of that extraordinarily wrong-headed policy."" He added: ""We are so sorry for the fact that that was ever the case, that people who had the courage to serve in our nation's armed forces were then thrown out because they loved someone of their own sex."" He would not be drawn on whether compensation would be offered, but said ""it may be that compensation matters more"" than apologies.

US envoy flies to Europe as Ukraine tensions rise,"Belarus's defence ministry released photos showing Russian troops and tanks arriving for drills US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said Russia could attack Ukraine ""on very short notice"" and warned again of tough sanctions if it did. He was speaking on a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv after months of tension over a Russian military build-up near Ukraine's borders. Stressing the US's close ties with Ukraine, Mr Blinken vowed ""relentless"" diplomacy to stop Russian aggression. Moscow has denied any plans to attack or invade. Russia has made a raft of demands to Western governments, including that Ukraine should never join Nato and that the defensive alliance's military activities should be limited in member states including Poland. Talks between the West and Russia last week failed to reach a breakthrough, with some of Moscow's demands rejected as non-starters. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 after the overthrow of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine. It has supported pro-Russian rebels who control parts of eastern Ukraine after they fought a bloody war with government forces. There are fears that the conflict, which cost at least 13,000 lives and caused at least two million people to flee their homes, may reignite, with the Russian military openly intervening. Mr Blinken said Russia had built up troops near Ukraine's borders with ""no provocation, no reason"". ""We know that there are plans in place to increase that force even more on very short notice, and that gives President [Vladimir] Putin the capacity, also on very short notice, to take further aggressive action against Ukraine,"" he said. He accused Russia of trying to weaken Ukraine's diplomatic institutions and divide Ukrainian society ""using everything from election interference to disinformation to cyber attacks"". He pledged ""relentless diplomatic efforts to prevent renewed aggression and to promote dialogue and peace"", and repeated a warning of tough sanctions against Russia in the event of an invasion. Mr Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart in Geneva on Friday, after talks with European allies in Berlin. Antony Blinken met Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv A picture, they say, is worth a thousand words. So on a day when the White House warned that a Russian attack on Ukraine could come ""at any point"", American Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew almost 8,000km to appear in front of cameras with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and reiterate the close ties between the two nations. He cautioned Russian President Vladimir Putin that there would be severe consequences if he opted for military action and promised continued defensive and financial support for the Ukrainian government. Given evidence of a Russian disinformation campaign to convince Ukrainians that the US is abandoning the Eastern European nation - drawing comparisons to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan - such a show of support was particularly welcomed by senior Ukrainian officials. Meanwhile, on the streets of Kyiv, everyday life is continuing as normal. Pedestrians waved and took photographs of Mr Blinken's motorcade as it passed along ice-encrusted streets. There is no sense of panic or undue concern even amid headlines of Russian troops amassing along the nation's borders. Time may tell whether this is mass denial or a sense of steely resolve for the challenges that lie ahead. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led recent negotiations with the US in Geneva, said his country did not ""intend to take any aggressive actions"". ""We will not strike, attack or invade Ukraine,"" he said at a meeting on Moscow. He said the US could not force Moscow to move its troops away from the Ukrainian border. ""They are on our territory and we won't be making any changes to their movement because of external pressure,"" he added. Mr Ryabkov also called on Washington to stop its military support for Ukraine, which he said posed a direct threat to Russian security. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Mr Blinken's visit to Kyiv was described as a bid to ""reinforce the United States' commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"", before talks in Berlin on Thursday with German, French and British counterparts. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who visited Moscow on Tuesday, has warned that any further military escalation ""would carry a high price for the Russian regime - economic, political and strategic"". Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov has urged Western governments to impose immediate sanctions on Moscow. Speaking to the BBC's HardTalk programme, he warned that a Russian invasion of the country could lead to bloodshed and a refugee crisis for Europe. A consignment of light anti-tank missiles arrived in Kyiv from the UK on Tuesday as British ministers urged Moscow to reflect on the brink of a potential conflict in which thousands could die. In an essay published this week,external, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace accused Russia of using Nato as a ""strawman"" to justify an invasion of Ukraine, accusing President Putin of being motivated by ""ethnonationalism"".

What is the mood among Tory MPs?,"The prime minister will face Sir Keir Starmer again in the Commons at lunchtime. Boris Johnson will know, though, that some of his fiercest critics will be sitting behind, and not in front of, him. Half a dozen of his own MPs have publicly called for him to go, and some others are privately of the same view. He will, of course, expect to hear cheers from supporters and from some other colleagues who want to rally round in the face of Labour attacks. Perhaps more crucially, though, are a disparate group of MPs that you might call ""considerers"". They are weighing up whether to submit letters of no confidence, which would trigger a leadership contest. They will be listening closely to his answers. So what - for now - is holding them back? Most Conservative MPs will say they will await the conclusion of the investigation into the gatherings in Downing Street by the senior civil servant Sue Gray before deciding how to proceed. One of those who has already called for Mr Johnson's departure has urged his colleagues ""to grow some"". He said he had 1,500 hostile letters from constituents and ""this can't go on"". But in truth some of those colleagues tell me they are merely awaiting the completion of ""due process"". Virtually irrespective of what Sue Gray says, they will join the cacophonous chorus calling for him to go in due course. One of them said he was simply waiting for other colleagues to ""catch up"" with the conclusion he had reached. For others, though, it matters hugely what Ms Gray says. Although she won't sit in judgement of the prime minister, and will simply set out the facts, it will be important to some leadership-sceptics which facts she sets out. One of them told me that if she can substantiate Dominic Cummings's claim that the prime minister was told about the nature of the event on 20 May 2020 - that was a social not a work gathering - then more letters of no confidence were likely to go in as MPs would feel they had been misled by the prime minister. Sue Gray's report could come out soon This, of course, may not materialise - the prime ministerhimself denied again on Tuesdaythat he was warned the event could be against the rules. Dominic Cummings has allegedin his blog,externalthat the prime minister had been told. This, too, puts pressure on Sue Gray to investigate the claims, and avoid any impression of a whitewash. That said, if Sue Gray merely uncovers evidence that the civil servant Martin Reynolds was warned about proceeding with the event, some MPs will be content to see a clear-out of No 10 officials, and their potential rebellion could fade. One well-placed MP declared ""she is not going to throw the prime minster under a bus"" - and that a plan was in place for staffing changes at No 10. And a former cabinet minister told me he expected ""deputy heads to roll"" in order to save the prime minister. He did not believe Mr Johnson could remain in No 10 until the next election, but that he could stave off an immediate threat. For some Conservative MPs there are other considerations. One MP told me he was on the verge of sending a no-confidence email, but key figures in his constituency association - the grassroots Tories who selected him and campaigned for him - wanted to support the prime minister - and, more widely, there is polling which suggests he has retained more support amongst activists than voters. However, there is significant pressure from Conservative voters. At least one constituency association has been checking negative letters and emails against the list of supporters that they would canvass at election time, and that has made grim reading. Many MPs say the incoming criticism goes beyond ""the usual suspects"". And this in turn could yet tip the balance against the prime minister. So far cabinet ministers are staying solid. But the thin blue line of junior ministers is under strain. Maria Caulfield is one minister who has been critical of her boss the prime minister Junior minister Maria Caulfield posted on Facebook that she ""fully appreciates the depth of anger on this issue"" amongst her constituents and that ""it is clear the spirit of the rules"" was broken. Science minister George Freeman made clear that he was angry about staff in No 10 holding parties - though he would not pass judgment at this stage on the prime minister. And privately another junior minister has said that her postbag isn't just critical of the prime minister but increasingly hostile to her. She is not - even off the record - calling for the prime minister to go yet - but the prospect of ""party-gate"" sullying the reputations of those who had nothing to do with the gatherings has touched a raw nerve. If the prime minister's future is in the balance, this may in due course put more weight on the ""go"" rather than ""stay"" scale. It's been suggested that some sceptical MPs will rally round because they do not want to indulge a ""Dominic Cummings coup"" against an elected leader. And that this could perhaps move the balance back in the PM's favour. But that he is the source of some - and by no means all - of the allegations against the PM isn't weighing heavily on the minds of some of the considerers. One of the 2019 intake was under no illusions about Mr Cummings' role, but nonetheless felt that his attacks would have misfired if the prime minister himself had not given him the ammunition. A former minister told me: ""Just because he is the source of a story is not a reason to ignore the story."" And there are concerns that Mr Cummings will come forward with more claims even after Sue Gray reports, and this will be corrosive if the prime minister stays in No 10. So far it's been fellow Brexiteers - such as Andrew Bridgen and Tim Loughton - who have publicly urged the prime minister to go. Worryingly for him, these also tend to be people sceptical of lockdown measures. So one aspect of his fightback - the lifting of restrictions in England later this month - won't suddenly get them to reverse their view. But what of those who were perhaps more sceptical of Boris Johnson all along? TheOne Nation group,externalof MPs met behind closed doors on Monday night. They had gathered to hear from the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson on Northern Ireland - a party which has had its own leadership problems - and the question of Conservative leadership came up in the second half of the meeting. MPs shared tales of dismal postbags and I'm told there was an ""intense"" discussion on what to do. While broadly there was a feeling of ""inevitability"", there were different views on timing. One MP told me he was against triggering a confidence vote now, because he feared ""Boris Johnson could win"" and ""we would be stuck with him for the next two years"". But one of his colleagues favoured a swifter move because he felt that unless Mr Johnson won a confidence vote convincingly ""he will be handed the pearl-handled revolver"".

REALITY CHECK:The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held PROFILE:What is Sue Gray investigating? TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings How the timing of a contest would play with the public is weighing on some people's minds - would it look less indulgent to move after potentially poor local elections in May rather than in the midst of a pandemic? And would it be better if Mr Johnson took the hit for national insurance rises and increased energy costs in the spring rather than his successor? ""It's all about the pace at which this occurs"" - and not whether it will occur - according to a former minister. But some MPs are already mulling over what would come next. One MP who has not been publicly critical of the prime minister is simply concerned that any replacement would not be as effective at appealing to first-time Conservative voters. ""Do we really want a dull manager as leader?"" he mused. And those who are likely to seek to replace him do not seem to be in an immediate rush. Letters of no confidence are sent to Sir Graham Brady - the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. He is the very personification of discretion so estimates of how many letters he has received - 54 would lead to a confidence vote, which in turn would trigger a leadership contest if the prime minister loses that vote - are hugely speculative. One former minister believes the sheer volume of public complaint makes it likely that more letters may have been, or will be, quietly submitted by his colleagues without much flourish or co-ordination. And just 24 hours before PMQs a group of around 20 MPs elected at the 2019 election met behind closed doors at Westminster, where the mood was said to be hardening - with the possibility that more no-confidence letters are submitted after PMQs. Will two Tory tribes go to war with the PM? The Northern Research Group of MPs also met privately on Tuesday afternoon. So it may take little more to tip the balance. But, of course, letters can be withdrawn as well as submitted - so the prime minister's performance at PMQs, and then the tone of his response to Sue Gray, may yet tip the balance back in his favour. And while Labour is publicly claiming it is in the ""national interest"" for Mr Johnson to go, privately shadow ministers believe it's in their party interest if he continues in office. So if Sir Keir Starmer succeeds in further wounding the prime minister, it will be his own MPs who will have to decide whether it's better to then move in for the kill.

PM faces MPs as Tories hold talks on his future,"This video can not be played Watch how Boris Johnson reacts when asked if apologising to the Queen was a moment of shame Boris Johnson faces more questions about his leadership at Prime Minister's Questions, as the row over lockdown parties at No 10 continues. Growing revolt among Tory MPs, including those elected in the 2019 election, poses a threat to the PM. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg says one MP claims around half of a group of 20 newer MPs submitted no confidence letters on Wednesday morning. If 54 Tory MPs submit letters, it would trigger a leadership contest. Only seven are known to have done so, but one MP told the BBC they thought the threshold could be reached shortly. But only MP Sir Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee - who receives and counts up the no-confidence requests - knows the exact number. Defence Minister James Heappey urged his Tory colleagues to show ""cool heads"", adding now was not the right time for the country to change leader. Many Conservatives have said they want to wait for civil servant Sue Gray to complete her report into gatherings in Downing Street before deciding what to do. ANALYSIS:How Boris Johnson's future hangs in the balance LAURA KUENSSBERG:Is 'pork pie plot' a serious threat to the PM? REALITY CHECK:The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held PROFILE:What is Sue Gray investigating? TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings So far, six Conservative MPs have publicly stated that they have submitted letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson to Sir Graham, while the BBC has been told a seventh - Christian Wakeford, the MP for Bury South - has also sent in a letter. One MP involved in trying to encourage others to send letters told the BBC on Tuesday: ""I think we've done it"", but added ""difficult to tell though"". It comes after a group of around 20 Tory MPs first elected at the 2019 election - and dubbed the 'pork pie plot' in a nod to one MP's constituency - met to discuss their concerns, with one Tory MP saying half of that group had now submitted letters in an attempt to trigger a ballot. The MP said that quotes from ministers that the group of newer MPs were ""idiots"" and ""fools"" had hardened their attitude, and that some of them were threatened with losing their seats under planned boundary changes. Two Tory sources told the BBC that theOwen Paterson lobbying rowover the autumn had dented the ability of the ""old guard"" on the Tory backbenches to calm anger among newer MPs. Bishop Auckland MP Dehenna Davison messaged local campaigners to say that she had been the subject of a ""fabricated"" smear by Downing Street after some newspapers reported that she had been one of this group's organisers. Conservative Chris Loder is among the 2019 intake, and said the group were simply ""sharing views and opinions"". ""I want to make sure that decency, honour and integrity are returned to the heart of government and I think that would be a good shared objective, rather than the distraction of briefing out about rebellion ringleaders."" The meeting was nicknamed by one cabinet minister as the ""pork pie plot"" because one of the attendees was Alicia Kearns, who represents Rutland and Melton (home of Melton Mowbray pies). Colleagues of Ms Kearns say she is not leading a rebellion. The meeting of 2019 MPs dubbed ""the pork pie plot"" by an irritated member of cabinet might sound like something slightly comic, but it is serious. And there is now a wider question - how many other dominoes may then fall? In the last week or so, government ministers and the prime minister have been saying, and pleading with people, to wait for the official verdict from the Sue Gray report. But some of this younger generation - not necessarily in age but in terms of time in Parliament - seem to have just lost patience with that. And it isn't just them. Remember in the darkest days for Theresa May, the Conservatives were broadly split in two - Brexiters and Remainers - with clear ring leaders on each side. But this time it is a really circus of different factions that make the complexity of the picture very hard to read. Let's take a breath though. A big part of the Tory leadership process is shrouded in secrecy, so anyone who purports to tell you with certainty what is going to happen should be treated with very healthy scepticism. It is possible that the number of letters hits the threshold required of 54 in the next couple of days. But it is also possible that the numbers may be miles off. Whatever happens in the next 48 hours, the consensus that is growing in the Conservative Party is that as every day goes by, Boris Johnson is less likely to be leading them into the general election unless he - sometimes a political Houdini - can pull off his biggest ever political comeback. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson insisted he was not warned a drinks party in No 10 on 20 May 2020 could be in breach of Covid rules. Speaking to a reporter, he said he ""humbly"" apologised to people for ""misjudgements that were made"" but added he was ""absolutely categorical"" that ""nobody said to me this is an event that is against the rules"". This contradicts the account of his former adviser Dominic Cummings who says he cautioned the prime minister about the event, billed by an official in an email invitation as ""socially distanced drinks"". He also accused his former boss of lying to Parliament about his knowledge of gatherings in Downing Street. Asked if he would resign if he was found to have misled MPs, Mr Johnson said: ""Let's see what the report says."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Heappey suggested Mr Johnson's staff were to blame for the event going ahead, adding that the PM ""doesn't really own his own diary"" and its was ""up to his team to have his back"". He says the gathering ""reflects rather poorly on those who scheduled it, and put it in the prime minister's diary"". This video can not be played Watch: Chancellor believes PM is telling truth about No 10 parties Lord Marland, a former Conservative party treasurer and Johnson ally, said MPs should ""be careful what they wish for because the alternative is probably not thinkable"". Speaking to Newsnight, he said people should not ""want to pillory a man who has led us through this crisis and create turmoil within the country"". Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns also urged people to get behind Mr Johnson, telling Channel 4: ""Boris won seats for us in that 2019 election I never imagined would fall into the Conservative column."" As well as PMQs on Wednesday, Mr Johnsonis set to update the public on England's Plan B measures.
