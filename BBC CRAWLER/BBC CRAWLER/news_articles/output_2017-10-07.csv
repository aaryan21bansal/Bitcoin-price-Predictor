London museum crash 'not terror-related',"This video can not be played Video shows a man being pinned to the ground near the Natural History Museum A crash outside a London museum that injured 11 people was not terror-related, police have said. A black Toyota Prius hit the people outside the Natural History Museum in Exhibition Road, South Kensington. Video footage that emerged on Twitter showed a man, believed to be the driver, being restrained on the ground. The Metropolitan Police later said the incident was thought to be a ""road traffic collision"" and a man in his 40s had been arrested at the scene. He was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and received hospital treatment before being taken to a north London police station for questioning. London Ambulance said the people it treated - including the detained man - had mostly sustained head and leg injuries. Nine were taken to hospital. The Met said none of the injuries were believed to be life-threatening or life changing. Prime MinisterTheresa May tweeted,externalher thanks to first responders and members of the public, adding: ""My thoughts are with the injured."" A picture of the car at the scene on Exhibition Road London MayorSadiq Khan also tweeted,externalhis thanks and hopes for a ""swift recovery"" for those injured. ""For Londoners and visitors planning to visit our excellent museums and attractions in the area, please be assured they will be open as usual tomorrow."" The current terror threat in the UK is at ""severe"" - the second highest level - meaning an attack is highly likely. Exhibition Road is an area popular with tourists as it is home to the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Oliver Cheshire, a model and popstar Pixie Lott's fiance, was involved in helping hold the man down after the incident. He tweeted:,external""I'm OK. Thank you to the men who helped me pin him down and the police for coming so quickly."" BBC reporter Chloe Hayward, who was leaving the Natural History Museum as the crash happened at 14:20 BST, said she saw a car ""diagonally across the road"", looking like it had hit a bollard, before armed officers arrived. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent We have been to the south end of Exhibition Road nearest the Tube and the area, normally a busy destination for Saturday afternoon dining by locals and tourists, is deserted. Eyewitnesses told us that police came rushing into each bar and restaurant and told people to get out. We can see coats on chairs - some knocked over - half-eaten meals and half-drunk glasses of wine. Police helped one restaurant owner to recover staff belongings, like house keys, because it was unclear when the area would reopen. An eyewitness who was walking to the Science Museum said: ""When waiting for the light, we heard what I thought was gunshots and saw a car drive over the pavement. We just ran. My friend dived on the floor and cut her hands."" The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ""When it calmed down we walked back to where we'd been and saw a gentleman on the floor being restrained by police."" This video can not be played Ellie Mackay, who lives opposite South Kensington tube station, said she heard ""a couple of loud bangs"" Connor Honeyman, from Essex, who was in the queue for the museum, said: ""We heard a horrible thudding noise and a car engine. Everyone started running and screaming inside. ""We ran in, everyone was following us, and then all the security guards ran out and they closed the main entrance. There was much confusion before the police got there.""

Trump: 'One thing will work' with N Korea,"The US president and his North Korean counterpart are at loggerheads over Pyongyang's nuclear programme ""Only one thing will work"" in dealing with North Korea after years of talks with Pyongyang brought no results, US President Donald Trump has warned. ""Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years,""he tweeted,,externaladding that this ""hasn't worked"". Mr Trump did not elaborate further. The two nations have been engaged in heated rhetoric over North Korea's nuclear activities, with the US pressing for a halt of missile tests. Pyongyang says it has recently successfully tested a miniaturised hydrogen bomb which could be loaded on to a long-range missile. The US has been conducting military exercises with South Korea as part of what it describes as show of force missions There are fears that North Korea will soon have the capacity to hit the US mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile President Trump has previously warned that the US could destroy North Korea if necessary to protect America's national interests and defend its allies in the region. Inside the world's most secretive country Where is the war of words heading? North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Saturday praised nuclear weapons as a ""powerful deterrent"" which guaranteed his country's security, state media reported. In a speech addressing ""the complicated international situation"", he said such weapons had safeguarded ""the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and north-east Asia"" against the ""protracted nuclear threats of the US imperialists"". He said his country's policy of simultaneously pursuing the development of nuclear weapons in parallel with moves to strengthen the economy was ""absolutely right"". North Korea recently launched two missiles over Japan and defied international condemnation to carry out its sixth nuclear test in September.  It has promised to carry out another test in the Pacific Ocean. There are fears in the West that is rapidly reaching the point where it is capable of developing a nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the US mainland. Saturday's tweets by President Trump are another cryptic announcement by America's leader, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Washington says. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (above) has denied reports of a rift with President Trump Last week, it was suggested that US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had direct lines of communication with Pyongyang to try to resolve the escalating tensions. Mr Trump then tweeted: ""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!"" On Saturday, the US president insisted he had a good relationship with his secretary of state, but added that Mr Tillerson could be tougher. Earlier in the week,Mr Tillerson had denied rumoursof a rift between the two men, amid media reports he had called the president a ""moron"". Mr Trump's latest comment on North Korea could just be bluster - but the fear is that Pyongyang will interpret it as a threat, our correspondent says. At a speech to the UN later that month, Mr Trump threatened to annihilate North Korea, saying the country's leader, Kim Jong-un,"" is on a suicide mission"". In exchange, Mr Kim in a rare statement, vowed to ""tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire"".

May 'to demote Boris' and Major's 'blast',"The overwhelming message on Sunday's front pages is summed up in a Sunday Telegraph headline, which says the Tories are ""at war"". Rebel MPs are said to have given Theresa May until Christmas to make real progress on Brexit to avoid another attempt to oust her. The paper says,externalMrs May has decided to commit billions of pounds on preparing Britain to leave the EU without a deal - to send a signal to pro-Brexit MPs that she's serious about regaining the upper hand in negotiations. According to the Sunday Times,external, the prime minister will reassert her authority with a cabinet reshuffle in which she is prepared to demote Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Tory sources have told the paper she will shake up her top team later this month. In aninterview with the paper,external, Mrs May says: ""It's never been my style to hide from a challenge and I'm not going to start now."" In hisarticle in the Mail on Sunday,external, Sir John Major tells the plotters it is time to focus on the needs of the British people rather than their own ambitions if they want to avoid two 'neo-Marxists' being in government - a reference to Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. In an editorial, the Mail urges Mrs May to seize the moment and attack. ""While willing to wound,"" it says, ""her foes fear to strike"". It advises her to ""get rid of unreliable and worn-out ministers"". According to the Sunday Express, ""Brexit's big three"" -  Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and David Davis - ""have thrown their weight behind Theresa May"" and urged Tories to rally round her as leader. In anarticle for the paper,external, Dr Fox praises the prime minister's ""great inner strength"". ButNigel Nelson in the People,externalsays Mrs May is no longer ""she who must be obeyed"" and instead labels her: ""She who's being abandoned."" The Sunday Mirror,externalhas a front page picture which it says shows prisoners cooking steaks smuggled into their jail. Pictures inside the paper are said to expose the lifestyle of convicts - with no fear of authority - partying on drugs, vodka and take-away pizzas and fried chicken. The paper says the pictures ""shame our failing prison system"". A spokesman for the Prison Service is quoted saying: ""This behaviour is completely unacceptable."" The Sun on Sunday,externalalso features a prison story. It says ""prison chiefs have been blasted"" after reports that a mother was groomed from behind bars by the jailed paedophile, Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins. It says it led to the woman's two-year-old daughter being taken into care, after police and social services were alerted. The paper says it's only the latest in a series of scandals and the prison bosses who allowed it should be ashamed of themselves. Many of the Spanish papers carry pictures of the demonstrations for national unity that took place on Saturday, calling on Catalans to reject independence. The country's biggest selling newspaper, El Pais, criticises the authorities in Catalonia, saying they should never have encouraged a large part of their population to go outside the legal framework and vote in a referendum already banned by the constitutional court. The Observer says,externalhuge numbers are expected at a demonstration by Catalans opposed to independence in Barcelona today.

Thousands rally for Spanish unity,"This video can not be played Thousands gathered at political rallies in Madrid and Barcelona Thousands of people calling for Spanish unity have attended rallies in the capital Madrid after Sunday's disputed referendum for Catalan independence. Other demonstrations - including in the Catalan city Barcelona - have also been held urging political dialogue. Protesters dressed in white gathered with signs saying ""Spain is better than its leaders"" and ""let's talk"". Businesses have continued to announce their departure from the Catalan region amid the ongoing political uncertainty. The Caixa Foundation, which controls one of the Spain's largest banks, announced it was moving its headquarters to Palma de Mallorca while the crisis continues. This video can not be played Voters in Catalonia explain why their reasons for backing or rejecting independence The country is waiting for a speech on Tuesday by Catalan President Carles Puigdemont amid speculation he will declare independence. The final results showed 90% of the 2.3 million people who voted backed independence. Turnout was 43%. There have been several claims of irregularities, and many ballot boxes were seized by the Spanish police. Spain's government representative in Catalonia apologised on Friday to people hurt during police efforts to stop the referendum, but blamed the Catalan government for holding an illegal vote. Enric Millo said he could not help but ""regret it and apologise on behalf of the officers that intervened"", while casting doubt on the numbers said to be injured. Spain eases firms' exit from Catalonia Distressed police officer photo goes viral Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Nearly 900 people were injured as police, trying to enforce a Spanish court ban on the vote, attempted to seize ballot boxes and disperse voters. Thirty-three police officers were also hurt. The Spanish government's official spokesperson, IÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo, also apologised for the police violence and suggested that new elections in Catalonia might be a way to heal the fracture caused by the disputed referendum. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the Catalan parliament on Tuesday at 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT) after Spain's Constitutional Court earlier suspended the Catalan parliament session that had been planned for Monday. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold There is speculation that the parliament will declare independence unilaterally at its next sitting. Meanwhile, the former leader of Catalonia, Artur Mas,told,externalthe Financial Times newspaper that the region was not yet ready for real independence - even though he believed it had won the right to break away. By BBC's James Reynolds, Alicante The competing authorities in Barcelona and Madrid could each take a potentially dramatic step. Barcelona has the option of making a unilateral declaration of independence. For its part, Madrid has the power to dissolve self-rule in Catalonia. Each step - if taken - would provoke a constitutional crisis in Spain. There are some signs that each side may choose to pause. Mr Puigdemont says he will deliver a report to the Catalan parliament on Tuesday about the political situation - a deliberately vague form of words which gives him room for manoeuvre.

Poland holds controversial prayer day,"This video can not be played Tens of thousands prayed in numerous locations around Poland's borders Tens of thousands have taken part in a controversial prayer day in Poland. Catholics were encouraged to go to designated points along the country's borders for a mass rosary prayer for the salvation of Poland and the world. Church leaders say the event is purely religious, but there are concerns it could be seen as endorsing the state's refusal to let in Muslim migrants. The feast day marks the anniversary of a Christian victory over Ottoman Turks at the sea battle of Lepanto in 1571. People were bussed in from more than 300 churches to points all along the border. They stood in lines, some on beaches on the Baltic Sea, some in fields and some in towns. ""We come to the border of Poland to pray for the Poles and for the whole world,"" said one woman. Many people said they were praying for their Catholic faith Several hundred took part in the port of Gdynia ""We want our Catholic faith to continue, to keep our children safe, that our brothers from other countries can understand that our faith is unwavering and that we feel safer, not only in Poland but also in the world."" Mateusz Maranowski, a Polish radio journalist, said he had come out to thank the Virgin Mary for his child, who was born prematurely. He said about 300 people took part in the event in the sea port of Gdynia. ""At first I wanted to pray alone on the beach but it turned out that many people from nearby parishes came out to the beach to take part in the... event,"" he said. Halina Kotarska, 65, said she was expressing thanks for the survival of her son in a car crash, but also praying for the survival of Christianity in Europe. ""Islam wants to destroy Europe,"" she said,quoted,externalby the Associated Press. ""They want to turn us away from Christianity."" Some priests and Church commentators said the event could be seen as support for the government's refusal to accept Muslim migrants, a policy backed by a majority of Poles. Organisers said the prayer was not directed against anyone or anything. The border was chosen, they said, because it symbolised their desire to encompass the world with prayer. Poland, along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, refused to take part in an EU deal in 2015 to relocate refugees from frontline states Italy and Greece. The Polish position has put it at odds with the Vatican, with Pope Francis urging greater acceptance of migrantson a visit to Poland last year. Bishops have urged the government to assist selected Syrian refugees but the plan has failed to secure politicians' backing.

Scot facing jail over Dubai 'hip touch',"Jamie Harron has been prevented from leaving the country and has had his passport confiscated A Scot is facing a three-year jail sentence in Dubai for reportedly putting his hand on a man in a bar. Jamie Harron, who is 27 and from Stirling, said he was trying to avoid spilling his drink in the crowded Rock Bottom Bar when the incident happened. He was locked up for five days and has now been prevented from leaving the city in order to attend court. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was providing consular assistance on the matter. The arrest follows the case of an Edinburgh man who was also detained in Dubai after attempting to exchange a fake Â£20. William Barclay, from Edinburgh, returned home on Friday after being held in a Dubai jail for three daysduring a family holiday. The campaign group Detained in Dubai said Mr Harron was arrested for public indecency after touching the man on his hip. Mr Harron, who works as an electrician in Afghanistan and was on a two-day stopover in the United Arab Emirates, is said to have since lost his job and spent more than Â£30,000 in expenses and legal fees, since the incident on 15 July. Radha Stirling, chief executive of Detained in Dubai, said: ""It is quite outrageous that he has been held in the country for so long already. Jamie Harron was at the Rock Bottom Bar when the incident reportedly happened ""This is another example of how vulnerable tourists are to arrest and detention in Dubai and at how drawn-out and disorganised legal proceedings are."" The organisation claims it was only after Mr Harron and his friend sat at a table that the man who had been touched seemed aggravated. Police arrived at the scene ""20 to 30"" minutes later and arrested Mr Harron, according to his representatives. The charges he faces in connection with the incident are said to be twofold - drinking alcohol and public indecency. Mr Harron was reportedly locked up for five days in Al Barsha prison, before being released on bail and having his passport confiscated. Ms Stirling added that following a conversation with Mr Harron, it was clear that he was under ""immense pressure and stress"". She said: ""He was expecting to appear in court this Sunday, but the court moved the date without telling him or his lawyer. ""This led to a sentence of 30 days' imprisonment for failing to present himself at the hearing."" A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ""We have been in contact with a British man following his arrest in Dubai in July. We are providing consular assistance."" âMisledâ Blairgowrie lodge owners face losing their homes after appeal defeats Falkirk Council planners want to reject 21 homes in Dennyloanhead Plans for 48 homes in Polmont should be rejected say Falkirk Council planners A9 closed northbound near Dunblane after crash New membership packages aim to improve health and well-being Scottish regiment's Boer War experiences to be explored in Stirling lecture At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres under fire in LA, 0% contained 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Journalist Kim Wall's head is found,"Kim Wall (right) went missing after boarding Peter Madsen's submarine (left) The head of Swedish journalist Kim Wall has been found, two months after she disappeared on a trip with a Danish submariner, Danish police say. Divers found bags containing her head, legs and clothing in Koge Bay, just south of Copenhagen, the city's police inspector Jens Moller Jensen said. They were found not far from where Ms Wall's torso was discovered 11 days after she boarded Peter Madsen's submarine on 10 August. Mr Madsen, 46, denies murdering her. Healso deniesa charge of mutilating her corpse. What we know âExceptionalâ journalist remembered Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Mr Moller Jensen said the bags, found on Friday, had been weighed down with pieces of metal. ""Yesterday morning we found a bag within which we found Kim Wall's clothes, underwear, stockings, and shoes. In the same bag laid a knife, and there were some car pipes to weigh the bag down,"" he said. He said a post-mortem examination confirmed the head was Ms Wall's and that it showed ""no sign of fracture... [or] any sign of other blunt violence to the skull"". This would seem to contradict Mr Madsen's statement that she had died after hitting her head on a hatch. Ms Wall, 30, was last seen alive on the evening of 10 August as she departed with Mr Madsen on his self-built 40-tonne submarine, UC3 Nautilus, for a story she was writing about his venture. Her boyfriend raised the alarm the next day when she did not return from the trip. Initially, Mr Madsen said he had dropped her off safely in Copenhagen, but he later changed his story to say it had been a ""terrible accident"", that he had ""buried her at sea"" and planned afterwards to take his own life by sinking his submarine.

Catalan declaration 'will have no effect',"Mariano Rajoy: ""I don't rule out absolutely anything that is within the law"" Any declaration of independence by Catalonia will have no effect, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has warned, adding that he is not ruling out suspending the region's autonomy. In an interview with El PaÃ­s newspaper, Mr Rajoy also rejected any mediation to resolve the crisis. On Saturday thousands of people rallied in Madrid for Spanish unity. A similar demonstration is under way in Barcelona in response to last week's disputed referendum. Protestors in Barcelona held a banner reading ""Catalonia is Spanish"" on Sunday The final results from the wealthy north-eastern region showed 90% of the 2.3 million people who voted backed independence. Turnout was 43%. There have been several claims of irregularities, and many ballot boxes were seized by Spanish police. Nearly 900 people were injured as the police, trying to enforce a Spanish court ban on the vote, attempted to disperse voters. Thirty-three police officers were also hurt. This video can not be played Voters in Catalonia explain why their reasons for backing or rejecting independence In the El PaÃ­s interview, Mr Rajoysaid,external: ""The government will ensure that any declaration of independence will lead to nothing."" Asked whether he was prepared to invoke Article 155 of Spain's constitution, which allows the national parliament to intervene in the running of an autonomous region, Mr Rajoy said: ""I don't rule out absolutely anything that is within the law."" Spain eases firms' exit from Catalonia Distressed police officer photo goes viral Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Mariano Rajoy - the prime minister who lost Catalonia?

New Orleans braced for Hurricane Nate,"New Orleans residents fill sandbags as forecasters warn that Nate will make US landfall as a category two hurricane A state of emergency has been declared in four southern US states with Hurricane Nate gathering strength as it heads towards the Gulf Coast. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and parts of Florida have issued hurricane warnings and evacuation orders. The measures apply to parts of the city of New Orleans, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago.

The driving lesson selfie that enraged some Saudis,"Three days after King Salman issued a decree allowing women in Saudi Arabia to drive, a selfie of a man giving his wife a driving lesson led to a divisive conversation on Twitter. Faisal BaDughaish, an analyst in a gas and oil company from Dhahran in the east of Saudi Arabia,tweeted,externala photo of him with his wife in an empty car park. The tweet read: ""I started teaching my wife how to drive in one of the private parking spaces in a safe and legal way, preparing for the law to take effect."" But the reaction to the picture - which was retweeted thousands of times - shows just how controversial the lifting of the driving ban is. Some said that they disapproved of Mr BaDughaish publishing a photo of his wife's face. ""Don't you feel embarrassed or protective of her when posting her picture?"" tweeted one user called Bderr1991. ""Shame on you."" But many women responded positively to the tweet saying that they too were expecting lessons from men in their family. A woman named Amal Nadhreen commented: ""Tomorrow, my son Azzam will teach me how to drive."" Some men, like Faisal Alshehri,tweeted,externalthat they were encouraged by Mr BaDughaish to teach their own wives: ""We're all going to follow your lead."" However, other women revealed that the royal decree had caused debate within their own families. A tweeter named Julnarwrote,external: ""I will let my son train me, even though my husband says no - but I am not having that."" Saudi women driving reform: 'We did it' Why women are uber annoyed in Saudi Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external Speaking to BBC Arabic, Mr BaDughaish said that both he and his wife had been ""waiting impatiently"" for Saudi Arabia's law to change and that he was hoping the selfie would encourage other Saudi men to teach their female relatives to drive. He added that he also wanted to inspire women to train in a legal way, as it is currently not permissible for females to learn how to drive on main roads in Saudi Arabia. His wife called the lesson ""amazing"".Dooa BaDughaish told BBC Outside Sourcethat driving ""was a little bit tough to learn, but I hope I'm a fast learner."" ""I think that was a great experience,"" she said. Faisal BaDughaish said that some of the messages sent to him were so threatening that he reported them to Saudi Arabia's cybercrimes department. The historicannouncement, allowing women in Saudi Arabia to drive, was made at the United Nations by Saudi Arabia's permanent representative. Women in the country will be able to drive from June 2018. The Gulf kingdom is the only country in the world that bans women from driving - only men are allowed licences and women who drive in public risk being arrested and fined.

Protests across Russia on Putin birthday,"This video can not be played Police blocked off Moscow city centre, but generally kept a low profile during the protests there More than 250 people have been arrested as supporters of opposition leader Alexei Navalny held protests in some 80 cities across Russia, reports say. They were demanding he be allowed to stand in 2018 presidential elections. Clashes and dozens of arrests were reported in St Petersburg, where the main protest was taking place. The rallies coincided with President Vladimir Putin's 65th birthday. Most were unauthorised, including those in Moscow and St Petersburg. Mr Navalny is currently serving 20 days in jail for repeatedly violating a law on organising public meetings. It is the third time this year that Mr Navalny has been jailed. Russia's electoral authorities say he cannot stand in the March vote because of a separate suspended sentence. In recent months he has travelled across Russia in a bid to bolster his makeshift election campaign.

It was prevented last year with the help of an undercover FBI agent - posing as an IS supporter - who communicated with the three plotters. Details of the alleged plot were released on Friday as prosecutors revealed the charges. New York's subway system is alleged to have been a target of the bombers The trio are alleged to have wanted to attack Times Square when it was heavily crowded Police on Friday announced charges against Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy, 19, a Canadian citizen detained in New York; Talha Haroon, also 19, a US citizen based in Pakistan and Russell Salic, 37, from the Philippines. El Bahnasawy was arrested in May 2016 and pleaded guilty last October to seven terror-related charges. He is awaiting his sentence. Who is behind the jihadist attacks on Europe and North America? Haroon was arrested in Pakistan in September 2016, while Salic was arrested in the Philippines the following April. Both men are due to be extradited to the US.

China trade sees donkeys killed on massive scale,"'Instant puddings' made from donkey-hide gelatine are popular among Chinese consumers The world's donkeys are facing a population crisis because of the huge demand for their skins in China, where they are used to make health foods and traditional medicine. Donkey meat is also a popular food, but a huge drop in the number of Chinese donkeys and the fact they are slow to reproduce, has forced suppliers to look elsewhere. Africa has been badly hit because the animals are such an important part of life for transport and farming - particularly in poorer communities. In Zimbabwe, a ""state-of-the-art"" donkey meat abattoir costing $150,000 (Â£114,000) is due to open in October In many places the price of a donkey has doubled in the past few years, and as thieves cash in, families are left unable to afford a new animal. Water deliveryman Anthony Maupe Wanyama, 29, from Kenya had his donkey Carlos for four years and was doing well. ""I bought land up-country, bought a house, paid school fees and looked after my family,"" said the father of two. This video can not be played 'I woke up and my donkey was gone' He and his donkey were such a part of life in Ongata Rongai, just outside Nairobi, that Anthony's nickname is ""Carlos"". ""I woke up one morning and Carlos was missing. I looked around the area, and then found him dead, his skin had been removed,"" said Anthony, tears rolling down his cheeks as he talked about his much-loved animal. He now rents another donkey to pull a cart-load of blue plastic jerry cans he uses to deliver water, but has to give the owner half of the three or four dollars he makes on a good day. Anthony Wanyama attaches a harness to his rented donkey ""Carlos"", the name of Andrew's dead donkey and the nickname now given to him, is still listed on his cart ""Now I don't have enough money. I haven't paid my rent, I haven't paid school fees, and I have people who depend on me,"" Anthony said. He can't afford to buy a new Carlos. Donkey hides piled up ready for export 1.8m skins are traded every year - according toestimates from UK-based charity The Donkey Sanctuary,external- but the demand is as high as 10m China's donkey population dropped from 11m in 1990 to 3m today, based on government data Ejiao, the gelatine produced by boiling donkey skins, can sell for up to $388 (Â£300) per kilo Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal have banned donkey exports to China The surge in price and demand in Kenya has been encouraged by three donkey abattoirs, which have opened across the country. They can each slaughter around 150 animals a day, packing and freezing the meat and salting the skins for export. At the Star Brilliant Donkey Export Abattoir in Naivasha, the latest arrivals are being dragged onto flat metal scales - they are sold by ""live weight"". Staff lead donkeys to an abattoir in Kenya They are shot in the head with a bolt gun before their meat and skins are processed. Chief executive John Kariuki says he was the first in Kenya, and in Africa, to get official permits to open a donkey slaughterhouse. ""Before, there was no market for the donkeys. People used to sell their cows, people used to sell their goats to pay their school fees for the children,"" he said. ""But now I find that people in the market are selling donkeys more than cows. ""We are happy with the Chinese, because before there was nothing coming from donkeys, but so many people are benefitting from the donkey now today."" Chinese buyers monitor the process - making sure everything is properly packed and prepared. When the skins are boiled, they produce a brown gelatine, which is the essential ingredient in Chinese ""ejiao"" products - popular health foods and traditional medicines. Donkey gelatine - or ejiao - is marketed in a variety of liquid and paste forms But the way donkeys are being treated has been criticised. A British donkey charity and environmental investigative journalists from South Africa-based group Oxpeckers have uncovered cases of animal abuse among those waiting to be killed in appalling conditions. ""This is the biggest crisis donkeys have ever faced,"" said Mike Baker from The Donkey Sanctuary, which is leading an international campaign to halt the trade in donkey products until it can be properly regulated. ""We are seeing millions being taken and we are seeing suffering on the scale I have never witnessed before. A mound of donkey carcasses dumped in Botswana after the animals' flesh was removed ""We are talking about donkeys being starved to death to make it easier to skin them, or bludgeoned to death."" But Mr Baker says the international pressure is starting to have an impact. Countries including Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal have banned China from buying their donkey products. ""Over a dozen governments have now taken action to stop this trade, and that's because they know this is impoverishing their people as well as being massively cruel to animals,"" Mr Baker says. Donkey hides are laid out to dry in Ghana They are being killed on a dramatic scale across the continent - and places further afield like Brazil and Peru. And life is certainly a lot harder for Anthony Wanyama and his family, with rent arrears and unpaid school fees. Many thousands of people trapped by terrible drought have been forced to sell their only assets, while others have lost their donkeys to thieves and can no longer afford to buy another animal.

Football family honours Freddy Shepherd,"Everton star Wayne Rooney was among the mourners Family and friends have gathered for the funeral of former Newcastle United chairman Freddy Shepherd. Former club captain Alan Shearer, ex-Magpies managers Kenny Dalglish and Sam Allardyce, and Everton star Wayne Rooney were among mourners at St George's Church, in Jesmond, Newcastle. The service got under way at noon and was followed by a private cremation ceremony. Mr Shepherd, 75,passed away at home on 25 September. He engineered the Â£15m deal which took Shearer from Blackburn back to his native Newcastle in July 1996. Paying tribute during the service, Shearer said: ""It is well-documented that there was another, so-called big club after me, but it was Freddy along with Kevin (Keegan), Sir John (Hall) and Douglas (Hall) who was instrumental in getting me home. ""I left 10 years later with him as my great friend, playing for my club, breaking the goal-scoring record, living my dream. ""I can thank Freddy for all of that."" He ended his eulogy by saying: ""We miss you Mr Chairman, we miss you Freddy."" The club's record goal-scorer and former captain, Alan Shearer, paid tribute during the service Mr Shepherd's coffin was carried into St George's Church Mr Shepherd (l) paid Â£250,000 for a brass statue of former striker Shearer outside St James' Park last year Sir John Hall, who was chairman before Mr Shepherd and who teamed up with him to take over the club when it was in trouble in the 1990s, said Newcastle became other fans' second team and their brand of entertaining football ""lifted Tyneside"". During Mr Shepherd's time at Newcastle, the club twice finished as Premier League runners-up, reached two FA Cup finals and enjoyed two Champions League campaigns. In addition, he oversaw the redevelopment of an ageing stadium, boosting its capacity from about 36,000 to more than 52,000. Sir John Hall handed over the role of club chairman to Mr Shepherd in 1997 Former Newcastle United and England manager Sam Allardyce was another guest Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce was among the big names from the world of football in attendance Local Labour MP Nick Brown told mourners Mr Shepherd created the Soccer Aid charity with Robbie Williams to help the world's poorest children, and it has raised Â£25m since 2004. Away from football, Mr Shepherd was a major employer on Tyneside, having built up his offshore industry business with his brother Bruce. On a floral tribute, Mr Shepherd's son Kenneth said his father was his best friend, adding: ""My rock, Mr Charisma, Big Fred you are - but more, you are dad.""

Johnson tells Tories to 'get behind' May,"Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has urged colleagues to ""get behind"" the PM because ""people are fed up with this malarkey"". In a WhatsApp message he urged Tories ""talk about nothing except policies"". It comes after ex-party chairman Grant Shapps said about 30 Tory MPs backed his call for a leadership contest. The party's leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, said it should ""get its house in order"", back Theresa May and ""let her get back to governing"". Ms Davidson said critics should ""put up"" and ""shut up"", adding that the calls were not led by anyone ""serious"". The message read: Folks I am away but just read all this! See amber piece this am She is right right right We have JUST HAD AN ELECTION and people are fed up with all this malarkey Get behind the pm. Ordinary punters I have spoken to thought her speech was good and anyone can have a cold Circle the wagons turn the fire on Corbyn and talk about nothing except our great policies and what we can do for the country The prime minister has said she has the ""full support of her cabinet"". Speaking on Friday, she insisted she was providing the ""calm leadership"" the country needed. Laura Kuenssberg: Doubts are now out in open Theresa May says cabinet 'fully behind' her Tories rally round May after speech woes PM struggles through interrupted speech Nigel Evans MP, of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, said Mr Shapps's ""sniping"" was doing the party ""no favours"" and could have a negative impact on Brexit negotiations. Dismissing supporters of a plot to oust Mrs May as ""the coalition of the disappointed"", he told BBC Breakfast: ""Any talents he thinks he's got he should really now direct towards backing Theresa May on the difficult negotiations on Brexit."" Former leadership contender Andrea Leadsom also gave her support to the PM, telling BBC Radio 4's Any Questions: ""Like a lot of my colleagues have said today, [Mr Shapps] should shut up."" This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Look, I've had a cold this week"" Pressure on the prime minister has grown since her party conference speech was plagued by a series of mishaps, as she struggled with a persistent cough and was interrupted by a prankster. Mr Shapps, who was co-chair of the party between 2012 and 2015, said he believed it was ""time we actually tackle this issue of leadership"" adding that ""so do many colleagues"". However, cabinet ministers including Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Home Secretary Amber Rudd were among those who backed the PM on Friday. This video can not be played Former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said Theresa May should face a leadership election Speaking onRadio 4's Political Thinking podcast, Ms Davidson,leader of the Scottish Conservatives, suggested the prime minister's critics should ""put up, shut up and get off the stage"", adding there were ""an awful lot of people in our party who need to settle down"". ""I think if the plotters were serious, they would be led by someone a bit more serious,"" she said. ""One of the irritants over the last couple of days, for me, particularly as a woman, is this idea that all of these men are supposed to be making decisions on Theresa May's behalf,"" she added. ""Well, have they actually met Theresa May? This is a woman with agency, with grit, with determination. ""I backed her in the leadership, I back her now and I will back her in the future."" To trigger a vote of confidence in the party leader, 48 of the 316 Conservative MPs would need to write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. A leadership contest would only be triggered if Mrs May lost that vote, or chose to quit. Mr Shapps said no letter had been sent and that his intention had been to gather signatures privately and persuade Mrs May to stand down. But he claimed party whips had taken the ""extraordinary"" step of making it public by naming him as the ringleader of a plot to oust the PM in a story in the Times. He said: ""The country needs leadership. It needs leadership at this time in particular."" Former minister Ed Vaizey was the first MP to publicly suggest Mrs May should quit on Thursday, telling the BBC: ""I think there will be quite a few people who will now be pretty firmly of the view that she should resign.""

Tower block safety cash 'not released',"The government has not released funds to make tower blocks safe following the Grenfell Tower fire, according to some councils. Several local authorities in England and Wales say funding requests for refurbishments such as new cladding and sprinkler systems are not being met. Jane Urquhart, from Nottingham City Council, said some works were regarded as ""additional rather than essential"". The government said it had asked councils for more detailed proposals. Police believe at least 80 people died when fire engulfed Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London in the early hours of 14 June. Sprinklers 'would have saved Grenfell' Grenfell Tower: Who were the victims? Reality Check: Why don't all high-rises have sprinklers? Ms Urquhart, a Labour councillor, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""safety must come at the top of the list"". She said: ""Given that in the refurbishment of the Houses of Parliament sprinklers are considered essential... we thought it was quite incredible that they were essential for the Houses of Parliament but not essential for residents of high-rises."" Adam Hug, leader of the Labour opposition group on Westminster City Council, said the authority had faced difficulties securing funding from Communities Secretary Sajid Javid's department to pay for the removal of cladding and installation of sprinklers. ""Ultimately these are things that the London Fire Brigade says have to be done and ultimately the cost is having to be borne by the housing revenue account, which is tenants' rents and service charge fees,"" he said. ""Councils across the country are asking the government for the help that Sajid Javid promised and they are being told 'no, only in exceptional circumstances when you literally don't have the money in any form'."" Cladding has been removed from many tower blocks following the Grenfell Tower fire Mr Hug described the situation as a ""national civil emergency across the country"", adding that councils have complied with regulations but ""the government is not stepping up to the plate"". According to the Guardian,externalother councils, including Croydon and Wandsworth, have also seen requests for funding declined. Fire safety expert Paul Atkins, who was previously contracted to work on Grenfell Tower,told the BBC last monththat sprinklers would have stopped the flames from spreading. ""If they'd had a sprinkler system the fire would have been deluged before it got to the cladding,"" he said. ""People would've had plenty of time to leave the building."" Mr Atkins said no-one had ever died in a fire when a sprinkler system was present in the building. The Grenfell Tower fire started in a Hotpoint fridge freezer,and was not deliberate, police have said. The flames ignited the cladding on the outside of the building, spreading across the exterior of the tower block with what police described as ""unexpected"" speed. Police also said the building's cladding and insulation failed subsequent safety tests. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said public safety was ""paramount"". He added: ""Building owners are responsible for funding measures designed to make a building safe. ""We've been clear that where a local authority has concerns about funding essential fire safety measures, they should contact DCLG as soon as possible to discuss their position. ""The department has written to Nottingham, Croydon and Wandsworth councils inviting them to provide more detail about the works they propose. To date these authorities have not submitted this information."" Sprinklers 'would have saved Grenfell' 'Disaster tourism' at Grenfell Tower.

Fresh US tariffs imposed on Bombardier,"Parts of Bombardier's C-Series planes are made in Belfast The US Department of Commerce has again ruled against aerospace firm Bombardier in its dispute with rival Boeing. A further tariff of 80% has been imposed on the import of Bombardier's C-Series jet to the US for alleged below-cost selling. This is on top of anearlier tariff of 220%which related to subsidies Bombardier got from Canada and the UK. There have been warnings that the import tariffs could threaten Bombardier jobs in Belfast. About 1,000 jobs are linked to the C-Series, the wings of which are made at a purpose-built Â£520m factory in the city. Reaction to Bombardier tax ruling Analysis: Not the end of Bombardier row Why is company so important to NI? Bombardier-Boeing dispute explained A spokesperson for Bombardier said: ""We strongly disagree with the commerce department's preliminary decision."" The firm said the ruling represented an ""egregious overreach and misapplication of U.S. trade laws"". ""The commerce department's approach throughout this investigation has completely ignored aerospace industry realities,"" it said. ""This hypocrisy is appalling, and it should be deeply troubling to any importer of large, complex, and highly engineered products."" The programme is not just important to Bombardier jobs in Belfast, but also to 15 smaller aerospace firms in Northern Ireland - and dozens more across the UK - which make components for the wings. The US Department of Commerce rulings, which could more than triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold into the US, could jeopardise a major order placed last year from US airline Delta. A final ruling in the case is due early next year. Davy Thompson from the Unite union said workers are very concerned. ""It looms very large over these workers and it's time for the British government to actually step up for British workers,"" he said. ""We see the British government being bullied by Boeing. ""The EU needs to step in, because effectively they are being bullied too. It needs to stop and it needs to stop now."" This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland A government spokesperson described the latest development as ""disappointing"", but said it was ""hardly surprising given last week's preliminary ruling sided with Boeing"". ""As with the investigation into subsidies, this is only the first step in the process,"" they added. ""Since the interim finding, we have had further Cabinet level engagement with the US Administration and Canadian government. ""We continue to make all efforts alongside the Canadian government to get Boeing to the table to resolve the case."" In a statement Boeing said: ""Today's decision follows a fact-based investigation by the Commerce Department and it validates Boeing's dumping complaints regarding Bombardier's pricing in the United States. ""This was an avoidable outcome within Bombardier's control. The laws governing global trade are transparent and well known."" US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said: ""The United States is committed to free, fair and reciprocal trade with Canada, but this is not our idea of a properly functioning trading relationship"". ""We will continue to verify the accuracy of this decision, while doing everything in our power to stand up for American companies and their workers."" The Canadian aerospace firm employs more than 4,000 workers across four sites in Northern Ireland. Components of the C-Series jet are manufactured at a purpose-built factory in east Belfast and many other local firms are involved in the supply chain. The punitive tax would significantly raise the price of the jet in the US market, and threaten the future of the product. Boeing took the case after accusing Bombardier of anti-competitive practices. It claimed its rival was selling the C-Series jets below cost price after taking state subsidies from the Canadian and British governments. When the preliminary tax ruling was madelast week, Wilbur Ross said: ""The subsidisation of goods by foreign governments is something that the Trump administration takes very seriously."" The US trade commission is due to rule on the Department of Commerce's 220% tax proposal next year, but the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise (ISME) Association said the EU should not wait for the final decision. Its chief executive, Neil McDonnell, said the EU ""should signal right now that it will unconditionally, unequivocally and aggressively oppose protectionist measures by the US with tariffs of like effect"".

US braced for Hurricane Nate,"New Orleans residents fill sandbags as forecasters warn that Nate will make US landfall as a category two hurricane A state of emergency has been declared in four southern US states with Hurricane Nate gathering strength as it heads towards the Gulf Coast. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and parts of Florida have issued hurricane warnings and evacuation orders. The measures apply to parts of the city of New Orleans, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago. Nate killed at least 25 people as it swept through Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Honduras as a tropical storm. The storm, which brushed past Mexican beach resorts, is still strengthening, and is now expected to make landfall as a category two hurricane overnight. Although not as strong as last month's Maria and Irma, Nate will still bring strong winds and storm surges. Its latest recorded wind speeds reached 90mph (150km/h). This video can not be played Video shows passengers climbing out of the windows of a bus, after it was stranded in flood water US President Donald Trump has issued an emergency declaration for Louisiana, allowing the state to seek federal help with preparation and possible relief efforts. In Alabama, Republican Governor Kay Ivey has urged residents in areas facing heavy winds and storm surges to take precautions. Five ports along the Gulf Coast have also been closed to shipping as a precaution. Most oil and gas platforms in the US Gulf of Mexico have evacuated their staff and stopped production ahead of the storm. Harvey v Katrina: Lessons learned? How to stay safe in a hurricane Do 'Pray for...' messages make disaster relief harder? Thehurricane warning,externalissued to parts of the Gulf Coast includes the threat of life-threatening storm surge flooding. Evacuation orders have been put in place for some low-lying areas. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards has declared a state of emergency ahead of the hurricane, which is due to make landfall on Saturday night local time. He said more than 1,000 National Guard troops had been mobilised with a number sent to New Orleans to monitor the drainage pumps there. ""Anyone in low-lying areas... we are urging them to prepare now,"" he said. Star Wars fans dressed as storm troopers walk the streets of New Orleans ahead of Nate's arrival A mandatory curfew from 18:00 (23:00 GMT) is in place in New Orleans, where residents from areas outside the city's levee system have been evacuated. ""Nate is at our doorstep, or will be soon,"" the city's Mayor Mitch Landrieu said, adding that the winds could cause significant power outages. ""We have been through this many, many times, there is no need to panic,"" he added. Nate went past Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula - home to the popular beach resorts of Cancun and Playa del Carmen - on Friday night as it headed north, the US National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The governor of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, Carlos Joaquin, earlier said that although the worst of the storm had been expected to pass just east of the peninsula, it could still bring torrential rains and flooding. Costa Rica is among central American countries hit by storm Nate Nate caused heavy rains, landslides and floods which blocked roads, destroyed bridges and damaged houses as ittore through central America. At least 13 people died in Nicaragua, eight in Costa Rica, three in Honduras and one in El Salvador. The tail of the storm is still causing problems in the region, where thousands have been forced to sleep in shelters and some 400,000 people in Costa Rica were reported to be without running water.

Rallies call for Spain unity after vote,"This video can not be played Thousands gathered at political rallies in Madrid and Barcelona Thousands of people calling for Spanish unity have attended rallies in the capital Madrid after Sunday's disputed referendum for Catalan independence. Other demonstrations - including in the Catalan city Barcelona - have also been held urging political dialogue. Protesters dressed in white gathered with signs saying ""Spain is better than its leaders"" and ""let's talk"". Businesses have continued to announce their departure from the Catalan region amid the ongoing political uncertainty. The Caixa Foundation, which controls one of the Spain's largest banks, announced it was moving its headquarters to Palma de Mallorca while the crisis continues. This video can not be played Voters in Catalonia explain why their reasons for backing or rejecting independence The country is waiting for a speech on Tuesday by Catalan President Carles Puigdemont amid speculation he will declare independence. The final results showed 90% of the 2.3 million people who voted backed independence. Turnout was 43%. There have been several claims of irregularities, and many ballot boxes were seized by the Spanish police. Spain's government representative in Catalonia apologised on Friday to people hurt during police efforts to stop the referendum, but blamed the Catalan government for holding an illegal vote. Enric Millo said he could not help but ""regret it and apologise on behalf of the officers that intervened"", while casting doubt on the numbers said to be injured. Spain eases firms' exit from Catalonia Distressed police officer photo goes viral Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Nearly 900 people were injured as police, trying to enforce a Spanish court ban on the vote, attempted to seize ballot boxes and disperse voters. Thirty-three police officers were also hurt. The Spanish government's official spokesperson, IÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo, also apologised for the police violence and suggested that new elections in Catalonia might be a way to heal the fracture caused by the disputed referendum. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the Catalan parliament on Tuesday at 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT) after Spain's Constitutional Court earlier suspended the Catalan parliament session that had been planned for Monday. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold There is speculation that the parliament will declare independence unilaterally at its next sitting. Meanwhile, the former leader of Catalonia, Artur Mas,told,externalthe Financial Times newspaper that the region was not yet ready for real independence - even though he believed it had won the right to break away. By BBC's James Reynolds, Alicante The competing authorities in Barcelona and Madrid could each take a potentially dramatic step. Barcelona has the option of making a unilateral declaration of independence. For its part, Madrid has the power to dissolve self-rule in Catalonia. Each step - if taken - would provoke a constitutional crisis in Spain. There are some signs that each side may choose to pause. Mr Puigdemont says he will deliver a report to the Catalan parliament on Tuesday about the political situation - a deliberately vague form of words which gives him room for manoeuvre.

'Important' Bronze Age torc on display,"The torc is made of 730g (26oz) of almost pure gold One of England's ""most important Bronze Age finds"" has gone on display for the first time near to where it was found. The Â£220,000 gold torc was unearthed by metal detectorists in an east Cambridgeshire field last year. It was probably left as a ""gift to the gods"" and its diameter is ""larger than any adult male trousers"" according to Neil Wilkin, from the British Museum. The bracelet-like ring is more than 3,000 years old and wasbought by Ely Museum using a series of grants. It was declared treasure at an inquest and the finder and landowner will receive a reward. Elie Hughes, Ely Museum curator, said the detectorist ""had no idea what it was until he cleaned it"", at which point he reported it to the county finds liaison officer. This is how the torc looked once the dirt was washed off - it has not required any polishing, according to Ely curator Elie Hughes Dr Wilkin, who is responsible for the British Museum's British and European Bronze Age Collection, described it as ""one of the most important Bronze Age finds that's ever been made in England"". He said the torc is the ""largest of its type in the whole of Europe"" and its diameter is ""larger than any adult male trousers that you can buy in a shop today"". He speculated the torc could have been worn over bulky clothing or by a sacrificial animal but its use ""remains a guessing game"". At this time in the Bronze Age, people were no longer being buried with important objects - instead they deposited them at ""important places in the landscape"". Dr Wilkin said: ""We don't necessarily know why, but we think it was a gift to the gods, designed to secure good harvests or a healthy family. ""I've calculated you could probably make 10 smaller objects out of this one, so it's a really big sacrifice of wealth and status.""

'I risk death threats to expose scammers',"Romance scams remain a successful tactic for criminals online. In the flesh, Wayne May (not his real name) is an affable gentleman in his late 40s, softly spoken with a lilting Welsh accent. When we meet he's casually dressed in jeans and a Batman T-shirt. He works full-time as a carer. On the net, he's a tireless defender of scam victims and a fearless scam baiter - a person who deliberately contacts scammers, engages with them and then publishes as much information about them as possible in order to warn others. He regularly receives death threats, and his website, Scam Survivors, is often subjected to attempted DDoS attacks - where a site is maliciously hit with lots of web traffic to try to knock it offline. But Mr May is determined to continue helping scamming victims in his spare time, and has a team of volunteers in the US, Canada and Europe doing the same. ""Wayne May"" says victims need to accept that they are unlikely to get their money back Scam Survivors is not an official platform - in the UK victims are encouraged to contact Action Fraud - but the team has dealt with 20,000 cases in the past 12 years, he claims. According to theOffice for National Statistics,externalthere were 1.9 million reports of ""cyber-related"" fraud in the year ending March 2017 in England and Wales. But the report also says that many incidents go unreported. TheAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission website,externalsays nearly AUS$13m (Â£8m, $10m) has been lost this year to romance fraud alone. Scamming may be an old trick but it's still an effective one. Mr May, who does not charge but invites donations on his website, says his website gets up to 10,000 hits a day and the group also receives up to two dozen messages a day from people who are victims of sextortion - when a person is blackmailed after being persuaded to carry out a sex act on webcam, which is then recorded. ""A lot of people, when they come to us are already so far deep into it, they have nowhere to turn,"" he says. ""They're not stupid, they're just unaware of the scam."" ""It's not obvious [that it's a scam] if they've never experienced it before."" Scammer demanded sex show Suspects deny 'sextorting' teenager Bogus tech support call turns nasty He discovered he was ""rather good"" at baiting romance scammers and found relatives of victims were approaching him to help loved-ones. ""I started dealing more with the victims of the scams rather than the scammers themselves, so my priorities changed then from just having fun to actually helping people."" Many scams are not a particularly sophisticated form of fraud. ""There are constantly new scams coming out, and we need to be aware of those,"" says Mr May. ""But a lot of the scams aren't high-tech, they simply write messages to people and that's it. ""You might think, 'I'm not going to fall for this scam' but then you'll fall for another one. The scammers will find a chink in your armour."" Daniel Perry, 17, died in a fall from the Forth Road Bridge in July 2013 - he was a victim of sextortion The first thing Mr May has to explain to those who get in touch is that Scam Survivors cannot recover any money the victim has been persuaded to hand it over. In his experience, the average victim will end up around Â£1,000 out of pocket, but some will go a lot further - one man who recently made contact with the support group had given more than Â£500,000 to a male Russian scammer he thought he was in a relationship with. ""We say upfront, we can't get your money back. We can't offer you emotional support. We're not psychiatrists. We're just people who know how scams work and how to deal with them,"" he says. Drop all contact with the scammer. Don't try to track them down - remember, the scammer has your real details and possibly compromising information about you. It's not worth the risk to continue talking to them, and especially not worth confronting them. If you sent cash, there's no realistic way to get it back - beware the ""recovery scam"" where the scammer then claims to be an agency able to get the money back, for a fee. Contact the police. Share as many details about the scam as you can to warn others. To prevent being a victim, his advice is simple: ""Google everything."" Search the images you are sent, the messages you receive - often scammers use the same material and the more widely shared it is, the more likely it is to end up on a website dedicated to exposing scams. If you fear blackmail, Mr May suggests setting up an alert so that you are notified if your name is mentioned online. If, in the case of sextortion, a video is published on the net, you will then know straight away and can report it, as you are likely to be tagged in it. ""Be aware and learn how to search everything,"" he says. ""If someone sends you a picture or text, search it, try to find out as much as you can. If you're unsure don't send them money."" Action Fraud, the UK's national fraud and cyber-crime reporting service, said all scams reported to it are passed on to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, which is part of City of London Police. However, a spokeswoman told the BBC that only around 30% of all fraud cases had ""viable lines of inquiry"". ""We know that at these levels it is difficult for law enforcement agencies to investigate all these crimes,"" said a spokeswoman. ""We have to maximise our resources where there is the best chance of a successful investigative outcome."" Professor Alan Woodward, cyber-security expert from Surrey University, said it was still important to keep reporting scams to the national body even if individual justice was not always possible. ""For those contacting Action Fraud UK to report a crime it may appear that little happens, but your information is vital in constructing an accurate picture of where, when and how online scams are occurring,"" he said. ""It may be that the police are unable to solve your individual crime but by studying the big picture they are able to zero in on the scammers. ""Your report could be vital in completing the overall picture and enable law enforcement to prevent others suffering as you have."" Some people argue that the scammers themselves are also in desperate situations - many of them operate in some of the poorest parts of the world, such as West Africa and the Philippines. Wayne May has no sympathy. ""These people aren't Robin Hood types,"" he says. ""If you go online and scam people you have the money to go online, if you can't afford food you can't spend hours in an internet cafe."" He is, however, haunted by one occasion when a woman from the Philippines he was scam-baiting offered to perform on webcam for him. When he declined she then asked if she should involve her sister. ""She called this girl over and she couldn't have been more than nine or 10,"" he recalls. ""That horrified me. I said, 'Don't do this, not for me, not for anybody. You shouldn't do this'. I couldn't talk to her again after that. I had to completely walk away."" He says he has no idea what happened to her. ""I can't let it affect me too much, otherwise I wouldn't be able to do what I do,"" he said. ""I've been doing it for almost 12 years now, and if I let every case affect me I'd be a gibbering wreck in the corner."" Romance- when a scammer builds an intense online relationship with someone, then asks for money Sextortion- when a victim is persuaded to carry out a sex act on webcam which is then videoed and the scammer demands a ransom in return for not publishing the content on the net Pets- a pet is advertised for sale, and then fees are demanded in order to get the pet to its new owner.

Could you brave an 'immersive horror' show?,"A child gets sucked down a drain by a scary clown Earlier this month, horror movie It (based on the Stephen King novel) was released in cinemas. You may well have seen It. But surely only the bravest among you would've gone to the ""immersive"" screenings of the movie. Such fans would've had the pleasure of a real-life Pennywise the Clown creeping round the auditorium during the film, jumping out at them from behind and basically scaring the living daylights out of everyone there. While many of us may think this sounds like the most utterly hideous experience in the world, not everyone feels that way - immersive horror is becoming quite a thing. ""There's huge growth in this area,"" says Simon Oakes, CEO of British horror brand Hammer, who have just premiered their first immersive show, The Soulless Ones. Hammer's immersive show's contemporary look is a far cry from that of its gothic horrors of the 1950s-70s ""It's a generational thing, newer audiences want something that's more tangible, emotional, more physical an experience, which is different from the promenade shows that you would've seen before, or even traditional theatre."" As anybody who has been to the cinema in the last decade knows, many people struggle to go for more than about four-and-a-half minutes without checking their WhatsApp, so the appeal of immersive theatre may be down to being totally engrossed in something and disconnected from the outside world. Of course, we've seen hugely popular immersive shows before with the likes of Punchdrunk and You Me Bum Bum Train. ""There's a whole generation of younger audiences who are excited about the idea of being involved in a story rather than told it,"" says Oscar Blustin, the co-writer and co-director of The Soulless Ones. ""I think gaming has a lot to do with it, and how young audiences expect things to be interactive. Now who wouldn't want this friendly chap jumping out at them in a dark cinema ""When you watch TV, we've all shouted at the screen, 'Don't go in there!' or 'Don't go upstairs', I think artists are recognising that this can engage audiences more with the narrative."" In the case of The Soulless Ones, Simon says: ""We wanted to come up with something completely original."" ""With something like The Great Gatsby or Alice in Wonderland, the audience knows what they're going to get. If you know the show, you've already bought into what the creative expectation might be. ""So we chose to start with a completely new show, this isn't a Frankenstein or Dracula, so as a story it's original."" Horror is arguably the genre which provides the most potential to create an immersive experience for theatregoers. ""I think that's because it's able to shed a light on your deepest fears,"" says Simon. Stephen King wrote It - immersive screenings of which have been terrifying audiences ""We don't want to frighten people and scare people as much as unsettle them. But it's not a jump-scare performance, which a lot of the modern horror films are. ""The general philosophy behind horror is that if you don't care about the people, you don't care about what happens to them, and with the great genre directors like Kubrick and Hitchcock, you were invested in the characters."" While the immersive screenings of Stephen King's It were just a few special ones organised to promote the film, The Soulless Ones has a residency at Hoxton Hall in London from this week until 31 October. Oscar explains the show is about ""a hive of vampires who are trying to perform a ritual which will let them walk in the daylight - it's our take on the vampire legend"". ""That is the over-arching story, but there are 14 characters, and 18-20 different rooms around the building, they all interweave and interlink, it's a patchwork of narrative threads."" That may sound a little overwhelming, but Simon argues one key aspect of the show's appeal is the potential for repeat visits. The Soulless Ones has a residency in Hoxton Hall for the month of October ""Because of the number of rooms, we've got 14 hours in total of prepared material,"" he says. ""And I hope that's one of the reasons people might want to see it again. You'd comfortably be able to see the show four times, and never see the same show twice, if you were clever about the route you take. ""Whichever room you walk into, you'll get a different side of the same story."" Oscar points out that audiences would struggle to play with their phones during performances even if they wanted to, ""mostly because the Victorian music hall we're performing in has absolutely no signal"". And if fans enjoy the experience, it could well lead to other similar projects. ""We're not like Marvel or DC comics,"" says Simon, ""at Hammer we feel immersive theatre is an intriguing part of what we do in terms of creating intellectual property. ""But what we do have is a place in this area, if it's successful, to be a building block to others."" Oscar adds: ""People are so on the hunt for unique and one-off experiences in particular. ""There's so much to talk about with immersive theatre, audiences who can compare notes on what they've seen and the different experience they've had at the same show. ""In the bar afterwards I'm anticipating a lot of 'What did you see?' conversations."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Catalan crisis: Two views about independence,"Tensions are running high in Spain in anticipation of a possible declaration of independence by the Catalan government. On 1 October, 43% of Catalans voted in a referendum, which the Spanish government declared illegal then tried to suppress by force. The final results from the outlawed poll show 90% of the 2.3m people who voted backed independence. There has been a big focus on relations between the government of Mariano Rajoy and the Catalan regional government. But what about relations within Catalonia itself, between people who are pro- and anti-independence? Support for independence among Catalans isn't unanimous: some just wanted greater autonomy, while others are fearful of the economic and political impact of a split from Spain. These are the thoughts of two prominent Catalans, with different perspectives on the crisis. Eduardo Mendozais one of Spain's most celebrated literary figures, a Catalan who doesn't support independence. He was awarded the prestigious Cervantes Prize for literature and wrote An Englishman in Madrid, among other novels. He grew up under Gen Franco, and says that the younger generation are wrong to draw parallels with the Francoist era. ""I think it is false to compare the current Spanish government with Franco. We live in a democracy: it's very imperfect. I don't like our government - I think most of our politicians should go to prison and many more burn in hell. ""But we live in a democracy, we cannot deny that. You can say anything you want, you can go wherever you want. To compare the Spanish government with Franco is to not have a memory or to be too young. ""People are falling out. It's very difficult to go back on this. It's lost forever, I think. Years ago I had friends who were pro-independence and others who were not. We never discussed the question of Catalan independence because we knew the arguments one way or another. Protesters wave Spanish flags at a demonstration defending unity on Wednesday ""Now the divide is absolute. People don't talk to each other, even families are divided. Brothers and sisters and fathers and sons don't talk any more or they fight all the time. This is very sad because I don't think it will heal for quite a long time. ""Do we have an identity? I don't know. I think today everybody's identity is his or her iPhone. There is no national identity as such. Carles Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain Divided loyalties: The couples at odds over independence Analysis: Biggest crisis for a generation Could Catalonia make a success of independence? ""I think it's been a snowball effect. There was this dissatisfaction and with the economic crisis this increased. The Catalan government has previously used this dissatisfaction to blame Madrid and get away with anything. ""So the Spanish government didn't pay any attention - they didn't try to talk, they didn't look for peaceful solutions. So this 15% [support for independence] increased to 25, then 45 because the Spanish government has been deaf and dumb."" Monica Terribaspresents the morning news programme on Radio Catalonia, the region's public radio station. She is pro-independence. She says there has been a new energy around the independence movement over the past seven years, partly because of the response of the Spanish state to its demands. ""Here in Catalonia there is a strong republican feeling because of the region's history. There is a feeling that we should organise society in a less hierarchical way and there are a lot of left-wing parties that are strong in Catalonia, much stronger than in the rest of Spain. I think there's a feeling that social rights and human rights and attention to the poor, attention to social movements will be represented in the building of this new society. ""The problem is that Madrid sees Spain as united and there is no way of discussing this. If there is a referendum, even if it's agreed with the state, you are seen as questioning Spanish sovereignty. ""Our society now is under pressure because there has been a violent reaction against polling stations on 1 October. This is the important thing: when you use violence, people are afraid, people don't think properly. ""The state should think carefully about using violence to solve political problems and the international community should be very strong when it sees a democratic state in the European Union doing these things. We aren't seeing an international reaction against that. ""And this can affect families - of course we are all talking about it. It is our future, our lives. ""I'm convinced now that if Spain agreed to hold a formal referendum of self-determination with Catalonia and they ran a campaign saying how wonderful it is to be part of Spain, a significant portion of people now voting in favour of independence would change their minds."" What's clear from these two views is that Spain is in the midst of a major constitutional crisis that could divide both the wider country and Catalonia itself. Though Spain's Prime Minister Rajoyhas called the vote a ""mockery""and has defended the police crackdown, both Monica Terribas and Eduardo Mendoza believe that the politicians in Madrid have handled the crisis badly. But that's where their agreement ends. Monica sees a bright, bold future for an independent Catalan state, whereas Eduardo sees a rupture that will be difficult to heal.

Donkeys face 'biggest ever crisis',"'Instant puddings' made from donkey-hide gelatine are popular among Chinese consumers The world's donkeys are facing a population crisis because of the huge demand for their skins in China, where they are used to make health foods and traditional medicine. Donkey meat is also a popular food, but a huge drop in the number of Chinese donkeys and the fact they are slow to reproduce, has forced suppliers to look elsewhere. Africa has been badly hit because the animals are such an important part of life for transport and farming - particularly in poorer communities. In Zimbabwe, a ""state-of-the-art"" donkey meat abattoir costing $150,000 (Â£114,000) is due to open in October In many places the price of a donkey has doubled in the past few years, and as thieves cash in, families are left unable to afford a new animal. Water deliveryman Anthony Maupe Wanyama, 29, from Kenya had his donkey Carlos for four years and was doing well. ""I bought land up-country, bought a house, paid school fees and looked after my family,"" said the father of two. This video can not be played 'I woke up and my donkey was gone' He and his donkey were such a part of life in Ongata Rongai, just outside Nairobi, that Anthony's nickname is ""Carlos"". ""I woke up one morning and Carlos was missing. I looked around the area, and then found him dead, his skin had been removed,"" said Anthony, tears rolling down his cheeks as he talked about his much-loved animal. He now rents another donkey to pull a cart-load of blue plastic jerry cans he uses to deliver water, but has to give the owner half of the three or four dollars he makes on a good day. Anthony Wanyama attaches a harness to his rented donkey ""Carlos"", the name of Andrew's dead donkey and the nickname now given to him, is still listed on his cart ""Now I don't have enough money. I haven't paid my rent, I haven't paid school fees, and I have people who depend on me,"" Anthony said. He can't afford to buy a new Carlos. Donkey hides piled up ready for export 1.8m skins are traded every year - according toestimates from UK-based charity The Donkey Sanctuary,external- but the demand is as high as 10m China's donkey population dropped from 11m in 1990 to 3m today, based on government data Ejiao, the gelatine produced by boiling donkey skins, can sell for up to $388 (Â£300) per kilo Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal have banned donkey exports to China The surge in price and demand in Kenya has been encouraged by three donkey abattoirs, which have opened across the country. They can each slaughter around 150 animals a day, packing and freezing the meat and salting the skins for export. At the Star Brilliant Donkey Export Abattoir in Naivasha, the latest arrivals are being dragged onto flat metal scales - they are sold by ""live weight"". Staff lead donkeys to an abattoir in Kenya They are shot in the head with a bolt gun before their meat and skins are processed. Chief executive John Kariuki says he was the first in Kenya, and in Africa, to get official permits to open a donkey slaughterhouse. ""Before, there was no market for the donkeys. People used to sell their cows, people used to sell their goats to pay their school fees for the children,"" he said. ""But now I find that people in the market are selling donkeys more than cows. ""We are happy with the Chinese, because before there was nothing coming from donkeys, but so many people are benefitting from the donkey now today."" Chinese buyers monitor the process - making sure everything is properly packed and prepared. When the skins are boiled, they produce a brown gelatine, which is the essential ingredient in Chinese ""ejiao"" products - popular health foods and traditional medicines. Donkey gelatine - or ejiao - is marketed in a variety of liquid and paste forms But the way donkeys are being treated has been criticised. A British donkey charity and environmental investigative journalists from South Africa-based group Oxpeckers have uncovered cases of animal abuse among those waiting to be killed in appalling conditions. ""This is the biggest crisis donkeys have ever faced,"" said Mike Baker from The Donkey Sanctuary, which is leading an international campaign to halt the trade in donkey products until it can be properly regulated. ""We are seeing millions being taken and we are seeing suffering on the scale I have never witnessed before. A mound of donkey carcasses dumped in Botswana after the animals' flesh was removed ""We are talking about donkeys being starved to death to make it easier to skin them, or bludgeoned to death."" But Mr Baker says the international pressure is starting to have an impact. Countries including Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal have banned China from buying their donkey products. ""Over a dozen governments have now taken action to stop this trade, and that's because they know this is impoverishing their people as well as being massively cruel to animals,"" Mr Baker says. Donkey hides are laid out to dry in Ghana They are being killed on a dramatic scale across the continent - and places further afield like Brazil and Peru. And life is certainly a lot harder for Anthony Wanyama and his family, with rent arrears and unpaid school fees. Many thousands of people trapped by terrible drought have been forced to sell their only assets, while others have lost their donkeys to thieves and can no longer afford to buy another animal.

Spain set for pro-unity rallies,"This video can not be played Thousands gathered at political rallies in Madrid and Barcelona Thousands of people calling for Spanish unity have attended rallies in the capital Madrid after Sunday's disputed referendum for Catalan independence. Other demonstrations - including in the Catalan city Barcelona - have also been held urging political dialogue. Protesters dressed in white gathered with signs saying ""Spain is better than its leaders"" and ""let's talk"". Businesses have continued to announce their departure from the Catalan region amid the ongoing political uncertainty. The Caixa Foundation, which controls one of the Spain's largest banks, announced it was moving its headquarters to Palma de Mallorca while the crisis continues. This video can not be played Voters in Catalonia explain why their reasons for backing or rejecting independence The country is waiting for a speech on Tuesday by Catalan President Carles Puigdemont amid speculation he will declare independence. The final results showed 90% of the 2.3 million people who voted backed independence. Turnout was 43%. There have been several claims of irregularities, and many ballot boxes were seized by the Spanish police. Spain's government representative in Catalonia apologised on Friday to people hurt during police efforts to stop the referendum, but blamed the Catalan government for holding an illegal vote. Enric Millo said he could not help but ""regret it and apologise on behalf of the officers that intervened"", while casting doubt on the numbers said to be injured. Spain eases firms' exit from Catalonia Distressed police officer photo goes viral Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Nearly 900 people were injured as police, trying to enforce a Spanish court ban on the vote, attempted to seize ballot boxes and disperse voters. Thirty-three police officers were also hurt. The Spanish government's official spokesperson, IÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo, also apologised for the police violence and suggested that new elections in Catalonia might be a way to heal the fracture caused by the disputed referendum. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the Catalan parliament on Tuesday at 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT) after Spain's Constitutional Court earlier suspended the Catalan parliament session that had been planned for Monday. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold There is speculation that the parliament will declare independence unilaterally at its next sitting. Meanwhile, the former leader of Catalonia, Artur Mas,told,externalthe Financial Times newspaper that the region was not yet ready for real independence - even though he believed it had won the right to break away. By BBC's James Reynolds, Alicante The competing authorities in Barcelona and Madrid could each take a potentially dramatic step. Barcelona has the option of making a unilateral declaration of independence. For its part, Madrid has the power to dissolve self-rule in Catalonia. Each step - if taken - would provoke a constitutional crisis in Spain. There are some signs that each side may choose to pause. Mr Puigdemont says he will deliver a report to the Catalan parliament on Tuesday about the political situation - a deliberately vague form of words which gives him room for manoeuvre.

"Tory rebels should 'put up, or shut up'","Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has urged colleagues to ""get behind"" the PM because ""people are fed up with this malarkey"". In a WhatsApp message he urged Tories ""talk about nothing except policies"". It comes after ex-party chairman Grant Shapps said about 30 Tory MPs backed his call for a leadership contest. The party's leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, said it should ""get its house in order"", back Theresa May and ""let her get back to governing"". Ms Davidson said critics should ""put up"" and ""shut up"", adding that the calls were not led by anyone ""serious"". The message read: Folks I am away but just read all this! See amber piece this am She is right right right We have JUST HAD AN ELECTION and people are fed up with all this malarkey Get behind the pm. Ordinary punters I have spoken to thought her speech was good and anyone can have a cold Circle the wagons turn the fire on Corbyn and talk about nothing except our great policies and what we can do for the country The prime minister has said she has the ""full support of her cabinet"". Speaking on Friday, she insisted she was providing the ""calm leadership"" the country needed. Laura Kuenssberg: Doubts are now out in open Theresa May says cabinet 'fully behind' her Tories rally round May after speech woes PM struggles through interrupted speech Nigel Evans MP, of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, said Mr Shapps's ""sniping"" was doing the party ""no favours"" and could have a negative impact on Brexit negotiations. Dismissing supporters of a plot to oust Mrs May as ""the coalition of the disappointed"", he told BBC Breakfast: ""Any talents he thinks he's got he should really now direct towards backing Theresa May on the difficult negotiations on Brexit."" Former leadership contender Andrea Leadsom also gave her support to the PM, telling BBC Radio 4's Any Questions: ""Like a lot of my colleagues have said today, [Mr Shapps] should shut up."" This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Look, I've had a cold this week"" Pressure on the prime minister has grown since her party conference speech was plagued by a series of mishaps, as she struggled with a persistent cough and was interrupted by a prankster. Mr Shapps, who was co-chair of the party between 2012 and 2015, said he believed it was ""time we actually tackle this issue of leadership"" adding that ""so do many colleagues"". However, cabinet ministers including Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Home Secretary Amber Rudd were among those who backed the PM on Friday. This video can not be played Former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said Theresa May should face a leadership election Speaking onRadio 4's Political Thinking podcast, Ms Davidson,leader of the Scottish Conservatives, suggested the prime minister's critics should ""put up, shut up and get off the stage"", adding there were ""an awful lot of people in our party who need to settle down"". ""I think if the plotters were serious, they would be led by someone a bit more serious,"" she said. ""One of the irritants over the last couple of days, for me, particularly as a woman, is this idea that all of these men are supposed to be making decisions on Theresa May's behalf,"" she added. ""Well, have they actually met Theresa May? This is a woman with agency, with grit, with determination. ""I backed her in the leadership, I back her now and I will back her in the future."" To trigger a vote of confidence in the party leader, 48 of the 316 Conservative MPs would need to write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. A leadership contest would only be triggered if Mrs May lost that vote, or chose to quit. Mr Shapps said no letter had been sent and that his intention had been to gather signatures privately and persuade Mrs May to stand down. But he claimed party whips had taken the ""extraordinary"" step of making it public by naming him as the ringleader of a plot to oust the PM in a story in the Times. He said: ""The country needs leadership. It needs leadership at this time in particular."" Former minister Ed Vaizey was the first MP to publicly suggest Mrs May should quit on Thursday, telling the BBC: ""I think there will be quite a few people who will now be pretty firmly of the view that she should resign.""

Hospital pays out to abused children,"Myles Bradbury was sentenced to 22 years in prison for abusing child patients A hospital where a doctor abused child patients has said it has paid out Â£611,750 in compensation to victims and their families. Myles Bradbury wasjailed for 22 yearsin December 2014 after admitting abusing 18 victims at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. The hospital said it received 31 claims, 15 of which have been settled. It said the age range of patients was from six to 17. The claims were made over the period of 2014-2017, it said. The information was disclosed by Addenbrooke's Hospital in response to a Freedom of Information request by the BBC. Bradbury, of Herringswell, Suffolk, admitted 25 offences, including sexual assault, voyeurism and possessing more than 16,000 indecent images. Addenbrooke's Hospital said it has paid out Â£611,750 in compensation to Bradbury's patients and their families The blood cancer specialist used a spy pen to take pictures of his victims. It contained 170,425 images of ""boys partially clothed... none indecent"", Cambridge Crown Court heard at the time of his sentencing. The images of his victims, some of whom had haemophilia, leukaemia and other serious illnesses, were gathered at Addenbrooke's Hospital. Samantha Robson, who has represented nine of Bradbury's victims, said some of those cases have been settled with damages awarded between Â£17,500 and Â£30,000. ""To date only a small proportion of the potential victims of Bradbury have come forward. ""The fact that not all of Bradbury's victims were named in the criminal proceedings should not prevent others from coming forward with their claims."" In addition to his jail term, Bradbury was placed on the sex offenders register for life and made subject of a sexual offences prevention order for life. At the time, Addenbrooke's Hospital said it was ""sickened"" by Bradbury's ""abhorrent betrayal and manipulation of his position as a doctor"".
