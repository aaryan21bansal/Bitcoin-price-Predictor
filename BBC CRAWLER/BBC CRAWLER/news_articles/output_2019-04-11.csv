Sturgeon calls for Brexit plan 're-set',"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""What I would like to see now is this issue going back to the people."" Scotland's first minister has urged the government to ""re-set"" its approach to Brexit after the latest delay to the UK's departure from the EU. A ""flexible"" extension of the Brexit deadline until 31 October was agreed at an EU summit on Wednesday night. Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Theresa May to urge the prime minister to ""drop your red lines"" and seek ""genuine consensus"" with opposition parties. Holyrood will not be recalled now that the extension has been agreed. Scottish Parliament Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh had warned MSPs they would be required from 13:00 on Thursday if the UK was due to leave the EU without a deal on Friday. However, following the announcement of the extension, Mr Macintosh said a recall was no longer necessary. Brexit: UK and EU agree delay until 31 October Live: May to face MPs after EU summit Q&A: European elections in Scotland The six-month extension was agreed after late-night talks in Brussels, and averts the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal on Friday. MPs remain deadlocked on what to do, having repeatedly rejected Mrs May's plan and a range of other alternative suggestions. Ministers are now holding talks with the Labour opposition to see if a compromise can be found. European Council president Donald Tusk said the UK could still sign off the government's negotiated deal, or choose to ""cancel Brexit altogether"". He added: ""This extension is as flexible as I expected, and a little bit shorter than I expected, but it's still enough to find the best possible solution. Please do not waste this time."" Mrs May, who had wanted a shorter delay, said the UK would still aim to leave the EU as soon as possible. European Council President Donald Tusk, Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, Theresa May, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Costa at the summit in Brussels In a letter to the prime minister, Ms Sturgeon welcomed the outcome of the summit, and said it was ""essential that this time is used constructively and not wasted"". She said: ""We now have the gift of more time from the EU, and that must be used constructively to re-set the UK government approach. Your ongoing talks with the leader of the opposition should now broaden to include other parties, the devolved administrations, business and civic society, and open up the range of options on the table in an effort to reach a genuine consensus. ""Fundamentally, the Scottish government considers that any deal agreed by the UK parliament should be put to another referendum, with the alternative proposition on the ballot paper being to remain in the EU. ""The extension to 31 October provides enough time to do this, and it is essential that no time is lost in making the necessary preparations."" Speaking on BBC radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said Mrs May was determined to leave the EU by 30 June. He said: ""We're not leaving the EU tomorrow on the basis of no deal. I think everyone, certainly in Scotland, is in agreement that leaving the EU on Friday would not have been a good outcome."" Mr Mundell added: ""She [Theresa May] wants to deliver Brexit by 22 May so that we don't have to have the European elections and there is still an opportunity to do that. ""If we can, as I would hope - because these talks seem to be serious - get some form of agreement with the Labour Party, then it would be possible to ratify the withdrawal agreement by 22 May and leave by then, and it would still be possible also to leave by 30 June."" European Council President Donald Tusk (right) said the extension was ""enough to find the best possible solution"" The prime minister had earlier told leaders she wanted to move the UK's exit date from Friday of this week to 30 June, with the option of leaving earlier if her withdrawal agreement was ratified by parliament. Following the extension announcement, she said that although the delay extends until 31 October, the UK can leave before then if MPs pass her withdrawal deal. ""I know that there is huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension,"" she said. ""The UK should have left the EU by now and I sincerely regret the fact that I have not yet been able to persuade parliament to approve a deal."" Mrs May added: ""I do not pretend the next few weeks will be easy, or there is a simple way to break the deadlock in parliament. But we have a duty as politicians to find a way to fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. ""Nothing is more pressing or more vital."" The PM said that the UK ""will continue to hold full membership rights and obligations [of the EU]"" during the delay. A Brexit extension ""only as long as necessary"" and ""no longer than 31 October"" to allow for the ratification of the withdrawal agreement The UK ""must hold the elections to the European Parliament"" and if it fails to do this, the UK will leave on 1 June The European Council reiterates there can be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement negotiations Read the EU's conclusions here.,external New Brexit deadline set for 31 October Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

Speedboat killer jailed after fleeing UK,"This video can not be played Charlotte Brown's sister Katie made a tearful statement outside court after Shepherd was sentenced A man who killed a woman in a speedboat crash has been jailed for an extra six months for fleeing the country. Jack Shepherd fled before he was sentenced to six years for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown, who died in the crash on the River Thames. He returned to the UK on Wednesday night after 10 months on the run. Shepherd, 31, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to breaching bail and absconding and was sent to prison to begin his six-and-a-half-year sentence. Judge Richard Marks said: ""Charlotte's family were, of course, devastated by the circumstances by which she met her death, and those feelings were greatly exacerbated by the fact you chose to go on the run. ""Your conduct in absenting yourself from justice for so long was as cowardly as it was selfish."" This video can not be played Speaking on the plane back from Georgia, Jack Shepherd said he regretted going on the run Speaking outside court, Ms Brown's father Graham said the family felt ""a sense of relief"". He said: ""Due to Shepherd's recklessness and negligent actions Charlotte isn't here to defend herself."" Her sister Katie said Shepherd had ""continued to prolong our agony, making wild accusations against our family"". She said his ""lack of respect and decency still continues to astound us"". Charlotte Brown died in December 2015 when Shepherd took her on a date on his speedboat Defence barrister Andrew McGee said Shepherd had travelled to Georgia in March last year. He said he had travelled ""under his own name, using his own passport"" before he handed himself in to police in Tbilisi in January. Mr McGee said Shepherd was ""overwhelmed by his fear"" of a prison sentence. He added: ""It [absconding] was not deliberately callous or cavalier. It was not cynical or calculated."" By Helena Lee, BBC News Correspondent at the Old Bailey Charlotte Brown's family - her mother, father and two sisters - were just metres away from the glass dock and got a clear view of Jack Shepherd when he was brought in by two guards. They glanced over at him. He, though, didn't look at them or up at the public gallery. Instead he stared ahead and listened as Judge Richard Marks told him his deliberate decision to go on the run hugely added to the distress of Charlotte's family. The family had been waiting months for this day to come, the day they got to see the man convicted of Charlotte's manslaughter finally start serving his sentence. Judge Marks said Shepherd was in contact with his lawyers from his ""hideaway"" during legal proceedings. He added: ""You were, in effect, having your cake and eating it. That is not how our system of justice is supposed to work."" Shepherd's boat was found to have several defects During his trial, jurors heard that Shepherd and Ms Brown went on a late-night high-speed jaunt in his boat past the Houses of Parliament on their first date on 8 December 2015. The pair were both thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water near Wandsworth Bridge. Ms Brown, from Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, was found in the water unconscious and unresponsive, while Shepherd was discovered clinging to the upturned boat. His trial was told that he was responsible for the speedboat, which had a series of serious defects, including to its steering. Thames speedboat killer arrives in UK The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Speedboat killer hands himself in to police Shepherd, originally from Exeter, last appeared at the Old Bailey in January last year when he denied manslaughter and was released on unconditional bail. But he failed to show up for his trial and sentencing in July. Shepherd has since been grantedthe right to appeal against his conviction.

Woman freed after Dubai horse insult,"Laleh Shahravesh was arrested in Dubai when she arrived with her teenage daughter Paris for her ex-husband's funeral A British woman who faced prison in Dubai for calling her ex-husband's new wife a ""horse"" on Facebook has been released, the campaign group which represents her has said. Laleh Shahravesh, 55, was arrested at a Dubai airport after flying to the city to attend her ex-husband's funeral. The Detained in Dubai groupsaid the case had been settled,externalwith a AED3,000 (Â£625) fine after a hearing. Ms Shahravesh is expected to be home by next week, it added in a statement. The mother-of-one, from Richmond in south-west London, was married to her Portuguese husband Pedro for 18 years. The couple lived together in Dubai for eight months - where Pedro worked for HSBC - before Ms Shahravesh returned alone to the UK with the couple's daughter. In 2016, she received divorce papers and discovered on Facebook that Pedro was remarrying.

Jackie Bird leaves Reporting Scotland,"This video can not be played The audience did not know it, but here is Jackie Bird delivering her final headlines and goodbye on her last Reporting Scotland Jackie Bird, the BBC's face of news in Scotland for the past three decades, has left Reporting Scotland. She has been the main face of the BBC Scotland programme since 1989 but fronted her last bulletin at 18:30 on Wednesday night. She left the studio with only a few close colleagues aware that she had presented her final programme. ""I'm not leaving the BBC, I'm just vacating the news desk,"" the presenter said. Ms Bird said she had been fortunate to cover most of the major news stories in Scotland over the past three decades. They included the Lockerbie bombing in 1988 and Dunblane school shootings in 1996. The journalist was also at the forefront of coverage of the devolution referendum in 1997 and more recently the Scottish independence referendum. This video can not be played Jackie Bird's 30 years with BBC Scotland She said: ""I've been planning this for a while. I thought I'd give it until Brexit was sorted, but I fear I might have to stay for another 30 years. ""I've been privileged to be involved in so many memorable news events, from seismic political changes to reporting live from Afghanistan. ""I've presented the programme from Washington to Westminster and last year anchoring from France on the centenary of the Armistice was an honour. ""None of this would have been possible without some tremendous colleagues - and it's them that I will miss most, but it's time to move on."" A newspaper announces a new face on the BBC's nightly news programme Jackie Bird reported from the scene of the Dunblane shootings in 1996 The popular host, who shares Reporting Scotland presenting duties with Sally Magnusson, also fronts many annual Scottish TV events such as Hogmanay, Children in Need and the World Pipe Band contest for the BBC. She said she wanted to have more time to present, write and produce projects outside of news in future. Covering the story of Scottish devolution in 1997 The presenter also fronts annual TV events in Scotland including Children in Need BBC Scotland's head of news, Gary Smith, said: ""Jackie is one of the most talented and committed journalists I've ever worked with. Her passion and energy for the job are unsurpassed. ""As a TV news presenter, she is the ultimate professional, who copes supremely well with whatever comes her way. She's also great fun. For many in the newsroom - and the audience across the country - she just IS Reporting Scotland."" BBC Scotland director Donalda MacKinnon also paid tribute and said Ms Bird had been a trailblazer for female colleagues at a time when journalism was dominated by men. She said: ""I've had the pleasure of working with Jackie for many years now and it's been very reassuring for me and for many of us that she's been at the helm of the country's most watched news programme. ""She's a brilliant journalist and multi-talented broadcaster who will, I hope, continue to work with us here at BBC Scotland. ""She was an inspiration to many female colleagues particularly during her earlier years when newsrooms were largely dominated by men. I am certain that she will continue to inspire and influence in all she does next."" Jackie Bird in final Reporting Scotland goodbye.

Emmerdale star fired over old tweets,"Shila Iqbal briefly played Aiesha Richards Actress Shila Iqbal has been fired from Emmerdale over historical offensive tweets, ITV has confirmed. The star, who played Aiesha Richards on the soap, was only made a series regular at the end of March. She said she was ""terribly sorry"" for using ""inappropriate language"" in tweets sent in 2013, when she was 19. ""As a consequence of historic social media posts, Shila Iqbal has left her role as Aiesha Richards on Emmerdale,"" a spokesperson for the show said. ""The programme took the decision not to renew her contract as soon as these posts were brought to the company's attention."" ITV would not confirm what she had said in the messages, and the 24-year-old has deleted her Twitter account. In a statement, she said: ""I am terribly sorry and take full responsibility for my use of such inappropriate language. I have paid the price and can no longer continue the job I loved the most at Emmerdale. ""Although I was young when I made the tweets, it was still completely wrong of me to do so and I sincerely apologise."" She added: ""The only consideration I would ask is that I have recently received hateful tweets telling me that as a Muslim my Emmerdale role means that I am 'committing sinful acts, promoting sin and deliberately going against the Quran'. ""We live in sensitive times for members of all communities and especially those in multi-racial Rochdale, where I grew up. I regret that I too have let people down by the use of such language, albeit six years ago. ""I, like everyone else, have a responsibility about the language I have used on social media as well as in conversation."" She's the latest in a string of high-profile figures to find old tweets coming back to haunt them. Last month, an actress playing a gay character in a stage production of The Color Purplewas sacked over homophobic commentsshe made five years ago. Seyi Omooba, who was due to play the lead role of Celie, claimed the Bible made clear homosexuality was wrong in the eyes of God and that people could not be born gay.

Wrong-way crash driver 'had brain cancer',"The crash happened in October between junctions six and seven of the M40 in Oxfordshire A man who caused a fatal crash by going the wrong way on the M40 was probably suffering from confusion brought on by cancer in his brain, a coroner said. John Norton, 80, was driving a Subaru towing a caravan on 15 October when it collided head-on with a Ford Mondeo driven by 32-year-old Stuart Richards. Both men and Mr Norton's passenger, Olive Howard, 87, died in the crash. An inquest in Oxford heard he travelled south on the northbound carriageway for about four miles before the accident. Witness statements read by Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter described cars flashing their lights, using their horns, and swerving to avoid the Subaru. Despite this Mr Norton continued in the third lane between junctions six and seven, driving at between 60mph and 70mph, and did not attempt to stop or slow down, he said. Mr Salter told the hearing at Oxford Coroner's Court that according to friends the retired banker, who lived with Mrs Howard in High Wycombe, had been acting confused in the days before the crash. Stuart Richards, from Stockport in Greater Manchester, was killed in the crash Mr Norton also crashed into a parked car on 10 October, and its owner said he was ""not fit to drive"" when he reported it to the police. Mr Norton was diagnosed with bladder cancer three years before, which a post-mortem examination showed had spread to his brain, Mr Salter said. He said this could have caused ""impaired cognitive function"", such as making it harder for him to recognise hazards. In February - at the same junction - another driver joined the motorway in the wrong direction and new temporary signs have now been installed. Mrs Howard's cousin Peter Weatherill said the second incident ""highlights that more needs to be done than just putting up a couple of signs"". Mr Salter said he would write to Highways England and Oxfordshire County Council to ask what permanent measures would be put in place at the junction. The Independent Office for Police Complaints investigated how Thames Valley Police handled the earlier complaint into Mr Norton's driving and determined it had followed proper procedures.Â A second car was spotted driving the wrong way between junctions six and seven in February New signs to stop wrong-way M40 drivers Wrong-way car seen near M40 crash site Police 'warned' about wrong-way driver Three dead in wrong-way M40 caravan crash The coroner - Oxfordshire County Council Thames Valley Police Comedian Russell Brand hit with fine after failing to appear at court Abingdon man captured by police after warrant for failure to appear in court Oxfordshire farmer says Governmentâs new deal 'a load of rubbish' Banbury Sewing Centre set to close next month after over 40 years of business Police warn of disruption in city centre as farming protest gets underway Yellow weather warning in place for ice in Oxfordshire Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

Amputee baby 'failed by system',"This video can not be played Four-year-old Tony Hudgell has been learning to walk with prosthetic limbs A boy who had both legs amputated as a result of neglect by his birth parents was ""failed by the system"", his adoptive mother has said. Tony Hudgell, from Kings Hill, Kent, was a five-week-old baby when he was injured so badly he lost both limbs. Paula Hudgell now wants an independent review of aserious case review,externalby Kent's safeguarding children board. The review, published on Thursday, found there was no evidence professionals missed signs of abuse. Jody Simpson (left) and Tony Smith have been jailed for 10 years Birth parents Jody Simpson, and Tony Smith, from Whitstable, who wereconvicted of causing the injuries, are serving 10-year jail terms. Mrs Hudgell said she believed facts had been omitted about Simpson's and Smith's histories. She also alleged there were unacceptable delays in assessments. ""I still feel that Tony was very, very badly let down by the system,"" she said. Tony's adoptive parents say he has grown into a happy, bubbly boy Listing key events, the review said there was an ""unexplained three-month delay"" in referring the family to social workers. It found there was no evidence a pre-birth assessment was planned or carried out. The report, which described Tony Hudgell as ""Child J"", said while Smith was known to be on heroin replacement therapy, there was no evidence a risk assessment was undertaken with regard to his drug use. The report concluded: ""There is currently no evidence that professionals in direct contact with the family missed signs of abuse to Child J. ""It was only following the criminal trial that the full extent of the injuries and their impact on Child J was realised and made known.""

Sudan protesters defy military curfew,"This video can not be played Anti-Bashir protesters celebrate Defiant crowds have spent the night on the streets of Sudan's capital, Khartoum, ignoring a curfew declared by the military. Long-time President Omar al-Bashir was overthrown and arrested on Thursday after months of street protests. But demonstrators say the military council which has taken power is part of the same regime. The fresh stand-off has raised fears of a violent confrontation between protesters and the army. There is also a real danger that different elements of the security forces and militia could turn their guns on each other, says BBC World Service Africa editor Will Ross. The UN and the African Union have both called for calm. Africa Live: Latest updates amid turmoil Sudan's unrest in 300 words How Sudan's strongmen stayed in power Sudan is due to reopen its airspace on Friday, following a 24-hour suspension, but land and maritime borders will remain closed, the military council has said. The curfew, in force from 22:00 local time (20:00 GMT) to 04:00, was declared for the ""safety"" of citizens, state media said. The armed forces and the security council would carry out their ""duty to uphold peace and security and protect citizens' livelihoods"", it said. Thousands of people were still camped outside military headquarters on Friday and the crowd was reportedly growing. Thursday's mood of celebration after news of Mr Bashir's arrest evaporated when organisers called for the mass sit-in to continue. ""This is a continuation of the same regime,"" said Sara Abdeljalil of the Sudanese Professionals' Association (SPA). ""So what we need to do is to continue the fight and the peaceful resistance."" An SPA statement said that ""those who destroyed the country and killed the people are seeking to steal every drop of blood and sweat that the Sudanese people poured in their revolution that shook the throne of tyranny"". The SPA has previously said that any transitional administration must not include anyone from the ""tyrannical regime"". Crowds waved flags and chanted ""Fall, again!"" - refashioning their previous anti-Bashir slogan of ""Fall, that's all!"". Early on Thursday, military vehicles entered the large compound in Khartoum housing the defence ministry, the army headquarters and Mr Bashir's personal residence. State TV and radio interrupted programming and Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf announced ""the toppling of the regime"". He said Mr Bashir was being held ""in a secure place"" but did not give details. This video can not be played The announcement was made by the defence minister Awad Ibn Auf Mr Ibn Auf said the country had been suffering from ""poor management, corruption, and an absence of justice"" and he apologised ""for the killing and violence that took place"". He said the army would oversee a two-year transitional period followed by elections. Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? The minister also said a three-month state of emergency was being put in place, with the constitution  suspended. Before the coup, Mr Ibn Auf was Mr Bashir's first vice-president and defence minister, and was regarded as being well placed to succeed him. During the Darfur conflict at the beginning of the century, he was head of military intelligence andthe US imposed sanctions on him in 2007,externalin relation to his alleged support of the Janjaweed militia blamed for atrocities there. This is a military coup with no clear roadmap for how the generals plan to hand over power to civilian rule. The fear will be that they have no such intention. The security elite has calculated that removing Omar al-Bashir and imposing a curfew will buy them time and end the protests. If so, this represents a serious miscalculation. The SPA and other civil society groups have made it clear they won't accept a cosmetic change. They have the numbers and are highly organised. The military has the guns and the capacity for imposing brutal repression. But what then? A crackdown will not resolve the desperate economic crisis that brought years of simmering resentment on to the streets last December. There is also the question of the cracks within the Sudanese security establishment, evident during the clashes between soldiers and intelligence/militia forces in recent days. It is a volatile and unpredictable situation that demands cool heads and compromise on the part of the military. The stability of Sudan depends on how they react to continued protests. It is not yet clear what will happen to the 75-year-old, who is now in custody. He is the subject of two international arrest warrants,externalissued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which accuses him of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur between 2003 and 2008. There are, according to the ICC, ""reasonable grounds"" to believe that he ""acted with specific intent to destroy in part the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa ethnic groups"". Mr Bashir's rule was marked by civil war. A conflict with the south of the country ended in 2005 and South Sudan became independent in 2011. Omar al-Bashir profile Demonstrations against his rule began in December, triggered by a rise in the cost of living, and at least 38 people died in the unrest. The former army officer himself came to power in 1989 through a military coup. UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres appealed for ""calm and utmost restraint by all"" and urged a transition that would meet the ""democratic aspirations"" of the people. The UN Security Council is to discuss the situation in a closed-door meeting on Friday. UK Foreign SecretaryJeremy Hunt said that a two-year military council was ""not the answer"",externaland called for a ""swift move to an inclusive, representative, civilian leadership"". This video can not be played Sudan protests: So what's going on? The African Union condemned the military takeover, saying it was not an appropriate response to the challenges facing Sudan and the aspirations of its people. Russia, which twice hosted Mr Bashir despite the international travel ban he faced, called for calm and said it was monitoring the situation. Amnesty International's Secretary General Kumi Naidoo said that justice was ""long overdue"" for Mr Bashir.

Aamir Siddiqi was hacked to deathat his home in Roath, Cardiff, in April 2010 after his killers Jason Richards and Ben Hope went to the wrong house. Mohammed Ali Ege, 41, from Cardiff, was arrested in India in 2011 on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. South Wales Police believe Mr Ege is getting financial support ""possibly from within south Wales"". Speaking on the ninth anniversary of Aamir's murder, Det Ch Insp Paul Giess said Mr Ege was ""Wales' most wanted"". He added: ""We are doing everything possible in our power with the assistance of international law enforcement to get him."" Police in Wales are still waiting to question Mohammed Ali Ege about Aamir Siddiqi's murder Mr Ege escaped on 12 April 2017 while in a New Delhi railway station toilet as officers prepared to extradite him from India back to the UK. Aamir was killed after Richards and Hope, who were high on heroin, targeted the wrong house. They burst into Aamir's home wearing balaclavas and screeching and stabbed him in the hallway - his parents fought the attackers in vain as they tried to save their son. South Wales Police is working with the National Crime Agency and international law enforcement agencies to track down Mr Ege and return him to the UK. The force also said officers had executed search warrants at addresses in Cardiff in recent weeks. Ben Hope and Jason Richards were convicted of murder at Swansea Crown Court Det Ch Insp Giess said: ""From our ongoing investigation to trace him we know that he has travelled. ""We also know that he has changed his appearance and has access to different identification which would allow him to travel extensively on false documentation. ""The false documents which were recovered at the time of his arrest in India were of high quality and would cost a substantial amount to produce, indicating that he is being supported financially, possibly from within south Wales. ""We will pursue anyone who is assisting Ege or who has supported him previously."" Police commander Mahendra Kumar Rathod told newspapers at the time of Mr Ege's escape: ""The accused requested the police to allow him to go to the washroom, and he escaped from there by removing the window grills of the washroom.""

Stormzy cancels gig over weapon search,"Stormzy's cancelled his gig at Snowbombing festival in Austria after claiming members of his team had been racially profiled. He was expected to perform on Thursday night, but organisers announced he would no longer be appearing. In an Instagram story the rapper claimed his team were targeted while security were looking for a weapon. Organisers of the gig said they were sad that he had cancelled and that they had acted in accordance to protocol. Stormzy explained on his Instagram story why he pulled out of the gig The grime artist told his fans he had to cancel the gig to make a point about racism and racial profiling. He accused the security team of being aggressive while searching some of his team. ""My manager and all my friends who were at the festival were racially profiled, targeted and aggressively handled because they had reason to believe someone was carrying a weapon."" He added: ""The security targeted them (despite no one fitting the description), were physically aggressive when handling them and there's been no effort from the festival to actually deal and address the problem."" The festival confirmed to Radio 1 Newsbeat that his team were not escorted off the premises and Stormzy was not on-site at the time of the incident. In a statement on its website,externalthe festival said they were alerted to a possible security threat that an individual might have been carrying a weapon. Organisers explain that: ""A small number of attendees, including Stormzy's manager were escorted to the nearest exit, searched and no weapon was found."" Allow Twitter content?

The festival apologised to Stormzy and his team and added: ""We are doing everything we can to understand the full situation and are treating this with the utmost seriousness to ensure this does not happen again."" People at the festival were only told about the cancellation a few hours before Stormzy was due to perform, via an app that cost attendees Â£3 to download. ""To be honest, if what Stormzy says is true, I kind of see his reasoning for pulling out. No-one wants to tolerate racial abuse,"" says Chris, who's been in Mayrhofen for Snowbombing since Monday. ""Obviously it's bad for his fans that he left it until the day to pull out, but if he had no other choice, he's got to stand by what he believes in at the end of the day."" Stormzy also told his fans he was sorry for wasting their time and money. ""Again, deeply sorry to everyone who came but I need you to understand why this is necessary in the grand scheme of trying to fight back against racism."" Stormzy was due to headline Snowbombing alongside The Prodigy and Groove Armada. The Prodigy were replaced by a Chase & Status tribute show to The Prodigy, followingthe death of frontman Keith Flint. Groove Armada played in the early hours of Monday morning, before Chris and most other festival-goers had arrived at Snowbombing. Newsbeat has contacted Stormzy for further comment.

Doctors call for drug supply clarity,"Doctors' leaders have raised concerns over a lack of clarity about drug availability highlighted by no-deal Brexit planning. The British Medical Association (BMA) warns ""a culture of secrecy"" could undermine the ability of medics to plan care and deliver treatment. Confidential NHS England files, seen by Newsnight, suggest supply chain issues mean some drugs ""cannot be stockpiled"". The government said it has been ""as transparent as possible"". With political discussions continuing and EU leaders having agreeda six-month extension to Brexit,the Department for Health has been co-ordinating work across the sector, involving the NHS, pharmaceutical companies and others to prepare for a no-deal Brexit scenario. ""Stockpiling is just one part of our multi-layered approach to minimise any supply disruption, which includes alternative transport routes,"" a spokesman said. ""We are confident that, if everyone does what they need to do, the supply of medicines should be uninterrupted in the event of a no deal."" The BMA, which represents doctors across the UK, said it was vital for patient safety that medics were informed about which drugs were being stockpiled and which might be affected by a no-deal Brexit. ""Only if there is clarity on the availability of medicines can GPs, consultants, pharmacists, nurses and health care professionals plan and deliver effective patient care,"" said Dr Andrew Green, the BMA's GP committee clinical and prescribing lead. ""If doctors and patients are left in the dark, healthcare professionals are left not knowing what drugs are available to be prescribed, what alternatives there may be and for how long."" 'Steep rise' in epilepsy meds shortage 'Unprecedented' drug shortage linked to Brexit Call for drugs export ban to protect NHS The comments followa Newsnight report about an internal NHS England document,,externalwhich detailed concerns about several drugs which pharmaceutical companies have been unable to stockpile. In January, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government had asked firms to stockpile a six-week supply of all drugs which do not have a short shelf life. This would provide continuity of care in the event of any supply problems caused by a no-deal Brexit. However, the internal document listed several drugs which had been impossible to stockpile because of problems including ""capacity constraints"" and ""disruption in production"". There is no suggestion that any supply disruption has been caused directly by Brexit. Consultant neurologist Dr David Nicholl said documents he was sent ""should be in the public domain"" The password-protected document, marked ""official sensitive"" and ""strictly confidential"", was shared with a handful of senior doctors. One of those who received the file was Dr David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist at University Hospitals Birmingham, who was sent the documents in March. He decided to breach his agreement to keep the information confidential, telling Newsnight it ""should be in the public domain"". ""There's nothing that I've seen in those documents that actually justifies them being confidentially held. In fact, this problem could have been sorted out a lot more easily some months ago, if the documents had been more widely shared,"" Dr Nicholl said. The Department of Health and Social Care suggests that sharing such information could lead to people considering local stockpiling, which could cause shortages. It said that it and the NHS have ""consistently shared all relevant no-deal plans with clinicians and stakeholder groups"". But other patient organisations and charities echoed the BMA's concerns over a lack of transparency about the potential shortages of some drugs, which included some medicines used to treat epilepsy. Epilepsy Action chief executive Philip Lee said the government needed to be ""more transparent at this critical time"". ""The added uncertainty the Brexit process brings only increases the concerns of patients, doctors and charities,"" he added. Dr Nicola Strickland, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said the assumption was that all drugs were being stockpiled. ""It would be very reassuring for our patients and for our doctors actually to be given a list of which drugs are being stockpiled, and whether any of them are not,"" she said. The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, said: ""We have been involved in regular discussions with NHS England, NHS Improvement, the Department of Health and Social Care as well as our members in NHS trusts across the country and we've not yet heard any details of medicine shortages related to Brexit.""

"Bird nets an 'atrocity', says Packham","This video can not be played The RSPB feared there was a risk of birds getting stuck in the netting and dying Nets installed on sea cliffs to prevent sand martins nesting are an ""atrocity"", TV naturalist Chris Packham has said. North Norfolk Council put them up in Bacton to encourage the birds to nest elsewhere - work has since started to remove the nets. The birds have flown half way around the world from Africa to return to sites they know have the resources they need to breed, the broadcaster said. He said the council was now undoing a problem that ""should never have been"". ""Every spring I see them flying over my house, probably on their way to north Norfolk,"" Packham said. ""The birds arrive exhausted to sites they know have resources to sustain them. To survive, birds will have up to three broods because predation and disease cuts numbers. ""They will not have energy or time to find new sites so many may fail to breed."" Why are nets appearing over trees and hedges? Packham welcomed protests by members of the public on social media. Work has started to remove the nets The RSPB has welcomed the nets' removal but has other concerns about the sand martins. A scheme to lay down sand to prevent erosion will see beach levels rise by 25ft (7m), leaving the birds' nests in danger of being swamped, the RSPB said. Campaigners staged a protest at the cliffs on Tuesday evening The nets stretch for just under a mile (1.3km) along the beach where sea defences are being installed, but the RSPB wants this reduced to a 160ft (50m) section. ""The onus is on North Norfolk District Council to make the final decision for the birds' sake,"" spokesman Fabian Harrison said. A council spokesman said the scheme was ""designed to protect hundreds of homes in Bacton and Walcott, as well as Bacton Gas Terminal"".

Sudan military coup topples Bashir,"This video can not be played The announcement was made by the defence minister Awad Ibn Auf Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has been ousted and arrested by the military after nearly 30 years in power. Speaking on state TV, defence minister Awad Ibn Auf said the army would oversee a two-year transitional period followed by elections. He also said a three-month state of emergency was being put in place. Protesters, however, have vowed to stay on the streets despite an overnight curfew being imposed by the military. Demonstrations against Mr Bashir, who has governed Sudan since 1989, have been taking place for several months. The protesters are now demanding a civilian council to lead the transition rather than a military one, correspondents say. Sudan's unrest in 300 words Bashir ousted: Five significant moments ""I announce as minister of defence the toppling of the regime and detaining its chief in a secure place,"" Mr Ibn Auf said in a statement. Mr Bashir's exact whereabouts are not known. Mr Ibn Auf said the country had been suffering from ""poor management, corruption, and an absence of justice"" and he apologised ""for the killing and violence that took place"". Some people celebrated in Khartoum after the army announcement He said Sudan's constitution was being suspended, border crossings were being shut until further notice and airspace was being closed for 24 hours. Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? As the news broke, crowds of protesters celebrated outside army headquarters in the capital, Khartoum, embracing soldiers and climbing on top of armoured vehicles. Sudan's intelligence service said it was freeing all political prisoners. Anti-government protesters have been cheering the military Mr Bashir is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which accuses him of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan's western Darfur region. However it is not clear what will happen to him following his arrest. This is a military coup with no clear roadmap for how the generals plan to hand over power to civilian rule. The fear will be that they have no such intention. The security elite has calculated that removing Omar al-Bashir and imposing a curfew will buy them time and end the protests. If so this represents a serious miscalculation. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) - which has spearheaded the demonstrations - and other civil society groups have made it clear they  won't accept a cosmetic change.

It is a volatile and unpredictable situation that demands cool heads and compromise on the part of the military. The stability of Sudan depends on how they react to continued protests. Early on Thursday, military vehicles entered the large compound in Khartoum housing the defence ministry, the army headquarters and Mr Bashir's personal residence. State TV and radio later interrupted programming to say the army would be making a statement. Omar al-Bashir has been in power since 1989 Meanwhile, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through central Khartoum, some chanting: ""It has fallen, we won."" The SPA said the military had announced a ""coup"" that would merely reproduce the same ""faces and institutions that our great people revolted against"". It urged people to continue the sit-in outside military headquarters and to stay on the streets of cities across the country. ""Those who destroyed the country and killed the people are seeking to steal every drop of blood and sweat that the Sudanese people poured in their revolution that shook the throne of tyranny,"" the statement read. The SPA has previously said that any transitional administration must not include anyone from what it called the ""tyrannical regime"". A young woman who became a symbol of the protests also dismissed the military announcement. Alaa Salah, nicknamed ""Kandaka"" or ""Nubian queen"" after she was filmed leading chants against the government, accused the authorities of ""hoodwinking"" the people. Allow Twitter content?

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed for ""calm and utmost restraint by all"" and urged a transition that would meet the ""democratic aspirations"" of the people. The UN Security Council is to discuss the situation in a closed-door meeting on Friday called by the US, France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Poland, diplomats said. UK Foreign SecretaryJeremy Hunt said that a two-year military council was ""not the answer"",external. ""We need to see a swift move to an inclusive, representative, civilian leadership.  And we need to ensure there's no more violence,"" he said on Twitter. The African Union condemned the military takeover. AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat said it was not an appropriate response to the challenges facing the country and the aspirations of its people. Russia, which has twice hosted Mr Bashir, called for calm and said it was monitoring the situation. Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov expressed hope that bilateral ties would not be damaged, whoever was in power. This video can not be played Sudan protests: So what's going on? Amnesty International's Secretary General Kumi Naidoo praised the courage of the Sudanese people but said he was ""alarmed by the raft of emergency measures"" announced by the military. In a statement, he also said that justice was ""long overdue"" for Mr Bashir. ""Omar al-Bashir is wanted for some of the most odious human rights violations of our generation and we need to finally see him held accountable,"" Mr Naidoo added. Formerly an army officer, he seized power in a military coup in 1989. His rule has been marked by civil war. The civil conflict with the south of the country ended in 2005 and South Sudan became independent in 2011. Another civil conflict has been taking place in the western region of Darfur. Mr Bashir is accused of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity there by the ICC. Read profile Despite an international arrest warrant issued by the ICC, he won consecutive elections in 2010 and 2015. However, his last victory was marred by a boycott by the main opposition parties. The arrest warrant has led to an international travel ban.

Ex-Pope blames 1960s revolution for sex abuse,"Benedict XVI was Pope from 2005 until 2013 Retired Pope Benedict XVI has published a letter which blames clerical sex abuse on the ""all-out sexual freedom"" of the 1960s. He said that cultural and historical change had led to a ""dissolution"" of morality in Catholicism. The sexual revolution in the 1960s had led to homosexuality and paedophilia in Catholic establishments, he claimed. The letter sparked fierce criticism from theologians who claim it is ""deeply flawed"". Vatican expert Joshua McElwee said in theNational Catholic Reporter,external: ""It does not address structural issues that abetted abuse cover-up, or Benedict's own contested 24-year role as head of the Vatican's powerful doctrinal office."" Some allegations of child sex abuse by priests that have emerged date back to decades before the 1960s, the decade that Pope Benedict claims sparked the abuse crisis. Julie Rubio, a Catholic theologian, said in a tweet that the letter was ""profoundly troubling"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It is rare for Pope Benedict, who in 2013 wasthe first to resign in almost 600 years, to intervene in clerical matters. He had been accused of failing to protect children and suppressing investigations,allegations he denied. The only solution to the problem, the former Pope said, was ""obedience and love for our Lord Jesus Christ"". World Catholic sex abuse scandals Sex abuse and the Catholic Church His analysis of the sex abuse scandals that have rocked the Roman Catholic Church takes a more theological and historical approach than Pope Francis. Pope Francis at a summit on protecting minors in the church in February 2019 At a summit in February,the current pontiff called for ""concrete measures""to tackle the crisis, not just ""simple and obvious condemnations"". As he had ""served in a position of responsibility as shepherd of the church"" when more cases emerged, Pope Benedict said he wanted to ""contribute to a new beginning"". Published in the German Catholic magazine Klerusblatt, the 5,500-word letter is divided into three parts. The first part presents the ""wider social context of the question"", lamenting the 1960s as a time when ""previously normative standards regarding sexuality collapsed entirely"". He blames sexual films, images of nudity and ""the clothing of that time"" leading to ""mental collapse"" and ""violence"". At the time of the sexual revolution, ""Catholic moral theology suffered a collapse that rendered the Church defenceless against these changes in society"", he said. The sexual revolution led to paedophilia being ""diagnosed as allowed and appropriate"". Next, the letter examines how this period affected the ""dissolution of the Christian concept of morality"", particularly in Catholic educational institutions. In some cases, bishops ""sought to bring about a kind of new, modern"" Catholicism and the sexual revolution led to ""homosexual cliques"" in seminaries. Pope Francis compares sex abuse to human sacrifice He claimed one bishop showed his students pornographic films to make them ""resistant to behaviour contrary to the faith"". ""The question of paedophilia, as I recall, did not become acute until the second half of the 1980s,"" he said. The letter concludes by advocating a return to faith. ""Why did paedophilia reach such proportions?"" he questions. ""Ultimately, the reason is the absence of God."" Pope Benedict XVI giving a farewell before retiring due to ill health in February 2013 He says ""the death of God in a society"" means ""the end of freedom"" and the solution is to ""live by God and unto Him"". Finally, Pope Benedict thanks his replacement, Pope Francis, ""for everything he does to show us, again and again, the light of God, which has not disappeared, even today"". Pope condemns sex abuse 'atrocities' Pope Francis saidin a letter in published in 2018that the Church ""did not act in a timely manner"" on the issue of child sexual abuse, and ""showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them"".

First private mission fails to land on moon,"One of the last photos taken by Beresheet of the moon's surface before it crashed The first privately funded mission to the Moon has crashed on the lunar surface after the apparent failure of its main engine. The Israeli spacecraft - called Beresheet - attempted a soft touchdown, but suffered technical problems on its descent to the lunar surface. The aim of the mission was to take pictures and conduct experiments. Only government space agencies from the former Soviet Union, the US and China have achieved soft lunar landings. Israel hoped to become the fourth country to do this. ""We didn't make it, but we definitely tried,"" said project originator and major backer Morris Kahn. ""I think that the achievement of getting to where we got is really tremendous; I think we can be proud,"" he said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, watching from the control room near Tel Aviv, said: ""If at first you don't succeed, you try again."" After a seven-week  journey to the Moon, the robotic spacecraft approached a final orbit at 15km (9 miles) from the surface. Tensions were high in the command centre as communications were lost before Opher Doron, the general manager of Israel Aerospace Industries' space division, announced there had been a failure in the spacecraft. ""We unfortunately have not managed to land successfully,"" he said. There was disappointment in the crowd following events from outside the control room in Yehud The audience outside had been through a turbulent journey themselves as they watched the first part of the landing go to plan. As Mr Doron announced that the engine had cut out, groans filled the room. ""We are resetting the spacecraft to try to enable the engine,"" he said. The engine came on seconds later and the audience applauded, only for communication with the spacecraft to be lost shortly after. The mission was over. The project has cost about $100m (Â£76m) and has paved the way for future low-cost lunar exploration. Dr Kimberly Cartier, an astronomer and science news reporter, tweeted that she was ""sad about how #Beresheet ended"" but ""proud of the entire @TeamSpaceIL"". Allow Twitter content?

Beresheet, which is Hebrew for ""in the beginning"", was a joint project between SpaceIL, a privately funded Israeli non-profit organisation, and Israel Aerospace Industries. In space terms, the Moon is a mere hop from the Earth, and most missions take a few days to get there. But the Beresheet mission, which launched on 22 February from Cape Canaveral in Florida, spent weeks reaching its destination. Its journey took it on a series of ever-widening orbits around the Earth, before being captured by the Moon's gravity and moving into lunar orbit on 4 April. The spacecraft launched on a SpaceX rocket in February The average distance to the Moon is 380,000km (240,000 miles) - Beresheet travelled more than 15 times that distance. And the main thing driving this was cost. Instead of sitting alone on a rocket that would put it on the perfect trajectory to the Moon, it blasted off on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket along with a communications satellite and an experimental aircraft. Sharing the ride into space significantly reduced its launch costs - but it meant the spacecraft had to take a more convoluted route. The spacecraft enlarged its path around Earth until it was captured by the Moon's gravity A controlled landing on the lunar surface was the major challenge for the Israeli spacecraft. The engine was British-built, developed by Nammo in Westcott, Buckinghamshire. It provided the power to get the spacecraft all the way to the Moon, but it also took Beresheet on its final descent. The 1.5m-tall spacecraft had to rapidly reduce its speed, so a final firing of the engine in effect slammed on the brakes, hoping to take the spacecraft to a gentle stop. Before the landing, Rob Westcott, senior propulsion engineer at Nammo, said ""We've never used an engine in this kind of application before"". He said the big challenge would be ""the fact that the engine is going to have to be switched on and get very hot, then switched off for a short period of time when all that heat is remaining in its thermal mass, and then fired up again, very accurately and very precisely such that it slows the craft down and lands very softly on the surface on the Moon"". That landing process took around 20 minutes. All of the controls for this were uploaded and performed autonomously with mission control watching on. Its first job was to use its high-resolution cameras to take some photos - including a selfie - which it did manage before the crash. It was then going to measure the magnetic field of the spot it landed in, an area known as Mare Serenitatis. Monica Grady, professor of planetary and space science at Open University, said it would be ""looking at the landing site really closely"". This would help ""work out how the magnetic measurements of the Moon fit in with the geology and geography of the Moon, which is really important to understand how the Moon formed"". The lander also carried a reflector from Nasa to help scientists make accurate measurements of the distance between the Earth and the Moon. Temperatures on the Moon are extreme, and as the Sun rose the spacecraft would have been unlikely to survive the heat. The spacecraft was due to study the Moon's magnetism while on the lunar surface Over 60 years of space exploration, only a few nations have made it down on to the Moon. The former Soviet Union achieved the first soft landing with its spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966. Nasa followed this by getting the first humans to the Moon in 1969.  In 2008, India's space agency fired an impact probe, which intentionally crashed into the Moon's south pole. Then, China's Change-4 spacecraft touched down on the farside of the Moon earlier this year. If their landing had worked, Israel would have been the latest nation to join this elite club. But it was the low-price tag - and the fact that the mission was not funded by a major space agency - that was significant. A photo taken by the spacecraft of the earth from a distance of 37,600 km (23400m) Beresheet was not alone in pursuing low-cost lunar exploration. Its origins lie in the Google Lunar XPrize, an international challenge offering $20m for the first privately developed spacecraft to land on the Moon. And while the competition ended last year after no-one was able to meet its deadline (the foundation has subsequently announced they will award the Beresheet collaboration $1m for their achievement), other teams involved are also continuing with their efforts to get to the Moon. Both Nasa and Esa have also announced their intention to use commercial landers to deliver scientific payloads to the lunar surface.

Woman 'freed' after Dubai horse insult,"Laleh Shahravesh was arrested in Dubai when she arrived with her teenage daughter Paris for her ex-husband's funeral A British woman who faced prison in Dubai for calling her ex-husband's new wife a ""horse"" on Facebook has been released, the campaign group which represents her has said. Laleh Shahravesh, 55, was arrested at a Dubai airport after flying to the city to attend her ex-husband's funeral. The Detained in Dubai groupsaid the case had been settled,externalwith a AED3,000 (Â£625) fine after a hearing. Ms Shahravesh is expected to be home by next week, it added in a statement. The mother-of-one, from Richmond in south-west London, was married to her Portuguese husband Pedro for 18 years. The couple lived together in Dubai for eight months - where Pedro worked for HSBC - before Ms Shahravesh returned alone to the UK with the couple's daughter. In 2016, she received divorce papers and discovered on Facebook that Pedro was remarrying.

Smart speaker recordings reviewed by humans,"Amazon, Apple and Google all employ staff who listen to customer voice recordings from their smart speakers and voice assistant apps. News siteBloomberg,externalhighlighted the topic after speaking to Amazon staff who ""reviewed"" Alexa recordings. All three companies say voice recordings are occasionally reviewed to improve speech recognition. But the reaction to the Bloomberg article suggests many customers are unaware that humans may be listening. The news site said it had spoken to seven people who reviewed audio from Amazon Echo smart speakers and the Alexa service. Reviewers typically transcribed and annotated voice clips to help improve Amazon's speech recognition systems. Amazon's voice recordings are associated with an account number, the customer's first name and the serial number of the Echo device used. Some of the reviewers told Bloomberg that they shared amusing voice clips with one another in an internal chat room. They also described hearing distressing clips such as a potential sexual assault. However, they were told by colleagues that it was not Amazon's job to intervene. The terms and conditions for Amazon's Alexa service state that voice recordings are used to ""answer your questions, fulfil your requests, and improve your experience and our services"". Human reviewers are not explicitly mentioned. In a statement, Amazon said it took security and privacy seriously and only annotated ""an extremely small sample of Alexa voice recordings"". ""This information helps us train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems, so Alexa can better understand your requests, and ensure the service works well for everyone,"" it said in a statement. ""We have strict technical and operational safeguards, and have a zero tolerance policy for the abuse of our system. Employees do not have direct access to information that can identify the person or account as part of this workflow."" Apple also has human reviewers who make sure its voice assistant Siri is interpreting requests correctly. Siri records voice commands given through the iPhone and HomePod smart speaker. Google Home, Amazon Echo and Apple HomePod speakers According toApple's security policy,external, voice recordings lack personally identifiable information and are linked to a random ID number, which is reset every time Siri is switched off. Any voice recordings kept after six months are stored without the random ID number. Its human reviewers never receive personally identifiable information or the random ID. Google said human reviewers could listen to audio clips from its Assistant, which is embedded in most Android phones and the Home speaker. It said clips were not associated with personally identifiable information and the company also distorted the audio to disguise the customer's voice. A common fear is that smart speakers are secretly recording everything that is said in the home. While smart speakers are technically always ""hearing"", they are typically not ""listening"" to your conversations. All the major home assistants record and analyse short snippets of audio internally, in order to detect a wake word such as ""Alexa"", ""Ok Google"" or ""Hey Siri"". If the wake word is not heard, the audio is discarded. But if the wake word is detected, the audio is kept and recording continues so that the customer's request can be sent to the voice recognition service. It would be easy to detect if a speaker was continuously sending entire conversations back to a remote server for analysis, and security researchers have not found evidence to suggest this is happening. Amazon'sAlexa privacy settings,externaldo not let you opt out of voice recording or human review, but you can stop your recordings being used to ""help develop new features"". You can also listen to and delete previous voice recordings. Google lets you listen to and delete voice recordings on theMy Activity,externalpage. You can also switch off""web and app history tracking"",externaland ""voice and audio activity"", which Google Assistant pesters you to switch on. Apple does not let you listen back to Siri recordings. Itsprivacy portal,external, which lets you download a copy of your personal data, says it cannot provide information ""that is not personally identifiable or linked to your Apple ID"". To delete voice recordings created by Siri on an iOS device, go to the Siri & Search menu in Settings and switch Siri off.

British woman found dead in Swiss hotel,"The young British woman was found dead in a waterside hotel in Locarno on Tuesday A 22-year-old British woman has been found dead in the bathroom of a hotel in southern Switzerland, police say. Her 29-year-old German boyfriend has been taken into custody and reportedly told police that the death was the result of a ""sex game"" that went wrong. The victim has not been officially named. Local media say a post-mortem examination has shown she died of suffocation. The UK Foreign Office said it was offering assistance to the family. Swiss media said the woman had been staying at the Hotel La Palma au Lac in Muralto, in the district of Locarno, with her boyfriend, who lives in Zurich. She was found dead on Tuesday morning. Police say they are still investigating the circumstances of the death. Reports say officials are looking into the possibility of an intentional killing. Some hotel guests told Swiss news outlets that they had heard arguing coming from the couple's room the night before she was found dead. The UK Foreign Office confirmed it was offering consular assistance to the family following the death of a British citizen.

Kim Kardashian to become a lawyer in 2022,"Kim Kardashian has revealed she has begun a four-year apprenticeship with a law firm in the US, with hopes of becoming a lawyer in 2022. The reality TV star says she made the decision to pursue a legal career in 2018. Last year, she met with President Donald Trump and successfully campaigned to have 63-year-old Alice Marie Johnson released from jail. She says her experiences at The White House inspired her decision. ""The White House called me to advise to help change the system of clemency,""she tells Vogue,externalmagazine in a new interview. Clemency is when someone is pardoned from a crime they are accused of having committed and it is declared that they are not guilty. In America, the President can grant clemency to anyone convicted under federal law. ""I'm sitting in the Roosevelt Room with, like, a judge who had sentenced criminals and a lot of really powerful people and I just sat there, like, Oh - I need to know more,"" Kim says. ""I would say what I had to say, about the human side and why this is so unfair. But I had attorneys with me who could back that up with all the facts of the case."" This video can not be played Alice Marie Johnson was released from jail after intervention from Kim Kim says choosing to pick up a new career was something she had to think ""long and hard"" about but that she knew she always wanted to ""do more"". ""It's never one person who gets things done; it's always a collective of people, and I've always known my role, but I just felt like I wanted to be able to fight for people who have paid their dues to society,"" she says. ""I just felt like the system could be so different, and I wanted to fight to fix it, and if I knew more, I could do more."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rugby star to be fired over anti-gay post,"Folau has scored 37 tries in 73 games for Australia Rugby Australia and the New South Wales Rugby Union say they intend to terminate Israel Folau's contract after asocial media postby the full-back in which he said ""hell awaits"" gay people. Folau, 30, has 73 caps and was expected to play at this year's World Cup. ""He does not speak for the game with his recent social media posts,"" the governing bodies said. ""In the absence of compelling mitigating factors, it is our intention to terminate his contract."" 'Folau may never play rugby again' Rugby Australia and the NSW Rugby Union, which is responsible for Super Rugby side NSW Waratahs, said they have made ""repeated attempts"" to contact Folau and he has failed to get in touch with either organisation. ""Israel has failed to understand that the expectation of him as a Rugby Australia and NSW Waratahs employee is that he cannot share material on social media that condemns, vilifies or discriminates against people on the basis of their sexuality,"" the governing bodies said in a statement. ""As a code we have made it clear to Israel formally and repeatedly that any social media posts or commentary that is in any way disrespectful to people because of their sexuality will result in disciplinary action."" Australia's sponsor Qantas, whose chief executive Alan Joyce is openly gay, said Folau's post was ""really disappointing"". ""These comments clearly don't reflect the spirit of inclusion and diversity that we support,"" the airline said. Folau, who signed a four-year deal with the Waratahs in March and had a deal with Rugby Australia until 2022,escaped punishmentfor similar comments last year, with Rugby Australia saying it accepted - but did not support - his ""position"". New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, for whose country's netball team Falou's wife Maria Falou is a star, said the posts were ""damaging"" from a player who is a ""role model for many"". ""I totally disagree with what he's said and the way he's using his platform,"" she added. On Wednesday, he posted on Instagram that ""drunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolaters"" should ""repent"" because ""only Jesus saves"", and made similar remarks on Twitter.

She faced anger from some in her own party in the Commons, those who favoured leaving without a deal, while some on the Labour benches applauded her for putting country over party. The PM confirmed that another referendum has not been offered in talks with the Labour Party. That's it! MPs are now in recess and will return to Parliament on 23 April. Press Association Europe needs to listen to unionist concerns about theIrish backstop, Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster has said. In a meeting in Brussels, Mrs Foster told the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier unionists in the region opposed the Withdrawal Agreement because of the mechanism. Afterwards, she warned that the UK and EU would move ""inexorably towards a no-deal scenario"" unless changes to the backstop were made. Mrs Foster says the EU has ignored the views of unionists on the issue, and has instead been influenced by the pro-backstop lobbying of Irish nationalists. Press Association Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns is blaming Brexit uncertainty on those who voted against the government's withdrawal agreement. He hopes the Easter break will be a time of reflection by MPs, he says. ""I was most disappointed that Parliament didn't get a majority for the withdrawal agreement because even opposition parties had expressed support for elements of it,"" he says. ""The country wants to draw a line under this, the country wants to move on to new investments and new opportunities. ""Therefore I think it's incumbent on MPs to recognise the outcome of the referendum but do so in a smooth and orderly way.""

Christine Lagarde tells the BBC that the delay to Brexit means businesses and investors will remain hesitant in the coming months. The government's Brexit talks with Labour could end by theEuropean electionson 23 June, Downing Street is suggesting. Discussions between the government and Labour are continuing today and a ministerial meeting is scheduled to take place on Friday. But a No 10 spokesman says the talks won't continue ""for the sake of it"". ""We have stressed the urgency because there is an opportunity to avoid European parliamentary elections and to bring a resolution so that businesses and people have greater certainty,"" he tells the Press Association. ""Bluntly, we won't continue to talk for the sake of it."" If talks fail, the next step would be to put options before MPs in another series of votes, the spokesman says. BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Livereporter Rowan Bridge is in Blackpool. He's been speaking to Nikki and Chris from Glasgow who are on a day trip with their two children. They both voted Remain. Nikki says: ""We're left really uncertain about our future, the future for our kids and future generations and it's just a bit unsettling really."" ""Nothing's really been agreed and we're not getting any further forward, so I've not really got confidence that it will be resolved, but you never know, they might surprise us. ""[Theresa May] is not giving me much confidence so far, but we'll wait and see how things go."" Chris says: ""I think it's a shambles... There's just been arrogance from the start and I'm really disappointed in all the parties. ""I don't really see an end point... I think we'll probably have to go back to a second referendum.

Here's what the President of the European Council Donald Tusk had to say about the delay (and what his speech actually means). Polling expert Sir John Curtice says it should be assumed the UK will take part in European elections as it has run out of time to agree a deal before the deadline. The prime minister has told MPs that backing her deal would
mean there was no need for European Parliament elections â which take place on
23 May. But Sir John, professor of politics at the University of
Strathclyde, tells the BBC: âThat three-week timetable - which is what sheâs
effectively got - looks terribly, terribly tight.â He adds: âIt doesnât look as though there is long enough to
complete the whole process by which we are going to withdraw from the EU by 22
May and for all practical purposes we should now assume that the European parliamentary
elections are going to happen.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The government is relient on aconfidence-and supply agreement with the DUPin the House of Commons. But the Northern Irish party, which wants changes to thebackstop, has repeatedly said it will not back Theresa May's Brexit deal.  Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent It is a longer delay than Prime Minister Theresa May asked for, but shorter than most EU leaders wanted. So what will happen next? With the clocking ticking again, Mrs May wants Parliament to finally agree on the UK's withdrawal from the EU preferably before 23 May, to avoid the UK taking part in elections to the European Parliament. Her plan is first to try to get a cross-party agreement with the opposition Labour Party. If that fails, there could be a series of votes in Parliament on alternatives to her deal, such as holding a second referendum. But agreement has so far proved elusive, so it's entirely possible the UK will be back where it started at the end of extra time. Read Rob's more detailed analysishere House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Alistair Burt, whoresignedto vote against the government over Brexit, calls on the PM to be as ""flexible as possible"" when it comes to alternatives to her deal. He calls for ""free votes"" in Parliament to determine which of those alternatives commands the most support. Theresa May replies that the government is working with Labour to find a compromise that could get through the Commons. If this is not possible, the government will work to ""take votes forward"" to identify a majority opinion in Parliament. Â© 2025 BBC.

Private mission to attempt Moon landing,"One of the last photos taken by Beresheet of the moon's surface before it crashed The first privately funded mission to the Moon has crashed on the lunar surface after the apparent failure of its main engine. The Israeli spacecraft - called Beresheet - attempted a soft touchdown, but suffered technical problems on its descent to the lunar surface. The aim of the mission was to take pictures and conduct experiments. Only government space agencies from the former Soviet Union, the US and China have achieved soft lunar landings. Israel hoped to become the fourth country to do this. ""We didn't make it, but we definitely tried,"" said project originator and major backer Morris Kahn. ""I think that the achievement of getting to where we got is really tremendous; I think we can be proud,"" he said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, watching from the control room near Tel Aviv, said: ""If at first you don't succeed, you try again."" After a seven-week  journey to the Moon, the robotic spacecraft approached a final orbit at 15km (9 miles) from the surface. Tensions were high in the command centre as communications were lost before Opher Doron, the general manager of Israel Aerospace Industries' space division, announced there had been a failure in the spacecraft. ""We unfortunately have not managed to land successfully,"" he said. There was disappointment in the crowd following events from outside the control room in Yehud The audience outside had been through a turbulent journey themselves as they watched the first part of the landing go to plan. As Mr Doron announced that the engine had cut out, groans filled the room. ""We are resetting the spacecraft to try to enable the engine,"" he said. The engine came on seconds later and the audience applauded, only for communication with the spacecraft to be lost shortly after. The mission was over. The project has cost about $100m (Â£76m) and has paved the way for future low-cost lunar exploration. Dr Kimberly Cartier, an astronomer and science news reporter, tweeted that she was ""sad about how #Beresheet ended"" but ""proud of the entire @TeamSpaceIL"". Allow Twitter content?

Beresheet, which is Hebrew for ""in the beginning"", was a joint project between SpaceIL, a privately funded Israeli non-profit organisation, and Israel Aerospace Industries. In space terms, the Moon is a mere hop from the Earth, and most missions take a few days to get there. But the Beresheet mission, which launched on 22 February from Cape Canaveral in Florida, spent weeks reaching its destination. Its journey took it on a series of ever-widening orbits around the Earth, before being captured by the Moon's gravity and moving into lunar orbit on 4 April. The spacecraft launched on a SpaceX rocket in February The average distance to the Moon is 380,000km (240,000 miles) - Beresheet travelled more than 15 times that distance. And the main thing driving this was cost. Instead of sitting alone on a rocket that would put it on the perfect trajectory to the Moon, it blasted off on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket along with a communications satellite and an experimental aircraft. Sharing the ride into space significantly reduced its launch costs - but it meant the spacecraft had to take a more convoluted route. The spacecraft enlarged its path around Earth until it was captured by the Moon's gravity A controlled landing on the lunar surface was the major challenge for the Israeli spacecraft. The engine was British-built, developed by Nammo in Westcott, Buckinghamshire. It provided the power to get the spacecraft all the way to the Moon, but it also took Beresheet on its final descent. The 1.5m-tall spacecraft had to rapidly reduce its speed, so a final firing of the engine in effect slammed on the brakes, hoping to take the spacecraft to a gentle stop. Before the landing, Rob Westcott, senior propulsion engineer at Nammo, said ""We've never used an engine in this kind of application before"". He said the big challenge would be ""the fact that the engine is going to have to be switched on and get very hot, then switched off for a short period of time when all that heat is remaining in its thermal mass, and then fired up again, very accurately and very precisely such that it slows the craft down and lands very softly on the surface on the Moon"". That landing process took around 20 minutes. All of the controls for this were uploaded and performed autonomously with mission control watching on. Its first job was to use its high-resolution cameras to take some photos - including a selfie - which it did manage before the crash. It was then going to measure the magnetic field of the spot it landed in, an area known as Mare Serenitatis. Monica Grady, professor of planetary and space science at Open University, said it would be ""looking at the landing site really closely"". This would help ""work out how the magnetic measurements of the Moon fit in with the geology and geography of the Moon, which is really important to understand how the Moon formed"". The lander also carried a reflector from Nasa to help scientists make accurate measurements of the distance between the Earth and the Moon. Temperatures on the Moon are extreme, and as the Sun rose the spacecraft would have been unlikely to survive the heat. The spacecraft was due to study the Moon's magnetism while on the lunar surface Over 60 years of space exploration, only a few nations have made it down on to the Moon. The former Soviet Union achieved the first soft landing with its spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966. Nasa followed this by getting the first humans to the Moon in 1969.  In 2008, India's space agency fired an impact probe, which intentionally crashed into the Moon's south pole. Then, China's Change-4 spacecraft touched down on the farside of the Moon earlier this year. If their landing had worked, Israel would have been the latest nation to join this elite club. But it was the low-price tag - and the fact that the mission was not funded by a major space agency - that was significant. A photo taken by the spacecraft of the earth from a distance of 37,600 km (23400m) Beresheet was not alone in pursuing low-cost lunar exploration. Its origins lie in the Google Lunar XPrize, an international challenge offering $20m for the first privately developed spacecraft to land on the Moon. And while the competition ended last year after no-one was able to meet its deadline (the foundation has subsequently announced they will award the Beresheet collaboration $1m for their achievement), other teams involved are also continuing with their efforts to get to the Moon. Both Nasa and Esa have also announced their intention to use commercial landers to deliver scientific payloads to the lunar surface.

"Ex-Pope blames 1960s revolution for sex abuseThe former Pope published the letter as he said he wanted to assist in ""this difficult hour"".","Benedict XVI was Pope from 2005 until 2013 Retired Pope Benedict XVI has published a letter which blames clerical sex abuse on the ""all-out sexual freedom"" of the 1960s. He said that cultural and historical change had led to a ""dissolution"" of morality in Catholicism. The sexual revolution in the 1960s had led to homosexuality and paedophilia in Catholic establishments, he claimed. The letter sparked fierce criticism from theologians who claim it is ""deeply flawed"". Vatican expert Joshua McElwee said in theNational Catholic Reporter,external: ""It does not address structural issues that abetted abuse cover-up, or Benedict's own contested 24-year role as head of the Vatican's powerful doctrinal office."" Some allegations of child sex abuse by priests that have emerged date back to decades before the 1960s, the decade that Pope Benedict claims sparked the abuse crisis. Julie Rubio, a Catholic theologian, said in a tweet that the letter was ""profoundly troubling"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It is rare for Pope Benedict, who in 2013 wasthe first to resign in almost 600 years, to intervene in clerical matters. He had been accused of failing to protect children and suppressing investigations,allegations he denied. The only solution to the problem, the former Pope said, was ""obedience and love for our Lord Jesus Christ"". World Catholic sex abuse scandals Sex abuse and the Catholic Church His analysis of the sex abuse scandals that have rocked the Roman Catholic Church takes a more theological and historical approach than Pope Francis. Pope Francis at a summit on protecting minors in the church in February 2019 At a summit in February,the current pontiff called for ""concrete measures""to tackle the crisis, not just ""simple and obvious condemnations"". As he had ""served in a position of responsibility as shepherd of the church"" when more cases emerged, Pope Benedict said he wanted to ""contribute to a new beginning"". Published in the German Catholic magazine Klerusblatt, the 5,500-word letter is divided into three parts. The first part presents the ""wider social context of the question"", lamenting the 1960s as a time when ""previously normative standards regarding sexuality collapsed entirely"". He blames sexual films, images of nudity and ""the clothing of that time"" leading to ""mental collapse"" and ""violence"". At the time of the sexual revolution, ""Catholic moral theology suffered a collapse that rendered the Church defenceless against these changes in society"", he said. The sexual revolution led to paedophilia being ""diagnosed as allowed and appropriate"". Next, the letter examines how this period affected the ""dissolution of the Christian concept of morality"", particularly in Catholic educational institutions. In some cases, bishops ""sought to bring about a kind of new, modern"" Catholicism and the sexual revolution led to ""homosexual cliques"" in seminaries. Pope Francis compares sex abuse to human sacrifice He claimed one bishop showed his students pornographic films to make them ""resistant to behaviour contrary to the faith"". ""The question of paedophilia, as I recall, did not become acute until the second half of the 1980s,"" he said. The letter concludes by advocating a return to faith. ""Why did paedophilia reach such proportions?"" he questions. ""Ultimately, the reason is the absence of God."" Pope Benedict XVI giving a farewell before retiring due to ill health in February 2013 He says ""the death of God in a society"" means ""the end of freedom"" and the solution is to ""live by God and unto Him"". Finally, Pope Benedict thanks his replacement, Pope Francis, ""for everything he does to show us, again and again, the light of God, which has not disappeared, even today"". Pope condemns sex abuse 'atrocities' Pope Francis saidin a letter in published in 2018that the Church ""did not act in a timely manner"" on the issue of child sexual abuse, and ""showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them"".

Speedboat killer jailed after fleeing UKJack Shepherd fled to Georgia before he was convicted of killing Charlotte Brown in a crash.,"This video can not be played Charlotte Brown's sister Katie made a tearful statement outside court after Shepherd was sentenced A man who killed a woman in a speedboat crash has been jailed for an extra six months for fleeing the country. Jack Shepherd fled before he was sentenced to six years for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown, who died in the crash on the River Thames. He returned to the UK on Wednesday night after 10 months on the run. Shepherd, 31, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to breaching bail and absconding and was sent to prison to begin his six-and-a-half-year sentence. Judge Richard Marks said: ""Charlotte's family were, of course, devastated by the circumstances by which she met her death, and those feelings were greatly exacerbated by the fact you chose to go on the run. ""Your conduct in absenting yourself from justice for so long was as cowardly as it was selfish."" This video can not be played Speaking on the plane back from Georgia, Jack Shepherd said he regretted going on the run Speaking outside court, Ms Brown's father Graham said the family felt ""a sense of relief"". He said: ""Due to Shepherd's recklessness and negligent actions Charlotte isn't here to defend herself."" Her sister Katie said Shepherd had ""continued to prolong our agony, making wild accusations against our family"". She said his ""lack of respect and decency still continues to astound us"". Charlotte Brown died in December 2015 when Shepherd took her on a date on his speedboat Defence barrister Andrew McGee said Shepherd had travelled to Georgia in March last year. He said he had travelled ""under his own name, using his own passport"" before he handed himself in to police in Tbilisi in January. Mr McGee said Shepherd was ""overwhelmed by his fear"" of a prison sentence. He added: ""It [absconding] was not deliberately callous or cavalier. It was not cynical or calculated."" By Helena Lee, BBC News Correspondent at the Old Bailey Charlotte Brown's family - her mother, father and two sisters - were just metres away from the glass dock and got a clear view of Jack Shepherd when he was brought in by two guards. They glanced over at him. He, though, didn't look at them or up at the public gallery. Instead he stared ahead and listened as Judge Richard Marks told him his deliberate decision to go on the run hugely added to the distress of Charlotte's family. The family had been waiting months for this day to come, the day they got to see the man convicted of Charlotte's manslaughter finally start serving his sentence. Judge Marks said Shepherd was in contact with his lawyers from his ""hideaway"" during legal proceedings. He added: ""You were, in effect, having your cake and eating it. That is not how our system of justice is supposed to work."" Shepherd's boat was found to have several defects During his trial, jurors heard that Shepherd and Ms Brown went on a late-night high-speed jaunt in his boat past the Houses of Parliament on their first date on 8 December 2015. The pair were both thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water near Wandsworth Bridge. Ms Brown, from Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, was found in the water unconscious and unresponsive, while Shepherd was discovered clinging to the upturned boat. His trial was told that he was responsible for the speedboat, which had a series of serious defects, including to its steering.

Diet pill manslaughter convictions quashed,"Bernard Rebelo had two convictions for manslaughter overturned on appeal A man faces a retrial over the death of a woman who took toxic slimming pills. Eloise Parry, 21, a bulimic student from Shrewsbury, took eight tablets containing dinitrophenol (DNP) in 2015. Bernard Rebelo was found guilty of two counts of manslaughter in connection with her death and jailed for seven years, but the convictions have been overturned on appeal. Court of Appeal judges ruled Rebelo, 31, from Gosport, would only face one count of manslaughter at a retrial. He was also convicted of one count of placing unsafe food on the market at his first trial at Inner London Crown Court in June. Ms Parry, a student at Wrexham Glyndwr University, had bulimia and borderline personality disorder. Latest news from the West Midlands Sir Brian Leveson, who heard the appeal with two other judges, ruled that Rebelo must stand trial on a single charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. Eloise Parry was 21 when she died in 2015 At an earlier hearing in February, he assured Ms Parry's parents the judges were ""very aware"" of their tragic loss, but said the appeal was ""an analysis of the law"". DNP is a highly toxic substance when ingested, inhaled or absorbed through the skin and was declared unfit for human consumption in the United States in 1938. It is sold as a slimming agent as it causes weight loss by burning fat and carbohydrates, with energy converted into heat.

"Sturgeon calls for Brexit plan 're-setScotland's first minister urges Theresa May to seek ""genuine consensus"" with other parties over Brexit.Scotland politicsComments","This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""What I would like to see now is this issue going back to the people."" Scotland's first minister has urged the government to ""re-set"" its approach to Brexit after the latest delay to the UK's departure from the EU. A ""flexible"" extension of the Brexit deadline until 31 October was agreed at an EU summit on Wednesday night. Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Theresa May to urge the prime minister to ""drop your red lines"" and seek ""genuine consensus"" with opposition parties. Holyrood will not be recalled now that the extension has been agreed. Scottish Parliament Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh had warned MSPs they would be required from 13:00 on Thursday if the UK was due to leave the EU without a deal on Friday. However, following the announcement of the extension, Mr Macintosh said a recall was no longer necessary. Brexit: UK and EU agree delay until 31 October Live: May to face MPs after EU summit Q&A: European elections in Scotland The six-month extension was agreed after late-night talks in Brussels, and averts the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal on Friday. MPs remain deadlocked on what to do, having repeatedly rejected Mrs May's plan and a range of other alternative suggestions. Ministers are now holding talks with the Labour opposition to see if a compromise can be found. European Council president Donald Tusk said the UK could still sign off the government's negotiated deal, or choose to ""cancel Brexit altogether"". He added: ""This extension is as flexible as I expected, and a little bit shorter than I expected, but it's still enough to find the best possible solution. Please do not waste this time."" Mrs May, who had wanted a shorter delay, said the UK would still aim to leave the EU as soon as possible. European Council President Donald Tusk, Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, Theresa May, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Costa at the summit in Brussels In a letter to the prime minister, Ms Sturgeon welcomed the outcome of the summit, and said it was ""essential that this time is used constructively and not wasted"". She said: ""We now have the gift of more time from the EU, and that must be used constructively to re-set the UK government approach. Your ongoing talks with the leader of the opposition should now broaden to include other parties, the devolved administrations, business and civic society, and open up the range of options on the table in an effort to reach a genuine consensus. ""Fundamentally, the Scottish government considers that any deal agreed by the UK parliament should be put to another referendum, with the alternative proposition on the ballot paper being to remain in the EU. ""The extension to 31 October provides enough time to do this, and it is essential that no time is lost in making the necessary preparations."" Speaking on BBC radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said Mrs May was determined to leave the EU by 30 June. He said: ""We're not leaving the EU tomorrow on the basis of no deal. I think everyone, certainly in Scotland, is in agreement that leaving the EU on Friday would not have been a good outcome."" Mr Mundell added: ""She [Theresa May] wants to deliver Brexit by 22 May so that we don't have to have the European elections and there is still an opportunity to do that. ""If we can, as I would hope - because these talks seem to be serious - get some form of agreement with the Labour Party, then it would be possible to ratify the withdrawal agreement by 22 May and leave by then, and it would still be possible also to leave by 30 June."" European Council President Donald Tusk (right) said the extension was ""enough to find the best possible solution"" The prime minister had earlier told leaders she wanted to move the UK's exit date from Friday of this week to 30 June, with the option of leaving earlier if her withdrawal agreement was ratified by parliament. Following the extension announcement, she said that although the delay extends until 31 October, the UK can leave before then if MPs pass her withdrawal deal. ""I know that there is huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension,"" she said. ""The UK should have left the EU by now and I sincerely regret the fact that I have not yet been able to persuade parliament to approve a deal."" Mrs May added: ""I do not pretend the next few weeks will be easy, or there is a simple way to break the deadlock in parliament. But we have a duty as politicians to find a way to fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. ""Nothing is more pressing or more vital."" The PM said that the UK ""will continue to hold full membership rights and obligations [of the EU]"" during the delay. A Brexit extension ""only as long as necessary"" and ""no longer than 31 October"" to allow for the ratification of the withdrawal agreement The UK ""must hold the elections to the European Parliament"" and if it fails to do this, the UK will leave on 1 June The European Council reiterates there can be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement negotiations Read the EU's conclusions here.,external New Brexit deadline set for 31 October Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

Sudan military says it has seized power,"This video can not be played The announcement was made by the defence minister Awad Ibn Auf Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has been ousted and arrested by the military after nearly 30 years in power. Speaking on state TV, defence minister Awad Ibn Auf said the army would oversee a two-year transitional period followed by elections. He also said a three-month state of emergency was being put in place. Protesters, however, have vowed to stay on the streets despite an overnight curfew being imposed by the military. Demonstrations against Mr Bashir, who has governed Sudan since 1989, have been taking place for several months. The protesters are now demanding a civilian council to lead the transition rather than a military one, correspondents say. Sudan's unrest in 300 words Bashir ousted: Five significant moments ""I announce as minister of defence the toppling of the regime and detaining its chief in a secure place,"" Mr Ibn Auf said in a statement. Mr Bashir's exact whereabouts are not known. Mr Ibn Auf said the country had been suffering from ""poor management, corruption, and an absence of justice"" and he apologised ""for the killing and violence that took place"". Some people celebrated in Khartoum after the army announcement He said Sudan's constitution was being suspended, border crossings were being shut until further notice and airspace was being closed for 24 hours. Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? As the news broke, crowds of protesters celebrated outside army headquarters in the capital, Khartoum, embracing soldiers and climbing on top of armoured vehicles. Sudan's intelligence service said it was freeing all political prisoners. Anti-government protesters have been cheering the military Mr Bashir is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which accuses him of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan's western Darfur region. However it is not clear what will happen to him following his arrest. This is a military coup with no clear roadmap for how the generals plan to hand over power to civilian rule. The fear will be that they have no such intention. The security elite has calculated that removing Omar al-Bashir and imposing a curfew will buy them time and end the protests. If so this represents a serious miscalculation. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) - which has spearheaded the demonstrations - and other civil society groups have made it clear they  won't accept a cosmetic change. They have the numbers and are highly organised. The military has the guns and the capacity for imposing brutal repression. But what then? A crackdown will not resolve the desperate economic crisis that brought years of simmering resentment on to the streets last December. There is also the question of the cracks within the Sudanese security establishment, evident during the clashes between soldiers and intelligence/militia forces in recent days. It is a volatile and unpredictable situation that demands cool heads and compromise on the part of the military. The stability of Sudan depends on how they react to continued protests. Early on Thursday, military vehicles entered the large compound in Khartoum housing the defence ministry, the army headquarters and Mr Bashir's personal residence. State TV and radio later interrupted programming to say the army would be making a statement. Omar al-Bashir has been in power since 1989 Meanwhile, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through central Khartoum, some chanting: ""It has fallen, we won."" The SPA said the military had announced a ""coup"" that would merely reproduce the same ""faces and institutions that our great people revolted against"". It urged people to continue the sit-in outside military headquarters and to stay on the streets of cities across the country. ""Those who destroyed the country and killed the people are seeking to steal every drop of blood and sweat that the Sudanese people poured in their revolution that shook the throne of tyranny,"" the statement read. The SPA has previously said that any transitional administration must not include anyone from what it called the ""tyrannical regime"". A young woman who became a symbol of the protests also dismissed the military announcement. Alaa Salah, nicknamed ""Kandaka"" or ""Nubian queen"" after she was filmed leading chants against the government, accused the authorities of ""hoodwinking"" the people. Allow Twitter content?

The protests were originally sparked by a rise in the cost of living, but demonstrators then began calling for the president to resign and his government to go. This video can not be played Anti-Bashir protesters celebrate Government officials said 38 people had died since December but Human Rights Watch said the number was higher. In February, it looked as though the president might step down, but insteadMr Bashir declared a state of national emergency. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed for ""calm and utmost restraint by all"" and urged a transition that would meet the ""democratic aspirations"" of the people. The UN Security Council is to discuss the situation in a closed-door meeting on Friday called by the US, France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Poland, diplomats said. UK Foreign SecretaryJeremy Hunt said that a two-year military council was ""not the answer"",external. ""We need to see a swift move to an inclusive, representative, civilian leadership.  And we need to ensure there's no more violence,"" he said on Twitter. The African Union condemned the military takeover. AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat said it was not an appropriate response to the challenges facing the country and the aspirations of its people. Russia, which has twice hosted Mr Bashir, called for calm and said it was monitoring the situation. Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov expressed hope that bilateral ties would not be damaged, whoever was in power. This video can not be played Sudan protests: So what's going on? Amnesty International's Secretary General Kumi Naidoo praised the courage of the Sudanese people but said he was ""alarmed by the raft of emergency measures"" announced by the military. In a statement, he also said that justice was ""long overdue"" for Mr Bashir. ""Omar al-Bashir is wanted for some of the most odious human rights violations of our generation and we need to finally see him held accountable,"" Mr Naidoo added. Formerly an army officer, he seized power in a military coup in 1989. His rule has been marked by civil war. The civil conflict with the south of the country ended in 2005 and South Sudan became independent in 2011. Another civil conflict has been taking place in the western region of Darfur. Mr Bashir is accused of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity there by the ICC. Read profile Despite an international arrest warrant issued by the ICC, he won consecutive elections in 2010 and 2015. However, his last victory was marred by a boycott by the main opposition parties. The arrest warrant has led to an international travel ban. However, Mr Bashir has made diplomatic visits to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.

Pri-mania as world's largest store opens,"Crowds were handed balloons as they ran into the new Primark store The world's biggest Primark has opened its doors to shoppers in Birmingham. Covering 161,000 sq ft over five floors, it occupies the entire site of a former shopping centre and comes complete with a Disney-themed cafe, a barber's shop and beauty studio, as well as Primark's standard fare - affordable fashion. It sounds like it has redefined the department store in an age when the high street's future is far from certain. So, with big names such as Debenhams and House of Fraser in decline, Primark's vision begs the question - can people be attracted back to bricks and mortar retail? In one way, Primark already has a leg-up when it comes to getting shoppers through the doors, as the retailer has no online presence. About 5,000 people are expected to visit the store at the former Pavilions Shopping Centre on High Street on its opening day. It is four times the size of Primark's old home round the corner. But what happens when opening-day clamour is a memory? How busy will the 430 workers who worked in the previous shop - and their 500 new colleagues - actually be? And if they are rushed off their feet, what lessons could Primark's peers learn? About 5,000 people are expected to visit the store on its opening day The development is thought to have cost about Â£70m, an eye-watering sum at a time when high street heavyweights are in peril. Earlier this week, Debenhamswas taken over by its lenders as part of an administration process. Analysts have previously claimeda lack of investment and innovationwere contributing factors to why traditional department stores were in decline. The allure of Primark, though, continues to grow. And that is despitecriticism over staff pay, and theenvironmental and social impactof so-called""fast fashion"". Last yearit reported higher UK salesand plans for more stores. It justifies its low prices with claims it spends nothing on advertising and has tight profit margins. This video can not be played The new development is thought to have cost about Â£70m Heiner Evanschitzky, professor of marketing at Aston Business School, said part of Primark's success was its clear business model - which is focused and means ""people know what they are going to get"". ""It is not like Debenhams and M&S, which struggled because they were trying too many different things. They were not positioned in a meaningful way - they have discount elements, high fashion elements and were all over the place,"" he said. This video can not be played Radio reporter Leona Smart spoke to keen shoppers who queued for the official opening Primark's lack of online presence means shoppers still have to go into stores to make purchases, which can encourage impulse shopping, Mr Evanschitzky added. ""In store you have the chance to inspire a customer, you get to say 'look around, browse, think of things you weren't planning on buying',"" he said. The new store has snatched the ""largest"" crown from Manchester and Mr Evanschitzky said its opening would be a ""huge gain"" for Birmingham city centre. More high street shops close than open every year across Great Britain and the gap is getting wider. Figures from PwC and the Local Data Company show a record net loss of 2,481 stores from the 500 biggest high streets in 2018. These include only ""multiple retailers"" - those with five or more shops. The number of shops closing stayed at about 16 per day, as it was the year before. However the number of openings has fallen significantly, to about nine per day and almost half what it was five years earlier. Charmaine Straker said Primark was ""an iconic brand"" Mother-of-six Charmaine Straker, 32, from Springhill, queued to enter the store with three of her children - Shae, 12, Xaviel, two, and six-month-old Harmony-Jai. She said: ""Stores like this only ever open in places like London. ""Because we're the second city and we've got this now, it's like we can finally live up to that title because Primark has become such an iconic brand. ""I'm not concerned about prices - if I like it I buy it. But Primark is cost effective if you have growing children."" Bedtime stories from daddy in jail Good Samaritan student tracked down 'Baking was my escape from anxiety' Irene Warrilow said she preferred to go into stores to shop rather than buying online Irene Warrilow, from Great Barr, was also part of the crowd waiting to go into the store. She said: ""I like to go into a shop and feel what I'm buying rather than shopping online. ""I think the cost of [Primark's] products makes them attractive. ""Places like Debenhams and John Lewis are just too expensive."" Michael Higgins believes Primark has ""moved with the times"" Michael Higgins, 23, travelled from Herefordshire to visit the new store. He said: ""I think it's a novelty at the moment. I'm looking forward to see the cafes and things like that. ""I think Primark has moved with the times to cater for different people, whereas other stores and companies maybe haven't so much."" A short power cut temporarily brought the store's escalators to a halt earlier and caused lighting to flicker on and off before normal service resumed. A number of House of Fraser stores have closed across the country Retail analyst Kate Hardcastle, from Insight with Passion, said people ""foolishly"" looked at Primark as a discount brand. ""It is anything but,"" she said. ""They are savvy, they know what they are doing. ""The easiest way to describe the department shops of old was they were too lazy, they stopped putting the customer and changing demands at the heart of their vision. ""They very much took footfall for granted, they always thought if they opened their doors, people would come. ""Primark understands what customers want and built their business around it."" Primark's lack of online shopping means purchases can only be made in store Ms Hardcastle said expanding ""experience retail"", with things such as beauticians and beauty bars at value prices, and using links with big name franchises including Disney - and Harry Potter through Warner Brothers - would bring in more customers. And the brand's lack of online presence also made the most of ""emotional spending"". ""When you think of Primark - there is just so much stuff, you go in for one thing and get more and more. Online, you would lose a lot of those purchases,"" she added. Blogger Hayley Warren, seen wearing a skirt from Primark, said she thinks the ""experience"" element of the new shop will bring people in from further afield Fashion blogger Hayley Warren said she thought the new superstore would attract people from outside the West Midlands. The 29-year-old, from Birmingham, who runsStrangeness and Charm,external, said: ""I know there are a lot of cafes in London which people will visit specifically to take pictures for Instagram, because they have things like flower walls. ""I know people from down south who have said they want to come up and visit Primark just because of Disney.""

""I think it is a store people will do that for, even those who wouldn't normally physically shop in stores - because you can't get it online. ""I think it will be really good for Birmingham as a destination."" Latest news from the West Midlands Ms Cavanagh said that when she was a teenager and student, Primark offered her what she wanted in cheap and fashionable clothes - but she now also used it for homeware. The Disney cafe is one of three places to eat in the store Primark's retail director for the UK and northern Europe, Simon Gibbs, said it was proud to be part of the ""fabric"" of Birmingham. During an advance tour of the centre on Wednesday, Tim Kelly, its director of new business, said: ""We have seen the changing face of retail globally and locally. ""When we were offered the location we jumped at the chance. ""We believe this is an opportunity for Primark to do something really special."" The store opened at 10:00 BST on Thursday.

Life beyond the throne," After seven seasons, 67 episodes, a bunch of blood-soaked character deaths and years of internet-breaking speculation, Game of Thrones is set to return for the final time. The world's biggest TV show has had a transformational effect on its cast, creators, crew and real-world home – Northern Ireland. The show has been filmed across Northern Ireland As the world gets ready to return to Westeros for the last time, and the airing of the season's first episode in the UK on 15 April on Sky Atlantic, BBC News NI looks at the show's impact on the film industry in Northern Ireland, as told by the people who helped bring the show to life. The Dark Hedges is the kind of the place that screams Game of Thrones. It's spring but an ominously wintry wind blows through the 18th Century cluster of gnarled beech trees in the County Antrim countryside. The scene, draped in a permanent sword metal sky, is made for cinema. Eight years ago, the Dark Hedges – locally well-known but never a tourist hotspot – featured at the end of episode two of Game of Thrones' second season. The rural lane was used as a stand-in for the Kingsroad, Westeros' famed highway. A fan takes a picture at the Game of Thrones plaquein Ballintoy Harbour, County Antrim And ever since the tourists have come – not just to the Dark Hedges but to other spots in Northern Ireland made famous by featuring on the real-world map of Westeros. Ballintoy (Pyke), Castle Ward (Winterfell), Cushendun (Melisandre’s caves). A decade of change, then, for the Dark Hedges and for many others too, like Ciaran Colton. Before Game of Thrones, he was a barman wondering what he was going to do next. Now he works full-time in the film industry as an assistant director. Hollywood life – even for those at its fringes – really does come at you pretty fast. He’s here at the Dark Hedges to be photographed for this feature. Tourists stop and stare, wondering if he’s somebody (“Wasn’t he that guy in season five…?”). Nearby, his eight-month-old son Manus sits in his pram being fussed over by American tourists while  a man speaking Spanish records a video. Back in 2008, when the Hedges went mostly unnoticed, Ciaran was pulling pints for a living. He'd dropped out of university and the 24-year-old didn't know where he was going. But he played in a band and had the long hair and big beard to prove it. His looks were to be a catalyst for a new career - but not how he ever imagined. “I was on the Metal Ireland forum,” he says. “There was an ad looking for people with long hair and beards to work on a Hollywood film…” That film was Your Highness, a critically mauled fantasy-comedy that flopped at the box office, but by coming to Northern Ireland, it was essentially a dry run for the HBO epic. Danny McBride and Natalie Portman in Your Highness From Your Highness, Ciaran moved on to the Game of Thrones pilot as Sean Bean's stand-in and a runner, then, eventually, as a third assistant director. Now, he's practically a seasoned veteran, having worked directly under show creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss on the upcoming series finale. So he is standing here at the Dark Hedges packing enough explosive secrets to hold an impromptu spoiler auction among the nearby Thrones fans, who would probably pay big to find out who’ll sit on the Iron Throne when the final scene rolls. But he didn’t get this far by blabbing television’s most guarded secrets and subtly changes the subject. “When I applied for Your Highness, I joked with Gemma [his then girlfriend] that I was only doing it so I could meet Natalie Portman.” These days, as a 34-year-old with 10 years in the industry, Gemma is his fiancée and they have two children and a house, with a bed that was bought, indirectly, by the Queen of Dragons herself, Daenerys Targaryen, Emilia Clarke. “Well, she gave me a gift voucher and we bought a mattress with it,” he says, laughing. “In my job, I'm the first person the actors see when they get out of the car on set. I send them where they need to go and chat with them about their family and lives – I mean, it's completely bizarre. “I didn’t really know where I was going in life, and now all this – I guess that happens to a lot of people in the film industry.” Television will certainly never be the same. The show changed the game in terms of what could be accomplished in the confines of high-end broadcast drama, sustaining the epic scope of blockbuster filmmaking over more than 70 hours of storytelling. Simultaneously broadcast in 170 countries, the show’s last seasonwas illegally downloaded more than a billion timesand it’s racked up almost 50 Emmys. The show has won almost 50 Emmy awards The show's creators, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, will be following up Thrones with the relatively-minor task of writing the next Star Wars movie, while cast members like Kit Harrington and Emilia Clarke have gone from unknowns to superstars. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss The Game of Thrones effect extends to birth certificates (the likes of Arya, Khaleesi and Daenerys are now children’s names), tax legislation (the tax break for high-end television drama in the UK is widely credited to the show) and higher education (Time Magazine reported that US universities were increasingly offering courses in medieval studies to satiate demand from Thrones devotees). Back in 2008, Northern Ireland was in the first throes of a prolonged battering by the financial crisis. It ended up suffering the deepest recession and slowest recovery of any UK region. Its film industry, relatively small-time, was almost entirely centred on the UK with no real global recognition. It lacked infrastructure and a skills base. For those tasked with bringing productions here, the place was a tough sell. Richard Williams, head of Northern Ireland Screen, which promotes the film industry, says: “We used to go out to Los Angeles, pitching the value proposition of shooting stuff here. “Famously, we had one meeting that we thought was great. And one of the studios, it turned out as we were leaving, had thought we were New Zealand. We were struggling to make in-roads into the London market, so we looked further afield more, which is why we were trudging around studios in LA trying to pitch ""That's why we were at the Cannes Film Festival year after year, trying to pretend we were more significant than we were.” But NI Screen was ambitious. Harry Treadaway and Saoirse Ronan featured in City of Ember Buoyed by snagging two major studio films for Belfast, City of Ember and Your Highness, they wanted to bring something massive to Northern Ireland. And HBO was looking for somewhere to shoot a new pilot. Somewhere with a British look and sensibility - and cheap. Janet Graham-Borba, HBO's executive vice president of west coast production, who has worked on Thrones since day one, says: “We sent people out to scout in Canada, Eastern Europe, the British Isles. “We came to feel that Northern Ireland was going to be way past perfect. David and Dan [the show’s creators] were familiar with Ireland because they had spent some time at Trinity College (in Dublin), and they loved what was possible in terms of landscapes.” Jay Roewe, HBO’s senior vice-president of production, adds: “The fact that Northern Ireland had not been overly filmed also made us feel as there were things to show the rest of world, on this particular story, that would potentially be new and creatively supportive.” The Paint Hall (right) forms part of Titanic Studios Belfast also had the Paint Hall, a remnant of Belfast's shipbuilding past where parts of the Titanic were built, that had cannily been turned into a huge studio space. And it didn’t hurt that Northern Ireland’s authorities were happy to offer cash incentives to HBO to give the place a chance. Janet says: “On a pure number-crunching basis, Northern Ireland and one other location that shall remain nameless were the best we were going to do financially. “But the really more profound thing was - the story looked like it belonged in Northern Ireland.” Peter Robinson, Ian McElhinney and Martin McGuinness For Jay, the partnership of the then first and deputy first ministers of Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness, was also “critical” in making HBO feel comfortable bringing Thrones to Northern Ireland. Richard Williams of NI Screen says that the government “stepped up to the plate” in a big way. “They made a bold bet. They allowed us to invest very, very heavily in the pilot,” he says. Because it was a bet - that pilot could have tanked and we wouldn't have got anything out of that ""But, at that time, standard TV networks might get one in 10 pilots to air, but with HBO it was more like in two or three – so we had good odds. And how long was it going to be before another HBO pilot was going to come along wanting to shoot in Northern Ireland?” A show as ambitious as Thrones required hundreds of crew from a place that did not have a deep pool of experienced industry workers. Yet, after eight seasons and 10 years, hundreds of local people who, in many instances, had never worked a day in film can say they helped bring Westeros to life. HBO executive Janet said: “There's a phrase: ‘If you can't see it, you can't be it.' So if you don't know that a career is possible, or how you can access it – you can't do it. “But once we started making the show in Belfast, people could see it and people could be it.” Just as production was starting on Game of Thrones’ first season, Stephanie McCutcheon was finished with Manchester. She was in a city where she could “see it” – her dream career as an editor in TV and film – but she was struggling to “be it”. When she was mugged twice in the span of two weeks she decided it was time to come home. Soon after she returned, an old work colleague asked if she wanted a job as a runner for the costumes department on this show Stephanie described as “Belfast, boobs, swords and dragons”. “It was the usual thing,” she recalls. “I was told to come for a day, then I stayed for a week, stayed for a month, then stayed for the season. ""That turned into two seasons."" ""I was very honest and told them from the start that I didn't want to do costumes, which was scary because I didn't want to get sacked. But it worked.” For two seasons, Stephanie ran all over the set, all over Belfast, all over Northern Ireland, picking up fabric, material, bits and bobs, going from location to location, learning the on-set etiquette of when to speak and when to stay quiet. One day, she was urgently asked to iron Cersei Lannister's kimono. “I bricked myself,” she admitted. “I didn't do a very good job but it's one of those moments where you need to do something random. You got into those situations all the time.” On another day, she inadvertently discovered season one's most unexpected twist. “I was picking up costumes from the set and Sean Bean's Ned Stark costume was on the 'dead rail'. “I was thinking: 'Oh, isn't he the lead of the series?' I was getting worried the show wasn't going to do very well.” But the cameras kept rolling. Stephanie transferred to the post-production department for season three, as a runner once again, but a step closer to the editor’s chair. The job came with its own stresses, like picking up film rushes from the set. They don't tell you this, but you have the negatives. If you were to get into a car crash, you would have to ask – which is more valuable, me or the rushes? “It's a horrible thought,” she laughs. “But I did think it.” By season four, she began to get some hands-on experience doing the editing job she always wanted. By season five, she was an assistant editor and since then has worked on other productions such as the Ridley Scott-produced film Morgan, iBoy and on some episodes of The Frankenstein Chronicles, which were filmed in Belfast. “I feel a little bit guilty,” she admits. “I'm very lucky to have gotten that Frankenstein job, because I'm a very young editor. I'm sure there were people side-eyeing me, but I wasn't going to say no.” Sam Donaghy-Bell has lived on the Game of Thrones' set for a decade but he's not here to talk about stars or the twists of George RR Martin’s story – he's never even watched the show. But ask him about cameras, the technology, “the toys”, as he says – and just watch him go. He says: “We had George Lucas visit to speak to David and Dan (Weiss) and everyone was going: 'Oh, my God, George Lucas!' And I was like, 'Yeah, he did Star Wars, but guys – have you seen the new camera gear over here?' Sam worked on film sets from a young age with his TV producer parents. He grew up around live broadcasts, working as a runner, but it was always the cameras that interested  him. He started out as a “humper and lumper” on the electrical department for Your Highness, which confirmed his taste for the film set life, before starting out on Thrones as a runner and then becoming a camera trainee. Like Stephanie, he also moved up the ladder, from trainee to a first assistant camera or “focus puller” – two steps below the director of photography (DOP) who is the person in charge of making every shot epic or beautiful or some combination of the two. Not that Sam wants to be one. Filming in Carnlough, County Antrim, in August 2015 He says: “Being a DOP has never appealed to me. They sit in a tent on a chair staring at two or three monitors, that's their day. Whereas the camera operator is out with the crane, camera on his shoulder, going down ditches, up cliffs. “I don't want to tell people to go and do the things that are in my head, I want to go out and shoot it myself.” For Sam, the good days on set were often the big days, like when 50 horses were charging in a battle scene. It was fun but it was anything but easy. “There were the 55 days of night shoots. I remember most of those because it got down to minus 12 degrees some nights."" It's burnt into your mind as a bad memory to a degree because those were the times the gear stopped working and batteries died “You look back on it and remember it was great but it wasn't at the time – it was horrible! But it was still one of the best experiences anyone in the industry could have.” Ingrid Houwers is in her taxidermy studio, surrounded by all manner of creatures, each suspended in a moment in time. When she moved to Bangor, County Down from Holland in 2006, Ingrid brought a cool box of dead birds on her flight, much to the confusion of the check-in desk. Every other day someone calls her up to tell her about a dead animal they had found at the roadside or come to her door with a bird that met an unfortunate end after colliding with a window. Such is the life of a taxidermist and Ingrid’s been living it for almost 20 years. It’s unusual enough without throwing Game of Thrones into the mix. Ingrid and Cody But film work has become a fascinating sideline for Ingrid, who lives with her husband and her very own ‘direwolf’ Cody, a Northern Inuit related to the canine actors that appeared on the show. She had already been producing animal prop commissions before getting the call from Thrones. I think their first request was a horse-hoof door knocker “And then they came in to have a look and said they could really work with what I was doing on a larger scale.” As an ethical taxidermist, Ingrid only works with animals that have either died of natural causes or have been killed as part of regulated pest control. Since season one, she has supplied the production with animal skins, body parts and full taxidermied animals. Everything from furs to make bedspreads or costumes; game birds for hanging as market displays; animal knuckle bones for dice games played by Westerosi soldiers; even a giant eagle owl which featured in season four on the shoulder of a Thenn warg. Ingrid is one of a host of experts with specialist skills who were brought into the Thrones fold to help bring Westeros to life. Attention to detail has always been crucial in selling George RR Martin’s fantasy epic to the audience. Janet Graham-Borba of HBO explains the philosophy: “If you believe the fire, you’ll believe the dragons. “So much of our fire is real fire and that’s true of other aspects. You will believe Kings Landing if you believe the doorway someone walks through.” Season-after-season, the show’s popularity grew until it seemed to go supernova following the infamous Red Wedding in season three – the scene that launched a million memes. A year later the show received a seal of approval from a real-life royal when the Queen herself visited the Iron Throne during a trip to Belfast in 2014. Then prime minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha also displayed an impressive knowledge when they toured the set at Titanic Studios in 2015. Jay Roewe of HBO said: “You have to remember that when we started the show it was nowhere near the size and scope of where we ended up. Because of the show’s success, every season we had to outdo ourselves.” Standing in his forge in Saintfield, County Down, blacksmith Steve Murphy tells how he played his part. He helped to create one of the show’s biggest props – a medieval siege weapon called a scorpion, which was used by the Lannister army to try to take down Drogon, one of Daenerys’s dragons. He says: “It took about 12 weeks to make and then it was shipped over to Spain to be filmed. I was responsible for dressing it, putting the metal plates on it, making it look the part and the firing mechanism for it as well.” Steve has worked on all eight seasons of Thrones, initially as an extra, before joining the armoury department in season three. They are responsible for creating weapons and making sure no one loses an eye or an arm during a big battle  - not that anything too serious ever happened. As an extra hanging around the set, Steve made a point of telling people if they needed a blacksmith, then he was their man. Later, he got to talking to Tommy Dunne, an Irishman at the head of the armoury department  and showed him some of his work. “With the show getting bigger he needed more people and gave me a call,” says Steve. “They use so many traditional crafts – there are leatherworkers, willow weavers, blacksmiths. All people with a broad range of skills.” Since then, Steve has made swords and shields, forged decorative pieces of metalwork, worked as a standby armourer on set and even popped up in the background in a couple of scenes. On other occasions, his impact has been less subtle. Holding up a hammer at his workshop, he says: “This was used by Jon Snow to kill Styr. They just needed a hammer and they ended up using mine.” Neither taxidermist Ingrid or blacksmith Steve ever thought their careers would take them within touching distance of Hollywood, but their skills have proved indispensable. The downside is the occasional last-minute deadline. Steve says: “In the Battle of the Bastards, the shield wall that the Boltons had – that was just sprung on us last minute. When that happens you just work every hour you can. “If you get the phone call in the middle night telling you that they need such and such, you wouldn’t say no,” echoes Ingrid. “You said: ‘Yes, it’ll be done.’ And then the panic ensued.” Sometimes, producers can ask for something particularly unusual or challenging, which requires developing new skills or finding a workaround – like when Ingrid had to supply wolf-like fur. “With the Stark family, the sigil is a direwolf. But the wolf is a protected species, so getting wolf fur requires a tonne of paperwork and rightly so. “But the coyote is quite similar in colour, although smaller, and they do have a wolfish look and they’re part of pest control in America. So a lot of the ‘wolf skins’ are coyotes, which look the part.” It’s all in a day’s work for the likes of Ingrid and Steve, who now find themselves balancing film work with their day-to-day professions. “Thrones has had a huge impact,” says Steve. “It allowed me to build equipment; I got the opportunity to buy machinery and kit out my workshop. I met my wife through making friends with people on the show.” “I’m just a small cog in a humongous machine,” says Ingrid. “But I’m very proud to be that little small cog.” “All I've ever wanted to do since I was 11 was work in the film industry. And when I finished college I thought I would have to move to London to chase the dream, and it literally landed on our doorstep – the biggest show in the world.” Ryan Tohill is another Game of Thrones ""lifer"" who has spent eight seasons in the show's props department. He’s now making his own way in the film industry as a director. His debut feature film – The Dig - which he has produced with his brother Andrew, will have its Irish premiere in late April. There's talk of UK distribution and his days are now filled with regular Skype calls to his agent and manager in Los Angeles. Ryan has worked not just on Thrones, but also on most of the shows that have arrived in Belfast on its leather coattails like The Frankenstein Chronicles, Krypton, My Mother and Other Strangers. He says: “All through Krypton, I was going home every night to read scripts. I'd fall asleep on the sofa then get up at 05:00 to go to set. To be able to say that and have that be your life and then almost be at the stage where you're complaining about it?” He laughs, shakes his head slowly. I will never have any reason to complain about anything again It all began at Christmas when Ryan and Andrew were 11. Their father received a camcorder and the boys were so taken by the new gadget that they can't even remember what was under the tree for them. As the pair moved into their teens, they kept filming and asking friends to act in whatever movie they were in the middle of making. But their ultimate dream would probably never have been realised without the Thrones effect. The show, says Ryan, allowed “a kid who grew up obsessed with cinema to reach out and touch Hollywood”. “It was an amazing thing.” Thrones has also given local writers a new sense of confidence. They now believe not only that they can get their film or TV show made, but they can get it made in Northern Ireland. Take Derry Girls - Channel 4’s smash-hit comedy was created by Lisa McGee from Derry and directed by Michael Lennox from Belfast. It was shot in locations all across Northern Ireland with mostly local talent on both sides of the camera. Ryan says he and his brother are “living proof” of the role Northern Ireland Screen and its financing plays in the careers of young filmmakers, creatives and crew members. And the experience he gained on the Thrones set was invaluable. “It's fair enough to go to film school but if you really want to learn how the craft works, you've got to get on a film set.You've got to learn very quickly and understand every single cog in the wheel of every department,” he says. “I used to just study the directors and luckily in my job I was always in directors’ rehearsals. I was even sometimes in rehearsals 'priors' with David and Dan, they'd be there rewriting things, trying to find the realism and the truth in the scene. They had so much understanding of how they worked, tweaking, fine-tuning things. It was amazing to see and a privilege.” The Dig was shot over 18 gruelling days in 2017. Even though directing was lightyears from his day job on Thrones, Ryan's on-set knowhow, combined with his brother's experience in documentaries, helped the pair bring the film together. “It was all about practical thinking and that comes from being on set and seeing all these problems – that's what Thrones gave me. “If I was trying to make The Dig 10 years ago, and I had never been on Thrones, the film would have been a disaster. It just wouldn't have happened or it wouldn't have been as good.” In 2018, The Dig was screened at the Toronto Film Festival (TIFF), which attracts almost 500,000 people every year, and won best Irish film at the Galway Film Festival, just weeks after they had held a screening for cast and crew. “The entire Game of Thrones crew turned up, it was brilliant. Northern Ireland film crew are amazing. You spend more time with these people than you do your own family.” When it comes to making the next big show or film, Ryan says it’s not just about having it shot in Northern Ireland – it's about having it written, directed and produced by local people too. “With every generation, there's more confidence,” says Ryan. There's going to be bigger productions coming here after Thrones and for all those young people – it's doable, your film, it can be done “All it takes is to make something and get it into the hands of the right people. Go knock the door. They can't ignore you forever.” There was a world BGOT – before Game of Thrones – even if it’s hard to remember a time without “You know nothing, Jon Snow,” “Hold the door,” “Shame! Shame! Shame!” - and a million other pop culture memes. There will also be a world after, though the people who worked on the show are finding it as difficult to say goodbye as everyone else. “I’m grief-stricken,” says HBO executive Janet Graham-Borba. “It’s been a huge part of my working day for a decade and I’m so proud of what everyone has done. I say very regularly to people that Northern Ireland is one of the best - if not the best - production experience  I’ve ever had and it’s an extraordinary place to work While Janet believes Belfast can “sustain this success” and HBO will be coming back to Northern Ireland later this year to film a prequel pilot, many people who have been trained up and worked on the show are facing their first year without Thrones in almost a decade. Big shows have moved into Northern Ireland during the Thrones’ run – high-profile dramas like Line of Duty and The Fall; genre specialties like The Frankenstein Chronicles and Krypton; success-story comedy Derry Girls; major film productions such as Dracula Untold and The Lost City of Z. But they all existed in the space beside Game of Thrones, not instead of it. The show’s departure will leave a dragon-sized hole to fill. Northern Ireland Screen is “sad but not worried” as Thrones comes to an end, says its chief executive Richard Williams, but he admits nothing can replicate it. “We can find other projects, we can fill our film studios, we can find work and continue to grow and move on to bigger and better things from the platform Game of Thrones has given us. But will we have a single project like it? I don’t think so - we can find more work but it won’t be the same For Sam Donaghy-Bell, there's a “void” now that Thrones has finished and he’s concerned about what comes next. “It's scary now that it's not here. I would happily work on that show for the rest of my life,” he says. But, regardless of what happens next, Sam, Stephanie McCutcheon, Ciaran Colton and many others have the experience of being Thrones ""lifers"" who worked on all eight seasons of the world's biggest TV show and have the tattoos to prove it. Each carries an ""8"" inked in Thrones font and paid for by the show as a symbol of fellowship. It's also a mark of quality. “If, hypothetically, I was asked to do the next Bond or Avengers movie, I could do it no problem,” says Sam. “The ways of working would be exactly the same as Thrones; the hierarchy would be the same. “Because of Thrones, I've learned quicker.” For Stephanie, Thrones didn't just open a door; it opened her eyes to what was possible. If you can see it, you can be it. “I walked into that show thinking: 'I don't know any girl editors.' And there were two female assistants and two female editors. It changed my perspective. “I got a really good footing with the other assistants and at the start I could see that they were only four years older than me – I could see that it's not that far away, that through Thrones I could get there really fast.” “I'm very lucky. I've learned from the best.” Ciaran Colton, meanwhile, hopes if his children Aoibhe and Manus can see it, maybe they can be it too. “They might see me working in the film industry and decide to go for it. That’s the thing about the industry – there’s a role in it for everyone. “Game of Thrones showed that to people. Gave them opportunities, jobs and skills they didn't even know they had. And confidence. I feel like I could work on anything. No job could be as tough as this job.” Built with Shorthand"
Victoria Square resident 'no information',"Residents of the apartments in Belfast on Chichester Street have been directed to vacate the building The management firm of a Belfast apartment complex that was vacated for safety reasons says it cannot ""make any assurances"" on compensation costs for alternative accommodation. On Wednesday, residents at the Victoria Square complex were told to leave the building ""immediately"" due to structural concerns, Victoria Square Residential Management Limited has released a statement. It said the estimated cost of repairs was ""significant"". The firm said this was ""given the technical nature of the work involved"", and that it hoped to start work on site soon. It said it was ""regrettable that this situation will cause inconvenience to the residents of the apartments"", adding it was ""doing all it can to resolve the matter as quickly as possible"". A resident at the complex, Adam Cain, said he found it ""shocking"" that the management company could not ""make any assurances"" on compensation costs. Mr Cain said he was told to vacate the building at short notice with a knock on the door coming as he cooked his dinner. He and his fiancÃ©e are currently staying in hotels. Adam Cain said he was told to vacate the building at short notice The management company said it is estimated that the repair work will take approximately 20 weeks, but that it will ""involve a period of investigation to determine the specific cause of the damage and the parties responsible"". The firm said ""the absolute priority is to protect the structure of the building and ensure the safety of its residents"". It said that ""in order for evacuated residents to return to the building as soon as possible"", it will be ""necessary for the management company to apply its funds in the first instance towards the required repairs"". ""The management company is therefore not in a position to make any assurances in relation to costs incurred by the evacuated residents for alternative accommodation,"" it said. The firm said it ""is possible that some residents may be able to return to their apartments sooner [than] the projected date for completion of the repair works but this cannot be confirmed at this point in time"". ""In the meantime, the management company and its agent will continue to liaise directly with apartment owners affected by the required evacuation,"" it added. ""Throughout this process the management company has kept the owner of Victoria Square Shopping Centre informed about its proposals to repair the structural issue within the residential development."" The company said it maintained the Victoria Square residential development at Chichester Street which has 91 apartments. It said the ""apartment owners are shareholders"" in the management company. This video can not be played Dundalk man, Cian Carroll, was among residents at Belfast's Victoria Square apartment complex that were told to vacate the building Earlier, a Victoria Square resident said he did not know where he and his partner would sleep tonight. Cian Carroll, who is from Dundalk but renting in Belfast, was put up in a nearby hotel by a management company. ""We haven't had any further information so we don't know what's going on, or where we're going to sleep,"" he said. ""I can't get my head around the shops and car park both being open, yet the residents have been told to leave. What's going on?"" Victoria Square is open for business as usual, despite structural issues affecting apartments in the complex. It said it is ""working with the managing agents of the apartments to assist in their investigation"". Mr Carroll told BBC News NI that it was his understanding that 23 residents stayed in a Holiday Inn on Wednesday night and a number of others slept in a Hampton by Hilton hotel in the city centre. ""There has been very little information and if there were any concerns over structural damage before this, we were not privy to it,"" said Mr Carroll, who moved into the apartment block in February. ""We can go back to family in Dundalk, if we have to, but I'm sure there are residents who aren't in that position. ""We're lucky that we don't have any kids to worry about, but I don't know what you'd do if you did."" A letter to residents from McGuinness Fleck estate agency said work was being done to resolve a ""serious structural issue"". A spokesman said the repair would take 20 weeks to complete, but Mr Carroll said he only found this out because it was in the news on Thursday morning. Another resident told BBC News NI: ""We've been told we may be out for a few days, but we've packed for a week. ""It's a bit of an inconvenience but, at the same time, it's an adventure."" The woman, who has lived in the complex for a few months, said there had been ""absolutely no sign of any damage"" in her apartment. A resident, who moved into the complex at the end of March, said two men called at her apartment on Wednesday evening and handed her a letter saying a structural report had revealed a problem. The woman said she was told the apartment ""wasn't safe"" and was advised to move out as the whole block was affected by the issue. A lawyer for the Victoria Square Residential Management Company Ltd said the decision was not ""taken lightly"". Emmet McKeown of Johns Elliot Solicitors, which represents the Victoria Square Residential Management Company Ltd, said that since ""a structural issue was initially identified in February, there has been a process of detailed structural assessments of the building"". Mr McKeown added: ""Engineers have been inspecting the building in coordination with the landlord for Victoria Square Shopping Centre. ""A programme of repair work will now need to be done which is being arranged at the moment. ""A timescale of 20 weeks is what we are currently expecting."" In a statement, Belfast City Council said: ""Structural engineers engaged by the managing agents for the residential properties at Victoria Square contacted our building control team earlier this week to notify us of planned works to resolve a structural issue within the site. ""Our team are now in contact with the structural engineers to ascertain the exact nature and extent of the issue and the timescales involved, and these conversations will continue over the coming days.""

"Rugby star to be fired over anti-gay postRugby Australia says it intends to terminate Israel Folau's contract following a social media post by the full-back in which he said ""hell awaits"" gay people.","Folau has scored 37 tries in 73 games for Australia Rugby Australia and the New South Wales Rugby Union say they intend to terminate Israel Folau's contract after asocial media postby the full-back in which he said ""hell awaits"" gay people. Folau, 30, has 73 caps and was expected to play at this year's World Cup. ""He does not speak for the game with his recent social media posts,"" the governing bodies said. ""In the absence of compelling mitigating factors, it is our intention to terminate his contract."" 'Folau may never play rugby again' Rugby Australia and the NSW Rugby Union, which is responsible for Super Rugby side NSW Waratahs, said they have made ""repeated attempts"" to contact Folau and he has failed to get in touch with either organisation. ""Israel has failed to understand that the expectation of him as a Rugby Australia and NSW Waratahs employee is that he cannot share material on social media that condemns, vilifies or discriminates against people on the basis of their sexuality,"" the governing bodies said in a statement. ""As a code we have made it clear to Israel formally and repeatedly that any social media posts or commentary that is in any way disrespectful to people because of their sexuality will result in disciplinary action."" Australia's sponsor Qantas, whose chief executive Alan Joyce is openly gay, said Folau's post was ""really disappointing"". ""These comments clearly don't reflect the spirit of inclusion and diversity that we support,"" the airline said. Folau, who signed a four-year deal with the Waratahs in March and had a deal with Rugby Australia until 2022,escaped punishmentfor similar comments last year, with Rugby Australia saying it accepted - but did not support - his ""position"".

"Sudan military says it has seized powerAfter mass protests, the military says it has ousted and arrested long-time leader Omar al-Bashir.Africa","This video can not be played The announcement was made by the defence minister Awad Ibn Auf Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has been ousted and arrested by the military after nearly 30 years in power. Speaking on state TV, defence minister Awad Ibn Auf said the army would oversee a two-year transitional period followed by elections. He also said a three-month state of emergency was being put in place. Protesters, however, have vowed to stay on the streets despite an overnight curfew being imposed by the military. Demonstrations against Mr Bashir, who has governed Sudan since 1989, have been taking place for several months. The protesters are now demanding a civilian council to lead the transition rather than a military one, correspondents say. Sudan's unrest in 300 words Bashir ousted: Five significant moments ""I announce as minister of defence the toppling of the regime and detaining its chief in a secure place,"" Mr Ibn Auf said in a statement. Mr Bashir's exact whereabouts are not known. Mr Ibn Auf said the country had been suffering from ""poor management, corruption, and an absence of justice"" and he apologised ""for the killing and violence that took place"". Some people celebrated in Khartoum after the army announcement He said Sudan's constitution was being suspended, border crossings were being shut until further notice and airspace was being closed for 24 hours. Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? As the news broke, crowds of protesters celebrated outside army headquarters in the capital, Khartoum, embracing soldiers and climbing on top of armoured vehicles. Sudan's intelligence service said it was freeing all political prisoners. Anti-government protesters have been cheering the military Mr Bashir is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which accuses him of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan's western Darfur region. However it is not clear what will happen to him following his arrest. This is a military coup with no clear roadmap for how the generals plan to hand over power to civilian rule. The fear will be that they have no such intention. The security elite has calculated that removing Omar al-Bashir and imposing a curfew will buy them time and end the protests. If so this represents a serious miscalculation. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) - which has spearheaded the demonstrations - and other civil society groups have made it clear they  won't accept a cosmetic change. They have the numbers and are highly organised. The military has the guns and the capacity for imposing brutal repression. But what then? A crackdown will not resolve the desperate economic crisis that brought years of simmering resentment on to the streets last December. There is also the question of the cracks within the Sudanese security establishment, evident during the clashes between soldiers and intelligence/militia forces in recent days. It is a volatile and unpredictable situation that demands cool heads and compromise on the part of the military. The stability of Sudan depends on how they react to continued protests. Early on Thursday, military vehicles entered the large compound in Khartoum housing the defence ministry, the army headquarters and Mr Bashir's personal residence. State TV and radio later interrupted programming to say the army would be making a statement. Omar al-Bashir has been in power since 1989 Meanwhile, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through central Khartoum, some chanting: ""It has fallen, we won."" The SPA said the military had announced a ""coup"" that would merely reproduce the same ""faces and institutions that our great people revolted against"". It urged people to continue the sit-in outside military headquarters and to stay on the streets of cities across the country. ""Those who destroyed the country and killed the people are seeking to steal every drop of blood and sweat that the Sudanese people poured in their revolution that shook the throne of tyranny,"" the statement read. The SPA has previously said that any transitional administration must not include anyone from what it called the ""tyrannical regime"". A young woman who became a symbol of the protests also dismissed the military announcement. Alaa Salah, nicknamed ""Kandaka"" or ""Nubian queen"" after she was filmed leading chants against the government, accused the authorities of ""hoodwinking"" the people. Allow Twitter content?

The protests were originally sparked by a rise in the cost of living, but demonstrators then began calling for the president to resign and his government to go. This video can not be played Anti-Bashir protesters celebrate Government officials said 38 people had died since December but Human Rights Watch said the number was higher. In February, it looked as though the president might step down, but insteadMr Bashir declared a state of national emergency. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed for ""calm and utmost restraint by all"" and urged a transition that would meet the ""democratic aspirations"" of the people. The UN Security Council is to discuss the situation in a closed-door meeting on Friday called by the US, France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Poland, diplomats said. UK Foreign SecretaryJeremy Hunt said that a two-year military council was ""not the answer"",external. ""We need to see a swift move to an inclusive, representative, civilian leadership.  And we need to ensure there's no more violence,"" he said on Twitter. The African Union condemned the military takeover. AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat said it was not an appropriate response to the challenges facing the country and the aspirations of its people. Russia, which has twice hosted Mr Bashir, called for calm and said it was monitoring the situation. Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov expressed hope that bilateral ties would not be damaged, whoever was in power. This video can not be played Sudan protests: So what's going on? Amnesty International's Secretary General Kumi Naidoo praised the courage of the Sudanese people but said he was ""alarmed by the raft of emergency measures"" announced by the military. In a statement, he also said that justice was ""long overdue"" for Mr Bashir. ""Omar al-Bashir is wanted for some of the most odious human rights violations of our generation and we need to finally see him held accountable,"" Mr Naidoo added. Formerly an army officer, he seized power in a military coup in 1989. His rule has been marked by civil war. The civil conflict with the south of the country ended in 2005 and South Sudan became independent in 2011. Another civil conflict has been taking place in the western region of Darfur. Mr Bashir is accused of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity there by the ICC. Read profile Despite an international arrest warrant issued by the ICC, he won consecutive elections in 2010 and 2015. However, his last victory was marred by a boycott by the main opposition parties. The arrest warrant has led to an international travel ban. However, Mr Bashir has made diplomatic visits to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.

"Murdoch wins backing to merge Times titlesRupert Murdoch's Times and the Sunday Times should be allowed to pool resources, the government rules.","Rupert Murdoch bought the Times titles in 1981 Rupert Murdoch's Times and the Sunday Times should be free to merge editorial departments, the government has ruled. Culture secretary Jeremy Wright said he was ""minded"" to allow News UK's request that the two newspapers should be allowed to share journalism resources. When the papers were bought in 1981 Mr Murdoch gave legal undertakings to keep them separate. But News UK has argued that the competitive landscape has changed, especially in the digital era. The papers employ 505 people between them. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport will now take more evidence before a final verdict. Mr Wright said in a statement:,external""I am... minded to accept News UK's application. However, in considering the proposed new undertakings as a whole, I have noted that the existing governance arrangements - agreed in 1981 - lack clarity and certainty over roles and responsibilities. Murdoch asks to merge Times titles ""Before agreeing the application I am therefore of the view that these arrangements need to be suitably updated and enhanced to reflect corporate best practice."" News UK has said the change would allow more flexibility to share resources across the titles, while continuing to commit to them remaining as separate newspapers with separate editors. In its application,external, News UK had listed a number of factors affecting the industry, including the fall in circulation as readers shift online. At the time, it said that ""virtually all"" other major UK national appeared to have integrated their editions. News UK welcomed Mr Wright's announcement and his acknowledgement that ""a material change of circumstances"" since 1981 justified merging the newspapers' resources. ""The Times and The Sunday Times are committed to remaining as separate newspapers but persistent cost pressures facing our industry means both titles need the freedom and ability to work more closely to avoid unnecessary duplication.

New Brexit deadline set for 31 October,"This video can not be played May on Brexit extension: ""The UK should have left the EU by now"" European Union leaders have granted the UK a six-month extension to Brexit, after late-night talks in Brussels. The new deadline - 31 October - averts the prospect of the UK having to leave the EU without a deal on Friday, as MPs are still deadlocked over a deal. European Council President Donald Tusk said his ""message to British friends"" was ""please do not waste this time"". Theresa May, who had wanted a shorter delay, said the UK would still aim to leave the EU as soon as possible. The UK must now hold European elections in May, or leave on 1 June without a deal. The prime minister will later make a statement on the Brussels summit to the House of Commons, while talks with the Labour Party, aimed at reaching consensus on how to handle Brexit, are set to continue. Mrs Maytweeted:,external""The choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear. So we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal that is in the national interest."" What happens next? Brexit: A really simple guide Trick or treat? Halloween deadline is both So far, MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Mrs May reached with other European leaders last year and they have voted against leaving the EU without a deal. The EU has ruled out any renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement. Before the summit, Mrs May had told leaders she wanted to move the UK's exit date from this Friday to 30 June, with the option of leaving earlier if Parliament ratified her agreement. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer called the delay to 31 October ""a good thing"", saying businesses would be ""relieved"". He added: ""Negotiations are in good faith. We all feel a deep sense of duty to break the impasse. ""But there's also this question of how on Earth do we ensure that anything this prime minister promises is actually delivered in the future because of course she's already said she's going to step down, probably within months."" One government minister told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg the latest delay to Brexit could mean a Conservative Party leadership contest after Easter, with a new prime minister potentially in place by June. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said: ""There's been no progress whatsoever, really."" He added that it was still ""difficult to see how"" Mrs May could get her deal with the EU through Parliament and said: ""The pressure on her to go will increase dramatically now, I suspect."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted,externalher ""relief"" that the UK wouldn't be ""crashing out"" on Friday, adding that ""allowing people to decide if they still want to leave is now imperative"". A Brexit extension ""only as long as necessary"" and ""no longer than 31 October"" to allow for the ratification of the withdrawal agreement The UK ""must hold the elections to the European Parliament"" and if it fails to do this, the UK will leave on 1 June The European Council reiterates there can be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement negotiations Read the EU's conclusions here.,external What is Theresa May's withdrawal agreement? Donald Tusk emerged from the talks - and a subsequent meeting with Mrs May - to address reporters at a news conference at 02:15 local time (01:15 BST). ""The course of action will be entirely in the UK's hands,"" he said. ""They can still ratify the withdrawal agreement, in which case the extension can be terminated."" This video can not be played Tusk on Brexit extension: ""Please do not waste this time"" Mr Tusk said the UK could also rethink its strategy or choose to ""cancel Brexit altogether"". He added: ""Let me finish with a message to our British friends: This extension is as flexible as I expected, and a little bit shorter than I expected, but it's still enough to find the best possible solution. Please do not waste this time."" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: ""There will probably be a European election in the UK - that might seem a bit odd, but rules are rules and we must respect European law and then we will see what happens."" Mrs May spoke at 02:45 local time (01:45 BST). She said that, although the delay extends until 31 October, the UK can leave before then if MPs pass her withdrawal deal. This video can not be played BBC's Adam Fleming explains how the EU agreed a Brexit delay. ""I know that there is huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension,"" she said. ""The UK should have left the EU by now and I sincerely regret the fact that I have not yet been able to persuade Parliament to approve a deal."" She added: ""I do not pretend the next few weeks will be easy, or there is a simple way to break the deadlock in Parliament. But we have a duty as politicians to find a way to fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. Nothing is more pressing or more vital."" The PM said the UK would ""continue to hold full membership rights and obligations [of the EU]"" during the delay. You couldn't quite make it up. The new Brexit deadline is, you guessed it, Halloween. So to get all the terrible metaphors about horror shows, ghosts and ghouls out of the way right now, let's consider straight away some of the reasons why this decision is a treat in one sense, but could be a trick too. A treat? First and most importantly, the EU has agreed to put the brakes on. We will not leave tomorrow without a deal. The prime minister's acceptance that leaving the EU without a formal arrangement in place could be a disaster won out. And there are quite a few potential tricks. This new October deadline might not solve very much at all. This could, although I hate to say it, just make way for months of extra gridlock before the UK and the EU find themselves back here in a similar situation in the autumn. Read Laura's blog here The EU had been split over the length of delay to offer the UK, and by law its other 27 member states had to reach a unanimous decision. Although other countries backed a longer delay, French President Emmanuel Macron pushed for a shorter extension. He called the 31 October deadline ""a good solution"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel had argued for a longer delay Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said the extension gave the UK time ""to come to a cross-party agreement"". Fudge and can-kicking are the EU-familiar words that spring to mind at the end of this Brexit summit. After all the drama and speculation leading up to the meeting, effectively all that happened here is that the threat of a no-deal Brexit has been postponed for another six months. Time enough for the EU to hold European parliamentary elections, choose a new president of the European Commission and pass a new budget - without EU leaders having to keep one eye at least on the day-to-day dramas in the House of Commons. Despite EU leaders' rhetoric beforehand, they granted this extension without hearing a convincing plan of Brexit action from Theresa May. In the summit conclusions there is no evidence of the punitive safeguards mooted to ensure the UK ""behaves itself"" - refraining from blocking EU decisions - as long as it remains a club member. Yes, EU leaders worry about who might replace Theresa May as prime minister. Yes, they're concerned these six months could fly past with the UK as divided as ever but their message to the UK tonight was: ""We've done our bit. Now you do yours. It's up to you. Please use the time well.""

May updates MPs on Brexit delay,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""If we want to get on with leaving, we need to start this process soon."" Theresa May has told MPs it remains her ""priority"" to deliver Brexit, defending the decision to delay the UK's exit from the EU. The new deadline of 31 October means the UK is likely to have to hold European Parliament elections in May. The prime minister said that if the deal agreed with the EU was passed, the UK could leave the EU ""as soon as possible"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the latest delay a ""diplomatic failure"". The prime minister promised to pursue an ""orderly"" Brexit, adding that the ""whole country"" was ""frustrated"". Brexit was originally set to happen on 29 March. But after MPs repeatedly rejected Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU, the deadline was put back to 12 April. The new 31 October deadline averts the prospect of the UK having to leave the EU without a deal this Friday. Delay puts Brexit storm on pause - for now What happens next? Brexit: A really simple guide Delay puts Brexit storm on pause - for now The government said on Thursday it would ""continue to make all necessary preparations"" for a no-deal Brexit, after it was reported that departments had stood down their planning. A government source said ""plans will evolve and adapt"" but would not stop, while the chance of leaving the EU without an agreement remained. The source added that a leaked message referring to the ""winding down"" of no deal preparation related only to Operation Yellowhammer, the contingency planning operation based on worst-case scenarios - and not no-deal planning in general. Under EU rules, the UK will have to hold European Parliament elections in May, or face leaving on 1 June without a deal. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mrs May said she ""profoundly"" regretted her deal not being agreed to by MPs. She said: ""The whole country is intensely frustrated that this process of leaving the European Union has not been completed."" On the latest delay, she said: ""The choices we face are stark and the timetable is clear. I believe we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal that is in the national interest."" And she told MPs that the UK would hold full EU membership rights during the extension, saying the country ""would continue to be bound by all our ongoing obligations as a member state, including the duty of sincere co-operation"". The government is continuing to hold talks with Labour aimed at achieving a consensus on how to break the deadlock in Parliament. Mrs May and Mr Corbyn had a ""short meeting"" on Thursday, Labour said. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says the Article 50 delay is a ""diplomatic failure"" In Parliament, Mrs May said: ""Reaching an agreement will not be easy, because to be successful it will require both sides to make compromises. ""But however challenging it may be politically, I profoundly believe that in this unique situation where the House is deadlocked, it is incumbent on both front benches to seek to work together to deliver what the British people voted for."" In response, Mr Corbyn said: ""The second extension in the space of a fortnight represents not only a diplomatic failure but is another milestone in the government's mishandling of the entire Brexit process."" Can the UK revoke Article 50? How could another Brexit referendum work? What is Theresa May's withdrawal agreement? How UK is gearing up for European elections How do European elections work? He added: ""The prime minister has stuck rigidly to a flawed plan and now the clock has run down, leaving Britain in limbo and adding to the deep uncertainty of business, workers and people all across this country."" Mr Corbyn said cross-party talks were ""serious, detailed and ongoing"", but warned that the government would ""have to compromise"". If no agreement was possible, he said: ""We believe all options should remain on the table, including the option of a public vote."" Shortly- Talks continue between the Conservatives and Labour on how to end the Brexit impasse 23 April- MPs return from Parliament's Easter recess 2 May- Local elections take place in England and Northern Ireland 23 May- European Parliament elections are scheduled to happen in the UK, if MPs do not back Theresa May's agreement with the EU in time to avert them 31 October- The UK leaves the EU, unless MPs back the withdrawal agreement in advance of this deadline Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, urged Mrs May to use the extra time to hold a second EU referendum.

""It's now a very real possibility that we can remain in the European Union,"" he said.

India's marathon election kicks offTurnout has been high on the first day of voting in India's mammoth election - the world's biggest.,"This video can not be played India's elections: Why you should care Tens of millions of Indians have voted on the first day of a general election that is being seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Indians in 20 states and union territories cast their ballots in 91 constituencies. The seven-phase vote to elect a new lower house of parliament will continue until 19 May. Counting day is 23 May. With 900 million eligible voters across the country, this is the largest election ever seen. Some observers have billed the vote as the most important in decades and the tone of the campaign has been acrimonious. Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a historic landslide in the last elections in 2014.  He stakes his claim to lead India on a tough image and remains the governing BJP's main vote-getter. But critics say his promises of economic growth and job creation haven't met expectations, and India has become more religiously polarised under his leadership. As it happened: First day of voting The BJP faces challenges from strong regional parties and a resurgent Congress party, led by Rahul Gandhi.  Mr Gandhi's father, grandmother and great-grandfather were all Indian prime ministers. His sister, Priyanka Gandhi, formally launched her political career in January. Mr Modi has made national security a key election issue The Lok Sabha, or lower house of parliament, has 543 elected seats and any party or coalition needs a minimum of 272 MPs to form a government. Hundreds of voters began to queue up outside polling centres early Thursday morning for the first of seven days of voting over six weeks. Their concerns ranged from jobs and unemployment to India's role in the world and national security. Many, like Dashami Majumdar, a 23 year old with two children, were focused on local issues - namely ""better roads"". ""Nobody tells me who to vote for, my vote is mine, my vote is my independence,"" she told the BBC in Cooch Behar, in West Bengal. Another voter there, Shzina Bibi, a 28-year-old housewife with two children, said she was looking at what the political parties, not individual candidates, would do for Indian society. ""We need more communal peace in India. We need to live together with more tolerance,"" she said. But in some places, voters were furious to find they were not on the rolls. In the southern state of Telangana, Shobhana Kamineni was distraught to find that she was not able to cast a ballot. ""This is a crime against me as a citizen and I will not tolerate it,"" she told BBC Telugu. A little boy clutches his father outside a polling booth in Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh state In Baghpat, a constituency in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, scores of Muslim and Dalit (formerly ""untouchable"") voters also complained that their names were missing. Violence also flared in several places. Two people died in separate clashes at polling stations in southern Andhra Pradesh state. In central Chhattisgarh state, suspected Maoist rebels detonated an IED device near a polling booth at about 04:00 local time (22:30 GMT) -  no injuries were reported. Modi The man who wants 900m votes A really simple guide to Indiaâs general election 900m voters, 39 days: 11 things about India polls Modi's struggle to connect with the south It is mind-bogglingly vast - about 900 million people above the age of 18 will be eligible to cast their ballots at one million polling stations. At the last election, voter turnout was about 66%. No voter is meant to have to travel more than 2km to reach a polling station. Because of the enormous number of election officials and security personnel involved, voting is taking place in seven stages between 11 April and 19 May. More than 140 million people were eligible to vote in the first phase of the election on Thursday. Indian lambadi tribeswomen at a polling station in southern India The states and union territories that went to the polls were: Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar islands and Lakshadweep. Polling in some states, such as Andhra Pradesh and Nagaland, concluded in one day. But other states, such as Uttar Pradesh, will hold polls in several phases. India's historic first election in 1951-52 took three months to complete. Between 1962 and 1989, elections were completed in four to 10 days. The four-day elections in 1980 were the country's shortest ever. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, and his sister Priyanka Gandhi, come from a political dynasty Hundreds of millions of Indians have escaped poverty since the turn of the millennium but huge challenges remain. Under Mr Modi, the world's sixth-largest economy appears to have lost some of its momentum. Although annual GDP growth has hovered at about 7%, unemployment is a major concern. Mr Modi's government has been accused of hiding uncomfortable jobs data. In fact, a leaked government report suggests thatthe unemployment rate is the highest it has been since the 1970s. Farm incomes have also stagnated because of a crop glut and declining commodity prices, which have left farmers saddled with debt. Unsurprisingly both parties have targeted the rural poor in their campaign manifestos. The BJP has promised a slew of welfare schemes for India's farmers, while Congress has promised a minimum income scheme for the country's 50 million poorest families. The low-caste leader taking on Indiaâs Modi Has India's government kept its promises? WhatsApp: The 'black hole' of fake news in India's election National security is also in the spotlight this election after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir in February. India then carried out unprecedented air strikes in Pakistan. Since then, the BJP has made national security a key plank in its campaign.

India's marathon election kicks off,"This video can not be played India's elections: Why you should care Tens of millions of Indians have voted on the first day of a general election that is being seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Indians in 20 states and union territories cast their ballots in 91 constituencies. The seven-phase vote to elect a new lower house of parliament will continue until 19 May. Counting day is 23 May. With 900 million eligible voters across the country, this is the largest election ever seen. Some observers have billed the vote as the most important in decades and the tone of the campaign has been acrimonious.

Judge Michael Wigney said he was ""not satisfied"" that the incidents detailed in The Daily Telegraph, published by Nationwide News, had occurred. He said Mr Rush's former co-star Eryn Norvill's evidence was ""inconsistent"". He also said she was ""prone to exaggeration and embellishment"". Judge Wigney ruled that Mr Rush, 67, should be awarded A$850,000 (Â£464,420; $608,680) and would be entitled to more compensation, the exact amount of which would be decided at a later date.

Ã¢ÂÂThree-personÃ¢ÂÂ baby boy born in GreeceThe baby was conceived using an experimental form of IVF that has been criticised by some experts.Health,"The baby was conceived using an experimental form of IVF Fertility doctors in Greece and Spain say they have produced a baby from three people in order to overcome a woman's infertility. The baby boy was born weighing 2.9kg (6lbs) on Tuesday. The mother and child are said to be in good health. The doctors say they are ""making medical history"" which could help infertile couples around the world. But some experts in the UK say the procedure raises ethical questions and should not have taken place. The experimental form of IVF uses an egg from the mother, sperm from the father, and another egg from a donor woman. It was developed to help families affected by deadly mitochondrial diseases which are passed down from mother to baby. It has been tried in only one such case - a family from Jordan - and that provoked much controversy. But some fertility doctors believe the technology could increase the odds of IVF too. First 'three person baby' born Three-person babies IVF technique âsafeâ The girl with three biological parents This is all about mitochondria - they are the tiny compartments inside nearly every cell of the body that convert food into useable energy. They are defective in mitochondrial diseases so combining the mother's DNA with a donor's mitochondria could prevent disease. But there is also speculation mitochondria may have a role in a successful pregnancy too. That claim has not been tested. The patient was a 32-year-old woman in Greece who had endured four unsuccessful cycles of IVF. She is now a mother, but her son has a tiny amount of his genetic makeup from the donor woman as mitochondria have their own DNA. Dr Panagiotis Psathas, president of the Institute of Life in Athens, said: ""A woman's inalienable right to become a mother with her own genetic material became a reality. ""We are very proud to announce an international innovation in assisted reproduction, and we are now in a position to make it possible for women with multiple IVF failures or rare mitochondrial genetic diseases to have a healthy child.""

In February 2018, the doctors in Newcastle who pioneered the technology were given permission to create the UK's first three-person babies. The fertility regulator approved two attempts, both in families with rare mitochondrial diseases. Some doctors in the UK argued the two applications - fertility and disease prevention - are morally very different. Tim Child, from the University of Oxford and the medical director of The Fertility Partnership, said: ""I'm concerned that there's no proven need for the patient to have her genetic material removed from her eggs and transferred into the eggs of a donor. ""The risks of the technique aren't entirely known, though may be considered acceptable if being used to treat mitochondrial disease, but not in this situation.

The 52-year-old Australian was arrested in April 2019 at the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he had been staying since 2012. He sought asylum at the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden on a rape allegation that he denied - and claimed was a ploy to hand him over to the US.

Profile: Julian Assange,"Julian Assange spent years fighting extradition to the US To his supporters, Julian Assange is a valiant campaigner for truth. To his critics, he is a publicity seeker who has endangered lives by putting a mass of sensitive information into the public domain. Assange is described by those who have worked with him as intense, driven and highly intelligent, with an exceptional ability to crack computer codes. He set up Wikileaks, which publishes confidential documents and images, in 2006, making headlines around the world in April 2010 when it released footage showing US soldiers shooting dead 18 civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. But later that year the Australian was detained in the UK - and later bailed - after Sweden issued an international arrest warrant over allegations of sexual assault. Assange argued it was a ploy to ultimately extradite to the US to face espionage charges - kicking off a legal saga which has now spanned 14 years, embroiled five countries and reached some of the world's highest courts. But the 52-year-old is now free - bailed and on his way to the Northern Mariana Islands - where he is on Wednesday expected to plead guilty to a single charge after reaching a deal with US authorities. He is expected to be released immediately, given the time he has already served in prison in the UK, and will return to Australia. Follow live reaction to the Assange plea deal Wikileaks founder Julian Assange freed after US plea deal A timeline of the Julian Assange saga Assange has been generally reluctant to talk about his background, but media interest since the emergence of Wikileaks has thrown up some insight into his influences. He was born in Townsville in the Australian state of Queensland in 1971, and led a rootless childhood while his parents ran a touring theatre. He became a father at 18 and custody battles soon followed. The development of the internet gave him a chance to use his early promise at maths, though this too led to difficulties. After pleading guilty to ""hacking"", Assange escaped prison on the condition he did not reoffend In 1995 Assange was accused, with a friend, of dozens of hacking activities. Though the group of hackers was skilled enough to track detectives tracking them, Assange was eventually caught and pleaded guilty. He was fined several thousand Australian dollars - only escaping a prison term on the condition that he did not reoffend. He dabbled in the world of academia - co-writing a bestselling book on the emerging, subversive side of the internet, before studying physics and maths. Assange began Wikileaks in 2006 with a group of like-minded people from across the web, creating a web-based ""dead-letterbox"" for would-be leakers. ""[To] keep our sources safe, we have had to spread assets, encrypt everything, and move telecommunications and people around the world to activate protective laws in different national jurisdictions,"" he told the BBC in 2011. ""We've become good at it, and never lost a case, or a source, but we can't expect everyone to go through the extraordinary efforts that we do."" Assange told the BBC that in order to protect sources he would ""encrypt everything"" Adopting a nomadic lifestyle, he ran Wikileaks from temporary, shifting locations. He could go for long stretches without eating and focus on work with very little sleep, according to Raffi Khatchadourian, a reporter for the New Yorker magazine who spent several weeks travelling with him. ""He creates this atmosphere around him where the people who are close to him want to care for him, to help keep him going. I would say that probably has something to do with his charisma."" But it was in 2010 that Wikileaks - and Assange - really shot to prominence, with the release of the footage of the US helicopter firing on civilians in Iraq. He promoted and defended the video, as well as the massive release of classified US military documents on the Afghan and Iraq wars in July and October 2010. The whistleblowing website went on to release new tranches of documents, including five million confidential emails from US-based intelligence company Stratfor. It soon found itself fighting for survival, when a number of US financial institutions began to block donations. And shortly after, Swedish authorities began chasing him for questioning over claims that he had raped one woman and sexually molested and coerced another in August 2010, while on a visit to Stockholm to give a lecture. By the end of 2010, an international warrant had been issued for his arrest. From the embassy's balcony in 2012, Assange urged the US to end its ""witchhunt"" against Wikileaks Assange says the encounters were entirely consensual - and the rape allegations were part of a politically motivated smear campaign - spending a year and a half challenging the warrant in court. When the UK Supreme Court upheld it, Assange turned to then Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa for help, the two men having expressed similar views on freedom in the past. In June 2012 he sought asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London to avoid extradition. His stay at the embassy was punctuated by occasional press statements and interviews. He made a submission to the UK's Leveson Inquiry into press standards, saying he had faced ""widespread inaccurate and negative media coverage"". It was during this time that concerns over his health first began to surface - but Assange dismissed reports that he would be leaving the embassy to seek medical treatment. Assange dismissed reports in 2014 that he would be leaving the embassy to seek medical treatment After spending almost seven years inside the embassy, Assange was dramatically dragged from the premises and arrested by British police on 11 April 2019. Ecuadorean President LenÃ­n Moreno - who said he had ""inherited"" the situation from his predecessor - tweeted that his country had taken ""a sovereign decision"", to withdraw his asylum status. Mr Moreno and his government had grown increasingly frustrated with Assange and his refusal to follow the rules they had imposed for his continued stay in the embassy. There were ""repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols"" by Assange, he said in a video statement. But Ecuador had requested that Great Britain guarantee that Assange would not be extradited to a country where he could face torture or the death penalty, Mr Moreno added. In 2019 Met Police officers dragged Assange out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he had stayed since 2012 Assange was taken into custody at a central London police station - charged with failing to surrender to court back in 2012 - and on 1 May 2019 was sentenced to 50 weeks in jail. In the following weeks, Swedish prosecutors promptly reopened their investigation into the 2010 rape claims and the US publicly charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act, related to the publication of classified documents in 2010. The US Department of Justice has described the leaks as ""one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States"". Wikileaks said the announcement was ""madness"" and ""the end of national security journalism"". As Assange prepared to fight against extradition to the US, Swedish prosecutors announced that the investigation into the 2010 rape allegation had been dropped, because the evidence against Assange was ""not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment"". Since then his case has been tied up in legal back-and-forth and a series of appeals. In 2021, a British court ruled in his favour, blocking his extradition - but that was later successfully appealed by the US government. And just last month the UK Supreme Court decided that Assange could appeal the US extradition order - again. All the while, Assange has sat in London's maximum security Belmarsh Prison. It was there that in 2022 he married his partner of seven years, Stella Moris, a South African lawyer and long-time member of his legal team. She is also the mother of Assange's two young children, who were conceived while Assange was living in the Ecuadorean embassy. This video can not be played Julian Assangeâs wife said she dreaded going public with their relationship His family have long said his health was steadily and dramatically declining and they feared he would die or kill himself. As the saga has dragged on, the UK and the US have faced growing pressure - from public campaign and from Assange's home country of Australia - to resolve the case. In February Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the country as a whole shared the view that ""enough is enough"". ""This thing cannot just go on and on and on indefinitely"". Rights groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have all called for his release, saying his treatment has been cruel and his case a threat to press freedom. He's also won support from countless figures of global power and influence, including former leader of the UK Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn, linguist Noam Chomsky, Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, and the late fashion icon Dame Vivienne Westwood. The late Dame Vivienne Westwood had appeared at rallies calling for Assange's release But his critics - which include former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and retiring Republican stalwart Mitch McConnell- say he is not a journalist and endangers lives by publishing troves of documents without redaction. After the final hearing on Wednesday in the US territory of Saipan - a Pacific island north of Guam - he is expected to return to Australia and be reunited with his family. They have expressed relief and thanked his supporters. ""I am grateful that my son's ordeal is finally coming to an end. This shows the importance and power of quiet diplomacy,"" his mother Christine Assange said in a statement.

India's marathon election kicks offTurnout has been high on the first day of voting in India's mammoth election - the world's biggest.India,"This video can not be played India's elections: Why you should care Tens of millions of Indians have voted on the first day of a general election that is being seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Indians in 20 states and union territories cast their ballots in 91 constituencies. The seven-phase vote to elect a new lower house of parliament will continue until 19 May. Counting day is 23 May. With 900 million eligible voters across the country, this is the largest election ever seen. Some observers have billed the vote as the most important in decades and the tone of the campaign has been acrimonious. Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a historic landslide in the last elections in 2014.  He stakes his claim to lead India on a tough image and remains the governing BJP's main vote-getter. But critics say his promises of economic growth and job creation haven't met expectations, and India has become more religiously polarised under his leadership. As it happened: First day of voting The BJP faces challenges from strong regional parties and a resurgent Congress party, led by Rahul Gandhi.  Mr Gandhi's father, grandmother and great-grandfather were all Indian prime ministers. His sister, Priyanka Gandhi, formally launched her political career in January. Mr Modi has made national security a key election issue The Lok Sabha, or lower house of parliament, has 543 elected seats and any party or coalition needs a minimum of 272 MPs to form a government. Hundreds of voters began to queue up outside polling centres early Thursday morning for the first of seven days of voting over six weeks. Their concerns ranged from jobs and unemployment to India's role in the world and national security. Many, like Dashami Majumdar, a 23 year old with two children, were focused on local issues - namely ""better roads"". ""Nobody tells me who to vote for, my vote is mine, my vote is my independence,"" she told the BBC in Cooch Behar, in West Bengal. Another voter there, Shzina Bibi, a 28-year-old housewife with two children, said she was looking at what the political parties, not individual candidates, would do for Indian society. ""We need more communal peace in India. We need to live together with more tolerance,"" she said. But in some places, voters were furious to find they were not on the rolls. In the southern state of Telangana, Shobhana Kamineni was distraught to find that she was not able to cast a ballot. ""This is a crime against me as a citizen and I will not tolerate it,"" she told BBC Telugu. A little boy clutches his father outside a polling booth in Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh state In Baghpat, a constituency in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, scores of Muslim and Dalit (formerly ""untouchable"") voters also complained that their names were missing. Violence also flared in several places. Two people died in separate clashes at polling stations in southern Andhra Pradesh state. In central Chhattisgarh state, suspected Maoist rebels detonated an IED device near a polling booth at about 04:00 local time (22:30 GMT) -  no injuries were reported. Modi The man who wants 900m votes A really simple guide to Indiaâs general election 900m voters, 39 days: 11 things about India polls Modi's struggle to connect with the south It is mind-bogglingly vast - about 900 million people above the age of 18 will be eligible to cast their ballots at one million polling stations. At the last election, voter turnout was about 66%. No voter is meant to have to travel more than 2km to reach a polling station. Because of the enormous number of election officials and security personnel involved, voting is taking place in seven stages between 11 April and 19 May. More than 140 million people were eligible to vote in the first phase of the election on Thursday. Indian lambadi tribeswomen at a polling station in southern India The states and union territories that went to the polls were: Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar islands and Lakshadweep. Polling in some states, such as Andhra Pradesh and Nagaland, concluded in one day. But other states, such as Uttar Pradesh, will hold polls in several phases. India's historic first election in 1951-52 took three months to complete. Between 1962 and 1989, elections were completed in four to 10 days. The four-day elections in 1980 were the country's shortest ever. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, and his sister Priyanka Gandhi, come from a political dynasty Hundreds of millions of Indians have escaped poverty since the turn of the millennium but huge challenges remain. Under Mr Modi, the world's sixth-largest economy appears to have lost some of its momentum. Although annual GDP growth has hovered at about 7%, unemployment is a major concern. Mr Modi's government has been accused of hiding uncomfortable jobs data. In fact, a leaked government report suggests thatthe unemployment rate is the highest it has been since the 1970s. Farm incomes have also stagnated because of a crop glut and declining commodity prices, which have left farmers saddled with debt. Unsurprisingly both parties have targeted the rural poor in their campaign manifestos. The BJP has promised a slew of welfare schemes for India's farmers, while Congress has promised a minimum income scheme for the country's 50 million poorest families. The low-caste leader taking on Indiaâs Modi Has India's government kept its promises? WhatsApp: The 'black hole' of fake news in India's election National security is also in the spotlight this election after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir in February. India then carried out unprecedented air strikes in Pakistan. Since then, the BJP has made national security a key plank in its campaign.

Is Halloween deadline a trick or treat?,"Trick or treat? You couldn't quite make it up. It is approaching 03:00 GMT - it's weird enough at this time of day to be about to see Theresa May speak. And thenew Brexit deadlineis, you guessed it, Halloween. So to get all the terrible metaphors about horror shows, ghosts and ghouls out of the way right now, let's consider straight away some of the reasons why this decision is a treat in one sense, but could be a trick too. A treat? First and most importantly, the EU has agreed to put the brakes on. We will not leave tomorrow without a deal. The prime minister's acceptance that leaving the EU without a formal arrangement in place could be a disaster won out. She has at least avoided the possible turmoil of leaving with no arrangement, which for so long Theresa May claimed to countenance. The UK now has nearly six more months to work out exactly how it wants to leave the EU. Of course it gives those trying to block the departure more time to try to make that happen too. But in its simplest sense, the prime minister asked for a delay so that she didn't open Pandora's Box. The EU eventually said yes, even on a different timetable. Theresa May is of course likely to still try to move as quickly as possible. And there are quite a few potential tricks. This new October deadline might not solve very much at all. It's longer than those who wanted a short delay hoped. So there won't be immediate pressure on the prime minister's current plan (which might be a vain hope) of getting out of this - finding common ground with the Labour party. Certainly, everyone in politics involved in Brexit could do with a breather, but a pause of such duration might just enable more delay, as the chance to quicken the tempo fades away. And with only limited expectations for that process anyway, it's likely sooner or perhaps later that the prime minister will be back in Parliament again asking MPs to coalesce around an option that could command a majority that could last a while. Again, without time pressure, it's not clear why Parliament would suddenly be in a rush to agree. That's why it's not entirely surprising to hear the EU Council president warn minutes after the agreement that the UK must not waste the extra time it's been given. This could, although I hate to say it, just make way for months of extra gridlock before the UK and the EU find themselves back here in a similar situation in the autumn. That's why, potentially, an election might become the way out that few want is still possible. And don't be in any doubt that those in Parliament and outside pushing for another referendum, or to stop Brexit altogether, will use this opportunity to make their case more and more loudly. Even Brexiteers in Cabinet, who are completely committed to the cause, acknowledge that the further away from the referendum in 2016, the weaker the mandate for departure becomes. There is though, still time for a leadership contest in the Tory Party that would leave a new prime minister in charge, to find a new way out. Even before the official confirmation of the decision came, one minister got in touch to say that now the prime minister can stay on ""in name only"" with a leadership contest getting going as early as just after Easter and a new leader in place by early summer. Perhaps, by the time this new deadline approaches, someone else will be trying to untangle the mess.

Sturgeon's 'relief' at new Brexit deadlineFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the UK must not waste time now an extension until 31 October has been agreed.,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""What I would like to see now is this issue going back to the people."" Scotland's first minister has urged the government to ""re-set"" its approach to Brexit after the latest delay to the UK's departure from the EU. A ""flexible"" extension of the Brexit deadline until 31 October was agreed at an EU summit on Wednesday night. Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Theresa May to urge the prime minister to ""drop your red lines"" and seek ""genuine consensus"" with opposition parties. Holyrood will not be recalled now that the extension has been agreed. Scottish Parliament Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh had warned MSPs they would be required from 13:00 on Thursday if the UK was due to leave the EU without a deal on Friday. However, following the announcement of the extension, Mr Macintosh said a recall was no longer necessary.

Ministers are now holding talks with the Labour opposition to see if a compromise can be found. European Council president Donald Tusk said the UK could still sign off the government's negotiated deal, or choose to ""cancel Brexit altogether"". He added: ""This extension is as flexible as I expected, and a little bit shorter than I expected, but it's still enough to find the best possible solution. Please do not waste this time.""

She said: ""We now have the gift of more time from the EU, and that must be used constructively to re-set the UK government approach.

Mr Mundell added: ""She [Theresa May] wants to deliver Brexit by 22 May so that we don't have to have the European elections and there is still an opportunity to do that.

Life beyond the throneGame of Thrones 'lifers' on work after Westeros," After seven seasons, 67 episodes, a bunch of blood-soaked character deaths and years of internet-breaking speculation, Game of Thrones is set to return for the final time. The world's biggest TV show has had a transformational effect on its cast, creators, crew and real-world home – Northern Ireland. The show has been filmed across Northern Ireland As the world gets ready to return to Westeros for the last time, and the airing of the season's first episode in the UK on 15 April on Sky Atlantic, BBC News NI looks at the show's impact on the film industry in Northern Ireland, as told by the people who helped bring the show to life. The Dark Hedges is the kind of the place that screams Game of Thrones. It's spring but an ominously wintry wind blows through the 18th Century cluster of gnarled beech trees in the County Antrim countryside. The scene, draped in a permanent sword metal sky, is made for cinema. Eight years ago, the Dark Hedges – locally well-known but never a tourist hotspot – featured at the end of episode two of Game of Thrones' second season. The rural lane was used as a stand-in for the Kingsroad, Westeros' famed highway. A fan takes a picture at the Game of Thrones plaquein Ballintoy Harbour, County Antrim And ever since the tourists have come – not just to the Dark Hedges but to other spots in Northern Ireland made famous by featuring on the real-world map of Westeros. Ballintoy (Pyke), Castle Ward (Winterfell), Cushendun (Melisandre’s caves). A decade of change, then, for the Dark Hedges and for many others too, like Ciaran Colton. Before Game of Thrones, he was a barman wondering what he was going to do next. Now he works full-time in the film industry as an assistant director. Hollywood life – even for those at its fringes – really does come at you pretty fast. He’s here at the Dark Hedges to be photographed for this feature. Tourists stop and stare, wondering if he’s somebody (“Wasn’t he that guy in season five…?”). Nearby, his eight-month-old son Manus sits in his pram being fussed over by American tourists while  a man speaking Spanish records a video. Back in 2008, when the Hedges went mostly unnoticed, Ciaran was pulling pints for a living. He'd dropped out of university and the 24-year-old didn't know where he was going. But he played in a band and had the long hair and big beard to prove it. His looks were to be a catalyst for a new career - but not how he ever imagined. “I was on the Metal Ireland forum,” he says. “There was an ad looking for people with long hair and beards to work on a Hollywood film…” That film was Your Highness, a critically mauled fantasy-comedy that flopped at the box office, but by coming to Northern Ireland, it was essentially a dry run for the HBO epic. Danny McBride and Natalie Portman in Your Highness From Your Highness, Ciaran moved on to the Game of Thrones pilot as Sean Bean's stand-in and a runner, then, eventually, as a third assistant director. Now, he's practically a seasoned veteran, having worked directly under show creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss on the upcoming series finale. So he is standing here at the Dark Hedges packing enough explosive secrets to hold an impromptu spoiler auction among the nearby Thrones fans, who would probably pay big to find out who’ll sit on the Iron Throne when the final scene rolls. But he didn’t get this far by blabbing television’s most guarded secrets and subtly changes the subject. “When I applied for Your Highness, I joked with Gemma [his then girlfriend] that I was only doing it so I could meet Natalie Portman.” These days, as a 34-year-old with 10 years in the industry, Gemma is his fiancée and they have two children and a house, with a bed that was bought, indirectly, by the Queen of Dragons herself, Daenerys Targaryen, Emilia Clarke. “Well, she gave me a gift voucher and we bought a mattress with it,” he says, laughing. “In my job, I'm the first person the actors see when they get out of the car on set. I send them where they need to go and chat with them about their family and lives – I mean, it's completely bizarre. “I didn’t really know where I was going in life, and now all this – I guess that happens to a lot of people in the film industry.” Television will certainly never be the same. The show changed the game in terms of what could be accomplished in the confines of high-end broadcast drama, sustaining the epic scope of blockbuster filmmaking over more than 70 hours of storytelling. Simultaneously broadcast in 170 countries, the show’s last seasonwas illegally downloaded more than a billion timesand it’s racked up almost 50 Emmys. The show has won almost 50 Emmy awards The show's creators, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, will be following up Thrones with the relatively-minor task of writing the next Star Wars movie, while cast members like Kit Harrington and Emilia Clarke have gone from unknowns to superstars. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss The Game of Thrones effect extends to birth certificates (the likes of Arya, Khaleesi and Daenerys are now children’s names), tax legislation (the tax break for high-end television drama in the UK is widely credited to the show) and higher education (Time Magazine reported that US universities were increasingly offering courses in medieval studies to satiate demand from Thrones devotees). Back in 2008, Northern Ireland was in the first throes of a prolonged battering by the financial crisis. It ended up suffering the deepest recession and slowest recovery of any UK region. Its film industry, relatively small-time, was almost entirely centred on the UK with no real global recognition. It lacked infrastructure and a skills base. For those tasked with bringing productions here, the place was a tough sell. Richard Williams, head of Northern Ireland Screen, which promotes the film industry, says: “We used to go out to Los Angeles, pitching the value proposition of shooting stuff here. “Famously, we had one meeting that we thought was great. And one of the studios, it turned out as we were leaving, had thought we were New Zealand. We were struggling to make in-roads into the London market, so we looked further afield more, which is why we were trudging around studios in LA trying to pitch ""That's why we were at the Cannes Film Festival year after year, trying to pretend we were more significant than we were.” But NI Screen was ambitious. Harry Treadaway and Saoirse Ronan featured in City of Ember Buoyed by snagging two major studio films for Belfast, City of Ember and Your Highness, they wanted to bring something massive to Northern Ireland. And HBO was looking for somewhere to shoot a new pilot. Somewhere with a British look and sensibility - and cheap. Janet Graham-Borba, HBO's executive vice president of west coast production, who has worked on Thrones since day one, says: “We sent people out to scout in Canada, Eastern Europe, the British Isles. “We came to feel that Northern Ireland was going to be way past perfect. David and Dan [the show’s creators] were familiar with Ireland because they had spent some time at Trinity College (in Dublin), and they loved what was possible in terms of landscapes.” Jay Roewe, HBO’s senior vice-president of production, adds: “The fact that Northern Ireland had not been overly filmed also made us feel as there were things to show the rest of world, on this particular story, that would potentially be new and creatively supportive.” The Paint Hall (right) forms part of Titanic Studios Belfast also had the Paint Hall, a remnant of Belfast's shipbuilding past where parts of the Titanic were built, that had cannily been turned into a huge studio space. And it didn’t hurt that Northern Ireland’s authorities were happy to offer cash incentives to HBO to give the place a chance. Janet says: “On a pure number-crunching basis, Northern Ireland and one other location that shall remain nameless were the best we were going to do financially. “But the really more profound thing was - the story looked like it belonged in Northern Ireland.” Peter Robinson, Ian McElhinney and Martin McGuinness For Jay, the partnership of the then first and deputy first ministers of Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness, was also “critical” in making HBO feel comfortable bringing Thrones to Northern Ireland. Richard Williams of NI Screen says that the government “stepped up to the plate” in a big way. “They made a bold bet. They allowed us to invest very, very heavily in the pilot,” he says. Because it was a bet - that pilot could have tanked and we wouldn't have got anything out of that ""But, at that time, standard TV networks might get one in 10 pilots to air, but with HBO it was more like in two or three – so we had good odds. And how long was it going to be before another HBO pilot was going to come along wanting to shoot in Northern Ireland?” A show as ambitious as Thrones required hundreds of crew from a place that did not have a deep pool of experienced industry workers. Yet, after eight seasons and 10 years, hundreds of local people who, in many instances, had never worked a day in film can say they helped bring Westeros to life. HBO executive Janet said: “There's a phrase: ‘If you can't see it, you can't be it.' So if you don't know that a career is possible, or how you can access it – you can't do it. “But once we started making the show in Belfast, people could see it and people could be it.” Just as production was starting on Game of Thrones’ first season, Stephanie McCutcheon was finished with Manchester. She was in a city where she could “see it” – her dream career as an editor in TV and film – but she was struggling to “be it”. When she was mugged twice in the span of two weeks she decided it was time to come home. Soon after she returned, an old work colleague asked if she wanted a job as a runner for the costumes department on this show Stephanie described as “Belfast, boobs, swords and dragons”. “It was the usual thing,” she recalls. “I was told to come for a day, then I stayed for a week, stayed for a month, then stayed for the season. ""That turned into two seasons."" ""I was very honest and told them from the start that I didn't want to do costumes, which was scary because I didn't want to get sacked. But it worked.” For two seasons, Stephanie ran all over the set, all over Belfast, all over Northern Ireland, picking up fabric, material, bits and bobs, going from location to location, learning the on-set etiquette of when to speak and when to stay quiet. One day, she was urgently asked to iron Cersei Lannister's kimono. “I bricked myself,” she admitted. “I didn't do a very good job but it's one of those moments where you need to do something random. You got into those situations all the time.” On another day, she inadvertently discovered season one's most unexpected twist. “I was picking up costumes from the set and Sean Bean's Ned Stark costume was on the 'dead rail'. “I was thinking: 'Oh, isn't he the lead of the series?' I was getting worried the show wasn't going to do very well.” But the cameras kept rolling. Stephanie transferred to the post-production department for season three, as a runner once again, but a step closer to the editor’s chair. The job came with its own stresses, like picking up film rushes from the set. They don't tell you this, but you have the negatives. If you were to get into a car crash, you would have to ask – which is more valuable, me or the rushes? “It's a horrible thought,” she laughs. “But I did think it.” By season four, she began to get some hands-on experience doing the editing job she always wanted. By season five, she was an assistant editor and since then has worked on other productions such as the Ridley Scott-produced film Morgan, iBoy and on some episodes of The Frankenstein Chronicles, which were filmed in Belfast. “I feel a little bit guilty,” she admits. “I'm very lucky to have gotten that Frankenstein job, because I'm a very young editor. I'm sure there were people side-eyeing me, but I wasn't going to say no.” Sam Donaghy-Bell has lived on the Game of Thrones' set for a decade but he's not here to talk about stars or the twists of George RR Martin’s story – he's never even watched the show. But ask him about cameras, the technology, “the toys”, as he says – and just watch him go. He says: “We had George Lucas visit to speak to David and Dan (Weiss) and everyone was going: 'Oh, my God, George Lucas!' And I was like, 'Yeah, he did Star Wars, but guys – have you seen the new camera gear over here?' Sam worked on film sets from a young age with his TV producer parents. He grew up around live broadcasts, working as a runner, but it was always the cameras that interested  him. He started out as a “humper and lumper” on the electrical department for Your Highness, which confirmed his taste for the film set life, before starting out on Thrones as a runner and then becoming a camera trainee. Like Stephanie, he also moved up the ladder, from trainee to a first assistant camera or “focus puller” – two steps below the director of photography (DOP) who is the person in charge of making every shot epic or beautiful or some combination of the two. Not that Sam wants to be one. Filming in Carnlough, County Antrim, in August 2015 He says: “Being a DOP has never appealed to me. They sit in a tent on a chair staring at two or three monitors, that's their day. Whereas the camera operator is out with the crane, camera on his shoulder, going down ditches, up cliffs. “I don't want to tell people to go and do the things that are in my head, I want to go out and shoot it myself.” For Sam, the good days on set were often the big days, like when 50 horses were charging in a battle scene. It was fun but it was anything but easy. “There were the 55 days of night shoots. I remember most of those because it got down to minus 12 degrees some nights."" It's burnt into your mind as a bad memory to a degree because those were the times the gear stopped working and batteries died “You look back on it and remember it was great but it wasn't at the time – it was horrible! But it was still one of the best experiences anyone in the industry could have.” Ingrid Houwers is in her taxidermy studio, surrounded by all manner of creatures, each suspended in a moment in time. When she moved to Bangor, County Down from Holland in 2006, Ingrid brought a cool box of dead birds on her flight, much to the confusion of the check-in desk. Every other day someone calls her up to tell her about a dead animal they had found at the roadside or come to her door with a bird that met an unfortunate end after colliding with a window. Such is the life of a taxidermist and Ingrid’s been living it for almost 20 years. It’s unusual enough without throwing Game of Thrones into the mix. Ingrid and Cody But film work has become a fascinating sideline for Ingrid, who lives with her husband and her very own ‘direwolf’ Cody, a Northern Inuit related to the canine actors that appeared on the show. She had already been producing animal prop commissions before getting the call from Thrones. I think their first request was a horse-hoof door knocker “And then they came in to have a look and said they could really work with what I was doing on a larger scale.” As an ethical taxidermist, Ingrid only works with animals that have either died of natural causes or have been killed as part of regulated pest control. Since season one, she has supplied the production with animal skins, body parts and full taxidermied animals. Everything from furs to make bedspreads or costumes; game birds for hanging as market displays; animal knuckle bones for dice games played by Westerosi soldiers; even a giant eagle owl which featured in season four on the shoulder of a Thenn warg. Ingrid is one of a host of experts with specialist skills who were brought into the Thrones fold to help bring Westeros to life. Attention to detail has always been crucial in selling George RR Martin’s fantasy epic to the audience. Janet Graham-Borba of HBO explains the philosophy: “If you believe the fire, you’ll believe the dragons. “So much of our fire is real fire and that’s true of other aspects. You will believe Kings Landing if you believe the doorway someone walks through.” Season-after-season, the show’s popularity grew until it seemed to go supernova following the infamous Red Wedding in season three – the scene that launched a million memes. A year later the show received a seal of approval from a real-life royal when the Queen herself visited the Iron Throne during a trip to Belfast in 2014. Then prime minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha also displayed an impressive knowledge when they toured the set at Titanic Studios in 2015. Jay Roewe of HBO said: “You have to remember that when we started the show it was nowhere near the size and scope of where we ended up. Because of the show’s success, every season we had to outdo ourselves.” Standing in his forge in Saintfield, County Down, blacksmith Steve Murphy tells how he played his part. He helped to create one of the show’s biggest props – a medieval siege weapon called a scorpion, which was used by the Lannister army to try to take down Drogon, one of Daenerys’s dragons. He says: “It took about 12 weeks to make and then it was shipped over to Spain to be filmed. I was responsible for dressing it, putting the metal plates on it, making it look the part and the firing mechanism for it as well.” Steve has worked on all eight seasons of Thrones, initially as an extra, before joining the armoury department in season three. They are responsible for creating weapons and making sure no one loses an eye or an arm during a big battle  - not that anything too serious ever happened. As an extra hanging around the set, Steve made a point of telling people if they needed a blacksmith, then he was their man. Later, he got to talking to Tommy Dunne, an Irishman at the head of the armoury department  and showed him some of his work. “With the show getting bigger he needed more people and gave me a call,” says Steve. “They use so many traditional crafts – there are leatherworkers, willow weavers, blacksmiths. All people with a broad range of skills.” Since then, Steve has made swords and shields, forged decorative pieces of metalwork, worked as a standby armourer on set and even popped up in the background in a couple of scenes. On other occasions, his impact has been less subtle. Holding up a hammer at his workshop, he says: “This was used by Jon Snow to kill Styr. They just needed a hammer and they ended up using mine.” Neither taxidermist Ingrid or blacksmith Steve ever thought their careers would take them within touching distance of Hollywood, but their skills have proved indispensable. The downside is the occasional last-minute deadline. Steve says: “In the Battle of the Bastards, the shield wall that the Boltons had – that was just sprung on us last minute. When that happens you just work every hour you can. “If you get the phone call in the middle night telling you that they need such and such, you wouldn’t say no,” echoes Ingrid. “You said: ‘Yes, it’ll be done.’ And then the panic ensued.” Sometimes, producers can ask for something particularly unusual or challenging, which requires developing new skills or finding a workaround – like when Ingrid had to supply wolf-like fur. “With the Stark family, the sigil is a direwolf. But the wolf is a protected species, so getting wolf fur requires a tonne of paperwork and rightly so. “But the coyote is quite similar in colour, although smaller, and they do have a wolfish look and they’re part of pest control in America. So a lot of the ‘wolf skins’ are coyotes, which look the part.” It’s all in a day’s work for the likes of Ingrid and Steve, who now find themselves balancing film work with their day-to-day professions. “Thrones has had a huge impact,” says Steve. “It allowed me to build equipment; I got the opportunity to buy machinery and kit out my workshop. I met my wife through making friends with people on the show.” “I’m just a small cog in a humongous machine,” says Ingrid. “But I’m very proud to be that little small cog.” “All I've ever wanted to do since I was 11 was work in the film industry. And when I finished college I thought I would have to move to London to chase the dream, and it literally landed on our doorstep – the biggest show in the world.” Ryan Tohill is another Game of Thrones ""lifer"" who has spent eight seasons in the show's props department. He’s now making his own way in the film industry as a director. His debut feature film – The Dig - which he has produced with his brother Andrew, will have its Irish premiere in late April. There's talk of UK distribution and his days are now filled with regular Skype calls to his agent and manager in Los Angeles. Ryan has worked not just on Thrones, but also on most of the shows that have arrived in Belfast on its leather coattails like The Frankenstein Chronicles, Krypton, My Mother and Other Strangers. He says: “All through Krypton, I was going home every night to read scripts. I'd fall asleep on the sofa then get up at 05:00 to go to set. To be able to say that and have that be your life and then almost be at the stage where you're complaining about it?” He laughs, shakes his head slowly. I will never have any reason to complain about anything again It all began at Christmas when Ryan and Andrew were 11. Their father received a camcorder and the boys were so taken by the new gadget that they can't even remember what was under the tree for them. As the pair moved into their teens, they kept filming and asking friends to act in whatever movie they were in the middle of making. But their ultimate dream would probably never have been realised without the Thrones effect. The show, says Ryan, allowed “a kid who grew up obsessed with cinema to reach out and touch Hollywood”. “It was an amazing thing.” Thrones has also given local writers a new sense of confidence. They now believe not only that they can get their film or TV show made, but they can get it made in Northern Ireland. Take Derry Girls - Channel 4’s smash-hit comedy was created by Lisa McGee from Derry and directed by Michael Lennox from Belfast. It was shot in locations all across Northern Ireland with mostly local talent on both sides of the camera. Ryan says he and his brother are “living proof” of the role Northern Ireland Screen and its financing plays in the careers of young filmmakers, creatives and crew members. And the experience he gained on the Thrones set was invaluable. “It's fair enough to go to film school but if you really want to learn how the craft works, you've got to get on a film set.You've got to learn very quickly and understand every single cog in the wheel of every department,” he says. “I used to just study the directors and luckily in my job I was always in directors’ rehearsals. I was even sometimes in rehearsals 'priors' with David and Dan, they'd be there rewriting things, trying to find the realism and the truth in the scene. They had so much understanding of how they worked, tweaking, fine-tuning things. It was amazing to see and a privilege.” The Dig was shot over 18 gruelling days in 2017. Even though directing was lightyears from his day job on Thrones, Ryan's on-set knowhow, combined with his brother's experience in documentaries, helped the pair bring the film together. “It was all about practical thinking and that comes from being on set and seeing all these problems – that's what Thrones gave me. “If I was trying to make The Dig 10 years ago, and I had never been on Thrones, the film would have been a disaster. It just wouldn't have happened or it wouldn't have been as good.” In 2018, The Dig was screened at the Toronto Film Festival (TIFF), which attracts almost 500,000 people every year, and won best Irish film at the Galway Film Festival, just weeks after they had held a screening for cast and crew. “The entire Game of Thrones crew turned up, it was brilliant. Northern Ireland film crew are amazing. You spend more time with these people than you do your own family.” When it comes to making the next big show or film, Ryan says it’s not just about having it shot in Northern Ireland – it's about having it written, directed and produced by local people too. “With every generation, there's more confidence,” says Ryan. There's going to be bigger productions coming here after Thrones and for all those young people – it's doable, your film, it can be done “All it takes is to make something and get it into the hands of the right people. Go knock the door. They can't ignore you forever.” There was a world BGOT – before Game of Thrones – even if it’s hard to remember a time without “You know nothing, Jon Snow,” “Hold the door,” “Shame! Shame! Shame!” - and a million other pop culture memes. There will also be a world after, though the people who worked on the show are finding it as difficult to say goodbye as everyone else. “I’m grief-stricken,” says HBO executive Janet Graham-Borba. “It’s been a huge part of my working day for a decade and I’m so proud of what everyone has done. I say very regularly to people that Northern Ireland is one of the best - if not the best - production experience  I’ve ever had and it’s an extraordinary place to work While Janet believes Belfast can “sustain this success” and HBO will be coming back to Northern Ireland later this year to film a prequel pilot, many people who have been trained up and worked on the show are facing their first year without Thrones in almost a decade. Big shows have moved into Northern Ireland during the Thrones’ run – high-profile dramas like Line of Duty and The Fall; genre specialties like The Frankenstein Chronicles and Krypton; success-story comedy Derry Girls; major film productions such as Dracula Untold and The Lost City of Z. But they all existed in the space beside Game of Thrones, not instead of it. The show’s departure will leave a dragon-sized hole to fill. Northern Ireland Screen is “sad but not worried” as Thrones comes to an end, says its chief executive Richard Williams, but he admits nothing can replicate it. “We can find other projects, we can fill our film studios, we can find work and continue to grow and move on to bigger and better things from the platform Game of Thrones has given us. But will we have a single project like it? I don’t think so - we can find more work but it won’t be the same For Sam Donaghy-Bell, there's a “void” now that Thrones has finished and he’s concerned about what comes next. “It's scary now that it's not here. I would happily work on that show for the rest of my life,” he says. But, regardless of what happens next, Sam, Stephanie McCutcheon, Ciaran Colton and many others have the experience of being Thrones ""lifers"" who worked on all eight seasons of the world's biggest TV show and have the tattoos to prove it. Each carries an ""8"" inked in Thrones font and paid for by the show as a symbol of fellowship. It's also a mark of quality. “If, hypothetically, I was asked to do the next Bond or Avengers movie, I could do it no problem,” says Sam. “The ways of working would be exactly the same as Thrones; the hierarchy would be the same. “Because of Thrones, I've learned quicker.” For Stephanie, Thrones didn't just open a door; it opened her eyes to what was possible. If you can see it, you can be it. “I walked into that show thinking: 'I don't know any girl editors.' And there were two female assistants and two female editors. It changed my perspective. “I got a really good footing with the other assistants and at the start I could see that they were only four years older than me – I could see that it's not that far away, that through Thrones I could get there really fast.” “I'm very lucky. I've learned from the best.” Ciaran Colton, meanwhile, hopes if his children Aoibhe and Manus can see it, maybe they can be it too. “They might see me working in the film industry and decide to go for it. That’s the thing about the industry – there’s a role in it for everyone. “Game of Thrones showed that to people. Gave them opportunities, jobs and skills they didn't even know they had. And confidence. I feel like I could work on anything. No job could be as tough as this job.” Built with Shorthand"
Speedboat killer admits fleeing country,"This video can not be played Charlotte Brown's sister Katie made a tearful statement outside court after Shepherd was sentenced A man who killed a woman in a speedboat crash has been jailed for an extra six months for fleeing the country. Jack Shepherd fled before he was sentenced to six years for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown, who died in the crash on the River Thames. He returned to the UK on Wednesday night after 10 months on the run. Shepherd, 31, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to breaching bail and absconding and was sent to prison to begin his six-and-a-half-year sentence. Judge Richard Marks said: ""Charlotte's family were, of course, devastated by the circumstances by which she met her death, and those feelings were greatly exacerbated by the fact you chose to go on the run. ""Your conduct in absenting yourself from justice for so long was as cowardly as it was selfish."" This video can not be played Speaking on the plane back from Georgia, Jack Shepherd said he regretted going on the run Speaking outside court, Ms Brown's father Graham said the family felt ""a sense of relief"". He said: ""Due to Shepherd's recklessness and negligent actions Charlotte isn't here to defend herself."" Her sister Katie said Shepherd had ""continued to prolong our agony, making wild accusations against our family"". She said his ""lack of respect and decency still continues to astound us"". Charlotte Brown died in December 2015 when Shepherd took her on a date on his speedboat Defence barrister Andrew McGee said Shepherd had travelled to Georgia in March last year. He said he had travelled ""under his own name, using his own passport"" before he handed himself in to police in Tbilisi in January. Mr McGee said Shepherd was ""overwhelmed by his fear"" of a prison sentence. He added: ""It [absconding] was not deliberately callous or cavalier. It was not cynical or calculated."" By Helena Lee, BBC News Correspondent at the Old Bailey Charlotte Brown's family - her mother, father and two sisters - were just metres away from the glass dock and got a clear view of Jack Shepherd when he was brought in by two guards. They glanced over at him. He, though, didn't look at them or up at the public gallery. Instead he stared ahead and listened as Judge Richard Marks told him his deliberate decision to go on the run hugely added to the distress of Charlotte's family. The family had been waiting months for this day to come, the day they got to see the man convicted of Charlotte's manslaughter finally start serving his sentence. Judge Marks said Shepherd was in contact with his lawyers from his ""hideaway"" during legal proceedings. He added: ""You were, in effect, having your cake and eating it. That is not how our system of justice is supposed to work."" Shepherd's boat was found to have several defects During his trial, jurors heard that Shepherd and Ms Brown went on a late-night high-speed jaunt in his boat past the Houses of Parliament on their first date on 8 December 2015. The pair were both thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water near Wandsworth Bridge. Ms Brown, from Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, was found in the water unconscious and unresponsive, while Shepherd was discovered clinging to the upturned boat. His trial was told that he was responsible for the speedboat, which had a series of serious defects, including to its steering. Thames speedboat killer arrives in UK The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Speedboat killer hands himself in to police Shepherd, originally from Exeter, last appeared at the Old Bailey in January last year when he denied manslaughter and was released on unconditional bail. But he failed to show up for his trial and sentencing in July. Shepherd has since been grantedthe right to appeal against his conviction.

âThree-personâ baby boy born in Greece,"The baby was conceived using an experimental form of IVF Fertility doctors in Greece and Spain say they have produced a baby from three people in order to overcome a woman's infertility. The baby boy was born weighing 2.9kg (6lbs) on Tuesday. The mother and child are said to be in good health. The doctors say they are ""making medical history"" which could help infertile couples around the world. But some experts in the UK say the procedure raises ethical questions and should not have taken place. The experimental form of IVF uses an egg from the mother, sperm from the father, and another egg from a donor woman. It was developed to help families affected by deadly mitochondrial diseases which are passed down from mother to baby. It has been tried in only one such case - a family from Jordan - and that provoked much controversy. But some fertility doctors believe the technology could increase the odds of IVF too. First 'three person baby' born Three-person babies IVF technique âsafeâ The girl with three biological parents This is all about mitochondria - they are the tiny compartments inside nearly every cell of the body that convert food into useable energy. They are defective in mitochondrial diseases so combining the mother's DNA with a donor's mitochondria could prevent disease. But there is also speculation mitochondria may have a role in a successful pregnancy too. That claim has not been tested. The patient was a 32-year-old woman in Greece who had endured four unsuccessful cycles of IVF. She is now a mother, but her son has a tiny amount of his genetic makeup from the donor woman as mitochondria have their own DNA. Dr Panagiotis Psathas, president of the Institute of Life in Athens, said: ""A woman's inalienable right to become a mother with her own genetic material became a reality. ""We are very proud to announce an international innovation in assisted reproduction, and we are now in a position to make it possible for women with multiple IVF failures or rare mitochondrial genetic diseases to have a healthy child."" The Greek team were working with the Spanish centre Embryotools, which has announced that24 other women are taking part in the trial,externaland eight embryos are ready to be implanted. In February 2018, the doctors in Newcastle who pioneered the technology were given permission to create the UK's first three-person babies. The fertility regulator approved two attempts, both in families with rare mitochondrial diseases. Some doctors in the UK argued the two applications - fertility and disease prevention - are morally very different. Tim Child, from the University of Oxford and the medical director of The Fertility Partnership, said: ""I'm concerned that there's no proven need for the patient to have her genetic material removed from her eggs and transferred into the eggs of a donor. ""The risks of the technique aren't entirely known, though may be considered acceptable if being used to treat mitochondrial disease, but not in this situation. ""The patient may have conceived even if a further standard IVF cycle had been used."" Dr Beth Thompson, from the Wellcome Trust, said: ""UK regulation was based on strong public engagement and scientific evidence and allows the risks and benefits to be carefully weighed up. ""We're proud to be supporting the first UK study into the use of mitochondria donation techniques in a well regulated environment, but we're concerned about studies taken place without similar levels of oversight.""

Home Office breaches EU citizens' data,"The Home Office has apologised to hundreds of EU citizens seeking settled status in the UK after accidentally sharing their details. It blamed an ""administrative error"" for sending an email that revealed 240 personal email addresses - a likely breach of the Data Protection Act. The department may now have to make an apology in Parliament. In a statement to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, it said it had since improved its systems and procedures. How do I apply for 'settled status'- - BBC News 10 ways you could be affected by no-deal Brexit UK urged to guarantee EU citizens' benefits One recipient of the email told Today that she was outraged and was considering returning to Germany. The Home Office sent the email on Sunday 7 April asking applicants, who had already struggled with technical problems, to resubmit their information. But it failed to use the ""blind CC"" box on the email, revealing the details of other applicants. In another message apologising to those who had been affected, the Home Office wrote: ""The deletion of the email you received from us on 7 April 2019 would be greatly appreciated."" The government has alreadymade an unreserved apology after making a similar error with emails sent to 500 members of the Windrush generation. The department notified the Information Commissioner's Office and made a statement in Parliament. EU citizens in the UK before Brexit can apply for settled status, which allows them to continue to live and work there afterwards. Applicants and campaigning groups have criticised the system, saying it has proved slow and bureaucratic for some. Ofsted chief accepted for 'settled status' Nicolas Hatton, from the 3 Million group that campaigns for EU citizens' rights, said the incident showed the settled status process was not sufficiently robust. ""It feels like it adds insult to injury,"" he said. A Home Office spokesman said: ""In communicating with a small group of applicants, an administrative error was made which meant other applicants' email addresses could be seen. ""As soon as the error was identified, we apologised personally to the 240 applicants affected and have improved our systems and procedures to stop this occurring again.""

Sleeper trains 'are hotels on wheels',"This video can not be played The service boasted a ""hotel on wheels"" experience The new Â£150m fleet of Caledonian Sleeper trains has been unveiled - with travellers being promised an overnight stay in ""a hotel on wheels"". From June, 75 new carriages will offer en-suite double rooms for the first time. There will be 484 rooms available, initially on the Lowlander route between London and Glasgow/Edinburgh. They will be followed by a Highlander route between London and Aberdeen, Inverness and Fort William. The new trains hark back to an era of luxury overnight travel between Scotland and London. The Caledonian Sleeper after crossing the Forth Bridge The Caledonian sleeper has been running in various forms since 1873 when specialised sleeping carriages were first introduced. For the wealthier travellers, that included luxurious compartments with seating areas and en-suite toilets. The service was almost scrapped when the railways were privatised in the 1990s, but were saved after a high-profile campaign. Despite using ageing stock, thetrains remained popular. Rival road offerings were short-lived. Stagecoach launched a Glasgow/London overnight service withspecial sleeper coaches in 2011, and First's Greyhound night coaches with larger reclining seats began in 2010. Both have since stopped. Travellers get the new Scotland to London experience on a demonstration journey The rail service is now operated by Serco on behalf of Transport Scotland. Its new carriages are bespoke and designed for Caledonian Sleeper from scratch. The fleet,which will be on the rails from the beginning of June,external, features: 40 Sleeper carriages, each with six showers 14 Accessible carriages, each with two showers 347 toilets 40 upgraded service points Serco's Ryan Flaherty said the fleet would provide ""a truly magical experience that will transform travel between London and Scotland"". He added: ""Safety is absolutely paramount for us. But, beyond that, this is a hospitality experience. ""People now are very much looking for a decent experience - whether it is in a restaurant, a shop or indeed travelling on a train - and we have gone after that market."" Another first for the Sleeper is the introduction of new engineering technology to stop things going ""bump"" in night. In the past, passengers have complained of being woken by a shunt when two sections of the train coupled together at Carstairs , but the operators say the addition of 150 Dellner couplers will be a ""dream"" development for snoozing guests. Serco's Ryan Flaherty said: ""On the current train the coaches have to 'kick' together to make the contact, but going forward it's 'kissing'. ""It's much more gentle and will be imperceptible to the guests who are asleep."" Prices for the new recliner seats have not increased for travel between London and the Highlands Unlike standard rail fares which are released three months in advance, sleeper tickets can be bought a year before travel. Prices for rooms have been increased for passengers on the new trains from 2 June. Classic rooms cost from Â£170 each way for two people travelling between London and Glasgow, Edinburgh or the Highlands. The same room starts at Â£140 for one passenger, but the option to share with a stranger is no longer available. In the old-style carriages, which are operating until the end of May, the cost of two one-way tickets in second class two-berth sleeper is Â£140 for to Edinburgh or Glasgow, or Â£160 to Inverness, Aberdeen, Fort William, Perth, Dundee, Aviemore. Prices are higher for the new Club rooms, and the new double en-suite rooms start at Â£400 for two passengers. Family rates will be available for passengers travelling with children, who can book interconnecting rooms from Â£170. The starting price for recliner seats remains at Â£45 per person for tickets between London and Inverness, Aberdeen, Fort William, Perth, Dundee, Aviemore.

Victoria Square shops open as usual,"Residents of the apartments in Belfast on Chichester Street have been directed to vacate the building The management firm of a Belfast apartment complex that was vacated for safety reasons says it cannot ""make any assurances"" on compensation costs for alternative accommodation. On Wednesday, residents at the Victoria Square complex were told to leave the building ""immediately"" due to structural concerns, Victoria Square Residential Management Limited has released a statement. It said the estimated cost of repairs was ""significant"". The firm said this was ""given the technical nature of the work involved"", and that it hoped to start work on site soon. It said it was ""regrettable that this situation will cause inconvenience to the residents of the apartments"", adding it was ""doing all it can to resolve the matter as quickly as possible"". A resident at the complex, Adam Cain, said he found it ""shocking"" that the management company could not ""make any assurances"" on compensation costs. Mr Cain said he was told to vacate the building at short notice with a knock on the door coming as he cooked his dinner. He and his fiancÃ©e are currently staying in hotels. Adam Cain said he was told to vacate the building at short notice The management company said it is estimated that the repair work will take approximately 20 weeks, but that it will ""involve a period of investigation to determine the specific cause of the damage and the parties responsible"". The firm said ""the absolute priority is to protect the structure of the building and ensure the safety of its residents"". It said that ""in order for evacuated residents to return to the building as soon as possible"", it will be ""necessary for the management company to apply its funds in the first instance towards the required repairs"". ""The management company is therefore not in a position to make any assurances in relation to costs incurred by the evacuated residents for alternative accommodation,"" it said. The firm said it ""is possible that some residents may be able to return to their apartments sooner [than] the projected date for completion of the repair works but this cannot be confirmed at this point in time"". ""In the meantime, the management company and its agent will continue to liaise directly with apartment owners affected by the required evacuation,"" it added. ""Throughout this process the management company has kept the owner of Victoria Square Shopping Centre informed about its proposals to repair the structural issue within the residential development."" The company said it maintained the Victoria Square residential development at Chichester Street which has 91 apartments. It said the ""apartment owners are shareholders"" in the management company. This video can not be played Dundalk man, Cian Carroll, was among residents at Belfast's Victoria Square apartment complex that were told to vacate the building Earlier, a Victoria Square resident said he did not know where he and his partner would sleep tonight. Cian Carroll, who is from Dundalk but renting in Belfast, was put up in a nearby hotel by a management company. ""We haven't had any further information so we don't know what's going on, or where we're going to sleep,"" he said. ""I can't get my head around the shops and car park both being open, yet the residents have been told to leave. What's going on?"" Victoria Square is open for business as usual, despite structural issues affecting apartments in the complex. It said it is ""working with the managing agents of the apartments to assist in their investigation"". Mr Carroll told BBC News NI that it was his understanding that 23 residents stayed in a Holiday Inn on Wednesday night and a number of others slept in a Hampton by Hilton hotel in the city centre. ""There has been very little information and if there were any concerns over structural damage before this, we were not privy to it,"" said Mr Carroll, who moved into the apartment block in February. ""We can go back to family in Dundalk, if we have to, but I'm sure there are residents who aren't in that position. ""We're lucky that we don't have any kids to worry about, but I don't know what you'd do if you did."" A letter to residents from McGuinness Fleck estate agency said work was being done to resolve a ""serious structural issue"". A spokesman said the repair would take 20 weeks to complete, but Mr Carroll said he only found this out because it was in the news on Thursday morning. Another resident told BBC News NI: ""We've been told we may be out for a few days, but we've packed for a week. ""It's a bit of an inconvenience but, at the same time, it's an adventure."" The woman, who has lived in the complex for a few months, said there had been ""absolutely no sign of any damage"" in her apartment. A resident, who moved into the complex at the end of March, said two men called at her apartment on Wednesday evening and handed her a letter saying a structural report had revealed a problem. The woman said she was told the apartment ""wasn't safe"" and was advised to move out as the whole block was affected by the issue. A lawyer for the Victoria Square Residential Management Company Ltd said the decision was not ""taken lightly"". Emmet McKeown of Johns Elliot Solicitors, which represents the Victoria Square Residential Management Company Ltd, said that since ""a structural issue was initially identified in February, there has been a process of detailed structural assessments of the building"". Mr McKeown added: ""Engineers have been inspecting the building in coordination with the landlord for Victoria Square Shopping Centre. ""A programme of repair work will now need to be done which is being arranged at the moment. ""A timescale of 20 weeks is what we are currently expecting.""

Council overpaid staff by ÃÂ£800k in errorRenfrewshire Council made more than salary 800 overpayments over a three-year period.Scotland,"An eighth of former employees continued to be paid after leaving the council A council overpaid staff and former employees more than Â£800,000 over three years, a spending watchdog has revealed. Renfrewshire Council made more than 800 salary overpayments between April 2015 and February 2018. The Accounts Commission said six of them exceeded Â£10,000 and one person received an extra Â£15,500. A spokesperson for the local authority said it had taken all appropriate action to recover the money. So far it has recovered 58% of the money overpaid -  a total of about Â£812,000 -  to current staff and 27% from former employees. But the Accounts Commission report revealed it had written off Â£21,000. The spending watchdog found an eighth of former employees of the council were still paid after leaving, ""usually due to a delay in a department notifying payroll services staff that someone had left"". Details of the financial error were revealed in a new report on council finances which warned that systems aimed at preventing money being lost through mistakes and fraud may be becoming ""strained"". It said: ""Some recurring weaknesses are becoming apparent among councils and the consequences could be serious, including the loss of significant amounts of public money, impacts on services and reputational damage."" Graham Sharp, chairman of the Accounts Commission, said robust management and scrutiny were more important now than ever before. ""Councils face complex and challenging financial pressures, and rising demand for services,"" he said ""At the same time, budgets are tightening and there is significant uncertainty from factors such as the UK's withdrawal from the EU."" However, he said there were also many examples where Scottish councils were managing their finances effectively. A Renfrewshire Council spokesperson said: ""The risk of overpayments exists for all organisations and we have robust recovery processes in place for all debts owed, including salary overpayments, and we always take all appropriate action to recover all overpayments."" Alison Evison, the president of the local government body Cosla, said the report was a ""timely reminder of the many and varied pressures on local government"". She added: ""Scotland's councillors appreciate their role and duty in safeguarding public money and take it seriously. ""Cosla and our colleagues in the Improvement Service will continue to support our member councils look at ways to strengthen our joint work in this vital area even further.""

DUP accuses EU of ignoring unionists,"DUP MP Sammy Wilson has accused the prime minister of rolling over to the EU Theresa May's credibility as prime minister is now being questioned, the DUP's Brexit spokesman has said. Sammy Wilson made the comments after the EU granteda ""flexible"" extension to the Brexit processuntil 31 October. Mr Wilson, whose party leader Arlene Foster has been in Brussels meeting EU officials, said the UK had ""rolled over"" to the EU. Mrs Foster has insisted the prime minister must address the Irish border backstop in the Brexit deal. What could no deal mean for the border? Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit explained in flowcharts Theresa Mayhas acknowledged that there was ""huge frustration""that she had to ask for more time. On Thursday, Mrs Foster met the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier along with the party's MEP, Diane Dodds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

They were accompanied by Conservative Brexiteer MPs Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary. Owen Paterson, a leading Brexiteer, accompanied the DUP to Brussels Ahead of the visit, Mrs Foster had accused the EU of ignoring the concerns of unionists in relation to the Irish border backstop - but the EU has repeatedly said the withdrawal agreement cannot be re-negotiated. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said that by opposing the Brexit backstop, the DUP is ""actively working"" against the best interests of people the party claims to represent. ""The DUP also continue to ignore the constant warnings from our business community, our agricultural sector, universities, trade unionists and many others who have all advocated the Backstop as the best way of protecting our interests from the worst impacts of Brexit."" The backstop is an insurance policy - designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. If the UK leaves the customs union and the single market that could mean goods would have to be checked as they crossed the frontier. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU, and leave Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. Unionists are opposed to it as they say the differences in trade between NI and Great Britain could pose a risk to the integrity of the union. Read more here. Mr Wilson, the East Antrim MP, told BBC News NI that Mrs May had repeatedly broken promises - and that she had ""rolled over"" to the EU. He said: ""She was the prime minister who said we would be leaving on the 29th of March not once, but 108 times, and she has not honoured that promise either. ""I think she has to ask herself given the amount of promises broken to different groups of people, does she have any credibility?"" Allow Twitter content?

On Thursday, Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski, who resigned from the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG),said the Brexit deadlock had put Theresa Mayat the ""mercy of unrealistic demands"" from the DUP and elements of the ERG. Theresa May has insisted MPs have a duty to break the deadlock at Westminster - the Conservatives and Labour have been engaged in talks but there has not been a breakthrough yet. Speaking in the Commons, the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the EU had backed down by granting another extension, and called on the PM to ""learn the lesson"" of that, by pushing for changes to the backstop. Theresa May has insisted that the UK can still leave the EU next month, if MPs can rally round a deal Mrs May told MPs the government had ""an accelerated timeline to determine alternative arrangements"", and had also committed money to ensuring those alternative arrangements would replace the backstop. However, she stressed that the best way to ensure the backstop did not take effect was to agree a deal and begin negotiating the UK-EU future relationship. Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland Electoral Office has confirmed it is moving ahead with plans for the European elections on 23 May. Theresa May said the UK must now hold the elections, or leave the EU on 1 June without a deal - if MPs have not passed the withdrawal agreement by 22 May. The Chief Electoral Officer for NI, Virginia McVea, said nominations for the elections will open on 16 April. Counting would take place on Monday 27 May. The DUP has already said its current MEP Diane Dodds, had been ratified as the party's candidate. Sinn FÃ©in is due to hold a nomination convention next week. Martina Anderson has represented the party in Brussels since 2012.

Former head of the EU Commission office in Belfast, Jane Morrice, told BBC's The View she would stand as an independent candidate as she feels she has a ""duty"" to run. If the UK takes part in the elections, it means extra seats that would have been allocated to the Republic of Ireland will remain Northern Ireland seats. That could have an impact onformer SDLP leader Mark Durkan's chances of taking a seatfor Fine Gael in Dublin. The party had decided to stand two candidates, Mr Durkan, and Frances Fitzgerald, in the new four-seat constituency - but the UK's participation in the European elections would reduce the number of seats available back to three.

India's marathon election kicks offLong queues are building up at polling stations for the first phase of India's mammoth election.India,"This video can not be played India's elections: Why you should care Tens of millions of Indians have voted on the first day of a general election that is being seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Indians in 20 states and union territories cast their ballots in 91 constituencies. The seven-phase vote to elect a new lower house of parliament will continue until 19 May. Counting day is 23 May. With 900 million eligible voters across the country, this is the largest election ever seen. Some observers have billed the vote as the most important in decades and the tone of the campaign has been acrimonious. Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a historic landslide in the last elections in 2014.  He stakes his claim to lead India on a tough image and remains the governing BJP's main vote-getter. But critics say his promises of economic growth and job creation haven't met expectations, and India has become more religiously polarised under his leadership. As it happened: First day of voting The BJP faces challenges from strong regional parties and a resurgent Congress party, led by Rahul Gandhi.  Mr Gandhi's father, grandmother and great-grandfather were all Indian prime ministers. His sister, Priyanka Gandhi, formally launched her political career in January. Mr Modi has made national security a key election issue The Lok Sabha, or lower house of parliament, has 543 elected seats and any party or coalition needs a minimum of 272 MPs to form a government. Hundreds of voters began to queue up outside polling centres early Thursday morning for the first of seven days of voting over six weeks. Their concerns ranged from jobs and unemployment to India's role in the world and national security. Many, like Dashami Majumdar, a 23 year old with two children, were focused on local issues - namely ""better roads"". ""Nobody tells me who to vote for, my vote is mine, my vote is my independence,"" she told the BBC in Cooch Behar, in West Bengal. Another voter there, Shzina Bibi, a 28-year-old housewife with two children, said she was looking at what the political parties, not individual candidates, would do for Indian society. ""We need more communal peace in India. We need to live together with more tolerance,"" she said. But in some places, voters were furious to find they were not on the rolls. In the southern state of Telangana, Shobhana Kamineni was distraught to find that she was not able to cast a ballot. ""This is a crime against me as a citizen and I will not tolerate it,"" she told BBC Telugu. A little boy clutches his father outside a polling booth in Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh state In Baghpat, a constituency in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, scores of Muslim and Dalit (formerly ""untouchable"") voters also complained that their names were missing. Violence also flared in several places. Two people died in separate clashes at polling stations in southern Andhra Pradesh state. In central Chhattisgarh state, suspected Maoist rebels detonated an IED device near a polling booth at about 04:00 local time (22:30 GMT) -  no injuries were reported. Modi The man who wants 900m votes A really simple guide to Indiaâs general election 900m voters, 39 days: 11 things about India polls Modi's struggle to connect with the south It is mind-bogglingly vast - about 900 million people above the age of 18 will be eligible to cast their ballots at one million polling stations. At the last election, voter turnout was about 66%. No voter is meant to have to travel more than 2km to reach a polling station. Because of the enormous number of election officials and security personnel involved, voting is taking place in seven stages between 11 April and 19 May. More than 140 million people were eligible to vote in the first phase of the election on Thursday. Indian lambadi tribeswomen at a polling station in southern India The states and union territories that went to the polls were: Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar islands and Lakshadweep. Polling in some states, such as Andhra Pradesh and Nagaland, concluded in one day. But other states, such as Uttar Pradesh, will hold polls in several phases. India's historic first election in 1951-52 took three months to complete. Between 1962 and 1989, elections were completed in four to 10 days. The four-day elections in 1980 were the country's shortest ever. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, and his sister Priyanka Gandhi, come from a political dynasty Hundreds of millions of Indians have escaped poverty since the turn of the millennium but huge challenges remain. Under Mr Modi, the world's sixth-largest economy appears to have lost some of its momentum. Although annual GDP growth has hovered at about 7%, unemployment is a major concern. Mr Modi's government has been accused of hiding uncomfortable jobs data. In fact, a leaked government report suggests thatthe unemployment rate is the highest it has been since the 1970s. Farm incomes have also stagnated because of a crop glut and declining commodity prices, which have left farmers saddled with debt. Unsurprisingly both parties have targeted the rural poor in their campaign manifestos. The BJP has promised a slew of welfare schemes for India's farmers, while Congress has promised a minimum income scheme for the country's 50 million poorest families. The low-caste leader taking on Indiaâs Modi Has India's government kept its promises? WhatsApp: The 'black hole' of fake news in India's election National security is also in the spotlight this election after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir in February. India then carried out unprecedented air strikes in Pakistan. Since then, the BJP has made national security a key plank in its campaign.

Hammersmith Bridge 'closed indefinitely',"Private vehicles and buses are banned from using the crossing but pedestrians and cyclists can still use it Hammersmith Bridge has been closed to motorists indefinitely after safety checks revealed ""critical faults"". Hammersmith and Fulham Council said it was left with ""no choice"" but to shut the bridge until refurbishment costs could be met. Government ""budget cuts"" left Transport for London (TfL) unable to repair the 132-year-old bridge, the council said. A government spokesperson said: ""Between 2015 and 2021 the government is providing Â£11bn of support to TfL."" The spokesperson added: ""This funding is helping to deliver key projects like Crossrail, the Thameslink and London Bridge improvements, and our work around airport expansion."" TfL said although funding the maintenance of the bridge was not its responsibility, it was working with the council to identify a plan for upgrading the structure. The bridge was not designed to carry the weight or volume of modern traffic, the council said Private vehicles and seven bus services have been banned from using the bridge but pedestrians and cyclists will retain access to the crossing, from Barnes to Hammersmith. The bridge opened in 1887 and requires reinforcing to cope with heavy motorised traffic. The council hadpreviously threatened to close the bridge,externalafter its strict rule allowing only one bus to cross at a time was broken. Local resident Laurence said even walking on the bridge felt like ""dancing with death"". ""To say it is critically unsafe at such short notice, especially when we had the boat race over the weekend - where many people were jumping up and down on the bridge - is very concerning,"" he added. AA president Edmund King said: ""We can't afford to have Hammersmith Bridge closed indefinitely. It is an essential artery to keep London moving. ""It will cause major congestion and hence more emissions - ironically in the same week that the ultra-low emission zone kicked off."" Pri-mania as world's largest store opens Bedtime stories from daddy in jail Good Samaritan student tracked down Many patchwork repairs have been carried out to the bridge's road surface over the years In a statement, the council said: ""Our weekly safety checks have revealed critical faults and we have no choice but to shut the bridge.

Japan's Olympics minister resigns over gaffe,"Japan's Olympics Minister Yoshitaka Sakurada has resigned over comments that offended people affected by a huge tsunami and earthquake in 2011. At a fund-raising event, he suggested that backing the governing LDP member of parliament for the region was more important than its economic revival. It is not the first time Mr Sakurada has been forced to apologise. He said in February that he was disappointed by a Japanese swimmer's leukaemia diagnosis. He said he was worried that medal favourite Rikako Ikee's illness might dampen enthusiasm for next year's Olympics. Mr Sakurada also admitted last year to never having used a computer, despite being Japan's cyber security minister. After accepting Mr Sakurada's resignation, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe apologised for appointing him. ""I deeply apologise for his remark to the people in the disaster-hit areas,"" said Mr Abe. The 2011 tsunami left more than 20,000 dead and caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Shunichi Suzuki, who had been Olympics minister before Mr Sakurada was appointed last October, will return to the post. In February Mr Sakurada had to make another apology, after arriving three minutes late to a parliamentary meeting. Opposition MPs said his poor timekeeping showed disrespect for his office and boycotted a meeting of the budget committee for five hours in protest. He also came under fire in 2016 for describing so-called comfort women forced to provide sexual services to Japanese war-time troops as ""professional prostitutes"".

Actor Rush wins defamation case,"Geoffrey Rush sued a Sydney newspaper for defamation last year Australian actor Geoffrey Rush has won a defamation case against the publisher of a Sydney newspaper which accused him of inappropriate behaviour towards a former co-star. Judge Michael Wigney said he was ""not satisfied"" that the incidents detailed in The Daily Telegraph, published by Nationwide News, had occurred. He said Mr Rush's former co-star Eryn Norvill's evidence was ""inconsistent"". He also said she was ""prone to exaggeration and embellishment"". Judge Wigney ruled that Mr Rush, 67, should be awarded A$850,000 (Â£464,420; $608,680) and would be entitled to more compensation, the exact amount of which would be decided at a later date. He was originally seeking more than A$25m in damages, reported theAustralian Broadcasting Corporation.,external Mr Rush had previously said that his career had been ""irreparably damaged"" by the newspaper's reports. The alleged incidents detailed in The Daily Telegraph article date back to a 2015 theatre production of King Lear in which Mr Rush acted alongside Ms Norvill.

âThree-personâ baby boy born in GreeceThe baby was conceived using an experimental form of IVF that has been criticised by some experts.Health,"The baby was conceived using an experimental form of IVF Fertility doctors in Greece and Spain say they have produced a baby from three people in order to overcome a woman's infertility. The baby boy was born weighing 2.9kg (6lbs) on Tuesday. The mother and child are said to be in good health. The doctors say they are ""making medical history"" which could help infertile couples around the world. But some experts in the UK say the procedure raises ethical questions and should not have taken place. The experimental form of IVF uses an egg from the mother, sperm from the father, and another egg from a donor woman. It was developed to help families affected by deadly mitochondrial diseases which are passed down from mother to baby. It has been tried in only one such case - a family from Jordan - and that provoked much controversy. But some fertility doctors believe the technology could increase the odds of IVF too. First 'three person baby' born Three-person babies IVF technique âsafeâ The girl with three biological parents This is all about mitochondria - they are the tiny compartments inside nearly every cell of the body that convert food into useable energy. They are defective in mitochondrial diseases so combining the mother's DNA with a donor's mitochondria could prevent disease. But there is also speculation mitochondria may have a role in a successful pregnancy too. That claim has not been tested. The patient was a 32-year-old woman in Greece who had endured four unsuccessful cycles of IVF. She is now a mother, but her son has a tiny amount of his genetic makeup from the donor woman as mitochondria have their own DNA. Dr Panagiotis Psathas, president of the Institute of Life in Athens, said: ""A woman's inalienable right to become a mother with her own genetic material became a reality. ""We are very proud to announce an international innovation in assisted reproduction, and we are now in a position to make it possible for women with multiple IVF failures or rare mitochondrial genetic diseases to have a healthy child."" The Greek team were working with the Spanish centre Embryotools, which has announced that24 other women are taking part in the trial,externaland eight embryos are ready to be implanted. In February 2018, the doctors in Newcastle who pioneered the technology were given permission to create the UK's first three-person babies. The fertility regulator approved two attempts, both in families with rare mitochondrial diseases. Some doctors in the UK argued the two applications - fertility and disease prevention - are morally very different. Tim Child, from the University of Oxford and the medical director of The Fertility Partnership, said: ""I'm concerned that there's no proven need for the patient to have her genetic material removed from her eggs and transferred into the eggs of a donor. ""The risks of the technique aren't entirely known, though may be considered acceptable if being used to treat mitochondrial disease, but not in this situation. ""The patient may have conceived even if a further standard IVF cycle had been used."" Dr Beth Thompson, from the Wellcome Trust, said: ""UK regulation was based on strong public engagement and scientific evidence and allows the risks and benefits to be carefully weighed up. ""We're proud to be supporting the first UK study into the use of mitochondria donation techniques in a well regulated environment, but we're concerned about studies taken place without similar levels of oversight.""

"S Korea must end abortion ban - courtSouth Korea will revise a law banning abortion by the end of 2020, after a historic court decision.Asia","Campaigners say South Korea's abortion ban stigmatises women and endangers their health South Korea's ban on abortion has been ruled unconstitutional in a historic court decision. The country's constitutional court ordered that the law must be revised by the end of 2020. Under the 1953 ban, women who have abortions can be fined and imprisoned, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to their health. Doctors who perform the procedure can also face jail. South Korea is one of the few developed countries to criminalise abortion. On Wednesday an opinion poll found 58% of the public favour abolishing the ban. The law was reviewed after a challenge from a female doctor who was prosecuted for performing almost 70 abortions. She said the ban endangered women and limited their rights. 'Why I never want babies' Why women in South Korea are cutting 'the corset' How to stop parents aborting girls The push for change comes from a burgeoning movement fighting for women's rights in South Korea. Pro-choice campaigners say the abortion ban is part of a broader bias against women in the country. South Korea is home to a large number of evangelical Christians, however - and some want abortion to remain illegal because they say it forces women to think deeply about the decision. As the cheers of celebration rippled through the hundreds who'd gathered to fight to overturn the abortion ban, two women stood hugging. One in tears. She'd had an abortion in the past. She'd hid her decision for years, even from her close friends, because she felt ashamed. But today she said she felt she could breathe and that her choice finally felt valid. The stigma was gone. Others in this mostly young group of women told me this landmark ruling finally made them feel that female voices were being heard in what is a deeply patriarchal society. On the other side of the road a group of anti-abortion activists shouted ""down with feminism"". They believe this ruling will not stand and that there is a chance to fight on. The Constitutional Court's decision has put the next step into the hands of politicians, who have until December 2020 to re-write the law. These conservative groups believe they can influence that process. Despite the restrictive law, abortions are widely accessible in South Korea and can be carried out safely. Women who end their pregnancies are rarely prosecuted, but activists say the ban puts their health at risk and generates social stigma. Teenagers who get pregnant are often forced to end their studies or transfer to remote institutions, according to youth rights groups. Allow Twitter content?

Australia's PM calls national election,"Scott Morrison is Australia's current prime minister Australians are voting in a closely-fought general election on Saturday. The poll will decide whether the conservative Liberal-National Coalition wins a third term or is replaced by a Labor administration led by Bill Shorten. All 151 seats in the House of Representatives will be contested, and half of the 76 seats in the Senate. The election has been hotly contested in several areas, particularly climate change and the economy. Prime Minister Scott Morrison told voters in his last pitch on Thursday: ""Now is the time to get on and keep on with the work of building our economy, by backing in the choices Australians are wanting to make every day."" Meanwhile, Mr Shorten highlighted climate change and urged voters to push for change. ""Vote for the new vision - the new stability, the new determination of a new Labor Government."" Here are some key things to know about the vote. This video can not be played Why Australians get fined if they don't turn up to vote Unlike many other global democracies, Australia has mandatory voting for people aged 18 and over - or they risk a fine. This year has seen a record 96.8% enrolment rate. In contrast, the most recent recent US and UK elections drew an estimated 55% and 69% respectively. Advocates say the mandatory system depolarises the vote and reduces the influence of lobby groups, though critics dispute this. Voting has also been open for three weeks already. More than four million people, about a quarter of voters, have already cast their ballot at ""pre-polling"" booths. The vote that spans outback to Antarctica Mr Morrison only became prime minister last August, after bitter party infighting ousted his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. In doing so, Mr Morrison became Australia's fifth leader since 2013. This video can not be played Australia's decade of internal leadership coups ""It was a peculiarly Australian form of madness,""Mr Turnbull told the BBC in March, speaking about a coup culture which began with Labor in 2010. It's likely to harm the government's standing with voters, predicts Prof Sally Young, a politics expert from the University of Melbourne. ""They're sick of the sniping and undermining,"" she says. ""Knifing a leader - it never goes down well."" Australia has just endured a year of extreme weather events, including destructive floods, bushfires, cyclones and a severe drought. The past summer was the nation's hottest on record. It has made climate change a key election issue in some seats, experts say. Extreme weather has pushed climate change into voters' minds, experts say Last year,the government scrapped plans to set an emissions reduction targetin legislation - prompting fierce criticism. ""Australia's lack of action [on climate change] internationally is becoming more recognised within this country,"" says Prof Young. The University of Sydney's Prof Marc Stears agrees, but says it's unclear how widely it will affect voting decisions. The big climate call coming to Australia How Australia's heat might be here to stay The major parties have been talking up their traditional strengths. That's subjects like jobs and tax relief for the government, and health and education for Labor. They will compete fiercely on economic issues, with both parties promising policies aimed at reducing the cost of living, Bill Shorten has led the Labor opposition for six years Although Australia's economy is the envy of many countries, wages growth is flat, and there is a generational split in attitudes to house prices. How Australia is changing - in 11 charts Mr Morrison is overseeing a minority government, meaning he can ill afford to lose support anywhere in the country. Political observers say he faces challenges from the left and right - a debate that is often framed in geographical terms. In the northern state of Queensland, experts say the government fears losing votes to more socially conservative minor parties and independents. But in Victoria in the south, the electorate is perceived as more progressive. It delivered a resounding victory to Labor in a state election five months ago. Is cash king in Australia's elections? During past elections, Australia's major parties have employed tough rhetoric on immigration issues - particularly regarding asylum seekers. It has often been used to appear strong on issues such as national security, says Prof Stears. Australia holds asylum seekers in offshore detention, under a controversial bipartisan policy That debate resurfaced in February, however it appears that the New Zealand mosque attacks in March may have silenced any dog-whistling rhetoric. Why Australia's PM is talking of dark threats and 'evil' Prof Young says there is some public cynicism about the major parties, pointing to possible increases in support for other candidates. High-profile independent candidates have entered key races, and in New South Wales, a recent state election saw rises in minor party support in rural electorates. In February, Mr Morrison said a ""state actor"" had carried out a cyber attackon the parliament and political parties. Authorities said there was no evidence of electoral interference, but security experts have urged vigilance. Concerns about alleged foreign interference prompted Australia to introduce new laws last year. This video can not be played Is China trying to influence Australian politics? In 2017, several MPs were disqualified for unintentionally breaking a rule that lawmakers cannot be dual citizens when elected. Fifteen parliamentarians were ousted, though six later managed to return after relinquishing their non-Australian citizenships.

The story of Australia's dual citizenship crisis Opinion polls have narrowed in recent weeks, but Labor still has the edge on a two-party preferred basis.

Council overpaid staff by ÃÂ£800k in error,"An eighth of former employees continued to be paid after leaving the council A council overpaid staff and former employees more than Â£800,000 over three years, a spending watchdog has revealed. Renfrewshire Council made more than 800 salary overpayments between April 2015 and February 2018. The Accounts Commission said six of them exceeded Â£10,000 and one person received an extra Â£15,500. A spokesperson for the local authority said it had taken all appropriate action to recover the money. So far it has recovered 58% of the money overpaid -  a total of about Â£812,000 -  to current staff and 27% from former employees. But the Accounts Commission report revealed it had written off Â£21,000. The spending watchdog found an eighth of former employees of the council were still paid after leaving, ""usually due to a delay in a department notifying payroll services staff that someone had left"". Details of the financial error were revealed in a new report on council finances which warned that systems aimed at preventing money being lost through mistakes and fraud may be becoming ""strained"". It said: ""Some recurring weaknesses are becoming apparent among councils and the consequences could be serious, including the loss of significant amounts of public money, impacts on services and reputational damage."" Graham Sharp, chairman of the Accounts Commission, said robust management and scrutiny were more important now than ever before. ""Councils face complex and challenging financial pressures, and rising demand for services,"" he said ""At the same time, budgets are tightening and there is significant uncertainty from factors such as the UK's withdrawal from the EU."" However, he said there were also many examples where Scottish councils were managing their finances effectively. A Renfrewshire Council spokesperson said: ""The risk of overpayments exists for all organisations and we have robust recovery processes in place for all debts owed, including salary overpayments, and we always take all appropriate action to recover all overpayments."" Alison Evison, the president of the local government body Cosla, said the report was a ""timely reminder of the many and varied pressures on local government"". She added: ""Scotland's councillors appreciate their role and duty in safeguarding public money and take it seriously. ""Cosla and our colleagues in the Improvement Service will continue to support our member councils look at ways to strengthen our joint work in this vital area even further.""

"The families who took on a housing giantHow a group of homeowners in Scotland won a fight to have their ""crumbling"" new-build homes repaired.Business","Families joined forces to protest outside a different, unaffected Taylor Wimpey development It took seven families two years, but a group of homeowners in Scotland has taken on a housing giant in order to have their ""crumbling"" new-build homes repaired. It's part of a broader, UK-wide issue - this is their story. Sheila Chalmers moved to her estate in Peebles in the Scottish borders with her husband 10 years ago. Her four-bed home was one of 250 built by developer Taylor Wimpey on a new site. For eight years, life went on as normal. Then something strange started to happen. Overnight, families at the top end of the estate started to vanish. But there were no for sale signs and no-one new was moving in. ""It became almost a ghost street,"" she says. ""Houses were empty. People were disappearing."" Sheila later heard that the properties had been bought back by Taylor Wimpey after problems were discovered. The owners had signed non-disclosure agreements so they could not speak out. Sheila paid for assessments by two different structural engineers Taylor Wimpey confirmed it did buy back a ""small number of homes"" to start with. It later sent a letter to all the remaining residents, saying that some houses did have a problem with the mortar holding together their bricks. Sheila thought she did not have anything to worry about, but she went outside and checked anyway. Patches of mortar were clearly eroding, she says, and in other places it could be scraped out with a fingernail. She paid for assessments by two different structural engineers, who both said the house needed extensive repair work, though Taylor Wimpey said its own inspections found that was not the case. Mortar is made up of two key materials: cement and sand. The more cement in the mix, the stronger the mortar, though the more brittle it can be. The family paid to have their laboratory tests on the mortar carried out by a specialist firm. The results suggested that there was far more sand in the mix than you would expect for a home in that area, although Taylor Wimpey says the type of chemical test used was ""not appropriate"" and the results could not be relied upon. Our investigation in 2018 found similar complaintsabout weak mortar across at least 13 estates in the UK all built by different companies. Jill and Pete Hall say they would never buy a new build house again Three doors down from Sheila, live Pete and Jill Hall with their 13-year-old son. Like Sheila, they first learned about the problem two years ago when Taylor Wimpey were buying back the individual houses. They paid for their own tests, which showed only one in eight samples taken from their home met industry guidelines, although again Taylor Wimpey says the test used was ""not appropriate"". ""On the garage the tests came back showing it was just sand,"" said Pete. A video filmed by the family after a rainstorm clearly shows the mortar on the back wall falling out when a screwdriver was run gently along it. In the end, seven core households became involved - passing on details to a wider community group on the estate. The families worked together to build their case, paying for their own structural surveys and using Freedom of Information laws to demand internal documents from the local council. They made handmade signs and protested outside the showroom of another Taylor Wimpey estate in the area. In 2017, they presented their findings to Taylor Wimpey's lawyers, saying that they would go public if their properties were not fixed, demolished or bought back. They were surprised at the response. The families' solicitors received a letter back saying they had decided not to report the group to the authorities under the Proceeds of Crime legislation. ""It was accusing us of bribery, effectively,"" said Pete. ""It took me about 10 minutes to stop laughing. But it was intimidation, a threat."" The couple bought a giant shipping container, covered it with warning stickers and left it on their front lawn By then, Pete and Jill had hired their own engineers to examine the house. They recommended that the couple should stop using the garage because it was at risk of collapse, although Taylor Wimpey denies that there was a structural problem. The couple bought a giant shipping container, covered it with warning stickers and left it on their front lawn. That, they say, got Taylor Wimpey's attention and - two years down the line - an agreement has now been reached for their home to be fixed. ""It falls short of where we think a full repair should be, but they have said it's that or nothing - so we have accepted it,"" Jill says. In December 2018, Taylor Wimpey sent out letters saying all 130 houses in the estate built with the weaker mortar would now be offered ""remediation"" work. Properties are being dealt with one at a time. Construction crews are scraping out the old mortar and replacing it with a stronger material. Taylor Wimpey said it ""sincerely apologises"" to the all the homeowners affected, is ""fully committed to resolving matters"" and has ""a clear plan in place to remediate affected homes"". ""This is a localised issue and falls short of the high-quality standards we uphold,"" it said. The firm has now apologised to Sheila and, even though its own inspections found a full repair is not needed, said work to replace the mortar in her home will start this summer. It will refund some of the Â£16,000 she has spent on legal costs and technical reports, most of which she had to borrow. Repair work on Pete and Jill's property, which may involve the demolition of the garage, is due to start in mid-July. Both families say the fight has been time-consuming, stressful and put them off ever buying a new-build home again. ""These developers, these companies, cannot be allowed to continue the destruction of people's lives with building shoddy homes,"" said Sheila. ""Somebody has to stand up and show them that they cannot get away with it."" Maps drawn up by Taylor Wimpey show about half of the 250 homes were built with far weaker mortar than recommended under industry standards A memo sent to all developers in the UK by the National House Building Council (NHBC) in 2013 warned about this problem The local council in Peebles says the mortar used was not the type in the original building warrant and was changed later without its knowledge Taylor Wimpey says the material was ""of sufficient strength to meet structural requirements"" as ""supported by an independent review"" by the local council, but accepts it may be ""less durable under prevailing exposure conditions"" It says it has now offered to repoint ""any home which was constructed with the same mortar, regardless of whether our inspection found this was necessary or not"" Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

She faced anger from some in her own party in the Commons, those who favoured leaving without a deal, while some on the Labour benches applauded her for putting country over party. The PM confirmed that another referendum has not been offered in talks with the Labour Party. That's it! MPs are now in recess and will return to Parliament on 23 April. Press Association Europe needs to listen to unionist concerns about theIrish backstop, Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster has said. In a meeting in Brussels, Mrs Foster told the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier unionists in the region opposed the Withdrawal Agreement because of the mechanism. Afterwards, she warned that the UK and EU would move ""inexorably towards a no-deal scenario"" unless changes to the backstop were made. Mrs Foster says the EU has ignored the views of unionists on the issue, and has instead been influenced by the pro-backstop lobbying of Irish nationalists. Press Association Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns is blaming Brexit uncertainty on those who voted against the government's withdrawal agreement. He hopes the Easter break will be a time of reflection by MPs, he says. ""I was most disappointed that Parliament didn't get a majority for the withdrawal agreement because even opposition parties had expressed support for elements of it,"" he says. ""The country wants to draw a line under this, the country wants to move on to new investments and new opportunities. ""Therefore I think it's incumbent on MPs to recognise the outcome of the referendum but do so in a smooth and orderly way.""

Christine Lagarde tells the BBC that the delay to Brexit means businesses and investors will remain hesitant in the coming months. The government's Brexit talks with Labour could end by theEuropean electionson 23 June, Downing Street is suggesting. Discussions between the government and Labour are continuing today and a ministerial meeting is scheduled to take place on Friday. But a No 10 spokesman says the talks won't continue ""for the sake of it"". ""We have stressed the urgency because there is an opportunity to avoid European parliamentary elections and to bring a resolution so that businesses and people have greater certainty,"" he tells the Press Association. ""Bluntly, we won't continue to talk for the sake of it."" If talks fail, the next step would be to put options before MPs in another series of votes, the spokesman says. BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Livereporter Rowan Bridge is in Blackpool. He's been speaking to Nikki and Chris from Glasgow who are on a day trip with their two children. They both voted Remain. Nikki says: ""We're left really uncertain about our future, the future for our kids and future generations and it's just a bit unsettling really."" ""Nothing's really been agreed and we're not getting any further forward, so I've not really got confidence that it will be resolved, but you never know, they might surprise us. ""[Theresa May] is not giving me much confidence so far, but we'll wait and see how things go."" Chris says: ""I think it's a shambles... There's just been arrogance from the start and I'm really disappointed in all the parties. ""I don't really see an end point... I think we'll probably have to go back to a second referendum.

Here's what the President of the European Council Donald Tusk had to say about the delay (and what his speech actually means). Polling expert Sir John Curtice says it should be assumed the UK will take part in European elections as it has run out of time to agree a deal before the deadline.

mean there was no need for European Parliament elections â which take place on
23 May. But Sir John, professor of politics at the University of
Strathclyde, tells the BBC: âThat three-week timetable - which is what sheâs
effectively got - looks terribly, terribly tight.â He adds: âIt doesnât look as though there is long enough to
complete the whole process by which we are going to withdraw from the EU by 22
May and for all practical purposes we should now assume that the European parliamentary
elections are going to happen.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The government is relient on aconfidence-and supply agreement with the DUPin the House of Commons. But the Northern Irish party, which wants changes to thebackstop, has repeatedly said it will not back Theresa May's Brexit deal.  Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent It is a longer delay than Prime Minister Theresa May asked for, but shorter than most EU leaders wanted. So what will happen next? With the clocking ticking again, Mrs May wants Parliament to finally agree on the UK's withdrawal from the EU preferably before 23 May, to avoid the UK taking part in elections to the European Parliament. Her plan is first to try to get a cross-party agreement with the opposition Labour Party. If that fails, there could be a series of votes in Parliament on alternatives to her deal, such as holding a second referendum. But agreement has so far proved elusive, so it's entirely possible the UK will be back where it started at the end of extra time. Read Rob's more detailed analysishere House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Alistair Burt, whoresignedto vote against the government over Brexit, calls on the PM to be as ""flexible as possible"" when it comes to alternatives to her deal. He calls for ""free votes"" in Parliament to determine which of those alternatives commands the most support. Theresa May replies that the government is working with Labour to find a compromise that could get through the Commons. If this is not possible, the government will work to ""take votes forward"" to identify a majority opinion in Parliament. Â© 2025 BBC.

S Korea abortion ban 'unconstitutional',"Campaigners say South Korea's abortion ban stigmatises women and endangers their health South Korea's ban on abortion has been ruled unconstitutional in a historic court decision. The country's constitutional court ordered that the law must be revised by the end of 2020. Under the 1953 ban, women who have abortions can be fined and imprisoned, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to their health. Doctors who perform the procedure can also face jail. South Korea is one of the few developed countries to criminalise abortion. On Wednesday an opinion poll found 58% of the public favour abolishing the ban. The law was reviewed after a challenge from a female doctor who was prosecuted for performing almost 70 abortions. She said the ban endangered women and limited their rights. 'Why I never want babies' Why women in South Korea are cutting 'the corset' How to stop parents aborting girls The push for change comes from a burgeoning movement fighting for women's rights in South Korea. Pro-choice campaigners say the abortion ban is part of a broader bias against women in the country. South Korea is home to a large number of evangelical Christians, however - and some want abortion to remain illegal because they say it forces women to think deeply about the decision. As the cheers of celebration rippled through the hundreds who'd gathered to fight to overturn the abortion ban, two women stood hugging. One in tears. She'd had an abortion in the past. She'd hid her decision for years, even from her close friends, because she felt ashamed. But today she said she felt she could breathe and that her choice finally felt valid. The stigma was gone. Others in this mostly young group of women told me this landmark ruling finally made them feel that female voices were being heard in what is a deeply patriarchal society. On the other side of the road a group of anti-abortion activists shouted ""down with feminism"". They believe this ruling will not stand and that there is a chance to fight on. The Constitutional Court's decision has put the next step into the hands of politicians, who have until December 2020 to re-write the law. These conservative groups believe they can influence that process. Despite the restrictive law, abortions are widely accessible in South Korea and can be carried out safely. Women who end their pregnancies are rarely prosecuted, but activists say the ban puts their health at risk and generates social stigma. Teenagers who get pregnant are often forced to end their studies or transfer to remote institutions, according to youth rights groups. Allow Twitter content?

A survey last year found that one in five women who had been pregnant had had an abortion, and just 1% fell under the legal exemptions, AFP news agency reports. An estimated 50,000 abortions were carried out in South Korea in 2017, compared with government estimates of about 169,000 cases in 2010. This fall is largely attributed to improvements to contraceptive services and products, which are now widely available, and a better understanding of birth control.

Wealthy biggest winners from school appeals,"Appeals can be made over school places by families who missed out on a first preference Families in affluent areas of England are much more likely to succeed in getting a school place on appeal, according to research. The Education Policy Institute has examined what happened to 86,000 families who did not get their first-choice secondary school place. About one in seven of those initially missing out go on to get a place from an appeal or joining a waiting list. Researcher Emily Hunt says this process is ""reinforcing inequalities"". The study found that families in wealthier areas were twice as likely to secure a place through appeals or waiting lists than their poorer counterparts. Researchers looked at the outcomes for the 86,000 families in 2016-17 who did not get into their first-choice school - of whom 13,000 later succeeded in getting into their preferred school. They found that the process of appeals, where decisions can be challenged, and waiting lists, tended to work in favour of better-off families. Appeals can be on grounds such as claiming there has been an error in applying admissions rules, or extra evidence that should have been taken into account or particular medical or social circumstances. There were also differences between ethnic groups, with 21% of white British families who appealed getting their chosen place, compared with 10% of black families. Secondary school places: Not got what you wanted? Northamptonshire warns of places shortage Shortfall in Bristol school places predicted The research found that the battle for places on appeal is almost always for high-achieving schools, graded either good or outstanding. But the study says that this second round of attempts to get a place, through appeals and waiting lists, does not seem to be a level playing-field. Report author Emily Hunt says it provides evidence of the inequality facing parents trying to get their preferred place. ""This is particularly concerning, as parents use these routes to access schools with higher Ofsted ratings, and these schools also have socially advantaged intakes. ""It is clear from our research that the current appeals and waiting lists system is not consistent with the government's aim of an education system that prioritises the most disadvantaged."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said there needed to be a more strategic approach to providing enough school places. ""For too many, there will be huge disappointment. In some parts of the country, it will mean children having to travel long distances to go to secondary school,"" he said. Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: ""The Tories have broken their promises to parents on school admissions, and it is the most disadvantaged children who are losing out as a result of this failure."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""Every parent or carer who has been refused a place at a school has the right to appeal. ""We have provided guidance for parents to help them understand the process and have made clear to appeals panels they must ensure the process is consistent, with all parties being treated fairly.""

MPs demand regulator to curb bailiffsA committee of MPs says a regulator should be appointed to crack down on bailiffsBusiness,"MPs have said bailiffs should be regulated to stop them breaking rules and even the law to collect debts. Charities have reported a dramatic rise in cases of bailiffs using intimidating behaviour, threatening to break into homes and in some cases even doing so. The Parliamentary Justice Committee says a regulator is needed to ensure that people in debt are treated fairly. Justice Committee chairman Bob Neill said:  ""We were surprised that no regulator is already in place. ""The system is confusing, particularly for the most vulnerable people in society. Complaints are important and must be investigated properly."" The committee calls the existing system in England and Wales of individual certification ""a rubber-stamping exercise"". It is recommending: A new regulator with powers to bar bailiffs from operating An independent complaints body Mandatory body cameras for all enforcement agents Mr Neill said: ""We're calling on the government to consult on whether new powers should sit with an existing body or a new one, and how it should be funded."" Although debt collection was reformed in 2014, 11 debt and mental health organisations launched a campaign calledTaking Control,externalto gather evidence and force further change. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""Bailiffs regularly break the rules, as our evidence has proved."" In the year to March, Citizens Advice saw a 16% increase in bailiff-related issues from last year and helped 40,000 people with almost 104,000 bailiff problems. The charity highlighted bailiffs refusing to set up offers of affordable payments, charging excessive fees and misrepresenting their rights of entry. Of all the people it helped with bailiff issues, 60% were female, 35% were either disabled or had a long-term health condition and of those, 11% had a mental health condition. Ms Guy said: ""It's excellent to see MPs from across all parties call for a regulator to crack down on the bailiff industry. They've also rightly called for a complaints process to be established, so problems are dealt with independently of the bailiff industry and outside the court system. ""All eyes will now be on the Ministry of Justice, which must introduce these reforms as a matter of urgency."" In November, the Civil Enforcement Association which represents civil enforcement agencies operating in England and Wales responded to Citizens' Advice's report that called for tougher regulation. Chief executive Russell Hamblin-Boone said: ""It is of great concern that Citizens Advice fails to make a distinction between laws that are broken and laws that people simply don't like. ""For example, in the [Citizens Advice] report it is assumed that a threat to force entry to a property or to remove goods required for work purposes is breaking the regulations. That is simply incorrect and depends on the circumstances. It is shocking that agents are being accused of acting illegally based on such flimsy evidence."" Increasingly bailiffs are used tocollect council tax arrears. A survey in 2016 by StepChange Debt charity found that 51% of clients who were contacted by bailiffs were being chased for council tax arrears. On Wednesday the Government said it would improve the way council tax debt is recovered. It said it was bringing in new guidance to help end aggressive repayment enforcement tactics following concerns from charities, debt advice bodies and local councils. Peter Tutton, head of policy at StepChange debt charity, said: ""Enforcement by bailiffs is intrusive and places disproportionate costs on people in the most vulnerable circumstances.

"Wealthy biggest winners from school appealsThe appeals system for school places is working in favour of richer families, say researchers.Family & Education","Appeals can be made over school places by families who missed out on a first preference Families in affluent areas of England are much more likely to succeed in getting a school place on appeal, according to research. The Education Policy Institute has examined what happened to 86,000 families who did not get their first-choice secondary school place. About one in seven of those initially missing out go on to get a place from an appeal or joining a waiting list. Researcher Emily Hunt says this process is ""reinforcing inequalities"". The study found that families in wealthier areas were twice as likely to secure a place through appeals or waiting lists than their poorer counterparts. Researchers looked at the outcomes for the 86,000 families in 2016-17 who did not get into their first-choice school - of whom 13,000 later succeeded in getting into their preferred school. They found that the process of appeals, where decisions can be challenged, and waiting lists, tended to work in favour of better-off families. Appeals can be on grounds such as claiming there has been an error in applying admissions rules, or extra evidence that should have been taken into account or particular medical or social circumstances. There were also differences between ethnic groups, with 21% of white British families who appealed getting their chosen place, compared with 10% of black families. Secondary school places: Not got what you wanted? Northamptonshire warns of places shortage Shortfall in Bristol school places predicted The research found that the battle for places on appeal is almost always for high-achieving schools, graded either good or outstanding. But the study says that this second round of attempts to get a place, through appeals and waiting lists, does not seem to be a level playing-field. Report author Emily Hunt says it provides evidence of the inequality facing parents trying to get their preferred place. ""This is particularly concerning, as parents use these routes to access schools with higher Ofsted ratings, and these schools also have socially advantaged intakes. ""It is clear from our research that the current appeals and waiting lists system is not consistent with the government's aim of an education system that prioritises the most disadvantaged."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said there needed to be a more strategic approach to providing enough school places. ""For too many, there will be huge disappointment. In some parts of the country, it will mean children having to travel long distances to go to secondary school,"" he said. Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: ""The Tories have broken their promises to parents on school admissions, and it is the most disadvantaged children who are losing out as a result of this failure."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""Every parent or carer who has been refused a place at a school has the right to appeal. ""We have provided guidance for parents to help them understand the process and have made clear to appeals panels they must ensure the process is consistent, with all parties being treated fairly.""

MPs demand regulator to curb bailiffs,"MPs have said bailiffs should be regulated to stop them breaking rules and even the law to collect debts. Charities have reported a dramatic rise in cases of bailiffs using intimidating behaviour, threatening to break into homes and in some cases even doing so. The Parliamentary Justice Committee says a regulator is needed to ensure that people in debt are treated fairly. Justice Committee chairman Bob Neill said:  ""We were surprised that no regulator is already in place. ""The system is confusing, particularly for the most vulnerable people in society. Complaints are important and must be investigated properly."" The committee calls the existing system in England and Wales of individual certification ""a rubber-stamping exercise"". It is recommending: A new regulator with powers to bar bailiffs from operating An independent complaints body Mandatory body cameras for all enforcement agents Mr Neill said: ""We're calling on the government to consult on whether new powers should sit with an existing body or a new one, and how it should be funded."" Although debt collection was reformed in 2014, 11 debt and mental health organisations launched a campaign calledTaking Control,externalto gather evidence and force further change. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""Bailiffs regularly break the rules, as our evidence has proved."" In the year to March, Citizens Advice saw a 16% increase in bailiff-related issues from last year and helped 40,000 people with almost 104,000 bailiff problems. The charity highlighted bailiffs refusing to set up offers of affordable payments, charging excessive fees and misrepresenting their rights of entry. Of all the people it helped with bailiff issues, 60% were female, 35% were either disabled or had a long-term health condition and of those, 11% had a mental health condition. Ms Guy said: ""It's excellent to see MPs from across all parties call for a regulator to crack down on the bailiff industry.

Council overpaid staff by Â£800k in error,"An eighth of former employees continued to be paid after leaving the council A council overpaid staff and former employees more than Â£800,000 over three years, a spending watchdog has revealed. Renfrewshire Council made more than 800 salary overpayments between April 2015 and February 2018. The Accounts Commission said six of them exceeded Â£10,000 and one person received an extra Â£15,500. A spokesperson for the local authority said it had taken all appropriate action to recover the money. So far it has recovered 58% of the money overpaid -  a total of about Â£812,000 -  to current staff and 27% from former employees. But the Accounts Commission report revealed it had written off Â£21,000. The spending watchdog found an eighth of former employees of the council were still paid after leaving, ""usually due to a delay in a department notifying payroll services staff that someone had left"". Details of the financial error were revealed in a new report on council finances which warned that systems aimed at preventing money being lost through mistakes and fraud may be becoming ""strained"". It said: ""Some recurring weaknesses are becoming apparent among councils and the consequences could be serious, including the loss of significant amounts of public money, impacts on services and reputational damage."" Graham Sharp, chairman of the Accounts Commission, said robust management and scrutiny were more important now than ever before. ""Councils face complex and challenging financial pressures, and rising demand for services,"" he said ""At the same time, budgets are tightening and there is significant uncertainty from factors such as the UK's withdrawal from the EU."" However, he said there were also many examples where Scottish councils were managing their finances effectively. A Renfrewshire Council spokesperson said: ""The risk of overpayments exists for all organisations and we have robust recovery processes in place for all debts owed, including salary overpayments, and we always take all appropriate action to recover all overpayments."" Alison Evison, the president of the local government body Cosla, said the report was a ""timely reminder of the many and varied pressures on local government"". She added: ""Scotland's councillors appreciate their role and duty in safeguarding public money and take it seriously. ""Cosla and our colleagues in the Improvement Service will continue to support our member councils look at ways to strengthen our joint work in this vital area even further.""

Millions of asthma cases 'due to pollution',"Four million cases of childhood asthma could be caused by air pollution from traffic - around 13% of those diagnosed each year, a global study suggests. Current pollution guidelines may need changing because most children developing asthma live in areas within recommended levels, the authors say. South Korea has the highest burden of pollution-related asthma, along with Chinese cities, the study found. Experts say urgent action to protect children is required. The study, in The Lancet Planetary Health journal,external, by researchers from George Washington University, looked at levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as an indicator of traffic pollution. NO2 is just one element of air pollution, which is also made up of particulate matter, ozone and carbon monoxide. Together they are known to be harmful to health and particularly damaging to the airways and lungs, increasing the risk of asthma and other lung diseases. Using population data, information on child asthma cases diagnosed by doctors and NO2 measurements from ground-level monitors and satellites, the researchers estimated the number of asthma cases related to traffic pollution in under-18s in 194 countries and 125 major cities. The countries with the highest rates of childhood asthma cases linked to traffic pollution are: Kuwait - 550 per 100,000 United Arab Emirates - 460 per 100,000 Canada - 450 per 100,000 The largest number of asthma cases attributable to traffic pollution are estimated to occur in: China - 760,000 cases India - 350,000 US - 240,000 Indonesia - 160,000 Brazil - 140,000 The countries with the highest percentage of pollution-related childhood asthma cases: South Korea - 31% Kuwait - 30% Qatar - 30% United Arab Emirates - 30% Bahrain - 26% The UK, China and the US were all on 19%, with India on 14%. The true levels of pollution-related asthma may be higher in many low and middle-income countries, the study said, because asthma cases often go undiagnosed in these regions. What are the effects of air pollution? Air pollution tests for UK children 'Our children are gasping' - Senegal's toxic air battle Lead study author Ploy Achakulwisut said: ""Our study indicates that policy initiatives to alleviate traffic-related air pollution can lead to improvements in children's health and also reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" She pointed toLondon's ultra-low emission zone congestion chargesand the electrification of Shenzhen's entire bus fleet as recent examples. The World Health Organisation says asthma rates in children have been increasing sharply since the 1950s. It estimates that 4.2 million premature deaths around the world are linked to air pollution, from heart disease, stroke and respiratory infections in children. WHO guidelines,externalstate that annual average NO2 concentrations should be 40ug/m3 (21 parts per billion). Prof Rajen Naidoo, from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, said: ""This strengthens the case for the downward revision of these global [pollution] standards and for stronger national policy initiatives in countries without air quality standards."" And he said the findings highlighted that there was an urgent need to protect the health of the most vulnerable in society - children. Prof Jonathan Grigg, from Queen Mary University London, said other components of the pollution mix should be targeted, not just NO2, and the effects on adult asthma should also be studied. But he said the study provided ""further evidence that ultra-low emission zones, such as the one launched recently in London, must be of sufficient size to reduce exposure of all children living in these urban areas."" Dr Matthew Loxham, fellow in respiratory biology and air pollution toxicology in medicine at the University of Southampton, said it was ""beyond doubt"" that air pollution causes adverse health effects. ""The issue is how we generate the data to decide what the [WHO] guideline levels should be or - perhaps more fundamentally - get across the message that there is no appropriate guideline level,"" he said. Dr Samantha Walker, director of policy and research at Asthma UK, said polluted air could be affecting an estimated half a million children with asthma in the UK. ""The government must commit to targets that reduce toxic air across the UK to the legal levels recommended by the World Health Organisation, so that future generations can breathe clean air,"" she said.

Multi-organ op woman 'wants normal life',"Michelle Oddy says the risky operation should give her ""a much better quality of life"" A woman waiting for a rare multi-organ transplant has said all she wants is to lead a normal life and eat a proper meal. Michelle Oddy, 43, was diagnosed with Crohn's disease as a teenager and can only consume liquids following several operations. She is now hoping the transplant procedure will save her life. Ms Oddy has been warned there is a risk of death but said she feared she would die anyway without the operation. The hairdresser is hoping to join a waiting list next month to get half a stomach, a new large and small bowel, intestines, pancreas and liver. ""I've changed my mind so many times about it,"" the mother-of-one from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, said. ""It's something that needs to be done so I can run a normal life with my wife and daughter."" Ms Oddy has had several health complications since she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease If the organs from a deceased donor are found she will undergo a 20-hour operation at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge - the only one in the UK which provides multi-organ transplants. Surgeon Andrew Butler said the procedure, which included an intestine graft, was ""rare and certainly complex"". ""We have carried out about 100 such procedures and internationally there have been around 1,500 bowel containing transplants in adults since 1992,"" he said. Crohn's disease is a condition in which parts of the digestive system become swollen It affects people of all ages and starts in childhood or early adulthood The main symptoms are diarrhoea, stomach aches and cramps, tiredness and weight loss There is no cure for the disease, but treatments can control the symptoms In some cases surgery is undertaken to remove a small part of the digestive system Source:NHS,external Ms Oddy has had sepsis three times because the feeding tube made her prone to infections Ms Oddy was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, which affects the digestive system, aged 14 and has liquid meals fed through a tube. ""I cannot wait to feel hungry and look forward to eating something,"" she added. ""At the minute, six nights a week, a nurse comes to attach me to my feeds and that gives me all the nutrients."" Eight organ transplant survivor weds 'National standard' needed for Crohn's Boy recovers from five-organ transplant In September, Ms Oddy and her partner Laura married after she contracted sepsis for a third time. ""We were pretty much saying goodbye,"" Ms Oddy said. ""We decided I'd got that close that I wasn't going to live, it gave us a kick up the bum, and made us look at things a lot different."" Laura Oddy said she wants to see her wife pain free Her wife Laura said: ""I'm terrified because there is that chance she might not pull through it, but on the other side, it could change her life.

"First ever black hole image releasedThe ""monster"" black hole is three million times the size of Earth.Science & Environment","The first ever picture of a black hole: It's surrounded by a halo of bright gas Astronomers have taken the first ever image of a black hole, which is located in a distant galaxy. It measures 40 billion km across - three million times the size of the Earth - and has been described by scientists as ""a monster"". The black hole is 500 million trillion km away and was photographed by a network of eight telescopes across the world. Details have been published today in Astrophysical Journal Letters. It was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a network of eight linked telescopes. Prof Heino Falcke, of Radboud University in the Netherlands, who proposed the experiment, told BBC News that the black hole was found in a galaxy called M87. ""What we see is larger than the size of our entire Solar System,"" he said. ""It has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun. And it is one of the heaviest black holes that we think exists. It is an absolute monster, the heavyweight champion of black holes in the Universe."" This video can not be played M87: The significance of the first ever image of a black hole The image shows an intensely bright ""ring of fire"", as Prof Falcke describes it, surrounding a perfectly circular dark hole. The bright halo is caused by superheated gas falling into the hole. The light is brighter than all the billions of other stars in the galaxy combined - which is why it can be seen at such distance from Earth. The edge of the dark circle at the centre is the point at which the gas enters the black hole, which is an object that has such a large gravitational pull, not even light can escape. The woman behind the black hole photo Taking the temperature of black holes Hawking: Black holes store information Get BBC news in your inbox, each weekday morning Astronomers have suspected that the M87 galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its heart from false colour images such as this one. The dark centre is not a black hole but indicates that stars are densely packed and fast moving The image matches what theoretical physicists and indeed, Hollywood directors, imagined black holes would look like, according to Dr Ziri Younsi, of University College London - who is part of the EHT collaboration. ""Although they are relatively simple objects, black holes raise some of the most complex questions about the nature of space and time, and ultimately of our existence,"" he said. ""It is remarkable that the image we observe is so similar to that which we obtain from our theoretical calculations. So far, it looks like Einstein is correct once again."" But having the first image will enable researchers to learn more about these mysterious objects. They will be keen to look out for ways in which the black hole departs from what's expected in physics. No-one really knows how the bright ring around the hole is created. Even more intriguing is the question of what happens when an object falls into a black hole. A black hole is a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape Despite the name, they are not empty but instead consist of a huge amount of matter packed densely into a small area, giving it an immense gravitational pull There is a region of space beyond the black hole called the event horizon. This is a ""point of no return"", beyond which it is impossible to escape the gravitational effects of the black hole Prof Falcke had the idea for the project when he was a PhD student in 1993. At the time, no-one thought it was possible. But he was the first to realise that a certain type of radio emission would be generated close to and all around the black hole, which would be powerful enough to be detected by telescopes on Earth. He also recalled reading a scientific paper from 1973 that suggested that because of their enormous gravity, black holes appear 2.5 times larger than they actually are. These two factors suddenly made the seemingly impossible, possible. After arguing his case for 20 years, Prof Falcke persuaded theEuropean Research Council,externalto fund the project. The National Science Foundation and agencies in East Asia then joined in to bankroll the project to the tune of more than Â£40m. The eventual EHT array will have 12 widely spaced participating radio facilities It is an investment that has been vindicated with the publication of the image. Prof Falcke told me that he felt that ""it's mission accomplished"". He said: ""It has been a long journey, but this is what I wanted to see with my own eyes. I wanted to know is this real?"" No single telescope is powerful enough to image the black hole. So, in the biggest experiment of its kind, Prof Sheperd Doeleman of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics led a project to set up a network of eight linked telescopes. Together, they form the Event Horizon Telescope and can be thought of as a planet-sized array of dishes.

Each is located high up at a variety of exotic sites, including on volcanoes in Hawaii and Mexico, mountains in Arizona and the Spanish Sierra Nevada, in the Atacama Desert of Chile, and in Antarctica. A team of 200 scientists pointed the networked telescopes towards M87 and scanned its heart over a period of 10 days. The information they gathered was too much to be sent across the internet. Instead, the data was stored on hundreds of hard drives that were flown to central processing centres in Boston, US, and Bonn, Germany, to assemble the information. Katie Bouman a PhD student at MIT  developed an algorithm that pieced together the data from the EHT. Without her contribution the project would not have been possible. Prof Doeleman described the achievement as ""an extraordinary scientific feat"". ""We have achieved something presumed to be impossible just a generation ago,"" he said. ""Breakthroughs in technology, connections between the world's best radio observatories, and innovative algorithms all came together to open an entirely new window on black holes."" The team is also imaging the supermassive black hole at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Odd though it may sound, that is harder than getting an image from a distant galaxy 55 million light-years away. This is because, for some unknown reason, the ""ring of fire"" around the black hole at the heart of the Milky Way is smaller and dimmer.

India to vote in world's largest electionTens of millions of people in 20 states will cast their ballots in the first day of voting.,"This video can not be played India's elections: Why you should care Tens of millions of Indians have voted on the first day of a general election that is being seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Indians in 20 states and union territories cast their ballots in 91 constituencies. The seven-phase vote to elect a new lower house of parliament will continue until 19 May. Counting day is 23 May. With 900 million eligible voters across the country, this is the largest election ever seen. Some observers have billed the vote as the most important in decades and the tone of the campaign has been acrimonious. Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a historic landslide in the last elections in 2014.  He stakes his claim to lead India on a tough image and remains the governing BJP's main vote-getter. But critics say his promises of economic growth and job creation haven't met expectations, and India has become more religiously polarised under his leadership. As it happened: First day of voting The BJP faces challenges from strong regional parties and a resurgent Congress party, led by Rahul Gandhi.  Mr Gandhi's father, grandmother and great-grandfather were all Indian prime ministers. His sister, Priyanka Gandhi, formally launched her political career in January. Mr Modi has made national security a key election issue The Lok Sabha, or lower house of parliament, has 543 elected seats and any party or coalition needs a minimum of 272 MPs to form a government. Hundreds of voters began to queue up outside polling centres early Thursday morning for the first of seven days of voting over six weeks. Their concerns ranged from jobs and unemployment to India's role in the world and national security. Many, like Dashami Majumdar, a 23 year old with two children, were focused on local issues - namely ""better roads"". ""Nobody tells me who to vote for, my vote is mine, my vote is my independence,"" she told the BBC in Cooch Behar, in West Bengal. Another voter there, Shzina Bibi, a 28-year-old housewife with two children, said she was looking at what the political parties, not individual candidates, would do for Indian society. ""We need more communal peace in India. We need to live together with more tolerance,"" she said. But in some places, voters were furious to find they were not on the rolls. In the southern state of Telangana, Shobhana Kamineni was distraught to find that she was not able to cast a ballot. ""This is a crime against me as a citizen and I will not tolerate it,"" she told BBC Telugu. A little boy clutches his father outside a polling booth in Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh state In Baghpat, a constituency in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, scores of Muslim and Dalit (formerly ""untouchable"") voters also complained that their names were missing. Violence also flared in several places. Two people died in separate clashes at polling stations in southern Andhra Pradesh state. In central Chhattisgarh state, suspected Maoist rebels detonated an IED device near a polling booth at about 04:00 local time (22:30 GMT) -  no injuries were reported. Modi The man who wants 900m votes A really simple guide to Indiaâs general election 900m voters, 39 days: 11 things about India polls Modi's struggle to connect with the south It is mind-bogglingly vast - about 900 million people above the age of 18 will be eligible to cast their ballots at one million polling stations. At the last election, voter turnout was about 66%. No voter is meant to have to travel more than 2km to reach a polling station. Because of the enormous number of election officials and security personnel involved, voting is taking place in seven stages between 11 April and 19 May. More than 140 million people were eligible to vote in the first phase of the election on Thursday. Indian lambadi tribeswomen at a polling station in southern India The states and union territories that went to the polls were: Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar islands and Lakshadweep. Polling in some states, such as Andhra Pradesh and Nagaland, concluded in one day. But other states, such as Uttar Pradesh, will hold polls in several phases. India's historic first election in 1951-52 took three months to complete. Between 1962 and 1989, elections were completed in four to 10 days. The four-day elections in 1980 were the country's shortest ever. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, and his sister Priyanka Gandhi, come from a political dynasty Hundreds of millions of Indians have escaped poverty since the turn of the millennium but huge challenges remain. Under Mr Modi, the world's sixth-largest economy appears to have lost some of its momentum. Although annual GDP growth has hovered at about 7%, unemployment is a major concern. Mr Modi's government has been accused of hiding uncomfortable jobs data. In fact, a leaked government report suggests thatthe unemployment rate is the highest it has been since the 1970s. Farm incomes have also stagnated because of a crop glut and declining commodity prices, which have left farmers saddled with debt. Unsurprisingly both parties have targeted the rural poor in their campaign manifestos. The BJP has promised a slew of welfare schemes for India's farmers, while Congress has promised a minimum income scheme for the country's 50 million poorest families.

WhatsApp: The 'black hole' of fake news in India's election National security is also in the spotlight this election after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir in February. India then carried out unprecedented air strikes in Pakistan. Since then, the BJP has made national security a key plank in its campaign.
