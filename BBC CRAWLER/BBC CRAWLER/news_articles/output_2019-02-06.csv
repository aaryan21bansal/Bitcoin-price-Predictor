Breaking|Breaking newsSearch team recover body from Sala planeThe body found in wreckage of plane carrying footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson has been recoveredWales,"This video can not be played It is not yet known whose body was recovered from the plane wreckage A body has been recovered from the wreckage of the plane which crashed with Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson on board. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said specialist contractors joined the operation in ""challenging conditions"". It was carried out in ""as dignified a way as possible"" and the men's families were kept updated throughout, it said. The wreckage of the plane, which vanished two weeks ago over the English Channel, was found off Guernsey. The Geo Ocean III, the boat carrying the body, arrived at Portland Port in Dorset on Thursday morning as it is the nearest part of the British mainland to where the plane was located. Dorset Police said: ""The arrival of the body into Dorset has been reported to the coroner for Dorset. ""The coroner will investigate the circumstances of this death supported by Dorset Police. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course."" No formal identification has taken place, but the force said both families had been updated. Who is David Mearns? Nantes demand Sala fee from Cardiff Cardiff City 'must move mountains' - manager Warnock Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson The Piper Malibu N264DB was en route from France to Cardiff, after the 28-year-old Argentine striker made a quick trip back to his former club Nantes two days after his Â£15m transfer to Cardiff was announced. Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, was at the controls when the flight lost contact with air traffic controllers on 21 January. An official search was called off on 24 January after Guernsey's harbour master said the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"". But an online appeal started by Sala's agent raised Â£324,000 (371,000 euros) for a private search led by marine scientist and oceanographer David Mearns. Working jointly with the AAIB, his ship and the Geo Ocean III, began combing a four square mile area of the English Channel, 24 nautical miles north of Guernsey, to make best use of the available sensors. Mr Mearns said the plane was identified by sonar, before a submersible with cameras was sent underwater to confirm this. A minute's silence was held for Sala and Mr Ibbotson ahead of Cardiff's home game against Bournemouth Cardiff fans left a sea of flowers outside the Cardiff City Stadium in tribute to Emiliano Sala The AAIB used a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) to aid the search, with no divers involved. The body was moved first, and separately from the wreckage, to maximise the chances of it being successfully brought to the surface. It said efforts to recover the crashed plane as a whole proved unsuccessful, before being abandoned due to poor weather. ""The weather forecast is poor for the foreseeable future and so the difficult decision was taken to bring the overall operation to a close,"" the AAIB said in a statement. However, the AAIB said video footage captured by the ROV would provide ""valuable evidence"" for its safety investigation. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Sala's former club, French Ligue 1 side Nantes, has demanded Cardiff City pay his Â£15m transfer fee. Sala, 28, was Cardiff's record signing but never played for the club. The fee was due to be paid over three years but Cardiff have withheld the first scheduled payment until they are satisfied with the documentation.

World headed for warmest period on recordScientists say we're in the middle of what's likely to be the warmest 10 years since records began in 1850.Science & EnvironmentComments,"A Nasa graphic showing the global temperature anomalies between 2014 and 2018 - higher than the long term trend is shown in red The world is in the middle of what is likely to be the warmest 10 years since records began in 1850, say scientists. The Met Office is forecasting that temperatures for each of the next five years are likely to be 1C or more above pre-industrial levels. In the next five years there's also a chance we'll see a year in which the average global temperature rise could be greater than 1.5C. That's seen as a critical threshold for climate change. If the data matches the forecast, then the decade from 2014-2023 will be the warmest in more than 150 years of record keeping. Climate change: UK CO2 emissions fall again Warming threatens Himalayan glaciers Blue planet to get even bluer The Met Office says that 2015 was the first year in which the global annual average surface temperature reached 1C above the pre-industrial level, which is generally taken to mean the temperatures between 1850 and 1900. Each year since then, the global average has hovered close to or above the 1C mark. Now, the Met Office says that trend is likely to continue or increase over the next five years. ""We've just made this year's forecasts and they go out to 2023 and what they suggest is rapid warming globally,"" Prof Adam Scaife, head of long term forecasting at the Met Office, told BBC News. ""By looking at individual years in that forecast we can now see for the first time, there is a risk of a temporary, and I repeat temporary, exceedance of the all-important 1.5C threshold level set out in the Paris climate agreement."" Last October,UN scientists published a special reporton the long-term impacts of a temperature rise of 1.5C. They concluded that it would take a massive carbon cutting effort to keep the world from tipping over the limit by 2030. The Met Office analysis now says there's a 10% chance of this happening within the next five years. ""It's the first time the forecasts have shown a significant risk of exceedance - it is only temporary. We are talking about individual years fluctuating above the 1.5 degree level,"" said Prof Scaife. ""But the fact that that can happen now due to a combination of general warming and the fluctuations due to things like El NiÃ±o events in the next few years does mean we are getting close to that threshold."" Temperature data for the five major global climate databases The Met Office says it has a 90% confidence limit in the forecasts for the years ahead. It says that from 2019 to 2023, we will see temperatures ranging from 1.03C to 1.57C above the 1850-1900 level, with enhanced warming over much of the globe, especially over areas like the Arctic. The research team says it is pretty certain in its predictions because of its past experience. The team's previous forecast, made in 2013, predicted the rapid rate of warming that's been observed over the past five years. It even predicted some of the lesser known details such as the patch of cooling seen in the North Atlantic and the cooler spots in the Southern Ocean. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map If the observations over the next five years match the forecasts, then the decade between 2014 and 2023 will be the warmest in more than 150 years of records. The Met Office forecast comes as a number of agencies publish their full analysis of temperature data from 2018, showing it to be the fourth warmest since records began in 1850. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has published an analysis of five major international datasets showing that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22. ""Temperatures are only part of the story. Extreme and high impact weather affected many countries and millions of people, with devastating repercussions for economies and ecosystems in 2018,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""Many of the extreme weather events are consistent with what we expect from a changing climate. This is a reality we need to face up to. Greenhouse gas emission reduction and climate adaptation measures should be a top global priority,"" he said. Other researchers in the field said the new forecast for the next five years was in line with expectations, given the record level of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere in 2018. ""The forecast from the Met Office is, unfortunately, no surprise,"" said Dr Anna Jones, an atmospheric chemist at the British Antarctic Survey. ""Temperatures averaged across the globe are at a record all-time high, and have been for a number of years. They are driven predominantly by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, that result from our continued use of fossil fuels. ""Until we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we can expect to see upward trends in global averaged temperatures.""

Baby born with heart outside body is home,"This video can not be played Vanellope Hope Wilkins was born with no breastbone in November 2017 A baby who was born with her heart outside her body has been fully discharged from hospital 14 months after she was born. Vanellope Hope Wilkins, who was born with no breastbone, was delivered at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester on 22 November 2017 by Caesarean section. She had three operations to place her heart back in her chest. Vanellope has now left Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre, which she was moved to in May to be nearer home. She has had a few trips home overnight but now will now be there permanently. Vanellope Hope Wilkins is now home with her parents and three brothers Her mother Naomi Findlay, from Bulwell, Nottingham, said it was ""absolutely amazing"" and ""a massive relief"" to have Vanellope home. ""It's exciting but it's daunting at the same time,"" she added. ""It has been an incredibly long, emotional journey."" Vanellope requires 24-hour care and is reliant on a ventilator. Vanellope's heart is now covered with her own skin after three operations Her parents - who said they will get married next year - are taking over much of her care, although they will have help overnight. Ms Findlay said it was ""not quite over yet"" but it was a chance for them to be a normal family. Outside heart op baby moves hospitals Baby has heart put back inside chest Vanellope's father Dean Wilkins said: ""There is still a lot she has to undergo yet but she is home and that's the first step."" Frances Bu'Lock, part of the team caring for Vanellope, said the baby would ""need something in the longer term"" to give structure to her chest and make her condition more stable. ""Like with all of her care we don't exactly know what's going to happen, because nobody's ever done it before, so we're going to have to keep an eye on things,"" she added. Staff at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre have been caring for Vanellope since May The condition, ectopia cordis, is extremely rare with only a few cases per million births, of which most are stillborn. When Vanellope's rare condition was first diagnosed in pregnancy her parents were told she had less than a one in 10 chance of surviving. However, the experts at the children's heart surgery unit at Glenfield Hospital defeated those odds. Glenfield Hospital said it knew of no other case in the UK where the baby had survived. Minutes after her birth, Vanellope's chest was covered with a sterile bag to keep her heart moist and reduce the risk of infection Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

"Mystery of '20,000 seabird deaths'","The dead guillemots have been washing up along 300km of Dutch coastline Scientists are trying to find out why some 20,000 guillemots have died in recent weeks along the Dutch coast. The birds were all emaciated and there are fears they may have been victims of a spill from the MSC Zoe container ship, from which some 345 containers fell in the sea during a storm. ""There's no smoking gun, but we're looking into it,"" says Mardik Leopold, who is investigating the deaths. Chemicals may be to blame as most plastics are hard to ingest, he says. Hours after the containers fell off the MSC Zoe in a storm, they started washing up on islands off the Dutch north coast on 2 January, spilling their contents of children's toys, furniture and televisions on to the beaches. A bag of peroxide powder was also found. This video can not be played Footage filmed by the Dutch coastguard shows precariously balanced containers on board the MSC Zoe. Mardik Leopold, a seabird expert from Wageningen University, said the figure of 20,000 dead guillemots was based on educated guesswork. ""That's based on the average trending rate of one guillemot per kilometre of beach per day in the Netherlands with 300km [186 miles] available. That's 10,000 birds,"" he told the BBC. A similar number would have been left in the sea, he added. Some of the survivors are being nursed back to health at the FÃ»gelhelling centre Islands hit as hundreds of containers fall off ship Although he is keeping an open mind, he points out that the birds began washing up at the time of the container spill. Bad weather can also affect a guillemot's access to food, but Mr Leopold believes the problem would then not have been confined to the Dutch coast. While the guillemots may have swallowed plastic pellets, a spill of paraffin or palm oil was perhaps more likely. The island of Terschelling, where much of the MSC Zoe debris washed up, has also seen paraffin appear on its beaches. On Wednesday, Dutch authorities said that at least 345 containers had fallen off the ship, 54 more than first thought. Dr Leopold found this guillemot on a beach on the island of Texel this week Post-mortem examinations will be carried out on 100 of the birds to assess what caused their deaths. Dozens of guillemots have been rescued and are being cared for in a number of centres, where many are being fed by tube as they are so weak. At Uretep in the north of the Netherlands, 11 guillemots are being nursed back to health. ""We have washed seven of them but the other four need to gain weight before we can give them a wash,"" says Hetty Sinnema from the FÃ»gelhelling centre. The hope eventually is to return the guillemots to the sea when they are strong enough She says the problem lies in their intestines but believes it is too early to blame the sea container spill for the disaster. ""We tube-feed them with a lot of minerals, energy powder and fish. They now weigh around 600g but they need to be at least 900g before they are strong enough to be washed."" The surviving birds have a long journey to recovery but ultimately the centre hopes they can be returned to the sea.

Five hurt in suspected gas explosion,"This video can not be played Several people suffered burn injuries in the blast At least five people have been hurt in a suspected gas explosion at a flat. A number of people suffered burn injuries in the blast on Hick Lane, Batley, West Yorkshire Police said. The bomb squad was called in after one witness reported hearing a massive bang and said he saw people covered in blood fleeing from the building. The force said said no-one appeared to have suffered life-threatening injuries. Some local residents were evacuated from their homes. More news and stories from across Yorkshire West Yorkshire Fire Service said five people were hurt in the explosion in a two-storey building, which is a block of converted flats. A Royal Logistic Corps bomb disposal van remained at the scene on Thursday morning along with police and fire service vehicles. The bomb disposal team was still at the blast site on Hick Lane after being called out on Wednesday night On Wednesday night, a spokesperson said: ""Firefighters are likely to be on the scene overnight and there are some concerns over the structural stability of the building.""

Blackface scandal hits second US politician,"Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring has acknowledged wearing ""brown makeup"" to a party, days after the state governor admitting wearing blackface. The second-in-line to the governor's seat said in a statement on Wednesday that he wore a costume to a party when he was 19 years old at university. Mr Herring had joined calls for Governor Ralph Northam to quit over a racist photo and blackface scandal. The lieutenant governor is meanwhile battling a sex assault claim. All three men are Democrats. If they were to resign over these controversies, Virginia could be led by the Republican Speaker of the House of Delegates, Kirk Cox. Behind the legacy of America's blackface 'There's going to be racism until the day we die' On Wednesday the attorney general confessed that he also once used blackface. Mr Herring said that in 1980, he and his friends donned costumes after ""some friends suggested we attend a party dressed like rappers we listened to at the time, like Kurtis Blow, and perform a song"". ""It sounds ridiculous even now writing it. But because of our ignorance and glib attitudes - and because we did not have an appreciation for the experiences and perspectives of others - we dressed up and put on wigs and brown makeup,"" he said. Ralph Northam's page in the 1984 yearbook of Eastern Virginia Medical School ""That conduct clearly shows that, as a young man, I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behaviour could inflict on others."" Mr Herring did not offer to step down and wrote of his ""efforts to empower communities of colour"" and ""to combat the rise in hate crimes and white supremacist violence that is plaguing our Commonwealth and our country"".

On Saturday, Mr Herring joined a chorus of fellow Democrats calling on Mr Northam to resign after an image surfaced from his 1984 medical yearbook page showing a person in blackface, and another in Ku Klux Klan robes. Mr Northam has denied it was him in the racist photo, but has acknowledged wearing blackface on a separate occasion that year while dressing up as Michael Jackson. Mr Herring said it was ""no longer possible"" for Mr Northam to serve as governor. A Washington Post editorial on Wednesday called on Mr Northam to resign. Virginia Democrats are running out of top officials not beset by scandal. With Attorney General Mark Herring's revelation that he, too, once wore blackface, the situation has metastasised from a controversy ensnaring one man - Governor Northam - to an indication of a larger problem. Cruel, intolerant actions that were once considered acceptable, at least among a certain crowd, are now, decades later, having political consequences. In her response to the president's State of the Union address on Tuesday night, Stacey Abrams - the black woman who narrowly lost her bid to be Georgia's governor - obliquely addressed the issue. ""We continue to confront racism from our past and in our present, which is why we must hold everyone from the highest offices to our own families accountable for racist words and deeds and call racism what it is, wrong,"" she said. Virginians - and Democrats across the US - are now grappling with racist deeds within their own family. It has thrown the state's leadership into turmoil. Accountability, however, could be harder to realise. The cold political reality is that the more top politicians are touched, the less likely it is any of them will go. US governor in racism row refuses to quit Virginia governor's deputy denies assault As the blackface scandal engulfed the governor's mansion, many Democrats said his deputy, Lt Governor Justin Fairfax, should take over. But since Sunday Mr Fairfax has been denying a woman's claim that he sexually assaulted her 15 years ago. On Wednesday, Vanessa Tyson came forward to recount the alleged assault in disturbing detail through a statement issued by her lawyers. Now a California college professor, she says Mr Fairfax forced her to perform a sex act on him during the 2004 Democratic political convention in Boston. Prof Tyson said he had invited her back to his hotel room during the political jamboree to retrieve some documents. This video can not be played Governor Northam: I am not the person in that photo While in the suite, she says, they kissed. But, her statement adds, ""what began as consensual kissing quickly turned into an assault"". ""I cannot believe, given my obvious distress, that Mr Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual,"" she said of their encounter. ""After the assault, I suffered from both deep humiliation and shame."" On Wednesday, Mr Fairfax said reading her statement had been ""painful"", but insisted he was innocent. His office meanwhile denied an NBC report that he used an expletive-laden outburst in reference to Prof Tyson, during a private meeting on Monday night.

Rolf Harris school incident investigated,"Harris was seen waving to children as they were waiting in the school hall for their lunch The Ministry of Justice has launched an investigation after convicted paedophile Rolf Harris entered the grounds of a Berkshire primary school. The school's head teacher confronted the former TV star, who was in conversation with a local sculptor, and asked him to leave the site. The MoJ said it was ""looking into these reports and will take appropriate action"". Harris was jailed for five years in 2014 but released on licence in 2017. A spokeswoman for the MoJ added: ""When sex offenders are released they are subject to strict licence conditions and are liable to be returned to custody for breaching them."" Head teacher Richard Jarrett said: ""In line with our standard procedures, an uninvited individual was asked to leave the outer perimeter of the school site yesterday, which he did without delay. ""At no time did any of our pupils come into contact with the individual nor was the individual invited by us onto the school grounds."" Harris was seen waving to children as they were waiting in the school hall for their lunch on Tuesday. He was talking to sculptor Nick Garnett, who was working in the school's ""Kiss and Drop"" area. Harris was seen waving to children as they were waiting for their lunch Mr Garnett told the BBC: ""I turned round and there was Rolf Harris, which was a strange moment. ""He asked for a piece of timber. Apparently he's interested in making some carvings, so I gave him a couple of pieces."" He said: ""At no point was he near any children. The headmaster dealt with it incredibly calmly."" Speaking to the Press Association, the parent of a pupil at the school said: ""What was he doing there? ""I feel like it was a really bad judgement call and I don't think his excuse is effective enough."" Thames Valley Police said: ""A report was made that a man was on the site of the school. ""An officer attended the scene but no offence was committed. No arrests were made and advice has been given to the man involved."" Australian-born TV presenter Harris was jailed in 2014 for 12 indecent assaults, relating to four girls between 1968 and 1986. In May 2017 he was cleared of four unconnected historical sex offences, which he had denied. In November 2017 one of the 12 indecent assault convictions was overturned by the Court of Appeal.

Trump sees total rout of IS as imminent,"Donald Trump: ""Their land is gone"" US President Donald Trump has said territory held by the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could be ""100%"" liberated as early as next week. ""It should be announced, probably some time next week, that we will have 100% of the caliphate,"" he told a gathering of coalition partners. However, he also cautioned that he wanted to ""wait for the official word"". US military and intelligence officials say IS could stage a comeback without sustained counter-terrorism pressure. Families flee last IS village in Syria Trump rewrites US Syria policy After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Mr Trump shocked coalition allies in December when he declared that the group had been defeated, amid reports he wanted to pull out US soldiers within 30 days. But he later slowed the withdrawal after several resignations from key defence officials and strong criticism from Republicans and allies abroad. The global coalition against IS, now numbering nearly 80 nations, was formed in 2014 after the group overran swathes of territory and went on to launch terror attacks outside the region. ""Their land is gone,"" he told Wednesday's conference in Washington. ""The Isis [IS] caliphate has been decimated."" But the group still had ""tiny sections that can be so dangerous"", he said, and ""foreign fighters must not gain access"" to the US. US ground troops first became involved in Syria in 2015 He also referred to the IS propaganda machine, which recruited fighters from Europe and other regions. ""For a period of time they used the internet better than we did,"" he said. ""They used the internet brilliantly but now it's not so brilliant."" The US leader thanked coalition partners, saying, ""We will be working together for many years to come."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pledged the US would continue to fight IS, despite withdrawing troops from Syria. He called the troop pullout a ""tactical change... not a change in the mission"", and said the world was entering an ""era of decentralised jihad"". It has certainly lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks. A suspected IS member captured by US-backed forces near the Syrian border with Iraq last week On Tuesday the head of the US military's Central Command, Gen Joseph Votel, told a Senate committee up to 1,500 IS militants remained in a 20 sq mile (52 sq km) pocket on Syria's border with Iraq. 'IS attack' kills US troops in Syria The enduring appeal of violent jihad The group, he said, still had ""leaders, fighters, facilitators, resources and the profane ideology that fuels their efforts"". Meanwhile, a report by a US defence department watchdog cited Central Command as saying that without sustained pressure IS ""could likely resurge in Syria within six to 12 months"". Another challenge is what to do with the hundreds of foreign fighters captured by the SDF, as well as their families. Governments in their home countries are reluctant to take back radicalised militants who swore allegiance to Islamic State. By Barbara PlettUsher, BBCstate department correspondent President Trump's comments were more than a month late, as he did not consult his allies about his decision in December to withdraw US troops from Syria. The shock from the surprise announcement has settled, but coalition members want to know how this is going to play out. It's not clear that the administration has sorted that out. Both Mr Trump and Mike Pompeo called on other nations to take on more commitments for the continued campaign against the IS group, but said they were still in the fight - America would continue to lead it, Mr Pompeo said. Mr Trump had previously suggested that some of the troops in Syria could be moved to American bases in neighbouring Iraq, from where they could launch commando operations across the border as necessary. But there are still no official details about how the US will continue the counter-terrorism pressure Mr Trump's generals and intelligence officials have said is necessary to stop IS militants from staging a comeback.

Tusk: Special place in hell for no-plan Brexiteers,"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: ""Special place in hell"" for those without Brexit plan European Council President Donald Tusk has spoken of a ""special place in hell"" for ""those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan of how to carry it out safely"". He was speaking after talks with Irish leader Leo Varadkar in Brussels. Brexit-backing MPs reacted with anger to the comments, accusing Mr Tusk of ""arrogance"". Downing Street said it was a question for Mr Tusk ""whether he considers the use of that kind of language helpful"". Kuenssberg: Donald Tusk's planned outburst Brexit risk for UK aid as Swiss cut off Will May make 'good enough' progress? Brexit: All you need to know The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We had a robust and lively referendum campaign in this country. In what was the largest democratic exercise in our history, people voted to leave the EU."" He added that everyone should now focus on delivering that.

And at the end of their news conference, Mr Varadkar was picked up by the microphones telling Mr Tusk: ""They'll give you terrible trouble in the British press for that."" Mr Tusk nodded at the comment and both laughed. Brussels officials were quick to clarify Mr Tusk's remarks, stressing to BBC correspondent Adam Fleming that the Brexiteers' special place in hell would be for when they are dead and ""not right now"". Jean-Claude Juncker tried to laugh off the comments at a later press conference with Mr Varadkar, saying the only hell he knew was doing his job as the president of the European Commission. And Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, referencing Mr Tusk's comments, latertweeted,external: ""Well, I doubt Lucifer would welcome them, as after what they did to Britain, they would even manage to divide hell.""

Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who is now an independent MEP, tweeted: ""After Brexit we will be free of unelected, arrogant bullies like you and run our own country. Sounds more like heaven to me."" Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, who also campaigned for Britain's exit from the EU, said Mr Tusk should apologise for his ""disgraceful"" and ""spiteful"" comments. ""I'm sure that when he reflects on it he may well wish he hadn't done it,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, when asked on ITV Peston's programme how he felt ""when President Tusk practically reserved your place in hell?"", said: ""Perhaps he'll join us there. ""When people throw insults around it says more about them than the people they're insulting."" PM in Belfast for Brexit deadlock talks Brexit: A really simple guide The Democratic Unionist Party's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said: ""This devilish Euro maniac is doing his best to keep the United Kingdom bound by the chains of EU bureaucracy and control. ""It is Tusk and his arrogant EU negotiators who have fanned the flames of fear in an attempt to try and overturn the result of the referendum."" This video can not be played Leadsom on Tusk: ""The man has no manners"" But Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald backed Mr Tusk, arguing that it was the position of ""hardline"" Brexit-supporting MPs like Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg that was ""intemperate"" and ""untenable"". And Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, who supports having another EU referendum, said Mr Tusk was ""absolutely right"" and it was ""painful"" for leading figures in the Leave campaign, such as Boris Johnson and David Davis, ""to have the truth pointed out to them"". Theresa May - who supported the UK staying in the EU during the 2016 EU referendum but has always insisted that Brexit must be delivered because that was what people voted for - is due to arrive in Brussels on Thursday to seek legal changes to the withdrawal deal she signed with the EU. She hopes these changes will help her get it through the UK Parliament. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson saidthe government was likely to publish a new employment billbefore the next vote on Mrs May's deal, with the aim to maximise support for it from Labour MPs. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has set out five demands for his party to support a Brexit deal - calling for them to be enshrined as objectives in domestic law. In a letter to the prime minister, he said Labour wanted a UK-wide customs union, close alignment with the single market, ""dynamic alignment"" on rights and protections, ""clear commitments"" on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes and ""unambiguous agreements"" on the detail of future security arrangements. He said Labour did not believe that ""simply seeking modifications"" to the backstop was a sufficient response. Mr Corbyn added that EU leaders had been clear that changes to the political declaration were possible if a request was made by the UK government ""and if the current red lines change"". By BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming The EU has been absolutely scathing about some of the British political class today. The dam broke on Donald Tusk's pent-up feelings about the leaders of the Leave campaign. The Irish prime minister suggested that MPs either didn't know what they were doing or were misled when they voted to look for alternatives to the Irish backstop. But - and it's a big but - they have all been open to the prime minister coming to Brussels with a solution to break the deadlock. And while Jean-Claude Juncker ruled out the idea of the UK having the right to pull out of the backstop if it were ever needed, he didn't say anything about the other idea doing the rounds - a time limit. Donald Tusk said that the other 27 EU members had decided in December that the withdrawal agreement was ""not open for renegotiation"" - a message echoed by Mr Juncker. Mr Tusk also had a message for Remain supporters in the UK, with 50 days to go until Brexit happens, with a deal or without one, saying: ""I have always been with you, with all my heart"". But he added: ""The facts are unmistakable. At the moment, the pro-Brexit stance of the UK prime minister, and the Leader of the Opposition, rules out this question. ""Today, there is no political force and no effective leadership for Remain. I say this without satisfaction, but you can't argue with the facts."" Please upgrade your browser Mr Tusk said the Irish border issue and the need to preserve the peace process remained the EU's ""top priority"". He hoped Mrs May would ""give us a deliverable guarantee for peace in Northern Ireland and the UK will leave the EU as a trusted friend"" that can command a Commons majority. Mr Varadkar said that while he was ""open to further discussions"" with the UK government about post-Brexit relations, the legally-binding withdrawal agreement remained ""the best deal possible"". And the backstop was needed ""as a legal guarantee to ensure that there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland"". He later said he will meet Theresa May for talks in Dublin on Friday. Jean-Claude Juncker said alternative arrangements - the form of words backed by MPs in a vote last week - ""can never replace the backstop"". Clarification 27 February 2019: While the summary of this story and opening paragraph made clear that Mr Tusk was referring to a specific group of people - those who promoted Brexit without a plan - the original headlines were misleading and so were amended shortly after publication on 6 February.

Kuenssberg: Tusk's planned outburst,"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: ""Special place in hell"" for those without Brexit plan They weren't off-the-cuff remarks, but a planned outburst. The softly-spoken politician who holds the authority of all EU countries has just completely condemned a chunk of the British cabinet, wondering aloud: ""What that special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit, without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely"". Sure, for a long time the EU has been frustrated with how the UK has approached all of this. And sure, plenty of voters in the UK are annoyed too at how politicians have been handling these negotiations. But it is quite something for Donald Tusk to have gone in like this, studs up, even though he sometimes reminisces about his time as a football hooligan in his youth. Be clear, he was not intending to talk about voters who wanted to Leave, but politicians who were involved in the campaign. Tusk: Place in hell for no-plan Brexiteers PM in Belfast for Brexit deadlock talks New ideas for the Brexit border backstop Brexit: All you need to know He also had pretty stern remarks for those who'd been on the other side of the argument, accusing those who still want the UK to stay in the EU of having ""no political force, and no effective leadership"". Mr Tusk will be all too aware that he will provoke tempers at home, even laughing about it as he left the stage with the Taoiseach, the Irish leader, Leo Varadkar. But if you strip away the planned flash of temper, also in his remarks was an invitation to the prime minister to come forward with a different version of the backstop - a ""believable guarantee"", a promise that a ""common solution is possible"". That is, on the face of it, in tone at least, more of an opening to the UK to put something new on the table than we have seen from the EU side. Certainly, Theresa May's most pressing job is to put something that could work on the table in Belfast, and in Brussels, and to do it fast. But don't forget, also at her back, she has Brexiteers whom she needs to manage, whose expectations she needs to contain, whose votes she desperately needs. And at a time when cool tempers and compromise are absolutely needed, Mr Tusk's remarks are likely to whip up the mood instead.

Enduring appeal of violent jihad,"The Islamic State group (IS) has lost its short-lived caliphate in the Middle East, with hundreds - possibly thousands - of would-be international jihadists stuck in limbo, and tempted to return home despite fears of arrest and imprisonment. Yet the scourge of violent jihad - where extremists attack those they perceive to be enemies of Islam - has not gone away. The hotel attack in Nairobi two weeks ago by the al-Qaeda-affiliated militant group al-Shabab was an uncomfortable reminder. Large swathes of north-west Africa are now vulnerable to attack by marauding jihadists. Somalia, Yemen and Afghanistan remain ideal refuges for jihadists. So just what is the enduring appeal of violent jihad for certain people around the world? After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? The victims of the Kenya hotel attack The decision to leave behind a normal, law-abiding life, often abandoning family and loved ones to embark on what is frequently a short, dangerous career is a personal one. Jihadist recruiters will play on the notion of victimhood, sacrifice and rallying to a higher cause in the name of religion. For nearly 20 years now the internet has been awash with gruesome propaganda videos, some portraying the collective suffering of Muslims in various parts of the world, others depicting revenge attacks and punishments inflicted on perceived enemies. These serve two purposes. The first is intended to arouse sympathy and even shame, that the viewer should be watching comfortably at home on his or her laptop while ""your brothers and sisters are being murdered"" - in say, Syria, Chechnya or the Palestinian Territories. This video can not be played Last September the BBC spoke to two British extremists who have lived and fought in Syria for years Secondly, the revenge videos appeal particularly to those of a sadistic nature, often attracting those with a violent criminal record. Peer pressure can be the trigger that tips an individual over from being simply angry about events in the world to taking violent action. In Jordan I interviewed a convict in prison who had been persuaded by his best friend from school to come and join him in Syria with IS. He did, then regretted it, escaped back to Jordan and was then sentenced to five years in prison. Those who are especially vulnerable to recruitment are young men and women who have grown apart from their families or their societies. For them, belonging to a secret, illegal organisation that appears to value them can be an attractive alternative. Even if it ends with them being told to strap on a suicide vest and blow themselves up in a market place. 'How I joined the jihadis by mistake' A teenager's journey to terror There is a reason why the Middle East has long been a primary source of global jihadism. Corrupt, undemocratic and often oppressive regimes tend to drive peaceful political dissent underground. In the early 21st Century Syria has been the most glaring example of this. After nearly eight years of civil war, with Syria's President Bashar al-Assad largely victorious against the rebels, the vast numbers of citizens who have disappeared into his jails provide a source of recruitment for extremist groups. In Iraq, a country turned upside-down by the ill-fated US-led invasion of 2003, sectarian discrimination has played a major part in the rise of al-Qaida and then IS. How the Sahara has become terror's new frontline The women keeping peace in the deadliest place Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever For eight years the oppression of the Sunni minority by the Shia-led government was so profound that IS (a Sunni militancy) was able to present itself as ""the protector of Iraq's Sunnis"" and easily take over much of the country. It is widely predicted that IS will look to exploit any future grievances. Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia and the Sahel (Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania) all contain large areas of ungoverned or conflict-riven space where jihadists have been able to recruit, train and plan attacks. In Afghanistan billions of dollars in international aid have failed to deliver the level of governance needed to stem the Taliban-led insurgency. Corruption is endemic and the police are seen by many as untrustworthy. Some people turn to extremism in areas where basic governance, such as food availability, fail The International Crisis Group (ICG) says state institutions there are so fragile, they are unable to ""deliver basic services to the majority of the population"". In remote, rural areas many Afghans prefer the draconian justice and rule meted out by the Taliban to that of the government. Desperate poverty, lack of employment opportunities and poor or absent governance have all combined to make the Sahel countries bordering the Sahara fertile ground for jihadist groups. Many recruits join up, not out of ideology, but simply because they see it as the only alternative to destitution. Recruiters for al-Qaida, IS, the Taliban and others have long been able to exploit religious obedience to draw young men and women into their ranks. Extremism expert Dr Erin Saltman says extremist groups often promote ""a narrative of struggle, heroic sacrifice and spiritual obligation in order to establish legitimacy and connect with potential recruits"". It is notable that after al-Shabab carried out its attack on the Nairobi hotel it gave as its justification the decision by President Trump to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the third most sacred site in Islam after Mecca and Medina. More than 20 people were killed in the Nairobi attack on 15 January Jerusalem has been an emotional touchstone for many people in the Middle East and al-Shabab may be trying to broaden its appeal beyond Somalia. The ideology behind violent jihad is likely to endure for some time yet, even though it is not shared by the vast majority of peaceful Muslims around the world. Al-Qaeda has survived the death of Osama Bin Laden and still has its regional franchises in Asia and Africa. IS still has its followers, including in the UK, although since it is now deprived of a physical space to call its caliphate it may well struggle to attract recruits in such numbers. On a global scale, containing and reducing violent jihad will require more than just good intelligence and police work. It will require far better and fairer governance, removing the drivers that spur people towards the violence that ruins so many lives. British jihadists refusing to leave Syria.

PM in Belfast for Brexit talks,"Theresa May is greeted as she arrives for talks at Stormont with Northern Ireland's main political parties Theresa May has held talks about Brexit with Northern Ireland's five main political parties at Stormont. The PM was on a two-day visit to try to reassure people she can secure a Brexit deal that avoids a hard border. Speaking on Wednesday,European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU would ""insist"" on the Irish backstop. Mr Tusk also said that there was a""special place in hell""for ""those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan of how to carry it safely"". Brexit: A really simple guide Q&A: Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know Can technology solve Irish border problem? He was speaking after talks with Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar in Brussels. In response to Mr Tusk's remarks, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said ""it is a delicate time and it is important we all consider our words carefully"". Mrs May is due to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Thursday in an effort to secure changes to her Brexit deal. This video can not be played Theresa May has ""no plan, no credibility and frankly no honour"", says Sinn FÃ©in's Mary Lou McDonald The EU has maintained it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish border backstop. On Tuesday, Mrs May told business leaders in Belfast thatshe wants changes to the controversial backstop but she suggested that she is not seeking to remove itfrom her Brexit deal. Analysis by Laura Kuenssberg, BBC News Political Editor Theresa May was in Northern Ireland meeting the different political parties - including the DUP, whose votes she needs in Parliament, who are totally opposed to the current version of the controversial backstop, as well as Sinn FÃ©in, who are just as adamant that it must remain. Tomorrow she will be in Brussels, asking again for the EU to amend the policy, seeking either a time limit or a legal upgrade to the promise that both sides will only use it if they really, really, really have to, and they don't expect it to last for ever. In short, Wednesday has been a chance for the PM to test out what she'll ask for; tomorrow is an opportunity to sell it as hard as she can in Brussels. Remember she has asked for these changes before and been turned down. And she's heard before from both sides in Northern Ireland how dug in their positions are. So can she do anything other than take one more turn around the same carousel while the clock ticks down? Read morehere. Mrs May held meetings about Brexit and Northern Ireland's political deadlock with Stormont's five biggest political parties: The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - the Conservative Party's confidence-and-supply partner at Westminster Sinn FÃ©in Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Alliance Party There has been no functioning devolved government since January 2017, when a row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in over a flawed green energy scheme collapsed the power-sharing executive. This video can not be played The leaders of the UUP, the SDLP and the Alliance Party gave their views after meeting the PM It sparked a snap election but, since then, various talks processes have collapsed and the Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley had to take control of financial matters and pass Stormont's budget bills through Westminster. For almost 10 years before that, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in worked together in government under a system of mandatory coalition, where unionist and nationalist parties shared power. DUP Leader Arlene Foster reiterated the party's opposition to the backstop and said Mrs May must ""stand strong"" in her talks with the EU. Mrs Foster also said Mr Tusk's comments were ""deliberately provocative and disrespectful"" and that the pressure is mounting among EU leaders. Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson responded to Mr Tusk's comments by calling him a ""devilish euro maniac"", and accused the European Council president of having ""fanned the flames of fear"" to try and overturn the referendum result. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said Donald Tusk's words were ""accurately reflecting the outrage"" people in NI feel about how Brexit has been handled. She added that the party's meeting with the PM was direct, but offered nothing new and she accused Mrs May of having ""no honour"". Ms McDonald also reiterated the party's support for the backstop and that a border poll should take place if there is a no-deal Brexit. Theidea of a border poll was met sceptically on Tuesday by Tony Lloyd, Northern Ireland's shadow secretary of state, who said it was ""not the most obvious thing we should rush into"". Criticism as Stormont stalled two years on What caused the Stormont stalemate? Who's calling the shots on NI policy? What is the Good Friday Agreement? UUP Leader Robin Swann said his party would not accept a time-limited backstop, something the PM suggested when his party met her. He added that Mrs May wanted to focus on Brexit and the UUP had to ""drag"" her to a place where they could raise the restoration of Stormont. Mr Swann said his party told her they wanted direct rule implemented in Northern Ireland if there is a no-deal Brexit. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley arrives at Stormont ahead of Brexit talks SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood said that his party had told Mrs May that it is now time to ""put up or shut up"". He said it was clear the backstop was the only viable solution, save keeping the UK in the single market and the customs union. He added that he had been ""infuriated"" when the government voted in favour of an amendment last week that called for alternative arrangements to replace the backstop. Alliance Party Leader Naomi Long said the time for ""assurances"" about Brexit from the government was over, describing her party's talks with Mrs May as ""constructive but very direct"". Ms Long reiterated that the party had heard nothing new from Mrs May and that it still backed the Brexit deal that included the backstop. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? The backstop is a commitment to avoid physical barriers or checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if no UK-EU trade deal is agreed before the Brexit transition period ends. Many people fear the return of customs checks would put the peace process at risk. In Tuesday's speech in Belfast, Mrs May said: ""There is no suggestion that we are not going to ensure in the future there is provision for this insurance policy... the backstop."" However, she indicated she would seek changes to address concerns raised by MPs about its ""potential indefinite nature"" when theyoverwhelmingly rejected her Brexit deal. Please upgrade your browser Last week, MPs voted for an amendment tabled by Conservative grandee Sir Graham Brady - and backed by the PM - which ""requires the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"". Many fear the ""temporary single customs territory"" created under the backstop plan would keep the UK tied to EU rules in the long term. Downing Street has insisted the government is still considering alternatives. On Wednesday,the Alternative Arrangements Working Group, comprised of Leave and Remain MPs,will conclude three days of talks aimed at finding other Brexit options that would avoid a hard border. MPs have been looking at ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop, which Mrs May has said she will discuss with EU leaders. They include: a ""trusted trader"" scheme to avoid physical checks on goods flowing through the border ""mutual recognition"" of rules with the EU ""technological"" solutions The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, when the two-year limit on withdrawal negotiations enforced by the Article 50 process expires. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. If MPs approve a deal with Brussels, the parties will then have until the end of 2020 to negotiate a future trade deal. If that is not in place by the end of this transition period, the backstop kicks in. Without a deal, however, there would be no backstop and no transition period. The prime minister has said she is ""determined"" to deliver Brexit on time but a number of cabinet ministers have indicated they would be willing to agree to a short extension to finalise legislation for Brexit.

Trump rewrites Syria policy,"US ground troops first became involved in Syria in 2015 Up to now the official US position has been that its forces would stay on the ground in Syria to secure the enduring defeat of the Islamic State (IS) group. ""Nobody is declaring a mission accomplished"", said Brett McGurk, the US special envoy to the global coalition to defeat IS, only two weeks ago. But over recent months an additional narrative has been intruding, certainly among the more strident foreign policy voices in the Trump administration. A longstanding presence in Syria, it was argued, would help to contain Iran and counter Russia's growing influence in the region. US confirms Syria troop withdrawal After the caliphate: What next for IS? Who are the Kurds? US ground troops first became involved in Syria in Autumn 2015 when then President Barack Obama sent in a small number of special forces to train and advise local Kurdish fighters who were fighting IS. The US did this reluctantly after several attempts at arming anti-IS groups had descended into chaos. Over the intervening years the numbers of US troops in Syria increased, standing today at some 2,000, though some estimates place the number perhaps even higher.  A network of bases and airstrips has been established in an arc across the north-eastern part of the country. But what is their strategic purpose now? IS is well on the way to being defeated. Syria's President Assad remains in place due to the support of his allies in Moscow and Tehran.  If the goal now is to contain Iran or Russia's rising influence in the region, then 2,000 troops strung out across a vast swathe of territory may be too small a force to do this. President Donald Trump's decision is thus in this sense logical, and it fits in with his own apparent hostility - despite a lot of bellicose rhetoric - to entanglements in foreign wars. Others might argue though that the presence of US troops gives the US ""skin in the game"". It is an important presence, and on occasion US forces have been involved in direct clashes with pro-Iranian militias and Russian military contractors who tried to attack the positions of their allies. Around 2,000 US troops are believed to be stationed in Syria IS may be largely defeated, but what is to happen in the roughly one third of Syria that remains outside the control of President Assad and his allies? Could a new phase of the civil war ensue? And if large parts of the country descend into renewed chaos, something related to IS or similar could easily emerge again. The US has also played an important role in bolstering Kurdish groups in northern Syria who have been the key local element in defeating IS. But these groups are seen by Turkey as a significant threat. It is telling that the Trump policy shift has come at a time when Washington and Ankara are trying to navigate a new bout of tensions, with the Turkish authorities warning that they plan to strike further into Syria against the  self-same Kurdish elements. So has Washington done a deal with Ankara? What security guarantees will there be for Washington's local allies going forward?  And if the Kurds are effectively abandoned to their fate, what does it say for the reliability of the US as an ally in future conflicts, should local fighters be encouraged to align themselves with Washington? But above all there will now be renewed questions about the Trump administration's whole approach to the region. What are its strategic goals? What are America's enduring interests there? And what means need to be invested to secure these goals? There is no doubt that the Middle East - once Washington's crucial energy supplier and a focus for superpower competition - is today less important in purely geo-strategic terms to the US than it once was. But it remains a region of great instability and one of huge continuing importance to Washington's closest European allies, who confront its many problems just across the Mediterranean. So Washington needs a coherent policy, one that extends beyond a simple slogan of ""containing Iran"". With President Trump  it often appears that US policy is unduly aligned with Saudi Arabia and Israel - or more accurately the approach of  two influential figures, de facto Saudi leader Mohammed bin Salman and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu - who are perhaps taking advantage of Washington's perceived weakness in the region to promote their own particular policy views. President Trump's decision reverses the much-rehearsed official lines of both the Pentagon and the state department, and it places Washington's Kurdish allies in greater jeopardy. A US pullout will only revive questions about the Trump administration's whole approach to the region which, while perhaps less important in Washington's calculations, still has the potential for explosive disruption and conflict. US ground troops 'withdrawing from Syria' Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat Can Trump quit Syria 'very soon'?

New ideas for the 'backstop',"Theresa May says she has ""fresh mandate and renewed determination"" to revisit the Brexit deal Prime Minister Theresa May says she intends to return to Brussels with new ideas on the Irish backstop. The EU has already dismissed the idea of putting a time limit on the backstop, so what other ideas have been suggested? The backstop is an insurance policy - designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. If the UK leaves the customs union and the single market that could mean goods would have to be checked as they crossed the frontier. Q&A: Irish border Brexit backstop Can technology solve Irish border problem? The UK and EU would instead like to keep the border frictionless through a comprehensive trade deal. If such an agreement could not be reached, then to avoid those checks with customs posts or other infrastructure, the backstop would come into force. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU, and leave Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. Many MPs fear the UK could be ""trapped"" in that arrangement for years, leaving it unable to strike its own trade deals on goods with the rest of the world. The prime minister's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) allies also do not want to see Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK. Clarification - and another referendum The Irish economist Karl Whelan has suggested thatthe EU should clarify that it has no objections to Great Britain leaving the customs union backstop,externalwhile Northern Ireland stays in it. ""This is the original version of the backstop that the EU offered, so it should be clear they are willing to still offer this,"" says Prof Whelan. That would leave Great Britain free to strike trade deals but Northern Ireland would not be part of them. That would be anathema to the DUP and other MPs. The DUP's Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster want NI to be treated the same as the rest of the UK after Brexit The second part of Prof Whelan's plan is to use the Brexit political declaration to promise the citizens of Northern Ireland a referendum on the backstop, should it ever come into effect. He suggests that five years after the beginning of the operation of a Northern Ireland-only backstop there would be a vote on whether to remain within the EU's customs union and single market. He says: ""A promise to hold a referendum five years after the end of the transition period would provide a clear concession to those who believe the backstop arrangements would be harmful to Northern Ireland by offering them a chance to convince their fellow citizens to end the arrangements after a period."" A European customs association A paper for the German Ifo Institute suggests thatthe difficulties with the backstop should cause both sides to fundamentally rethink,externaltheir red lines. It proposes a new European customs association - a permanent customs union between the UK and the EU. It would be superior to the customs deal Turkey has with the EU giving the UK ""full and active participation"", instead of merely being a rule-taker. However, it acknowledges even that would not be enough to keep the Irish border frictionless and the UK would have to effectively remain in the single market for goods and perhaps services. The Irish border has been one of the most contentious Brexit issues In return for such an enormous u-turn by the UK, the institute says that the EU should also make a radical change on free movement. The EU's position is that the UK cannot enjoy full participation in the single market unless it accepts the four freedoms - one of which is the free movement of people. The institute says the EU could ""abandon its indivisibility dogma by which the four freedoms are inseparable, offering the UK to participate in product market integration but allowing it to make its own choices in other areas"". It adds: ""Most importantly, this concerns the mobility of people."" Beef up the political declaration The political declaration was published alongside the withdrawal deal and sets out the broad shape of the future relationship between the UK and EU. EU leaders have said they are open to redrafting the declaration if the UK presents new ideas. The former Liberal Democrat MEP Andrew Duff has, in a paper for the European Policy Centre, suggestedimprovements aimed at ""rescuing"" the withdrawal agreement,external. Please upgrade your browser He says that the language on the temporary nature of the backstop could be clearer and ""more forceful"". However, given the prime minister's intention to seek legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement changes to the political declaration are unlikely to impress pro-Brexit MPs. Ireland leaves the EU customs union Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the prime minister's former senior adviser Nick Timothy suggested thatIreland could leave the EU's customs union and instead create a joint customs territory,externalwith the EU. That would eliminate the possibility of customs checks at the Irish border but mean new customs procedures between Ireland and the EU. Mr Timothy said that would build on existing policies and would help to protect Irish consumers and businesses. However, in Ireland there is near universal hostility to any suggestion that Brexit should force it to weaken its position in the EU. Mr Timothy appeared to acknowledge that reality, writing: ""No doubt this idea will be attacked as another unicorn.""

Tusk: Special place in hell for no-plan BrexiteersThe European Council president sparks a backlash from Brexit-backing MPs after his comments.UK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: ""Special place in hell"" for those without Brexit plan European Council President Donald Tusk has spoken of a ""special place in hell"" for ""those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan of how to carry it out safely"".

Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who is now an independent MEP, tweeted: ""After Brexit we will be free of unelected, arrogant bullies like you and run our own country. Sounds more like heaven to me."" Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, who also campaigned for Britain's exit from the EU, said Mr Tusk should apologise for his ""disgraceful"" and ""spiteful"" comments. ""I'm sure that when he reflects on it he may well wish he hadn't done it,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, when asked on ITV Peston's programme how he felt ""when President Tusk practically reserved your place in hell?"", said: ""Perhaps he'll join us there. ""When people throw insults around it says more about them than the people they're insulting.""

""It is Tusk and his arrogant EU negotiators who have fanned the flames of fear in an attempt to try and overturn the result of the referendum."" This video can not be played Leadsom on Tusk: ""The man has no manners"" But Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald backed Mr Tusk, arguing that it was the position of ""hardline"" Brexit-supporting MPs like Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg that was ""intemperate"" and ""untenable"". And Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, who supports having another EU referendum, said Mr Tusk was ""absolutely right"" and it was ""painful"" for leading figures in the Leave campaign, such as Boris Johnson and David Davis, ""to have the truth pointed out to them"". Theresa May - who supported the UK staying in the EU during the 2016 EU referendum but has always insisted that Brexit must be delivered because that was what people voted for - is due to arrive in Brussels on Thursday to seek legal changes to the withdrawal deal she signed with the EU. She hopes these changes will help her get it through the UK Parliament. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson saidthe government was likely to publish a new employment billbefore the next vote on Mrs May's deal, with the aim to maximise support for it from Labour MPs. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has set out five demands for his party to support a Brexit deal - calling for them to be enshrined as objectives in domestic law. In a letter to the prime minister, he said Labour wanted a UK-wide customs union, close alignment with the single market, ""dynamic alignment"" on rights and protections, ""clear commitments"" on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes and ""unambiguous agreements"" on the detail of future security arrangements. He said Labour did not believe that ""simply seeking modifications"" to the backstop was a sufficient response. Mr Corbyn added that EU leaders had been clear that changes to the political declaration were possible if a request was made by the UK government ""and if the current red lines change"". By BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming The EU has been absolutely scathing about some of the British political class today. The dam broke on Donald Tusk's pent-up feelings about the leaders of the Leave campaign. The Irish prime minister suggested that MPs either didn't know what they were doing or were misled when they voted to look for alternatives to the Irish backstop. But - and it's a big but - they have all been open to the prime minister coming to Brussels with a solution to break the deadlock. And while Jean-Claude Juncker ruled out the idea of the UK having the right to pull out of the backstop if it were ever needed, he didn't say anything about the other idea doing the rounds - a time limit. Donald Tusk said that the other 27 EU members had decided in December that the withdrawal agreement was ""not open for renegotiation"" - a message echoed by Mr Juncker. Mr Tusk also had a message for Remain supporters in the UK, with 50 days to go until Brexit happens, with a deal or without one, saying: ""I have always been with you, with all my heart"". But he added: ""The facts are unmistakable. At the moment, the pro-Brexit stance of the UK prime minister, and the Leader of the Opposition, rules out this question. ""Today, there is no political force and no effective leadership for Remain. I say this without satisfaction, but you can't argue with the facts."" Please upgrade your browser Mr Tusk said the Irish border issue and the need to preserve the peace process remained the EU's ""top priority"". He hoped Mrs May would ""give us a deliverable guarantee for peace in Northern Ireland and the UK will leave the EU as a trusted friend"" that can command a Commons majority. Mr Varadkar said that while he was ""open to further discussions"" with the UK government about post-Brexit relations, the legally-binding withdrawal agreement remained ""the best deal possible"". And the backstop was needed ""as a legal guarantee to ensure that there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland"". He later said he will meet Theresa May for talks in Dublin on Friday. Jean-Claude Juncker said alternative arrangements - the form of words backed by MPs in a vote last week - ""can never replace the backstop"". Clarification 27 February 2019: While the summary of this story and opening paragraph made clear that Mr Tusk was referring to a specific group of people - those who promoted Brexit without a plan - the original headlines were misleading and so were amended shortly after publication on 6 February.

Trump backs World Bank critic for top jobNominee David Malpass has called for changes at the international institution.Business,"David Malpass (R) is a controversial candidate US President Donald Trump has named senior Treasury Department official David Malpass to lead the World Bank. If approved, he is expected to push the bank to narrow the focus of its lending to the world's poorest countries, among other changes. His nomination has stirred debate, as some worry that Mr Malpass, a critic of the bank, will seek to reduce its role. White House officials said Mr Malpass, a long-time Republican, would be a ""pro-growth reformer"". At a press conference in Washington, Mr Trump praised Mr Malpass as a ""strong advocate for accountability at the World Bank for a long time"". The president, who frequently criticises multilateral institutions, said he expected Mr Malpass to ensure that the bank's dollars ""are spent effectively and wisely, serve American interests and defend American values."" The White House describes Mr Malpass as a ""pro-growth reformer"" Mr Malpass, a Trump loyalist, was a senior economic adviser to the US president during his 2016 election campaign. He has served as the Treasury Department's undersecretary for international affairs since August 2017. The 62-year-old has criticised the World Bank, along with other institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, for being ""intrusive"" and ""entrenched"". He has also pushed the bank to reduce its lending to China, which he says is too wealthy to deserve such aid, and deploys harsh practices when lending to other countries. Who is Trump's World Bank pick Malpass? The US, the World Bank's largest shareholder and a major source of its funding, has traditionally held sway over the selection process for president. An American has led the institution since its start in the 1940s, when it was created to help rebuild Europe in the aftermath of World War II. However, there has been increased pressure to diversify the bank's leadership, reflecting the economic rise of other countries in recent decades. It is not clear if other countries will propose alternatives to challenge Mr Malpass for the presidency. The World Bank, which has 189 members, is accepting names until 14 March and plans to create a shortlist of up to three candidates for interviews. Its executive board expects to vote on candidates before its April meeting. The US controls 16% of the 25-member board's voting power. European shareholders, who control another significant chunk of voting power, are also unlikely to block the pick, according to Reuters. The World Bank helped to fund repairs of the Kariba Dam White House officials said Mr Malpass would champion ""pro-growth"" policies, emphasising the role of the private sector, increased lending transparency and more ""competitive"" tax systems. He will also oversee implementation of reforms the US pushed last year, which coupled an increase in money for the bank with changes aimed at reducing lending to China. Officials said Mr Malpass's nomination did not signal a lack of support for the organisation, which helps finance development projects with loans, credits and grants, committing more than $60bn (Â£46.3bn) in its most recent financial year, However, they said the administration did want to see changes to make it more effective. ""Sometimes that does require real reform and modernising ways of doing business,"" a senior administration official said during a background briefing with reporters. The World Bank's search was triggered by the unexpected resignation of Jim Yong Kim If approved, Mr Malpass would replace Jim Yong Kim, a doctor and former president of Dartmouth University, who unexpectedly resigned last month.

Explosion fears at Ocado warehouse blaze,"This video can not be played About 200 firefighters spent Tuesday night tackling the blaze Homes have been evacuated because of the risk of a toxic cloud or large cylinder explosion at a large fire sweeping through an Ocado warehouse. A 500m exclusion zone has been set up as firefighters continue to tackle the blaze, which broke out on Tuesday morning. Deputy chief fire officer Andy Bowers said the evacuation of Walworth Industrial Estate in Hampshire was a precaution to keep the public safe. A major incident has been declared. Live updates on the Ocado warehouse fire evacuations Mr Bowers said: ""We have a risk of a toxic release or a large cylinder explosion. ""We are working extremely closely with all of our partners to keep the public safe."" The fire service said parts of the building are likely to collapse Some homes 1.6km away from the site were due to be evacuated depending to the wind direction, Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said. Residents outside the exclusion zone have been told to ""stay put and close doors and windows"". Test Valley Borough Council said residents who needed to be evacuated would ""be informed by emergency services visiting your property"". But the local authority advised people who were able leave their properties without assistance to do so. A fire service spokeswoman said about 20 families were at a rest centre set up in Harrow Way Community School, Andover, after being evacuated from their homes. She added it was a ""strong possibility"" that people who work within the exclusion zone would not have access on Thursday morning. This video can not be played Residents evacuated from homes say ""it's been a nightmare"" Chief fire officer Neil Odin said the initial small fire had taken a ""dramatic turn"" early on Wednesday morning and firefighters had to be withdrawn. ""This building is not meant for humans to be interacting with the racking and the storage - it has robots moving racking on to loading bays, so for firefighters trying to get in that high and to make an effective fire-fighting strategy, it has been very difficult,"" he said. Mr Odin added the ""extensive"" fire had led to a ""large cylinder with refrigerant gas in it"" being affected. Ocado sales warning after warehouse blaze Fire disrupts Ocado shopping deliveries The robot swarms that pack your shopping Firefighters have been tackling the blaze on the Andover site for more than 40 hours, after crews were called to the scene at 02:44 GMT on Tuesday.

Son's 200-mile journey beats ambulance,"Mark Clements travelled from London to Exmouth before paramedics reached his mother A man who travelled nearly 200 miles to reach his injured mother arrived before an ambulance reached her. Mark Clements caught a bus, tube and two trains from London to Exmouth, Devon on Saturday after his 77-year-old mother fell and broke her hip. The initial 999 call was made at 09:00 GMT but paramedics did not arrive until seven hours later. South Western Ambulance Service apologised and said it was experiencing ""an unprecedented rise in demand"". Mr Clements said he and his family - some of whom were waiting with his mother - were ""appalled"" by what happened. ""My mother was lying in an awkward position on a cold conservatory floor and was unable to move,"" he said. Mr Clements took three hours and 40 minutes to travel from London to Exmouth, arriving at his mother's home at 15:10, about 50 minutes before the ambulance crew. He said relatives called 999 on six different occasions but it was seven hours before an ambulance arrived. ""An ambulance station is less than 10 minutes from my mother's home,"" he added. Latest news and stories from Devon When paramedics eventually arrived, Mr Clements said they were ""equally appalled and astonished"" at the delay. ""My mother is a very strong woman and it was heartbreaking to see her go through this experience,"" he added. South Western Ambulance Service (SWASFT) said it had to prioritise more ""serious incidents"". It said it was sorry it was ""not able reach this patient sooner"" but an assessment was carried out and there was considered to be ""no immediate threat to life"". Mark Clements' mother was left on a ""cold conservatory floor"" after breaking her hip Mr Clements' mother was initially classed as a category four case, which is considered ""less urgent"" and only requiring transport to a hospital. Ambulance services in England took an average of one hour and 24 minutes to respond to such calls between April and December 2018,according to official figures,external. SWASFT's average was two hours and 21 minutes, the longest in the country. However its average response time for category one calls - for life threatening conditions - was seven minutes and 26 seconds, just one second behind the national average. Mr Clements' mother had a hip operation on Sunday and is recovering in hospital.

'Stansted 15' protesters spared jail,"Members of the Stansted 15 gathered outside Chelmsford Crown Court ahead of their sentencing Fifteen protesters who chained themselves to a plane to stop it deporting people to Africa have avoided immediate jail sentences. Dubbed the Stansted 15, the group broke through a fence at the airport in a bid to reach the jet taking 60 people to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. They were found guilty of endangering the safety of an aerodrome. Three were given suspended jail terms and 12 received community orders at Chelmsford Crown Court. The group has said they will appeal against their convictions, which they believe have serious implications for the freedom to protest. They used bolt cutters to enter Stansted Airport and attached themselves to the Boeing 767 using tubes and expanding foam on 28 March 2017. The runway was closed for more than an hour and 23 incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports. This video can not be played Stansted 15 'relieved' to avoid jail Passing sentence, Judge Christopher Morgan told the 15 that while he accepted the group were seeking to demonstrate in support of their cause, they had come ""perilously close"" to causing a catastrophe. He said: ""In normal circumstances only a normal custodial sentence would have been justified in this case, but in your case I accept that your intentions were to demonstrate."" ""There is no doubt that you understood that there were safety implications,"" he added. ""You put at risk the safe operations of the airport and the persons who were there on the night."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC Home Affairs correspondent In court, the judge faced some tough arguments from a top human rights barrister about his duties to balance the question of airport security with the need to protect freedom of speech and assembly. Judge Morgan said he did this through tempering his sentences - in other circumstances, he said, he would have jailed the lot of them. Some of the defendants looked jubilant and defiant. Others looked like defendants often do: exhausted by the process, somewhat remorseful and promising never to do it again. So if the Court of Appeal decides not to examine the convictions, this prosecution will stand as a warning to others of the type of charge they could face for endangering an airport. Read more from Dominic here A large crowd gathered outside the court in support of the Stansted 15 Three of the defendants, Edward Thacker, Alistair Tamlit and Melanie Strickland were given nine-month jail sentences, suspended for 18 months. The other 12 received 12-month community orders, with 11 of them ordered to carry out unpaid work. All 15 were convicted on 10 December last year under the 1990 Aviation and Maritime Security Act, which was brought in after the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. The Stansted 15 have said they will appeal their convictions The defendants had said they were being prosecuted under the ""little known"" legislation, originally devised to combat terrorism and hjijacking. In a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service said it was never suggested to the jury that any of the 15 were terrorists. Prosecutor Tony Badenoch said the Crown would not be recouping the financial deficit caused by the protest; estimated to be more than Â£1m. New mother Emma Hughes, who gave birth between being convicted and sentenced, said the group were ""massively relieved"" none of them would be going to jail. She said: ""It is a massive vindication of what we did. There are 11 people still in the UK because of the action we took.  Three of them have now been granted leave to remain; there is one man here who would have been separated from his family and is now here with his family. We are going to keep fighting until we get these convictions overturned."" Hundreds of people turned out to a demonstration outside the court, with crowds singing, clapping and waving banners. The courtroom was packed for the hearing, with extra space created in the public gallery and all seats filled. The 15 sentenced are: Helen Brewer, 29; Ferme Park Road, London. Lyndsay Burtonshaw, 28; Upper Lewes Road, Brighton. Nathan Clack, 30; Ferme Park Road, London. Laura Clayson, 28; Brownswood Road, London. Melanie Evans, 35; Vicarage Road, London.

Baby born with heart outside body is homeVanellope Hope Wilkins is fully discharged from hospital 14 months after she was born with no breastbone.Nottingham,"This video can not be played Vanellope Hope Wilkins was born with no breastbone in November 2017 A baby who was born with her heart outside her body has been fully discharged from hospital 14 months after she was born. Vanellope Hope Wilkins, who was born with no breastbone, was delivered at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester on 22 November 2017 by Caesarean section. She had three operations to place her heart back in her chest. Vanellope has now left Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre, which she was moved to in May to be nearer home. She has had a few trips home overnight but now will now be there permanently. Vanellope Hope Wilkins is now home with her parents and three brothers Her mother Naomi Findlay, from Bulwell, Nottingham, said it was ""absolutely amazing"" and ""a massive relief"" to have Vanellope home. ""It's exciting but it's daunting at the same time,"" she added. ""It has been an incredibly long, emotional journey."" Vanellope requires 24-hour care and is reliant on a ventilator. Vanellope's heart is now covered with her own skin after three operations Her parents - who said they will get married next year - are taking over much of her care, although they will have help overnight. Ms Findlay said it was ""not quite over yet"" but it was a chance for them to be a normal family. Outside heart op baby moves hospitals Baby has heart put back inside chest Vanellope's father Dean Wilkins said: ""There is still a lot she has to undergo yet but she is home and that's the first step."" Frances Bu'Lock, part of the team caring for Vanellope, said the baby would ""need something in the longer term"" to give structure to her chest and make her condition more stable. ""Like with all of her care we don't exactly know what's going to happen, because nobody's ever done it before, so we're going to have to keep an eye on things,"" she added. Staff at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre have been caring for Vanellope since May The condition, ectopia cordis, is extremely rare with only a few cases per million births, of which most are stillborn. When Vanellope's rare condition was first diagnosed in pregnancy her parents were told she had less than a one in 10 chance of surviving. However, the experts at the children's heart surgery unit at Glenfield Hospital defeated those odds. Glenfield Hospital said it knew of no other case in the UK where the baby had survived. Minutes after her birth, Vanellope's chest was covered with a sterile bag to keep her heart moist and reduce the risk of infection Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

"Katie Price considers residential care for sonThe former model says her son Harvey, who has disabilities, smashed windows, TVs and iPads.UK","This video can not be played Katie Price says her son Harvey, who has disabilities, smashed windows, TVs and iPads Katie Price has said she may have to move her disabled teenage son Harvey into residential care as her family finds it harder to cope. The disability rights campaigner and mother-of-five said Harvey, who is 16, sometimes scares her other children and ""is a danger to himself"". He has smashed eight iPads this year and broken windows and TVs, she said. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire, Ms Price also revealed she had sought treatment for cocaine use. She said after an ""awful year"" in 2018 - including her mum living with a terminal illness, splitting from her husband and being held at gunpoint in South Africa - she was ""self medicating"" with cocaine for around six months. Katie Price: The ups and downs of her life In-debt Katie Price avoids bankruptcy Katie Price backed by MPs over online abuse The reality TV star and former glamour model gave her TV interview on Wednesday morning alongside Harvey, who is partially blind, autistic and has the genetic disorder Prader-Willi syndrome. ""For the first time ever now I'm thinking he might have to go residential, Monday to Friday,"" she said. ""He's missing out on his education, he just wants to be with me all the time. ""It's so hard. I've never had respite, I do it all myself. But I'm really having to think about it. I hate it because he's my life. I've got to do what's best for him, but it won't be forever. ""When he's smashing things and the kids are a bit scared because he's big, he'll chase them and stuff, I've just got to do it for him."" This video can not be played Katie Price: ""I'm trying to get on with my life"" Ms Price said she does not think carers get enough respect, with people not realising ""how actually hard it is"". ""Today, before we came, I had to bath him, wash him, because he can't do it himself, I had to dress him,"" she said. Turning to Harvey, she added: ""Literally I do everything for you, don't I. You're like the king."" ""He wets the bed twice a night. He needs all these meds here to survive, if he doesn't have these he will literally die."" Ms Price said Harvey takes medication six times a day and then an injection at night The head of Contact, a charity for families of disabled children, said they receive hundreds of enquiries each year from parents whose children display challenging behaviour. ""Parents talk about being isolated and frightened and many feel they have lost control,"" said chief executive Amanda Batten. ""We strongly believe that getting the correct support in place early is hugely important. ""But we also recognise that the teenage years do bring new challenges and it's also vital that families get the help they need as their child grows up. ""We know that a lack of support has a negative impact on family life, with an increased likelihood of sibling and parental emotional distress, family breakdown and expensive residential placements."" The charity said it is taking part in a trial project with University College London for families with disabled children who display challenging behaviour, which aims to intervene early and give parents strategies for coping with and managing behaviour. Are you a family dealing with similar issues? You can share your experience by emailinghaveyoursay,external. Ms Price's interview comes just weeks after a group of MPsbacked her petitioncalling for new laws to crack down on social media abuse against disabled people, after online trolling of Harvey. She said: ""Most of the trolling he gets is from the football background, football fans. We looked into it. I had no idea, but most of it is actually from the football fans."" Meanwhile, separately in the interview, Ms Price admitted she had checked into The Priory - a private health clinic often known for its celebrity patients - after she turned to taking cocaine weekly for around six months. ""I just couldn't take it anymore. I had no-one to talk to because I couldn't trust anyone. So I went to The Priory, I was self-medicating on a drug, and I'm not proud of it. It was cocaine.

I went to the doctors, I knew it wasn't right, I've never been up that track before, never done the drugs and stuff. ""It was the hardest thing ever to sit there and say 'look, I'm at breaking point. I need help'."" She said: ""Am I ashamed I did it? It's not good but I couldn't help it, I was ill really.""

Trump backs World Bank critic for top job,"David Malpass (R) is a controversial candidate US President Donald Trump has named senior Treasury Department official David Malpass to lead the World Bank. If approved, he is expected to push the bank to narrow the focus of its lending to the world's poorest countries, among other changes. His nomination has stirred debate, as some worry that Mr Malpass, a critic of the bank, will seek to reduce its role. White House officials said Mr Malpass, a long-time Republican, would be a ""pro-growth reformer"". At a press conference in Washington, Mr Trump praised Mr Malpass as a ""strong advocate for accountability at the World Bank for a long time"". The president, who frequently criticises multilateral institutions, said he expected Mr Malpass to ensure that the bank's dollars ""are spent effectively and wisely, serve American interests and defend American values."" The White House describes Mr Malpass as a ""pro-growth reformer"" Mr Malpass, a Trump loyalist, was a senior economic adviser to the US president during his 2016 election campaign. He has served as the Treasury Department's undersecretary for international affairs since August 2017. The 62-year-old has criticised the World Bank, along with other institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, for being ""intrusive"" and ""entrenched"". He has also pushed the bank to reduce its lending to China, which he says is too wealthy to deserve such aid, and deploys harsh practices when lending to other countries. Who is Trump's World Bank pick Malpass? The US, the World Bank's largest shareholder and a major source of its funding, has traditionally held sway over the selection process for president. An American has led the institution since its start in the 1940s, when it was created to help rebuild Europe in the aftermath of World War II. However, there has been increased pressure to diversify the bank's leadership, reflecting the economic rise of other countries in recent decades. It is not clear if other countries will propose alternatives to challenge Mr Malpass for the presidency. The World Bank, which has 189 members, is accepting names until 14 March and plans to create a shortlist of up to three candidates for interviews. Its executive board expects to vote on candidates before its April meeting. The US controls 16% of the 25-member board's voting power. European shareholders, who control another significant chunk of voting power, are also unlikely to block the pick, according to Reuters. The World Bank helped to fund repairs of the Kariba Dam White House officials said Mr Malpass would champion ""pro-growth"" policies, emphasising the role of the private sector, increased lending transparency and more ""competitive"" tax systems. He will also oversee implementation of reforms the US pushed last year, which coupled an increase in money for the bank with changes aimed at reducing lending to China. Officials said Mr Malpass's nomination did not signal a lack of support for the organisation, which helps finance development projects with loans, credits and grants, committing more than $60bn (Â£46.3bn) in its most recent financial year, However, they said the administration did want to see changes to make it more effective. ""Sometimes that does require real reform and modernising ways of doing business,"" a senior administration official said during a background briefing with reporters. The World Bank's search was triggered by the unexpected resignation of Jim Yong Kim If approved, Mr Malpass would replace Jim Yong Kim, a doctor and former president of Dartmouth University, who unexpectedly resigned last month.

"Best-selling author lied about cancerDan Mallory, who wrote The Woman in the Window, admits he falsely told people he had brain cancer.Entertainment & Arts","Dan Mallory went straight to number one on the New York Times best-seller list Dan Mallory, author of the best-selling The Woman in the Window, has admitted to lying about having brain cancer. Mallory, who wrote the thriller under the pseudonym AJ Finn, said he claimed to have had cancer as a way to disguise his struggles with bipolar disorder. His admission comes aftera New Yorker profile,externalaccused him of a history of lies about his personal life. The US author told the magazine it was ""never the goal"" to ""take advantage of anyone else's goodwill"". Mallory was a book editor before The Woman in the Window, his debut novel, was published in January 2018. It debuted at number one on the New York Times best-seller list. A film adaptation of the book, about a woman with agoraphobia who begins spying on her new neighbours, is out later this year, starring Amy Adams and Gary Oldman. Mallory's debut novel has sold more than two million copies The New Yorker claimed Mallory had repeatedly said he had been diagnosed with brain cancer, including in a university application and to colleagues while working at publishing houses in London and New York. The article also alleged that he said his mother died of cancer and his brother also died. Although his mother did have cancer when Mallory was a teenager, she and his brother are both alive. In response to the New Yorker piece, the author wrote: ""It is the case that on numerous occasions in the past, I have stated, implied, or allowed others to believe that I was afflicted with a physical malady instead of a psychological one: cancer, specifically. ""My mother battled aggressive breast cancer starting when I was a teenager; it was the formative experience of my adolescent life, synonymous with pain and panic. I felt intensely ashamed of my psychological struggles - they were my scariest, most sensitive secret."" He said he was ""utterly terrified of what people would think of me if they knew"" about his mental health problems, and would think he was ""defective"" or would not believe him. ""Dissembling seemed the easier path."" He added that ""like many afflicted with severe bipolar II disorder, I experienced crushing depressions, delusional thoughts, morbid obsessions and memory problems"". He continued: ""It's been horrific, not least because, in my distress, I did or said or believed things I would never ordinarily say, or do, or believe - things of which, in many instances, I have absolutely no recollection. ""With the benefit of hindsight, I'm sorry to have taken, or be seen to have taken, advantage of anyone else's goodwill, however desperate the circumstances; that was never the goal."" His agent confirmed the statement to BBC News. A spokesman for HarperCollins UKtold The Bookseller:,external""We don't comment on the personal lives of our employees or authors. Professionally, Dan was a highly valued editor and the publication The Woman in the Window - a Sunday Times bestseller - speaks for itself.""

"Mystery of '20,000 seabird deaths'Scientists are trying to find out why so many dead guillemots have washed up on the Dutch coast.","The dead guillemots have been washing up along 300km of Dutch coastline Scientists are trying to find out why some 20,000 guillemots have died in recent weeks along the Dutch coast. The birds were all emaciated and there are fears they may have been victims of a spill from the MSC Zoe container ship, from which some 345 containers fell in the sea during a storm. ""There's no smoking gun, but we're looking into it,"" says Mardik Leopold, who is investigating the deaths. Chemicals may be to blame as most plastics are hard to ingest, he says. Hours after the containers fell off the MSC Zoe in a storm, they started washing up on islands off the Dutch north coast on 2 January, spilling their contents of children's toys, furniture and televisions on to the beaches. A bag of peroxide powder was also found. This video can not be played Footage filmed by the Dutch coastguard shows precariously balanced containers on board the MSC Zoe. Mardik Leopold, a seabird expert from Wageningen University, said the figure of 20,000 dead guillemots was based on educated guesswork. ""That's based on the average trending rate of one guillemot per kilometre of beach per day in the Netherlands with 300km [186 miles] available. That's 10,000 birds,"" he told the BBC. A similar number would have been left in the sea, he added. Some of the survivors are being nursed back to health at the FÃ»gelhelling centre Islands hit as hundreds of containers fall off ship Although he is keeping an open mind, he points out that the birds began washing up at the time of the container spill. Bad weather can also affect a guillemot's access to food, but Mr Leopold believes the problem would then not have been confined to the Dutch coast. While the guillemots may have swallowed plastic pellets, a spill of paraffin or palm oil was perhaps more likely. The island of Terschelling, where much of the MSC Zoe debris washed up, has also seen paraffin appear on its beaches. On Wednesday, Dutch authorities said that at least 345 containers had fallen off the ship, 54 more than first thought. Dr Leopold found this guillemot on a beach on the island of Texel this week Post-mortem examinations will be carried out on 100 of the birds to assess what caused their deaths. Dozens of guillemots have been rescued and are being cared for in a number of centres, where many are being fed by tube as they are so weak. At Uretep in the north of the Netherlands, 11 guillemots are being nursed back to health. ""We have washed seven of them but the other four need to gain weight before we can give them a wash,"" says Hetty Sinnema from the FÃ»gelhelling centre. The hope eventually is to return the guillemots to the sea when they are strong enough She says the problem lies in their intestines but believes it is too early to blame the sea container spill for the disaster. ""We tube-feed them with a lot of minerals, energy powder and fish. They now weigh around 600g but they need to be at least 900g before they are strong enough to be washed."" The surviving birds have a long journey to recovery but ultimately the centre hopes they can be returned to the sea.

Rail strikes halted amid 'breakthrough',"Northern, which is also known as Arriva Rail North, is the main train operator in northern England Strikes on Northern rail have been suspended after a ""major breakthrough"" in a long-running dispute over plans to axe guards on trains, a union said. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) have taken 47 days of industrial action and were due to walk out on the next two Saturdays. Passengers have faced huge disruption since the dispute began two years ago. The RMT said the company had now offered a guarantee of a conductor on all trains. The union claimed imposing driver-only services was a risk to public safety. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said his members had shown ""resilience and determination"". He said he wanted to thank the travelling public for their ""extraordinary support"". RMT members held pickets in Newcastle Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and Liverpool Mayor Steve Rotheram had also been important in allowing us to ""break the deadlock"", he added. Mr Cash said: ""Today's offer of a guarantee of a conductor on all services throughout the duration of the franchise, including the new fleet, is the substantial progress we have been pushing for. ""[It] has allowed RMT's executive to take the decision to suspend the current action and allow for further talks to now take place with all stakeholders around the operational details."" RMT union members on the picket line outside Wigan Wallgate Station Mr Burnham welcomed the news, saying keeping guards on trains will ""help to keep trains safer and more accessible for everybody"". However, he added while it was a ""step forward"" it was ""not yet a final agreement"" and hopes the two sides can reach agreement soon. Northern's managing director David Brown said the firm ""warmly welcomed"" the suspension of strike action, which was ""good news for customers and businesses across the North"". ""We have been very clear in these discussions that there will be a conductor on all our trains now and into the future,"" he said. ""We are looking forward to further positive talks with RMT about operational models moving ahead so that we can resolve their dispute and bring it to an end."" However, it was ""unfortunately too late"" to reintroduce a full timetable before this Saturday, he said. He said Northern would run about 700 services on Saturday. In response, RMT regional organiser Daren Ireland said that was ""madness"", adding it was the ""nonsense of a privatised industry"". He said: ""Our members will be working normally on Saturday and it is up to the Northern management to get their act together to run the full timetable.""

Students protest over rape chat probe,"This video can not be played Warwick University students protest over rape chat probe Hundreds of students have protested at the University of Warwick over the way it dealt with men involved in an online group chat threatening rape. Protestors are angry that the university reduced 10-year bans for two men who appealed to a year. Warwick has been accused of ""condoning rape culture"" and faced calls for an inquiry into the investigation. The university said an independent review of its disciplinary procedure has been launched. Earlier this week, Warwick said the two men confirmed they will not return in September. Hundreds of protesters marched on campus Several of those involved in the Facebook group chat messages last summer encouraged others to rape specific students. After a disciplinary inquiry by the university, two students were initially banned from campus for 10 years, two were excluded for one year and one was given a lifetime campus ban. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Victim's disgust over rape chat decision Warwick rape chat students 'won't return' But the university has come under heavy criticism from students and victims. The Reclaim Our University protest called for a life-long ban for the men involved. In a statement on Facebook, organisers said: ""The University is sending a message this behaviour is acceptable, and the rehabilitation of those who glorify sexual violence is more important than the safety and education of those they seek to attack. ""The higher education of privileged young men who would joke about endangering their fellow students is not more important than the safety and welfare of those they targeted, or that of all abuse and harassment survivors on our campus."" Ellen Butler, 21, at the protest, said: ""I hoped it sent a message that we will not stand for this kind of behaviour from the university. ""They really need to look after their students and put them first before anything else."" Elliot Mulligan, co-editor of student newspaper The Boar, said: ""Students feel the wrong decision was made in the first place so there is still a lot of anger about that."" Protesters accused the university of ""condoning rape culture"" University of Warwick's pro-chancellor David Normington called the men's behaviour ""abhorrent and unacceptable"" and apologised for the distress to victims of abuse. He added: ""There will be a thorough, external and independent review of our disciplinary and appeals processes. ""We will ensure that the views of our community are widely sought and the progress of this review will be communicated on a regular basis.""

Katie Price considers residential care for son,"This video can not be played Katie Price says her son Harvey, who has disabilities, smashed windows, TVs and iPads Katie Price has said she may have to move her disabled teenage son Harvey into residential care as her family finds it harder to cope. The disability rights campaigner and mother-of-five said Harvey, who is 16, sometimes scares her other children and ""is a danger to himself"". He has smashed eight iPads this year and broken windows and TVs, she said. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire, Ms Price also revealed she had sought treatment for cocaine use. She said after an ""awful year"" in 2018 - including her mum living with a terminal illness, splitting from her husband and being held at gunpoint in South Africa - she was ""self medicating"" with cocaine for around six months. Katie Price: The ups and downs of her life In-debt Katie Price avoids bankruptcy Katie Price backed by MPs over online abuse The reality TV star and former glamour model gave her TV interview on Wednesday morning alongside Harvey, who is partially blind, autistic and has the genetic disorder Prader-Willi syndrome. ""For the first time ever now I'm thinking he might have to go residential, Monday to Friday,"" she said. ""He's missing out on his education, he just wants to be with me all the time. ""It's so hard. I've never had respite, I do it all myself. But I'm really having to think about it. I hate it because he's my life. I've got to do what's best for him, but it won't be forever. ""When he's smashing things and the kids are a bit scared because he's big, he'll chase them and stuff, I've just got to do it for him."" This video can not be played Katie Price: ""I'm trying to get on with my life"" Ms Price said she does not think carers get enough respect, with people not realising ""how actually hard it is"". ""Today, before we came, I had to bath him, wash him, because he can't do it himself, I had to dress him,"" she said. Turning to Harvey, she added: ""Literally I do everything for you, don't I. You're like the king."" ""He wets the bed twice a night. He needs all these meds here to survive, if he doesn't have these he will literally die."" Ms Price said Harvey takes medication six times a day and then an injection at night The head of Contact, a charity for families of disabled children, said they receive hundreds of enquiries each year from parents whose children display challenging behaviour. ""Parents talk about being isolated and frightened and many feel they have lost control,"" said chief executive Amanda Batten. ""We strongly believe that getting the correct support in place early is hugely important. ""But we also recognise that the teenage years do bring new challenges and it's also vital that families get the help they need as their child grows up. ""We know that a lack of support has a negative impact on family life, with an increased likelihood of sibling and parental emotional distress, family breakdown and expensive residential placements."" The charity said it is taking part in a trial project with University College London for families with disabled children who display challenging behaviour, which aims to intervene early and give parents strategies for coping with and managing behaviour.

Ms Price's interview comes just weeks after a group of MPsbacked her petitioncalling for new laws to crack down on social media abuse against disabled people, after online trolling of Harvey. She said: ""Most of the trolling he gets is from the football background, football fans. We looked into it. I had no idea, but most of it is actually from the football fans."" Meanwhile, separately in the interview, Ms Price admitted she had checked into The Priory - a private health clinic often known for its celebrity patients - after she turned to taking cocaine weekly for around six months. ""I just couldn't take it anymore. I had no-one to talk to because I couldn't trust anyone. So I went to The Priory, I was self-medicating on a drug, and I'm not proud of it. It was cocaine. This video can not be played The ups and downs of Katie Price's life ""It was an escapism for me. I went to the doctors, I knew it wasn't right, I've never been up that track before, never done the drugs and stuff. ""It was the hardest thing ever to sit there and say 'look, I'm at breaking point. I need help'."" She said: ""Am I ashamed I did it? It's not good but I couldn't help it, I was ill really.""

Hotel booking sites to end 'misleading' sales,"Expedia, Booking.com, Agoda, Hotels.com, ebookers and trivago have been investigated over high-pressure selling tactics and misleading discount claims, the competition watchdog says. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) was concerned the sites were making rooms seem more popular than they were. The sites will now say if commissions they receive affect the results. They also agreed to be clearer with discount claims and hidden charges. The CMA began its investigation in June 2018 but didn't name the comparison sites it was investigating. ""The CMA has taken enforcement action to bring to an end misleading sales tactics, hidden charges and other practices in the online hotel booking market,"" said CMA Chairman Andrew Tyrie. ""These have been wholly unacceptable."" Websites must be clear about their claims The CMA will now seek to make the rest of the sector follow the same rules as the six companies it has named, it said. Consumer action group Which? welcomed the CMA's intervention and said the changes should be ""swiftly implemented"". The companies have all now agreed to the following, the CMA said: To make it clearer how hotels are graded, including whether hotels paying the ranking sites more have received a position higher up the list To not give a false impression of a hotel's popularity to rush customers into making a booking. For example, when saying that other customers are looking at the same hotel as you, it should be made clear it they are searching for different dates. Some sites were also placing sold-out hotels within search results to put pressure on people to book more quickly. Sites have now committed not to do this, the CMA said To be clear about discounts and only promoting deals that are actually available at that time. The CMA found sites comparing a higher weekend room rate with a weekday rate or comparing the price of a luxury suite with a standard room To show charges such as taxes, booking or resort fees in the price Not all of the six companies had fallen foul of all four of these bad practices, the CMA said. ""You can get some good bargains on these sites, but it is very important that you can trust what they say,"" Michael Grenfell, executive director of enforcement at the CMA told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Websites have to include all costs from 1 September ""We will monitor them,"" he added. The companies have until 1 September to comply with the demands, otherwise they could be taken to court.

New blackface admission hits Democrats,"Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring has acknowledged wearing ""brown makeup"" to a party, days after the state governor admitting wearing blackface. The second-in-line to the governor's seat said in a statement on Wednesday that he wore a costume to a party when he was 19 years old at university. Mr Herring had joined calls for Governor Ralph Northam to quit over a racist photo and blackface scandal. The lieutenant governor is meanwhile battling a sex assault claim. All three men are Democrats. If they were to resign over these controversies, Virginia could be led by the Republican Speaker of the House of Delegates, Kirk Cox. Behind the legacy of America's blackface 'There's going to be racism until the day we die' On Wednesday the attorney general confessed that he also once used blackface. Mr Herring said that in 1980, he and his friends donned costumes after ""some friends suggested we attend a party dressed like rappers we listened to at the time, like Kurtis Blow, and perform a song"". ""It sounds ridiculous even now writing it. But because of our ignorance and glib attitudes - and because we did not have an appreciation for the experiences and perspectives of others - we dressed up and put on wigs and brown makeup,"" he said. Ralph Northam's page in the 1984 yearbook of Eastern Virginia Medical School ""That conduct clearly shows that, as a young man, I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behaviour could inflict on others."" Mr Herring did not offer to step down and wrote of his ""efforts to empower communities of colour"" and ""to combat the rise in hate crimes and white supremacist violence that is plaguing our Commonwealth and our country"".

On Saturday, Mr Herring joined a chorus of fellow Democrats calling on Mr Northam to resign after an image surfaced from his 1984 medical yearbook page showing a person in blackface, and another in Ku Klux Klan robes. Mr Northam has denied it was him in the racist photo, but has acknowledged wearing blackface on a separate occasion that year while dressing up as Michael Jackson. Mr Herring said it was ""no longer possible"" for Mr Northam to serve as governor. A Washington Post editorial on Wednesday called on Mr Northam to resign. Virginia Democrats are running out of top officials not beset by scandal. With Attorney General Mark Herring's revelation that he, too, once wore blackface, the situation has metastasised from a controversy ensnaring one man - Governor Northam - to an indication of a larger problem. Cruel, intolerant actions that were once considered acceptable, at least among a certain crowd, are now, decades later, having political consequences. In her response to the president's State of the Union address on Tuesday night, Stacey Abrams - the black woman who narrowly lost her bid to be Georgia's governor - obliquely addressed the issue. ""We continue to confront racism from our past and in our present, which is why we must hold everyone from the highest offices to our own families accountable for racist words and deeds and call racism what it is, wrong,"" she said. Virginians - and Democrats across the US - are now grappling with racist deeds within their own family. It has thrown the state's leadership into turmoil. Accountability, however, could be harder to realise. The cold political reality is that the more top politicians are touched, the less likely it is any of them will go. US governor in racism row refuses to quit Virginia governor's deputy denies assault As the blackface scandal engulfed the governor's mansion, many Democrats said his deputy, Lt Governor Justin Fairfax, should take over. But since Sunday Mr Fairfax has been denying a woman's claim that he sexually assaulted her 15 years ago. On Wednesday, Vanessa Tyson came forward to recount the alleged assault in disturbing detail through a statement issued by her lawyers. Now a California college professor, she says Mr Fairfax forced her to perform a sex act on him during the 2004 Democratic political convention in Boston. Prof Tyson said he had invited her back to his hotel room during the political jamboree to retrieve some documents. This video can not be played Governor Northam: I am not the person in that photo While in the suite, she says, they kissed. But, her statement adds, ""what began as consensual kissing quickly turned into an assault"". ""I cannot believe, given my obvious distress, that Mr Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual,"" she said of their encounter. ""After the assault, I suffered from both deep humiliation and shame."" On Wednesday, Mr Fairfax said reading her statement had been ""painful"", but insisted he was innocent. His office meanwhile denied an NBC report that he used an expletive-laden outburst in reference to Prof Tyson, during a private meeting on Monday night.

Best-selling author lied about cancer,"Dan Mallory went straight to number one on the New York Times best-seller list Dan Mallory, author of the best-selling The Woman in the Window, has admitted to lying about having brain cancer. Mallory, who wrote the thriller under the pseudonym AJ Finn, said he claimed to have had cancer as a way to disguise his struggles with bipolar disorder. His admission comes aftera New Yorker profile,externalaccused him of a history of lies about his personal life. The US author told the magazine it was ""never the goal"" to ""take advantage of anyone else's goodwill"". Mallory was a book editor before The Woman in the Window, his debut novel, was published in January 2018. It debuted at number one on the New York Times best-seller list. A film adaptation of the book, about a woman with agoraphobia who begins spying on her new neighbours, is out later this year, starring Amy Adams and Gary Oldman. Mallory's debut novel has sold more than two million copies The New Yorker claimed Mallory had repeatedly said he had been diagnosed with brain cancer, including in a university application and to colleagues while working at publishing houses in London and New York. The article also alleged that he said his mother died of cancer and his brother also died. Although his mother did have cancer when Mallory was a teenager, she and his brother are both alive. In response to the New Yorker piece, the author wrote: ""It is the case that on numerous occasions in the past, I have stated, implied, or allowed others to believe that I was afflicted with a physical malady instead of a psychological one: cancer, specifically. ""My mother battled aggressive breast cancer starting when I was a teenager; it was the formative experience of my adolescent life, synonymous with pain and panic. I felt intensely ashamed of my psychological struggles - they were my scariest, most sensitive secret."" He said he was ""utterly terrified of what people would think of me if they knew"" about his mental health problems, and would think he was ""defective"" or would not believe him. ""Dissembling seemed the easier path."" He added that ""like many afflicted with severe bipolar II disorder, I experienced crushing depressions, delusional thoughts, morbid obsessions and memory problems"". He continued: ""It's been horrific, not least because, in my distress, I did or said or believed things I would never ordinarily say, or do, or believe - things of which, in many instances, I have absolutely no recollection. ""With the benefit of hindsight, I'm sorry to have taken, or be seen to have taken, advantage of anyone else's goodwill, however desperate the circumstances; that was never the goal."" His agent confirmed the statement to BBC News. A spokesman for HarperCollins UKtold The Bookseller:,external""We don't comment on the personal lives of our employees or authors. Professionally, Dan was a highly valued editor and the publication The Woman in the Window - a Sunday Times bestseller - speaks for itself.""

Crash driver 'swerved to avoid octopus',"Twitter users asked if the driver would be ""facing the long arms of the law"" A driver who swerved ""to avoid an octopus"" before crashing has been arrested on suspicion of drug-driving. Police were called to the A381 between Malborough and South Milton in Devon, where they found a vehicle upside-down in a ditch on Tuesday evening. The 49-year-old driver was checked over by paramedics before being arrested. Officers, who tweeted about the incident, said they found no evidence of an octopus on the road. Octopuses are not unheard of in the seas off the south coast of England, but this particular cephalopod would have had to crawl more than 3 miles (5km) over hills and fields to find itself in the path of a car on the A381. Police said they found no evidence of an octopus on the A381 between Malborough and South Milton A spokeswoman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: ""He did a bit of a slow roll into a ditch. ""An ambulance went out and the driver was checked over by paramedics but there weren't injuries enough to go to hospital.""

And I still do,â John Humphrys tells Radio 4's World at One about his decision to le Speaking to his former Today co-presenter Sarah Montague on The World at One, Humphrys said he would miss the show's listeners the most, adding: ""You do feel that you have a relationship with a huge number of people."" Asked what he would do after leaving, Humphrys cryptically announced: ""I like trees. I want to get more involved in trees."" Today editor Sarah Sands said she hoped listeners would ""enjoy John's lap of honour this year"". Sands, who has edited Today since 2017, said of the presenter: ""He is the Today programme patriarch but also, even now, the little boy who throws stones. ""He is deeply suspicious of power.

Kvitova tells court of knife attack horror,"Petra Kvitova testified via video link at Brno Regional Court Australian Open finalist Petra Kvitova has given graphic testimony at the trial of the man accused of stabbing her in her home in the Czech Republic. She suffered damage to ligaments and tendons in her playing left hand when fighting off an intruder in 2016. The star had surgery and returned to tennis five months after the attack. ""There was blood all over the place,"" she said via video-link to avoid being in the same room as the suspect, who denies the allegations. The suspect, 33-year-old Radim Zondra, faces 12 years in prison if convicted. He is currently serving another prison sentence for a separate offence. His colleagues have said in court that at the time of the incident, in December 2016, he was at work. She said the suspect rang the doorbell and she allowed him to enter as she was expecting a doping test. She said he claimed he had come to inspect the boiler. This video can not be played July 2017: Petra Kvitova 'had flashbacks' after knife attack but has 'won her fight' by being at Wimbledon While checking the hot water in the bathroom, Zondra allegedly grabbed Kvitova from behind before holding a knife to her throat. In a struggle to free herself, the knife badly injured her left hand. She said she offered Zondra money to leave, and he accepted some 10,000 Czech crowns (Â£341; $440). Her tendons, fingers and nerves were damaged, resulting in a four-hour surgery.

Stansted 15 protesters spared jail,"Members of the Stansted 15 gathered outside Chelmsford Crown Court ahead of their sentencing Fifteen protesters who chained themselves to a plane to stop it deporting people to Africa have avoided immediate jail sentences. Dubbed the Stansted 15, the group broke through a fence at the airport in a bid to reach the jet taking 60 people to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. They were found guilty of endangering the safety of an aerodrome. Three were given suspended jail terms and 12 received community orders at Chelmsford Crown Court. The group has said they will appeal against their convictions, which they believe have serious implications for the freedom to protest. They used bolt cutters to enter Stansted Airport and attached themselves to the Boeing 767 using tubes and expanding foam on 28 March 2017. The runway was closed for more than an hour and 23 incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports. This video can not be played Stansted 15 'relieved' to avoid jail Passing sentence, Judge Christopher Morgan told the 15 that while he accepted the group were seeking to demonstrate in support of their cause, they had come ""perilously close"" to causing a catastrophe. He said: ""In normal circumstances only a normal custodial sentence would have been justified in this case, but in your case I accept that your intentions were to demonstrate."" ""There is no doubt that you understood that there were safety implications,"" he added. ""You put at risk the safe operations of the airport and the persons who were there on the night."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC Home Affairs correspondent In court, the judge faced some tough arguments from a top human rights barrister about his duties to balance the question of airport security with the need to protect freedom of speech and assembly. Judge Morgan said he did this through tempering his sentences - in other circumstances, he said, he would have jailed the lot of them. Some of the defendants looked jubilant and defiant. Others looked like defendants often do: exhausted by the process, somewhat remorseful and promising never to do it again. So if the Court of Appeal decides not to examine the convictions, this prosecution will stand as a warning to others of the type of charge they could face for endangering an airport. Read more from Dominic here A large crowd gathered outside the court in support of the Stansted 15 Three of the defendants, Edward Thacker, Alistair Tamlit and Melanie Strickland were given nine-month jail sentences, suspended for 18 months. The other 12 received 12-month community orders, with 11 of them ordered to carry out unpaid work. All 15 were convicted on 10 December last year under the 1990 Aviation and Maritime Security Act, which was brought in after the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. The Stansted 15 have said they will appeal their convictions The defendants had said they were being prosecuted under the ""little known"" legislation, originally devised to combat terrorism and hjijacking. In a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service said it was never suggested to the jury that any of the 15 were terrorists. Prosecutor Tony Badenoch said the Crown would not be recouping the financial deficit caused by the protest; estimated to be more than Â£1m. New mother Emma Hughes, who gave birth between being convicted and sentenced, said the group were ""massively relieved"" none of them would be going to jail. She said: ""It is a massive vindication of what we did. There are 11 people still in the UK because of the action we took.  Three of them have now been granted leave to remain; there is one man here who would have been separated from his family and is now here with his family. We are going to keep fighting until we get these convictions overturned."" Hundreds of people turned out to a demonstration outside the court, with crowds singing, clapping and waving banners. The courtroom was packed for the hearing, with extra space created in the public gallery and all seats filled. The 15 sentenced are: Helen Brewer, 29; Ferme Park Road, London. Lyndsay Burtonshaw, 28; Upper Lewes Road, Brighton. Nathan Clack, 30; Ferme Park Road, London. Laura Clayson, 28; Brownswood Road, London. Melanie Evans, 35; Vicarage Road, London.

'Universal Credit nearly left me homeless',"Lisa Dunnington says she was out of debt before Universal Credit but now owes the council more than Â£1,000 in rent A mother of three says she has nearly been made homeless twice in two years due to the new Universal Credit benefits system. Lisa Dunnington says the new system, which rolls six benefits into one, has pushed her into debt. Citizens Advice says Lisa's story is not unusual, with half of the people it helps with the system struggling to pay rent or mortgages. The government says there is no single reason why rent arrears build up. Single mums win universal credit challenge 'I struggle to get by on universal credit' Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? Lisa, from York, says despite being in debt most of her life, she had been debt-free before moving on to Universal Credit. But she says she now owes York City Council over Â£1,000 in unpaid rent. ""Since I've got on Universal Credit last year, I've nearly lost my house twice and then I just end up in debt again."" She added: ""I've tried building a home for me and my kids for years and years. ""And for it to be nearly ripped away from you when you've tried to better yourself by getting a job and things like that - you just wake up and think 'what's the point?'"" Ms Dunnington is being helped by debt charity Christians Against Poverty (CAP). CAP spokeswoman Rachel Gregory said: ""We are seeing some of our clients being issued with eviction notices due to the wait for their universal credit, which causes lots of stress and worry for that person."" A spokeswoman for York City Council, which is Ms Dunnington's landlord, said it was working with the government to support people on universal credit. The government says Universal Credit was designed to make claiming benefits simpler and help people to get back into work. More than 1.5 million people in the UK now receive the payment. But new Citizens Advice analysis, using 190,000 people the organisation helped between July and September 2018, suggested many people were struggling due to the means-tested benefit. Its report, Managing Money on Universal Credit, found: 49% people the charity helped were in rent arrears or fell behind on their mortgage payments while waiting for their first payment 60% of people it helped are taking out advances while they wait for payment 24% of the people it helped with Universal Credit were also seeking debt advice. Among the people the charity helps with debt and Universal Credit: 47% said they have no money left after essential living costs such as food, housing and transport to pay creditors, or are spending more than comes in 82% hold what Citizens Advice classes as ""priority debt"" such as council tax, rent arrears or mortgage payments, and energy debts Four years ago, councils in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland were owed around Â£250m by tenants. Last year that figure had grown by 27% to Â£315m, a review of government figures by the BBC has found. The Welsh government does not collect comparable figures. Richard Watts from the Local Government Association says the situation will only get worse. ""I fear that there's a great risk the trajectory of increasing rent arrears continues as Universal Credit gets rolled out across the country"", he said. Homeless charity Shelter said the ""shambolic"" changes to the welfare system had led to a ""dire housing emergency"" in the UK. Chief executive Polly Neate, said: ""The Government urgently needs to get Universal Credit fit for purpose before rolling it out any further, as well as bringing up housing benefit and local housing allowance rates so people can actually afford their rents. ""Alongside this, it needs to ramp up social housing building so families will have a chance of a stable, affordable home."" The system has proved controversial almost from its inception, with reports of IT issues, massive overspends, administrative problems and delays to the scheme's rollout. In January, two high court judges ruled the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)was wrongly interpreting universal credit regulations. Four working single mothers argued a ""fundamental problem"" with the system meant their monthly payments varied ""enormously"", leaving them out of pocket and struggling financially. A DWP spokesman said: ""Most people on Universal Credit are happy managing their money, but budgeting support is available for anyone who needs extra help. ""Many people join Universal Credit with existing rent arrears, but this falls by a third after four months. ""We will continue to work closely with Citizens Advice and other stakeholders to develop our approach in order to provide the best possible support for all of our claimants.""

Arrest over 'shocking' football violence,"There was a strong police presence at the game, which Millwall won 3-2 An arrest has been made after a man was slashed across the face during a brawl between Millwall and Everton fans. The victim has a ""life-changing"" scar as a result of the attack, before an FA Cup tie in London on 26 January. A 27-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of wounding with intent, attempted grievous bodily harm, and violent disorder. The Metropolitan Policedescribed the brawl as ""some of the most shocking football violence seen for some time"". The suspect has been bailed to return to a central London police station on 28 February. Det Sgt Matt Simpson said the disorder involved dozens of people and lasted for a number of hours. ""We have hours of CCTV and hundreds of images which we are closely reviewing, and we have a team of experts working to identify those involved,"" he said. Trouble between fans started in the Hawkstone Road area of Southwark, near Millwall's stadium The Den. A police officer was among the injured and the Met said a number of coaches carrying Everton fans were damaged. Because the violence happened outside Millwall's stadium the Football Association said it would not be investigating. The match,which Millwall won 3-2, was also marred by allegations of racist chanting.

Woman 'wanted drugs trip on YouTube',"Louella Fletcher-Michie was found dead in a wooded area on the edge of the Bestival site A woman who died after taking a Class A drug at a festival urged her boyfriend to film her while she was high and post it on YouTube, a court has heard. Louella Fletcher-Michie, 24, was found dead in woods on the Bestival site in Dorset in September 2017. Boyfriend Ceon Broughton, 29, denies manslaughter and supplying drugs. In his phone footage, Ms Fletcher-Michie - the daughter of Holby City actor John Michie - said she was having the ""best trip I've ever had"". Winchester Crown Court previously heard she had taken a large amount of the Class A drug 2CP at the event held in the grounds of Lulworth Castle. Ceon Broughton could be seen laughing and smiling during the 50-minute video shown to the jury In the 50-minute video, shown to jurors, she shouted: ""This is mad. I'm so happy, the best day of my life. I've taken acid before. This ain't acid. I was not expecting this. ""Mum, I love you. Dad, I love you... I see through everything."" In the video, Ms Fletcher-Michie was seen having a non-stop rant and repeatedly waved her arms and slapped herself. She also urged Mr Broughton to ""make sure this goes on YouTube"" and shouted at him to ""film me"", ""call my mum"" and ""call my brother, call my sister"". At times he appeared to smile as he turned the camera on himself and told her ""it's between me and you"". He also told her to ""put your phone away"" and asked her to turn on airplane mode, which disables calls and messaging, as she talks about contacting her mum. The court has previously heard Ms Fletcher-Michie's family rushed down to the festival site in Dorset from London after contacting Mr Broughton. Ceon Broughton, 29, denies manslaughter and supplying Class A drugs In later recordings on Mr Broughton's phone, Ms Fletcher-Michie made incoherent high-pitched noises and grunts. A male voice told her: ""Stop eating these thorns. You're just going to cut your beautiful skin."" Recordings made after 21:00 BST on 10 September contained loud screams and images of blood-covered hands. The jury was shown an image from the phone of a person, thought to be Ms Fletcher-Michie, lying on the ground with her eyes closed at 23:24. She was found dead by security guards at 01:15 on what would have been her 25th birthday, the court previously heard. Prosecutors have claimed Mr Broughton failed to seek help because he feared breaching a suspended jail sentence. The trial continues.

'Stansted 15' protesters avoid jail,"Members of the Stansted 15 gathered outside Chelmsford Crown Court ahead of their sentencing Fifteen protesters who chained themselves to a plane to stop it deporting people to Africa have avoided immediate jail sentences. Dubbed the Stansted 15, the group broke through a fence at the airport in a bid to reach the jet taking 60 people to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. They were found guilty of endangering the safety of an aerodrome. Three were given suspended jail terms and 12 received community orders at Chelmsford Crown Court. The group has said they will appeal against their convictions, which they believe have serious implications for the freedom to protest. They used bolt cutters to enter Stansted Airport and attached themselves to the Boeing 767 using tubes and expanding foam on 28 March 2017. The runway was closed for more than an hour and 23 incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports. This video can not be played Stansted 15 'relieved' to avoid jail Passing sentence, Judge Christopher Morgan told the 15 that while he accepted the group were seeking to demonstrate in support of their cause, they had come ""perilously close"" to causing a catastrophe. He said: ""In normal circumstances only a normal custodial sentence would have been justified in this case, but in your case I accept that your intentions were to demonstrate."" ""There is no doubt that you understood that there were safety implications,"" he added. ""You put at risk the safe operations of the airport and the persons who were there on the night."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC Home Affairs correspondent In court, the judge faced some tough arguments from a top human rights barrister about his duties to balance the question of airport security with the need to protect freedom of speech and assembly. Judge Morgan said he did this through tempering his sentences - in other circumstances, he said, he would have jailed the lot of them. Some of the defendants looked jubilant and defiant. Others looked like defendants often do: exhausted by the process, somewhat remorseful and promising never to do it again. So if the Court of Appeal decides not to examine the convictions, this prosecution will stand as a warning to others of the type of charge they could face for endangering an airport. Read more from Dominic here A large crowd gathered outside the court in support of the Stansted 15 Three of the defendants, Edward Thacker, Alistair Tamlit and Melanie Strickland were given nine-month jail sentences, suspended for 18 months. The other 12 received 12-month community orders, with 11 of them ordered to carry out unpaid work. All 15 were convicted on 10 December last year under the 1990 Aviation and Maritime Security Act, which was brought in after the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. The Stansted 15 have said they will appeal their convictions The defendants had said they were being prosecuted under the ""little known"" legislation, originally devised to combat terrorism and hjijacking. In a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service said it was never suggested to the jury that any of the 15 were terrorists. Prosecutor Tony Badenoch said the Crown would not be recouping the financial deficit caused by the protest; estimated to be more than Â£1m. New mother Emma Hughes, who gave birth between being convicted and sentenced, said the group were ""massively relieved"" none of them would be going to jail. She said: ""It is a massive vindication of what we did. There are 11 people still in the UK because of the action we took.  Three of them have now been granted leave to remain; there is one man here who would have been separated from his family and is now here with his family. We are going to keep fighting until we get these convictions overturned."" Hundreds of people turned out to a demonstration outside the court, with crowds singing, clapping and waving banners. The courtroom was packed for the hearing, with extra space created in the public gallery and all seats filled. The 15 sentenced are: Helen Brewer, 29; Ferme Park Road, London. Lyndsay Burtonshaw, 28; Upper Lewes Road, Brighton. Nathan Clack, 30; Ferme Park Road, London. Laura Clayson, 28; Brownswood Road, London. Melanie Evans, 35; Vicarage Road, London.

Donald Trump set for second visit to UK,"US President Donald Trump's first official visit to the UK took place in July 2018 US President Donald Trump is expected to visit the UK in December for a Nato summit, the alliance's secretary general has said. Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement that ""the Allies have agreed"" to meet to discuss security challenges and how Nato can adapt to keep people safe. Theresa May said it would be an ""important opportunity"" to modernise. Mr Trump's controversial first official trip to the UK took place in July 2018, amid a backdrop of angry protests. The US president met the Queen at Windsor Castle and held talks with the prime minister at Chequers, while thousands of people marched through central London in protest at his visit. The police operation for the visitcost an estimated Â£18m, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council. The announcement of Mr Trump's December trip led the Liberal Democrats to say they would be ""front and centre to protest his visit"", while the Green Party tweeted ""we'll be there to greet him"". Trump's UK visit: Nine key moments In pictures: Trump's visit and protests Trump baby blimp launched in London The US president, who has repeatedly criticised the military alliance, will meet heads of state in London - the home of Nato's first headquarters. Theresa May said: ""The UK is one of the founding members of Nato and I am very pleased that the secretary general has asked us to host a meeting of Nato leaders this year to mark its 70th anniversary"". Mr Stoltenberg said the UK continues to play a key role in the alliance, making ""essential contributions to our shared security"". Mr Trump has previouslyurged Nato to commit 4% of its annual output (GDP) to military spending- double the current target. On Tuesday, he said in his State of the Union address that the US had been ""treated very unfairly by friends of ours, members of Nato"" over a period of years. The announcement came as Nato states signed anagreement with Macedonia, clearing the way for the Balkan nation to become its 30th member. Meanwhile, Mr Trump announced in his State of the Union speech that he will hold asecond nuclear summit with North Korea's leader this month. Plans for a second summit have been in the works since the two leaders' historic talks last year. Mr Trump and Mr Kim's meeting last June in Singapore was the first ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader.

Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said parts of the building are likely to collapse Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said about 70 firefighters remained at the site and urged nearby residents to keep doors and windows shut. Chief fire officer Neil Odin said the initial small fire had taken a ""dramatic turn"" early on Wednesday morning and firefighters had to be withdrawn. ""This building is not meant for humans to be interacting with the racking and the storage - it has robots moving racking on to loading bays, so for firefighters trying to get in that high and to make an effective fire-fighting strategy, it has been very difficult,"" he said.

Major government contractor in rescue deal,"Interserve holds the contract for cleaning Network Rail stations Interserve - one of the UK's largest providers of public services - has reached a deal with creditors to prevent its collapse. The rescue plan involves cutting its debts from over Â£600m to Â£275m by issuing new shares. Chief executive Debbie White said it was ""a significant step forward in our plans to strengthen the balance sheet"". Interserve sells services, including probation, cleaning and healthcare, and is involved in construction projects. ""The board believes that this agreement will secure a strong future for Interserve,"" Ms White added. The firm - a major government contractor - plans to issue Â£480m worth of new shares, which will be swapped with creditors for debt, leaving existing shareholders with virtually nothing. Under the rescue deal, Interserve will also keep its most profitable division, its RMD Kwikform construction business, loading Â£350m of debt onto its balance sheet. The firm had considered spinning the unit off to its lenders to raise money. Interserve has a market value of Â£17m, down from Â£500m in 2017, and a turnover of Â£3.2bn. About 70% of Interserve's turnover comes from government contracts. Stephen Rawlinson, an analyst at Applied Value, said that Interserve's woes are not as bad those of fellow outsourcer Carillion, which collapsed in January 2018 andput thousands of jobs at risk and cost taxpayers Â£148m. ""For existing shareholders, they're between a rock and a hard place, they have been for the last six to 12 months, so there's no difference, but now there is hope,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think another Carillion is likely, as the government has realised that to put these companies into liquidation is a very foolish thing to do."" However, he warned that the deal had not yet been approved by shareholders, and that it would probably take up to seven years before Interserve returned to profitability. This is the second rescue deal for Interserve, with the company refinancing its debt in March last year. Its troubles have been blamed on cancellations and delays in its construction contracts as well as struggling waste-to-energy projects in Derby and Glasgow. The firm's shares have plunged over the past year, currently trading at around 13p each. Just over a year ago, the shares were worth 100p each. Interserve rescue plan prompts share collapse Interserve shares dive on fears for future Government reassures over Interserve Following Carillion's collapse, the government launched a pilot of ""living wills"" for contractors, so that critical services can be taken over in the event of a crisis. Interserve is one of five suppliers taking part. In a separate statement, shareholder Coltrane Master Fund, which holds over a 5% stake in Interserve, has asked the firm to remove eight directors. The Interserve rescue deal will leave existing shareholders with virtually nothing It requested two other individuals be appointed as directors, but reiterated its support for Ms White as chief executive of the outsourcing provider. From its origins in dredging and construction, the company has diversified into wide range of services, such as health care and catering, for clients in government and industry. At King George Hospital in east London, for instance, Interserve has a Â£35m contract for cleaning, security, meals, waste management and maintenance. Its infrastructure projects include improving the M5 Junction 6 near Worcester, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water. But Interserve is also the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 ""medium-low risk offenders"" for the Ministry of Justice.

Trump and Kim Jong-un to meet again,"This video can not be played An eye-roll, a chant  and an unexpected ovation US President Donald Trump has announced in his State of the Union speech that he will hold a second nuclear summit with North Korea's leader this month. In an address to the nation with the theme ""Choosing Greatness"", he vowed once again to build a border wall. While appealing for political unity, the Republican president also said ""ridiculous partisan investigations"" could damage US prosperity. In a rebuttal, Democrats accused Mr Trump of abandoning US values. His primetime address came less than a fortnight after he backed down to end the longest ever US government shutdown when Democrats refused to fund a US-Mexico border wall. Fact-checking Trump's speech to Congress The Pelosi Clap and other curious talking points Federal agencies could close again if no spending plan is agreed by the end of next week. The president said in his 82-minute speech on Tuesday night that he would meet Kim Jong-un in Vietnam from 27-28 February. ""Much work remains to be done,"" Mr Trump said, ""but my relationship with Kim Jong-un is a good one."" Plans for a second summit have been in the works since the two leaders' historic talks last year. Mr Trump and Mr Kim's meeting last June in Singapore was the first ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. While Pyongyang has not conducted any atomic or ballistic missile tests since last summer, it has yet to agree to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme. The US envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, is in Pyongyang for talks,paving the way for the second leadership summit. Key challenges at second Trump-Kim summit When Trump met Kim: What happened next? Trump vows to end China's job 'theft' This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on Analysis by Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul Mr Trump's goal will be to extract pledges from Kim Jong-un without giving too much ground. The Trump administration has said it is not willing to lift sanctions, but it has mentioned helping out the North's economy. However, handing over such aid to a secretive state which has yet to declare a list of its weapons facilities or allow in independent inspectors is bound to raise more than eyebrows. So Mr Trump has to extract a written pledge from Mr Kim. Otherwise these summits will be seen as all show, and very little substance. As for Mr Kim's bargaining chips, we have been told he could be prepared to give up his nuclear production site known as Yongbyon. I've also been told by some sources close to Pyongyang that Mr Kim does want to achieve something his father and grandfather never did. A peace treaty. The prospect of becoming the US president who ended the 68-year long Korean War is bound to be a tantalising one for Mr Trump. After two years of rancorous partisanship, Mr Trump on Tuesday night repeated calls for political unity that he has made in his last two annual speeches to Congress. ""Together, we can break decades of political stalemate,"" he said. ""We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions."" Mr Trump raised potential areas of agreement, such as infrastructure improvements, lowering prescription drug costs and fighting childhood cancer. But he added: ""An economic miracle is taking place in the United States and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations."" Democrats have launched a flurry of inquiries into the Trump administration since they took over the US House of Representatives last month. This video can not be played ""You weren't supposed to do that!"" - Trump and Democratic women share an unexpected moment of unity A special prosecutor is still investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, which the president and Moscow deny. As Mr Trump delivered his nationally televised speech, his chief congressional antagonist was sitting at the rostrum over his shoulder. The Democratic leader of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, tweeted afterwards: ""It will take days to fact-check all the misrepresentations that the president made tonight."" Pride of place for a boy called Trump Donald Trump set for second visit to UK A photo of Nancy Pelosi clapping after Mr Trump's address has gone viral It was a speech that was billed as bipartisan, but beneath the flowery language were the same sharp divides and disagreements. Mr Trump has never really acknowledged his party's ballot-box defeat in the mid-term elections last November. By instigating the recently concluded government shutdown, he acted like he still had the political upper hand - even when it was clear to almost everyone that this was not the case. So this State of the Union address presented a quandary. How can a president reconcile himself to divided government while still asserting that everything is going great for him? For this president, the answer was to effectively shrug at the setbacks. To focus his message, where it counted, towards his political base. And to stick with the message that won him the presidency in 2016 and, he appears to believe, will keep him in the White House for another term next year. Five takeaways from Trump's speech This video can not be played Stacey Abrams delivered the Democratic response to President Trump Stacey Abrams, who lost her race last year to be governor of Georgia, delivered the Democrats' response to Mr Trump. She was the first African-American woman to give the party's rebuttal. Ms Abrams said: ""The shutdown was a stunt engineered by the president of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people - but our values."" She also said that while she is ""disappointed"" with Mr Trump, ""I still don't want him to fail."" Democratic female lawmakers who attended Mr Trump's speech wore white to celebrate the 100th anniversary of American women gaining the right to vote. They sat stony-faced as their Republican counterparts rose for the applause lines. But Democrats surprised Mr Trump with a standing ovation when he said there were more women in the workforce and in Congress than ever before. ""That's great!"" said the president, delighted by their reaction. ""Really great."" US First Lady Melania Trump (R) waves as Ivanka Trump (L) looks on Mr Trump said his administration was holding ""constructive talks"" with the Taliban to find a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan. ""The hour has come to at least try for peace,"" he added. The president also said ""virtually all"" of the territory once occupied in Syria and Iraq by the Islamic State group had been liberated from ""these bloodthirsty monsters"". ""It is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home,"" he told the chamber. He said 7,000 US troops had died and more than $7tn (Â£5.4tn) had been spent by America on nearly two decades of war in the Middle East. ""Great nations do not fight endless wars,"" said the president, who campaigned on an 'America First' platform. The president devoted much of his speech to border security, vowing once again to build a US-Mexico barrier and calling illegal immigration ""an urgent national crisis"". But he refrained from declaring a national emergency that might allow him to bypass Congress for wall funding. With another government shutdown deadline impending on 15 February, the president has few options to deliver his signature campaign promise. Mr Trump told his audience that working-class Americans pay the price for illegal immigration. At the scene - By Tara McKelvey, BBC News Despite the president's call for unity, the reception from Democrats was frosty for most of the evening. Meanwhile, Republicans shouted their approval - especially when Mr Trump talked about the wall along the southern border. When the president said: ""The state of our union is strong"", members of his party stood and chanted: ""USA!"" The Democrats stayed seated. But then the mood changed. As the president noted the record number of women in Congress, Democrats gave a standing ovation - and they began shouting: ""USA!"" Republicans joined in - they all chanted together. Bitter adversaries experienced a rare, happy moment of togetherness. And the president was right in the middle of it.

Kuenssberg: May's task,"Theresa May at a community centre in Belfast on Tuesday evening ""It's not good enough to come back next week and say that the negotiations are ongoing,"" a senior Cabinet minister warned. But will the prime minister's travels this week do more than just keep the show on the road? Today she's in Northern Ireland meeting the different political parties, including the DUP - whose votes she needs in Parliament - who are totally opposed to the current version of the controversial backstop, as well as Sinn Fein, who are just as adamant that it must remain. Then on Thursday, Theresa May will be in Brussels, asking - again - for the EU to amend the policy, seeking either a time limit or a legal upgrade to the promise that both sides will only use it if they really, really, really have to, and they don't expect it to last forever. In short, today's a chance for the PM to test out what she'll ask for, tomorrow, an opportunity to sell it as hard as she can in Brussels. Remember, she has asked for these changes before and been turned down. And she's heard before from both sides in Northern Ireland how dug in their positions are. So can she do anything other than take one more turn around the same carousel while the clock ticks down? PM in Belfast for Brexit deadlock talks New ideas for the Brexit border backstop Brexit: All you need to know The difference on her travels this time is that it's not just the prime minister pleading with the EU to budge, warning that this deal hypothetically might not wash. It's the first time she'll meet the EU top brass since the plan that she agreed with them was thumpingly rejected by Parliament. And the first time too she has some evidence to show that the deal could, in theory, pass through the Commons if the backstop was eventually changed. That's what last week's drama was all about - the so-called Brady amendment (which already feels a lifetime ago) passing Parliament paved the way for the prime minister to have another go at getting changes because it allows her to say to the EU, ""look, all those grumpy MPs could come on board, if only you are willing to give me this one thing - I know that you have said no in multiple languages, but it is the only way this is going to work"". That's why today will also be important for the Irish leader, who has his own talks in Brussels. Until now, Leo Varadkar has staked his political reputation on sticking to the backstop. Don't hold your breath for any signs of concessions from him later. One source said they wouldn't be likely to move until the ""92nd minute"". But with the risk of no-deal looming larger, by simple virtue of time marching on, perhaps behind closed doors the EU's dealmakers are looking for ways out. That's why this week, for example, Martin Selymayr did discuss with MPs whether they could accept a souped-up legal version of promises that have already been made. That's not the same as putting it on the table as an official proposal of course. But the fact that such a conversation has taken place matters. It seems rather optimistic though that, by the end of tomorrow, the prime minister will have conclusive proof that those kinds of noises-off make a concrete deal, or that the legal fixes being proposed by the Attorney General at home have been convincingly signed off by the EU. And all the while a group of Remainers and Brexiteers are working with government officials on their hoped-for alternative, the so-called Malthouse Compromise. While a tweaked deal with the EU could get some reluctant Brexiteers on board, some are hardening around the idea that it has to be this plan now, or there won't be a plan they can back at all. One key member of the powerful ERG group of Tory Brexiteer MPs told me this is ""the only show in town"", claiming that if No 10 doesn't ultimately buy their plan -which you can read about here- then the government could fall. That's quite a threat to wave around. No 10 is trying to maintain the idea that this could be the route they follow. The simple truth is they need the votes of those MPs who back it. But it's clear in the first instance that No 10 is trying to change the backstop in the deal they have sweated over for two years, rather than make a more significant shift. What Theresa May might need from the next 48 hours though is proof that the EU could move in her direction. Evidence to present back to Parliament next week that, while there might not be a deal fresh with wet ink, there is at least a proposal that's being taken seriously, that paves the way for another vote on a government-friendly amendment that can be used to signify numbers moving in her direction. If she comes back with nothing at all to show, nor any encouragement for those strongly pushing for change, then in her colleague's words, it might ""not be good enough"" at all.

Brexit: Donald Tusk's planned outburst,"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: ""Special place in hell"" for those without Brexit plan They weren't off-the-cuff remarks, but a planned outburst. The softly-spoken politician who holds the authority of all EU countries has just completely condemned a chunk of the British cabinet, wondering aloud: ""What that special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit, without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely"". Sure, for a long time the EU has been frustrated with how the UK has approached all of this. And sure, plenty of voters in the UK are annoyed too at how politicians have been handling these negotiations. But it is quite something for Donald Tusk to have gone in like this, studs up, even though he sometimes reminisces about his time as a football hooligan in his youth. Be clear, he was not intending to talk about voters who wanted to Leave, but politicians who were involved in the campaign. Tusk: Place in hell for no-plan Brexiteers PM in Belfast for Brexit deadlock talks New ideas for the Brexit border backstop Brexit: All you need to know He also had pretty stern remarks for those who'd been on the other side of the argument, accusing those who still want the UK to stay in the EU of having ""no political force, and no effective leadership"". Mr Tusk will be all too aware that he will provoke tempers at home, even laughing about it as he left the stage with the Taoiseach, the Irish leader, Leo Varadkar. But if you strip away the planned flash of temper, also in his remarks was an invitation to the prime minister to come forward with a different version of the backstop - a ""believable guarantee"", a promise that a ""common solution is possible"". That is, on the face of it, in tone at least, more of an opening to the UK to put something new on the table than we have seen from the EU side. Certainly, Theresa May's most pressing job is to put something that could work on the table in Belfast, and in Brussels, and to do it fast. But don't forget, also at her back, she has Brexiteers whom she needs to manage, whose expectations she needs to contain, whose votes she desperately needs. And at a time when cool tempers and compromise are absolutely needed, Mr Tusk's remarks are likely to whip up the mood instead.

Disability-themed emojis approved for use,"The introduction of dozens of new accessibility-themed emojis has been welcomed by disability rights campaigners. The new characters,externalinclude hearing aids, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, white ""probing"" canes and guide dogs. They follow a complaint by Apple that few existing emojis spoke to the experiences of those with disabilities. Their inclusion in 2019's official list means many smartphones should gain them in the second half of the year. ""Social media is hugely influential and it's great to see these new disability-inclusive emojis,"" said Phil Talbot, from the disability charity Scope. ""Up to now, disability has been greatly underrepresented. ""We'd also like to see greater representation of disabled people and disability across all parts of the media and social media."" A total of 230 new emojis feature in what is the sixth major update to the official list. It is maintained by a California-based group made up of representatives of computing companies, software developers and others, who ensure that users of different devices and apps can send emojis to each other. Apple wants to introduce new emojis for disabled people Could an emoji save your life? Emojis that are rarely used The various platform owners - including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Facebook and Twitter - can tweak Unicode's designs to their own liking but are supposed to ensure that each character remains recognisable from one product to another. The latest approved art includes men and women of different ethnicities using disability aids as well spotlighting individual products. In addition, men and women are pictured moving a finger between their ear and their mouth, which is used as a deaf sign in American Sign Language. The emojis build on the13 drawings submitted by Apple in March 2018,externalafter it had consulted the American Council of the Blind and the National Association of the Deaf, among other organisations. It had noted that one in seven people around the world had some form of disability. Another notable addition to the emoji library is a drop of blood, which is meant to offer women a new way to talk about menstruation. Its addition follows a campaign by Plan International UK, a girls' rights charity that held an online vote in 2017for what a period-themed emoji should look like,external. The most popular choice was a pair of pants marked by blood but when that was rejected by the Unicode Consortium, the charity pushed for a blood drop instead. ""For years we've obsessively silenced and euphemised periods,"" said Lucy Russell, head of girls' rights at the group. ""An emoji isn't going to solve this but it can help change the conversation. Ending the shame around periods begins with talking about it"". A skunk, parachutist and waffle also join the list Other new images include,external: an otter a flamingo a sari the South American drink mate the Middle Eastern food falafel a ballet shoe a rickshaw a finger-pinching hand Happy 10th birthday, iPhone emoji!

Girl 'wanted festival drugs trip on YouTube',"Louella Fletcher-Michie was found dead in a wooded area on the edge of the Bestival site A woman who died after taking a Class A drug at a festival urged her boyfriend to film her while she was high and post it on YouTube, a court has heard. Louella Fletcher-Michie, 24, was found dead in woods on the Bestival site in Dorset in September 2017. Boyfriend Ceon Broughton, 29, denies manslaughter and supplying drugs. In his phone footage, Ms Fletcher-Michie - the daughter of Holby City actor John Michie - said she was having the ""best trip I've ever had"". Winchester Crown Court previously heard she had taken a large amount of the Class A drug 2CP at the event held in the grounds of Lulworth Castle. Ceon Broughton could be seen laughing and smiling during the 50-minute video shown to the jury In the 50-minute video, shown to jurors, she shouted: ""This is mad. I'm so happy, the best day of my life. I've taken acid before. This ain't acid. I was not expecting this. ""Mum, I love you. Dad, I love you... I see through everything."" In the video, Ms Fletcher-Michie was seen having a non-stop rant and repeatedly waved her arms and slapped herself. She also urged Mr Broughton to ""make sure this goes on YouTube"" and shouted at him to ""film me"", ""call my mum"" and ""call my brother, call my sister"". At times he appeared to smile as he turned the camera on himself and told her ""it's between me and you"". He also told her to ""put your phone away"" and asked her to turn on airplane mode, which disables calls and messaging, as she talks about contacting her mum. The court has previously heard Ms Fletcher-Michie's family rushed down to the festival site in Dorset from London after contacting Mr Broughton. Ceon Broughton, 29, denies manslaughter and supplying Class A drugs In later recordings on Mr Broughton's phone, Ms Fletcher-Michie made incoherent high-pitched noises and grunts. A male voice told her: ""Stop eating these thorns. You're just going to cut your beautiful skin."" Recordings made after 21:00 BST on 10 September contained loud screams and images of blood-covered hands. The jury was shown an image from the phone of a person, thought to be Ms Fletcher-Michie, lying on the ground with her eyes closed at 23:24. She was found dead by security guards at 01:15 on what would have been her 25th birthday, the court previously heard. Prosecutors have claimed Mr Broughton failed to seek help because he feared breaching a suspended jail sentence. The trial continues.

Dementia risks not known by half of people,"Half of UK adults cannot identify any key risk factors for dementia, according to a study by Alzheimer's Research UK. The charity surveyed 2,361 people and found that only 1% were able to name the seven known risk or protective factors for dementia. The six risk factors are heavy drinking, genetics, smoking, high blood pressure, depression and diabetes. Physical exercise is a protective factor against the disease. The study, entitled Dementia Attitudes Monitor,,externalfound that more than half of UK adults now know someone with dementia. But only half recognised that dementia is a cause of death, and they found that a fifth incorrectly believe it is an inevitable part of getting older. Optician's eye test 'could spot early dementia signs' Dementia risk: Five-minute scan 'can predict cognitive decline' Alcohol and dementia: What's the truth? The foods that might help with dementia Although a third of cases of dementia are thought to be influenced by factors within our control, only 34% of people surveyed believe it is possible to reduce the risk of dementia, compared with 77% for heart disease and 81% for diabetes. Hilary Evans, chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK, said that despite growing dementia awareness, there was still a lot of misinformation. ""It is a sad truth that more people are affected by dementia than ever before and half of us now know someone with the condition,"" she said. ""Yet despite growing dementia awareness, we must work harder to improve understanding of the diseases that cause it."" More than 850,000 people in the UK are living with dementia. This number is set to rise to more than one million by 2025. Dementia is an umbrella term for a set of symptoms that affect cognitive function, such as memory loss, confusion and personality change, which get worse over time. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for approximately two-thirds of all cases. An individual's risk of developing dementia is made up of different factors including age, genetics and lifestyle. Source:Alzheimer's Research UK,external Sue Strachan is 63 and lives in Herefordshire. She was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2014. ""I wasn't very fit when I was diagnosed with dementia and my GP advised me to take up exercise to try to manage my condition,"" she said. ""I do wish I'd started earlier, because good heart health can have such a positive impact on the brain. I can see that society's view of dementia is improving, but I still experience misunderstanding about the condition - not least that there's nothing that can be done to help."" Sue ran last year's London Marathon for Alzheimer's Research UK to help raise awareness. The charity said reducing the number of people who believe that dementia is an inevitable part of ageing is ""key"", as ""this belief drives other negative attitudes towards dementia"". ""Our findings show that those who believe dementia is an inevitable part of ageing are less likely to see the value in seeking a formal diagnosis, and are less likely to engage with research developments that could bring about life-changing treatments and ultimately, a cure."" The study found key groups of people whose understanding of dementia is lower, including those from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, and adults under 24 and over 65. There is not currently a test for dementia, but the survey found that if there was a breakthrough in research, 85% would be willing to take a test through their doctor before symptoms showed.

This video can not be played Leadsom on Tusk: ""The man has no manners"" But Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald backed Mr Tusk, arguing that it was the position of ""hardline"" Brexit-supporting MPs like Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg that was ""intemperate"" and ""untenable"". And Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, who supports having another EU referendum, said Mr Tusk was ""absolutely right"" and it was ""painful"" for leading figures in the Leave campaign, such as Boris Johnson and David Davis, ""to have the truth pointed out to them"". Theresa May - who supported the UK staying in the EU during the 2016 EU referendum but has always insisted that Brexit must be delivered because that was what people voted for - is due to arrive in Brussels on Thursday to seek legal changes to the withdrawal deal she signed with the EU. She hopes these changes will help her get it through the UK Parliament. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson saidthe government was likely to publish a new employment billbefore the next vote on Mrs May's deal, with the aim to maximise support for it from Labour MPs. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has set out five demands for his party to support a Brexit deal - calling for them to be enshrined as objectives in domestic law. In a letter to the prime minister, he said Labour wanted a UK-wide customs union, close alignment with the single market, ""dynamic alignment"" on rights and protections, ""clear commitments"" on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes and ""unambiguous agreements"" on the detail of future security arrangements. He said Labour did not believe that ""simply seeking modifications"" to the backstop was a sufficient response. Mr Corbyn added that EU leaders had been clear that changes to the political declaration were possible if a request was made by the UK government ""and if the current red lines change"". By BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming The EU has been absolutely scathing about some of the British political class today. The dam broke on Donald Tusk's pent-up feelings about the leaders of the Leave campaign. The Irish prime minister suggested that MPs either didn't know what they were doing or were misled when they voted to look for alternatives to the Irish backstop. But - and it's a big but - they have all been open to the prime minister coming to Brussels with a solution to break the deadlock. And while Jean-Claude Juncker ruled out the idea of the UK having the right to pull out of the backstop if it were ever needed, he didn't say anything about the other idea doing the rounds - a time limit. Donald Tusk said that the other 27 EU members had decided in December that the withdrawal agreement was ""not open for renegotiation"" - a message echoed by Mr Juncker. Mr Tusk also had a message for Remain supporters in the UK, with 50 days to go until Brexit happens, with a deal or without one, saying: ""I have always been with you, with all my heart"". But he added: ""The facts are unmistakable. At the moment, the pro-Brexit stance of the UK prime minister, and the Leader of the Opposition, rules out this question. ""Today, there is no political force and no effective leadership for Remain. I say this without satisfaction, but you can't argue with the facts."" Please upgrade your browser Mr Tusk said the Irish border issue and the need to preserve the peace process remained the EU's ""top priority"". He hoped Mrs May would ""give us a deliverable guarantee for peace in Northern Ireland and the UK will leave the EU as a trusted friend"" that can command a Commons majority. Mr Varadkar said that while he was ""open to further discussions"" with the UK government about post-Brexit relations, the legally-binding withdrawal agreement remained ""the best deal possible"". And the backstop was needed ""as a legal guarantee to ensure that there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland"". He later said he will meet Theresa May for talks in Dublin on Friday. Jean-Claude Juncker said alternative arrangements - the form of words backed by MPs in a vote last week - ""can never replace the backstop"". Clarification 27 February 2019: While the summary of this story and opening paragraph made clear that Mr Tusk was referring to a specific group of people - those who promoted Brexit without a plan - the original headlines were misleading and so were amended shortly after publication on 6 February.

The Pelosi Clap and a wonky tie,"A photo of Nancy Pelosi clapping after Mr Trump's address has gone viral As US President Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union address to Congress, many people took to social media to discuss the event. Among the political analysis and partisan debate, a number of altogether more light-hearted talking points came up. It is perhaps unsurprising that Nancy Pelosi became the subject of one of the most popular memes on the night. The new House Speaker, de facto leader of the Democratic Party, sat behind President Trump during his address and is one of the most high-profile opponents of the president. Many on social media thought this political rivalry was captured in a photo of Ms Pelosi applauding after Mr Trump called for compromise in politics. The image, termed the ""Pelosi clap"", quickly went viral. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Fact-checking Trump's speech,"US President Donald Trump's speech was filled with praise for the strong economy. But did his numbers add up? This is exaggerated. Last year, average hourly earnings increased by 85 cents, or 3.2%,according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,external. This isn't the highest for decades though; it's the highest since 2009. The wage growth does not take into account inflation (that's the rate at which prices for goods and services increases). The current inflation rate is 1.9% for the 12 months ending on December 2018, according to the US Labor Department. This is another exaggeration. From Jan 2017 to Jan 2019, the US added 4.9 million jobs in total, including 454,000 in manufacturing, according to theBureau of Labor Statistics,external(BLS). The president appears to have inflated his numbers by going from the date of the 2016 election, rather than the date he assumed office. However, the economy is growing under the Trump administration - a trend that began under President Barack Obama. This is true. In May 2018, unemployment for African Americans fell to 5.9%, the lowest figure since the 1970s (when the BLS started breaking down the figures by race). This followed on from a similar trend under the Obama administration. It was recorded as 6.8% in January 2019. Some US media have highlighted someimportant caveats,external: The figures tend to be volatile and vary from month to month The rate is still statistically higher than for other ethnic groups This is true. Many other countries directly negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to regulate the prices. The US spent $1,443 per capita on pharmaceutical costs in 2016, compared to a range of $466 to $939 in 10 other high income countries, including the UK, Australia, Canada and Japan, according toa study in the Journal of the American Medical Association,external. Both Democrats and Republicans want to reduce the costs. True - according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), an independent energy statistical agency - it is the leading global oil and natural gas producer. Output has risen beyond Russia and Saudi Arabia, which have been limiting production to boost prices. The International Energy Agency predicts that by 2025 nearly every fifth barrel of oil and every fourth cubic metre of gas in the will come from the United States. President Trump made the claim while focusing on the ""national crisis"" of illegal immigration and called on Congress to back his plans for a border wall. He said the Texan city of El Paso - on the Mexican border - ""was one of the most dangerous cities in the country"", until a barrier went up. This is false. A stretch of fence was constructed there between 2008 and 2009, which appears to be the moment the president is referring to. In the years immediately before the barrier went up, El Paso had one of the lowest crime rates among the 50 largest cities in the US, according toFBI statistics,external. In 2007, there were 418 violent crimes per 100,000 people in El Paso. By comparison, in 2007, Detroit, Michigan, had 2,287 violent crimes per 100,000 people. Since the fencing was completed, the violent crime rate in El Paso has gone down before rising slightly in 2016, but it's still one of the lowest out of the largest 50 US cities, according to the FBI statistics.

PM in Belfast for Brexit deadlock talks,"Theresa May is greeted as she arrives for talks at Stormont with Northern Ireland's main political parties Theresa May has held talks about Brexit with Northern Ireland's five main political parties at Stormont. The PM was on a two-day visit to try to reassure people she can secure a Brexit deal that avoids a hard border. Speaking on Wednesday,European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU would ""insist"" on the Irish backstop. Mr Tusk also said that there was a""special place in hell""for ""those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan of how to carry it safely"". Brexit: A really simple guide Q&A: Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know Can technology solve Irish border problem? He was speaking after talks with Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar in Brussels. In response to Mr Tusk's remarks, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said ""it is a delicate time and it is important we all consider our words carefully"". Mrs May is due to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Thursday in an effort to secure changes to her Brexit deal. This video can not be played Theresa May has ""no plan, no credibility and frankly no honour"", says Sinn FÃ©in's Mary Lou McDonald The EU has maintained it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish border backstop. On Tuesday, Mrs May told business leaders in Belfast thatshe wants changes to the controversial backstop but she suggested that she is not seeking to remove itfrom her Brexit deal. Analysis by Laura Kuenssberg, BBC News Political Editor Theresa May was in Northern Ireland meeting the different political parties - including the DUP, whose votes she needs in Parliament, who are totally opposed to the current version of the controversial backstop, as well as Sinn FÃ©in, who are just as adamant that it must remain. Tomorrow she will be in Brussels, asking again for the EU to amend the policy, seeking either a time limit or a legal upgrade to the promise that both sides will only use it if they really, really, really have to, and they don't expect it to last for ever. In short, Wednesday has been a chance for the PM to test out what she'll ask for; tomorrow is an opportunity to sell it as hard as she can in Brussels. Remember she has asked for these changes before and been turned down. And she's heard before from both sides in Northern Ireland how dug in their positions are. So can she do anything other than take one more turn around the same carousel while the clock ticks down? Read morehere. Mrs May held meetings about Brexit and Northern Ireland's political deadlock with Stormont's five biggest political parties: The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - the Conservative Party's confidence-and-supply partner at Westminster Sinn FÃ©in Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Alliance Party There has been no functioning devolved government since January 2017, when a row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in over a flawed green energy scheme collapsed the power-sharing executive. This video can not be played The leaders of the UUP, the SDLP and the Alliance Party gave their views after meeting the PM It sparked a snap election but, since then, various talks processes have collapsed and the Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley had to take control of financial matters and pass Stormont's budget bills through Westminster. For almost 10 years before that, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in worked together in government under a system of mandatory coalition, where unionist and nationalist parties shared power. DUP Leader Arlene Foster reiterated the party's opposition to the backstop and said Mrs May must ""stand strong"" in her talks with the EU. Mrs Foster also said Mr Tusk's comments were ""deliberately provocative and disrespectful"" and that the pressure is mounting among EU leaders. Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson responded to Mr Tusk's comments by calling him a ""devilish euro maniac"", and accused the European Council president of having ""fanned the flames of fear"" to try and overturn the referendum result. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said Donald Tusk's words were ""accurately reflecting the outrage"" people in NI feel about how Brexit has been handled. She added that the party's meeting with the PM was direct, but offered nothing new and she accused Mrs May of having ""no honour"". Ms McDonald also reiterated the party's support for the backstop and that a border poll should take place if there is a no-deal Brexit. Theidea of a border poll was met sceptically on Tuesday by Tony Lloyd, Northern Ireland's shadow secretary of state, who said it was ""not the most obvious thing we should rush into"". Criticism as Stormont stalled two years on What caused the Stormont stalemate? Who's calling the shots on NI policy? What is the Good Friday Agreement? UUP Leader Robin Swann said his party would not accept a time-limited backstop, something the PM suggested when his party met her. He added that Mrs May wanted to focus on Brexit and the UUP had to ""drag"" her to a place where they could raise the restoration of Stormont. Mr Swann said his party told her they wanted direct rule implemented in Northern Ireland if there is a no-deal Brexit. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley arrives at Stormont ahead of Brexit talks SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood said that his party had told Mrs May that it is now time to ""put up or shut up"". He said it was clear the backstop was the only viable solution, save keeping the UK in the single market and the customs union. He added that he had been ""infuriated"" when the government voted in favour of an amendment last week that called for alternative arrangements to replace the backstop. Alliance Party Leader Naomi Long said the time for ""assurances"" about Brexit from the government was over, describing her party's talks with Mrs May as ""constructive but very direct"". Ms Long reiterated that the party had heard nothing new from Mrs May and that it still backed the Brexit deal that included the backstop. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? The backstop is a commitment to avoid physical barriers or checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if no UK-EU trade deal is agreed before the Brexit transition period ends. Many people fear the return of customs checks would put the peace process at risk. In Tuesday's speech in Belfast, Mrs May said: ""There is no suggestion that we are not going to ensure in the future there is provision for this insurance policy... the backstop."" However, she indicated she would seek changes to address concerns raised by MPs about its ""potential indefinite nature"" when theyoverwhelmingly rejected her Brexit deal. Please upgrade your browser Last week, MPs voted for an amendment tabled by Conservative grandee Sir Graham Brady - and backed by the PM - which ""requires the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"". Many fear the ""temporary single customs territory"" created under the backstop plan would keep the UK tied to EU rules in the long term. Downing Street has insisted the government is still considering alternatives. On Wednesday,the Alternative Arrangements Working Group, comprised of Leave and Remain MPs,will conclude three days of talks aimed at finding other Brexit options that would avoid a hard border.

Oscars 2019 ceremony to have no host,"Jimmy Kimmel hosting the 2018 Oscars This year's Oscars will be held without an official host - for the first time in 30 years. The head of ABC Entertainment, which airs the Academy Awards ceremony, said it would instead highlight celebrities presenting the trophies. Reports had suggested the broadcaster was struggling to fill the role - one of the toughest in US show business. In December, comedian Kevin Hart pulled out of hosting the ceremony following a controversy over old homophobic tweets. He said he did not want to be a distraction and that he was ""sorry he had hurt people"". Kevin Hart withdrew as host following criticism of past tweets Kevin Hart quits as host amid tweets row And the winner is... recent Oscars hosts rated The Oscars host usually delivers an opening monologue as well as being responsible for many of the ceremony's memorable comedic moments. As well as the main host, the ceremony also usually enlists an array of movie stars to present the individual statuettes. ABC Entertainment president Karey Burke said this year's ceremony on 24 February in Los Angeles would ""just have presenters host the Oscars"". The decision was taken after Hart's withdrawal, she said. Ms Burke added that ""the mystery"" hanging about this year's event ""has been compelling"", proving that viewers were keen to watch it. Rob Lowe performed a duet with Snow White the last time the Oscars had no host A number of Academy Awards ceremonies have had no host. The last time, in 1989, proved highly controversial, not least due to an opening number featuring Rob Lowe and an actress dressed as Disney's Snow White. A group of leading Hollywood figures wrote an open letter after the ceremony, calling the telecast ""an embarrassment to both the Academy and the entire motion picture industry"". The Walt Disney Company also filed a legal action against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, accusing the organisation of copyright infringement. The role of anchoring the Oscars has thrown up problems for a number of hosts since then. The Hollywood Reporter has described it as""the least wanted job in Hollywood,external"". The controversy about Hart's tweets and the choice not to replace him with a single host follows a difficult few years for the Academy. This video can not be played What's happened since the the #OscarsSoWhite controversy of 2015 The 2017 ceremony was rocked by the so-called ""Envelopegate"" scandal, in which La La Land was wrongly named best picture instead of the actual winner Moonlight. Plans to introduce apopular film award categorywere shelved last year following widespread criticism. The Academy has also been stung by the#OscarsSoWhitecampaign, prompted by the all-white line-ups in the four categories for acting in 2015 and 2016. The role of Oscar host traditionally involves a number of staple ingredients that best suit those with a background in stand-up comedy. The evening usually begins with a light-hearted musical number, followed by a monologue poking gentle fun at the assembled nominees. Once the monologue is over, the host's role is to introduce the various awards presenters and comic interludes, and to smooth things over when things go awry. Billy Crystal last hosted the Academy Awards in 2012 Billy Crystal, who hosted the ceremony nine times between 1990 and 2012, proved particularly adept at this, as he showed in 1992 when he introduced veteran producer Hal Roach from the stage. ""It was his 100th birthday,""Crystal recalled in 2013,external. ""He wasn't supposed to speak, only wave. But he started speaking, holding himself up by the seat in front of him. ""You could barely hear him. It went on and on. You could feel people getting restless.

Can Trump-Kim summit succeed?,"The Singapore summit was a historic moment, but are Mr Kim and Mr Trump on the same page now? US President Donald Trump has said he will hold a second nuclear summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam on 27-28 February. The two leaders face a number of challenges as they prepare for the meeting. Both Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un made the most of the press extravaganza surrounding their choreographed reconciliation at the Singapore summit in June 2018. Perhaps they could just about get away with breaking the ice at that historic meeting. But the vaguely worded statement it produced hasn't resulted in any concrete action towards the US goal of dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons, and Pyongyang is frustrated by Washington's refusal to ease sanctions. So the pressure's on for them to come up with something tangible. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme When Trump met Kim: What happened next? The difficulty here is that they've personalised the nuclear confrontation: they like to deal with each other directly, and have done so by exchanging letters and warm words. The concern in Washington is that this arrangement works better for Mr Kim than for his pen pal Mr Trump - the president famously likes to rely on his instincts, while the chairman has mastered the brief. The solution to that is working-level negotiations to sort out details before the summit. That didn't happen last time, but it is happening now. A real achievement would be a summit agreement for a framework to keep them going at the expert level. At the Singapore summit, the US and North Korea agreed to the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"". But they didn't say what that meant, which gets to the heart of whether a deal is even possible. For the US denuclearisation involves North Korea unilaterally giving up its entire nuclear weapons arsenal and allowing verification by international inspectors. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on For North Korea it means that America take ""reciprocal"" steps pulling back its ability to threaten Pyongyang with nuclear armed forces in the region. Much of that is non-negotiable for the Americans, but perhaps not all. President Trump, to the chagrin of his generals, has made clear he would like to bring home US troops stationed in South Korea, although he has said he has no plans to do so at the moment. Whatever the case, Kim Jong-un has not formally committed to a written definition of denuclearisation. Experts say he should be pushed to do so, and to agree to a detailed roadmap of how to get there. That's a real challenge. But last week the state department's North Korea envoy Stephen Biegun at least acknowledged the disconnect over disarmament goals, and said coming to an agreement with the North Koreans would have to happen ""over time"". Signals from both sides have raised expectations of some action at the summit. Pyongyang has offered to destroy all its facilities for making nuclear bomb fuel, according to Mr Biegun, if the Trump administration takes ""corresponding measures"". Kim Jong-un has telegraphed that these would have to involve some form of sanctions relief, and some form of security guarantees, such as a declaration formally ending the Korean War. The Americans seem to be softening their demands for significant denuclearisation steps upfront, apparently adopting more of the action-for-action approach advocated by Mr Kim. There are reports of a deal involving partial sanctions relief in exchange for a freeze on North Korea's nuclear and missile weapons production (Pyongyang has stopped the testing, but not the production). The challenge would be to ensure that this would lead to concrete steps for dismantling the nuclear weapons North Korea already has. The concern here is that Mr Trump might strike an ad-hoc interim deal without a clear path to denuclearisation. Virtually anyone in Washington who knows anything about North Korea thinks that Kim Jong-un won't abandon his nuclear weapons programme. It's too important a deterrent, director of national intelligence Dan Coats told a senate committee last week. He said the country's leaders ""ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival"", especially against a US attempt to overthrow it. Instead, experts believe Mr Kim is trying to create the diplomatic climate necessary for North Korea to be accepted as a nuclear state. He did make some intriguing statements in his New Year's Day speech, declaring that Pyongyang would neither make nor proliferate nuclear weapons as part of its commitment to denuclearisation. Some former Pentagon officials go so far as to argue that it would make more sense to pursue dialogue on arms control, rather than arms elimination. Regardless, many analysts conclude that progress on denuclearisation won't be possible unless the regime feels secure, and Kim Jong-un can be convinced he doesn't need his nuclear weapons to hold on to power.

Briton held in UAE in football shirt row,"Mr Ahmad is said to have been arrested after watching Qatar play Iraq A Briton has been arrested and detained in the United Arab Emirates after reportedly being assaulted when he wore a Qatar football team shirt to a match. Ali Issa Ahmad, 26, from Wolverhampton, is said to have been unaware of a law against ""showing sympathy"" for Qatar - brought in amid a diplomatic dispute. His friend says he was held after telling police he had been attacked. The UAE embassy in London said Mr Ahmad has been charged with wasting police time and making false statements. Responding to earlier media reports, a UAE official said he was ""categorically not arrested for wearing a Qatar football shirt"". The Foreign Office said it is providing assistance to a British man and is in touch with the UAE authorities. United Arab Emirates profile The UAE and four other countries in the region are currently engaged in apolitical and diplomatic stand-off with Qatarafter they accused the state of supporting radical and Islamist groups. On its website, theForeign Office warns travellers to the UAE,externalof a June 2017 announcement ""that showing sympathy for Qatar on social media or by any other means of communication is an offence. ""Offenders could be imprisoned and subject to a substantial fine"". Mr Ahmad is said to have travelled to the UAE for a holiday. He was arrested after watching Qatar play Iraq in an Asian Cup match in Abu Dhabi on 22 January. Speaking to the BBC World Service programme Newshour, his friend Amer Lokie said Mr Ahmad had called him from a police station on 30 January to tell him about the arrest. Mr Lokie said: ""After he left the stadium he was followed by a couple of people and they assaulted him."" Mr Ahmad had been wearing a Qatar football shirt and was holding another one in his hands, he said. ""They took away his T-shirt and he went home. Afterwards he went back to police station to report the assault and they held him,"" Mr Lokie said. Asked whether Mr Ahmad had indicated whether the people who attacked him were members of the public, police or security officials, Mr Lokie said: ""I was trying to ask him to clarify but he could not clarify because his time was limited."" ""He was just a person who loved sport so much,"" Mr Lokie added. "" I don't think he knew he could get into problems for wearing a T-shirt or supporting a particular team."" The UAE embassy in London initially said it was unable to comment specifically on the case, adding ""allegations of human rights violations are taken extremely seriously and will be thoroughly investigated"". In a later statement issued through the embassy, a UAE official said Mr Ahmad was a dual Sudanese-British citizen. The official said Mr Ahmad had gone to a police station to say he had been harassed and beaten up by local football fans for cheering the Qatar team. ""Police took him to hospital where a doctor who examined him, concluded that his injuries were inconsistent with his account of events and appeared to be self-inflicted,"" the official said. They said Mr Ahmad was charged on 24 January, adding: ""We are advised that he has since admitted those offences [wasting police time and making false statements] and will now be processed through the UAE courts."" The tiny oil- and gas-rich Qatar has been cut off by some of its powerful Arab neighbours - including the UAE - over its alleged support for terrorism. The continuing rift meant there were very few Qatar fans in attendance during its Asian Cup matches. WhenQatar knocked the UAE out in the semi-final,objects and shoes were thrown at their players. Qatar went on to win the tournament, defeating Japan 3-1 in the final on 1 February.

Interserve agrees rescue plan with creditors,"Interserve holds the contract for cleaning Network Rail stations Interserve - one of the UK's largest providers of public services - has reached a deal with creditors to prevent its collapse. The rescue plan involves cutting its debts from over Â£600m to Â£275m by issuing new shares. Chief executive Debbie White said it was ""a significant step forward in our plans to strengthen the balance sheet"". Interserve sells services, including probation, cleaning and healthcare, and is involved in construction projects. ""The board believes that this agreement will secure a strong future for Interserve,"" Ms White added. The firm - a major government contractor - plans to issue Â£480m worth of new shares, which will be swapped with creditors for debt, leaving existing shareholders with virtually nothing. Under the rescue deal, Interserve will also keep its most profitable division, its RMD Kwikform construction business, loading Â£350m of debt onto its balance sheet. The firm had considered spinning the unit off to its lenders to raise money. Interserve has a market value of Â£17m, down from Â£500m in 2017, and a turnover of Â£3.2bn. About 70% of Interserve's turnover comes from government contracts. Stephen Rawlinson, an analyst at Applied Value, said that Interserve's woes are not as bad those of fellow outsourcer Carillion, which collapsed in January 2018 andput thousands of jobs at risk and cost taxpayers Â£148m. ""For existing shareholders, they're between a rock and a hard place, they have been for the last six to 12 months, so there's no difference, but now there is hope,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think another Carillion is likely, as the government has realised that to put these companies into liquidation is a very foolish thing to do."" However, he warned that the deal had not yet been approved by shareholders, and that it would probably take up to seven years before Interserve returned to profitability. This is the second rescue deal for Interserve, with the company refinancing its debt in March last year. Its troubles have been blamed on cancellations and delays in its construction contracts as well as struggling waste-to-energy projects in Derby and Glasgow. The firm's shares have plunged over the past year, currently trading at around 13p each. Just over a year ago, the shares were worth 100p each. Interserve rescue plan prompts share collapse Interserve shares dive on fears for future Government reassures over Interserve Following Carillion's collapse, the government launched a pilot of ""living wills"" for contractors, so that critical services can be taken over in the event of a crisis. Interserve is one of five suppliers taking part. In a separate statement, shareholder Coltrane Master Fund, which holds over a 5% stake in Interserve, has asked the firm to remove eight directors. The Interserve rescue deal will leave existing shareholders with virtually nothing It requested two other individuals be appointed as directors, but reiterated its support for Ms White as chief executive of the outsourcing provider. From its origins in dredging and construction, the company has diversified into wide range of services, such as health care and catering, for clients in government and industry. At King George Hospital in east London, for instance, Interserve has a Â£35m contract for cleaning, security, meals, waste management and maintenance. Its infrastructure projects include improving the M5 Junction 6 near Worcester, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water. But Interserve is also the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 ""medium-low risk offenders"" for the Ministry of Justice.

Bin workers 'offered ÃÂ£3k to end dispute',"Unite says workers will stage fresh walkouts for two days a week from later this month Striking bin workers in Birmingham have been offered up to Â£3,000 each to end their dispute, a council report says. Huge piles of rubbish littered the streets during an initial three-month strike in 2017 as people struggled to dispose of their waste. Unite members have been working to rule since December over payments made to non-striking bin staff at the GMB union. It plans to further walkout for two days a week from later this month. A Birmingham City Council report says mounting rubbish could create a fire risk for tower block residents. Mark Crook said missed collections at Pritchett Tower could cause problems Mark Crook, chairman of the tenants' association at Pritchett Tower in Small Heath, said: ""We definitely have concerns. ""We haven't been told the strike could affect us but, if it does, it will become major fire risk. ""Overflow from the bin room would be a fire risk, without a question of a doubt, and the smells would be horrendous."" Could this be a familiar site for Birmingham residents if waste piles up again? Unite is scheduled to take the authority to an employment tribunal in February 2020. If the dispute was to continue until then, the report adds, clearing the backlog of rubbish would cost the council between Â£13.5m and Â£28.2m depending on whether there were breaks in the action. It says waiting for the tribunal would result in rubbish mounting on the streets, while paying off workers could set a precedent for future disputes. Birmingham braced for new bin strikes What caused the three-month bin strike? Bin workers getting 'grief on street' Birmingham City Council cabinet membersare to discuss four options at a meeting on Tuesday,external: Do nothing and allow the dispute to continue Pay off workers Settle a planned employment tribunal Take out an injunction to halt strikes The report said legal advice was that a ""reasonable, well-evaluated figure"" for Unite members would be in the ""region of Â£2,000 to Â£3,000"". It claims the authority had ""made a reasonable offer which the union has rejected on behalf of its members"".  Â£28.2mEstimated cost to city council of running contingency service if strikes are continuous Â£24.80Equivalent cost per person in Birmingham Â£13.5mEstimated cost if strikes are on and off Â£11.87Equivalent cost per person in Birmingham Unite said it would ""not be drawn on a figure"" but it had set the council a deadline of last Friday afternoon ""to make an improved offer to the workforce"". This video can not be played Cat flap locked to stop rodents as bin bags pile up The report warns Birmingham's trade and income could be hit and the ""general image of the city compromised"". But it says payments could ""lead to an increase in industrial unrest, with union members choosing to strike because they would then be likely to expect to receive a financial settlement and not because of specific issues leading to a trade dispute"". It adds there should be a swift end to a dispute that is causing mounting concern among residents and could cost substantially less to end than to keep fighting on. It is currently costing the council Â£350,000 a week to deal with the fallout. Meanwhile, a bin worker said collectors were getting abuse on social media and ""grief"" on the streets over collections. One told the BBC: ""Last time it felt like Birmingham was behind us, but the tide is turning."" The council said it was disappointed its offer to end this round of action was rejected Howard Beckett, Unite's assistant general secretary, said: ""The only acceptable outcome to this dispute is one that ensures those who failed to take strike action do not financially benefit over and above those who took industrial action."" Unite claims its striking members had been ""blacklisted"" and weredenied a payment which was given to GMB members, who did not strike in 2017. The authority has denied that was the case and the GMB said suggestions its members received extra payments for not taking strike action were ""inaccurate and misleading"".

'Monster' fatberg to be sucked up,"This video can not be played Workers attempt to clear giant Sidmouth fatberg The removal of a 210ft (64m) ""monster"" fatberg which is blocking a sewer in a seaside town has begun. The congealed mass of fat, oil, wet wipes and other rubbish was discovered in the sewers of Sidmouth in December. South West Water has removed the first chunk of it and taken 3D scans of the ""unwanted Christmas present"". It is estimated it could take eight weeks to remove it by breaking it down with manual labour and sucking it up to the surface. The first chunk of the colossal fatberg has been removed Clearance teams are using a combination of pick-axes and high-pressure jets to clear the colossal chunk of congealed fat. They are wearing full breathing apparatus and body suits because of the dangerous gases released by the fatberg. This video can not be played Fatberg: Inside Sidmouth's sewers High levels of hydrogen sulphide and methane mean the air is also too unstable to risk taking cameras down to film the removal, according to the water provider. How do you remove a fatberg? Monster fatberg found blocking sewer War on fatbergs: Can this 21st Century peril be blitzed?

Bin workers 'offered Â£3k to end dispute',"Unite says workers will stage fresh walkouts for two days a week from later this month Striking bin workers in Birmingham have been offered up to Â£3,000 each to end their dispute, a council report says. Huge piles of rubbish littered the streets during an initial three-month strike in 2017 as people struggled to dispose of their waste. Unite members have been working to rule since December over payments made to non-striking bin staff at the GMB union. It plans to further walkout for two days a week from later this month. A Birmingham City Council report says mounting rubbish could create a fire risk for tower block residents. Mark Crook said missed collections at Pritchett Tower could cause problems Mark Crook, chairman of the tenants' association at Pritchett Tower in Small Heath, said: ""We definitely have concerns. ""We haven't been told the strike could affect us but, if it does, it will become major fire risk. ""Overflow from the bin room would be a fire risk, without a question of a doubt, and the smells would be horrendous."" Could this be a familiar site for Birmingham residents if waste piles up again? Unite is scheduled to take the authority to an employment tribunal in February 2020. If the dispute was to continue until then, the report adds, clearing the backlog of rubbish would cost the council between Â£13.5m and Â£28.2m depending on whether there were breaks in the action. It says waiting for the tribunal would result in rubbish mounting on the streets, while paying off workers could set a precedent for future disputes. Birmingham braced for new bin strikes What caused the three-month bin strike? Bin workers getting 'grief on street' Birmingham City Council cabinet membersare to discuss four options at a meeting on Tuesday,external: Do nothing and allow the dispute to continue Pay off workers Settle a planned employment tribunal Take out an injunction to halt strikes The report said legal advice was that a ""reasonable, well-evaluated figure"" for Unite members would be in the ""region of Â£2,000 to Â£3,000"". It claims the authority had ""made a reasonable offer which the union has rejected on behalf of its members"".  Â£28.2mEstimated cost to city council of running contingency service if strikes are continuous Â£24.80Equivalent cost per person in Birmingham Â£13.5mEstimated cost if strikes are on and off Â£11.87Equivalent cost per person in Birmingham Unite said it would ""not be drawn on a figure"" but it had set the council a deadline of last Friday afternoon ""to make an improved offer to the workforce"". This video can not be played Cat flap locked to stop rodents as bin bags pile up The report warns Birmingham's trade and income could be hit and the ""general image of the city compromised"". But it says payments could ""lead to an increase in industrial unrest, with union members choosing to strike because they would then be likely to expect to receive a financial settlement and not because of specific issues leading to a trade dispute"". It adds there should be a swift end to a dispute that is causing mounting concern among residents and could cost substantially less to end than to keep fighting on. It is currently costing the council Â£350,000 a week to deal with the fallout. Meanwhile, a bin worker said collectors were getting abuse on social media and ""grief"" on the streets over collections. One told the BBC: ""Last time it felt like Birmingham was behind us, but the tide is turning."" The council said it was disappointed its offer to end this round of action was rejected Howard Beckett, Unite's assistant general secretary, said: ""The only acceptable outcome to this dispute is one that ensures those who failed to take strike action do not financially benefit over and above those who took industrial action."" Unite claims its striking members had been ""blacklisted"" and weredenied a payment which was given to GMB members, who did not strike in 2017. The authority has denied that was the case and the GMB said suggestions its members received extra payments for not taking strike action were ""inaccurate and misleading"".

Five takeaways from speech,"This video can not be played Trump slams 'ridiculous partisan investigations' as Nancy Pelosi looks on It's the halfway point of Donald Trump's first term in office, and - for more than an hour - the president had the nation's undivided attention. It was a speech that was billed as bipartisan, but beneath the flowery language were the same sharp divides and disagreements. Here are five takeaways from the president's address, plus analysis of the Democratic response. The feel-good moment of the 2019 State of the Union address occured when the president recognised the record number of women serving in the US Congress, prompting the white-clad legislators to stand and cheer in an unscripted show of exuberance. It probably wasn't lost on the president, however, that most of those cheering were Democrats - and that they won their recent elections by running against his policies. They - along with most other Democrats - were decidedly not cheering for the rest of the president's speech. They were stone-faced as the president spoke about immigration. They sat on their hands as he urged Congress to pass new anti-abortion legislation. There were audible groans when Mr Trump warned that ""ridiculous partisan investigations"" of his administration might threaten the ""economic miracle"" in the US. While the president leavened his speech with applause lines and tributes to World War Two veterans, childhood cancer patients and Holocaust survivors, the sharp divisions within US politics were also on full display. Trump announces second North Korean summit The address even started with a not-so-subtle slight. The president began to speak without waiting for a formal introduction from House Speaker, and top Democrat, Nancy Pelosi - a break with tradition. Ms Pelosi's office tweeted responses and criticisms of the president's speech while it was occurring, and several times her applause seemed less like an approbation than a sharp rebuke. The two adversaries started the year locked in mortal partisan combat, and this State of the Union address gave no indication of an end to the conflict. Perhaps the biggest issue looming over Mr Trump's State of the Union Address was the ongoing confrontation between Democrats and Republicans over immigration policy and Mr Trump's proposed border wall. It led to the recently concluded government shutdown and, if a compromise is not reached, could result in another shutdown a week from Friday. The president, who made the wall a central focus of his 2016 campaign, has backed away from his call for it to stretch along the entirety of the Mexican border. He's no longer saying it will be a concrete structure, instead describing it on Tuesday as a ""smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier"". And there was no mention of his pledge that Mexico would pay for the structure. The president insisted, however, that ""walls work and walls save lives"". Democrats have shown no indication that they will offer any sort of wall funding. Something has to give. This video can not be played ""You weren't supposed to do that!"" - Trump and Democratic women share an unexpected moment of unity On Tuesday night, Mr Trump didn't indicate a way out. There was no threat of a presidential ""emergency declaration"" that might allow Mr Trump to order the US military to build the wall without congressional approval. There were no signs of backing down. Instead, Mr Trump concluded his roughly 17 minutes of immigration talk with an open-ended bit of vagary, placing this political bag of snakes firmly in the laps of congressional negotiators. ""Let's work together, compromise and reach a deal that will truly make America safe,"" he said. Six surprising statistics about US immigrants With Democratic candidates - many sitting in the Capitol - already lining up to challenge Mr Trump in next year's presidential election, this address could also be viewed as the president's first big speech of his re-election campaign. First, he listed his accomplishments. He spoke of an ""unprecedented economic boom"", boasting of rising wages, 5.3 million new jobs, 600,000 new manufacturing jobs and low unemployment. The credit for this, he said, was his tax cut and reductions in government regulation.  And for the first time since 1955, he noted, the US is a net energy exporter, which he also took credit for (although the trends have been in place since the Obama-era fracking boom). Mr Trump also mentioned a couple of other legislative successes, including criminal justice reform and a law that allows patients with terminal disease to try experimental drugs. If the economy is still good, however, the economy will be the heart of his re-election pitch. A presidential campaign is about more than selling the candidate, however. It's also about convincing the public the alternative is the wrong choice. And in a few lines on Tuesday night, the president gave a preview of what's to come there, as well. After talking about the ""brutality"" of Nicolas Maduro's Venezuelan government, Mr Trump pivoted to an attack on his political opponents. Senator Bernie Sanders looks unimpressed by President Trump's attack on socialist policies ""Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,"" he said. ""America was founded on liberty and independence, not government coercion, domination and control."" Recent polls have showing a growing number ofDemocrats adopting a more positive view of ""socialism"" compared to capitalism,external- although, in this case, they are supporting policies more in line with European socialism and not Venezuelan dictatorship. The president, however, is making no such distinctions and, instead, appears poised to paint Democratic presidential hopefuls who are flocking to the left on issues like healthcare, education and income inequality as too radical to be trusted with power. ""We renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country,"" Mr Trump concluded to thunderous applause from the Republicans in the room. Expect to hear similar lines again and again, all the way to the November 2020 election day. The political battles over the wall for the past two months have effectively crowded out any discussion of other presidential priorities. In his State of the Union address, the president made an effort to breathe life into some of his other policy priorities, including areas that could - in less polarised times - find bipartisan support. Infrastructure investment, that long promised but never formally proposed presidential goal, again got a plug. He touted his newly negotiated trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, although he never explicitly called on Congress to approve the deal, which it must do at some point. There were a couple of lines about lowering prescription drug prices and eliminating HIV transmission and childhood cancer. When he turned to foreign policy - the final topic in his speech - the laundry list continued. He touted withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia and warned that if a new deal can't be reached, the US would ""outspend and out-innovate"" all others in nuclear weapons development. He boasted of ongoing negotiations with North Korea, including a new summit with Kim Jong-un later this month. He also spoke of concluding ""endless wars"", again asserting that the US will withdraw its military from Syrian and negotiate peace in Afghanistan. He gave no timeline for the process, however. Challenges for Trump-Kim summit On foreign policy, the president does have broad powers. If Mr Trump can ignore the criticisms from lawmakers and occasional disapproval within his administration, he could realise some of his objectives. When it comes to domestic policy, however, his proposals are effectively dead in the water. They were filler in the speech, delivered without enthusiasm. By tomorrow, most will be forgotten, as the whirlwind of modern American politics twists on. It's getting difficult for Democrats to find a voice for the party who also doesn't harbour, secretly or publicly, presidential ambitions. Rather than give a leg up to an aspiring White House candidate, the Democrats turned to someone whose most recent run at elective office ended in defeat, Stacey Abrams of Georgia. Although Ms Abrams isn't a current officeholder, her campaign for Georgia governor did reflect where the Democratic Party is today - ethnically diverse, and politically progressive. This video can not be played Stacey Abrams: 'We want Trump to tell the truth' Where the president's address was light on new policy proposals, Ms Abrams Democratic response was packed with policy. In around five minutes, she touched on gun control, the cost of higher education, climate change, healthcare reform and voting rights. She blamed the Republicans for the government shutdown, criticised the president's tax reform bill as being ""rigged against working people"" and touted the contribution of immigrants to US society. The woman vying to make US history The Democratic Party has more than its share of internal disagreements. There are questions over how to accomplish universal healthcare and low-cost college education, how to address income inequality and racism, and what taxes to cut and raise. They have their own debates about foreign policy, made clear when some Democratic presidential contenders in the House chamber applauded Mr Trump's line about endless foreign wars. Ms Abrams response, however, smoothed over those divides and presented the Democratic Party as the compassionate alternative to Mr Trump and the Republicans. ""Our progress has always been found in the refuge, in the basic instinct of the American experiment, to do right by our people,"" she said. As the Democratic presidential contest heats up, however, the differences within the party - and between the personalities battling to be the face of that party - will be impossible to ignore.

The Pelosi Clap and other curious talking points,"A photo of Nancy Pelosi clapping after Mr Trump's address has gone viral As US President Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union address to Congress, many people took to social media to discuss the event. Among the political analysis and partisan debate, a number of altogether more light-hearted talking points came up. It is perhaps unsurprising that Nancy Pelosi became the subject of one of the most popular memes on the night. The new House Speaker, de facto leader of the Democratic Party, sat behind President Trump during his address and is one of the most high-profile opponents of the president. Many on social media thought this political rivalry was captured in a photo of Ms Pelosi applauding after Mr Trump called for compromise in politics. The image, termed the ""Pelosi clap"", quickly went viral. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Taliban 'not seeking to seize Afghanistan',"This video can not be played Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai: ""Peace is more difficult than war"" The leader of the Taliban's peace negotiations with the US says the insurgents do not want to seize ""the whole country by [military] power"". ""It will not bring peace to Afghanistan,"" Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai told the BBC. However, he said the group would not agree to a ceasefire until foreign forces were withdrawn from Afghanistan. UN data shows the Taliban are responsible for more civilian casualties than any other party. Taliban threaten 70% of Afghanistan, BBC finds Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever Who are the Taliban? Mr Stanikzai, who until recently was the head of the Taliban's political office in Qatar and remains a leading figure in the group, was giving his first interview to the international media while attending a meeting in Moscow with senior Afghan opposition politicians. He said the Taliban's experiences in power in the 1990s, when it faced armed opposition from rival Afghan groups, had led the group to conclude it was preferable to reach a solution by ""coming to the table"". ""Peace is more difficult than war,"" Mr Stanikzai added, alluding to the difficulties in reaching a settlement. But he expressed hopes that the conflict could be brought to an end. Mr Stanikzai has overseen a series of meetings with the US special envoy for Afghan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, in recent months. In January, they reached what Mr Khalilzad termed as a ""draft framework"" of an agreement. It was based on a commitment to withdraw US forces from the country, and a guarantee by the Taliban not to allow international jihadist groups to use Afghanistan as a base in the future. Both sides have indicated that a number of issues still need to be resolved. However US President Donald Trump has made clear his desire to bring an end to the 17-year conflict and withdraw at least the vast bulk of American forces. Taliban militants have carried a number of deadly attacks across Afghanistan Mr Stanikzai told the BBC he believed the Trump administration wanted to ""bring peace to Afghanistan."" The meeting in Moscow is separate from the US-Taliban peace talks. In addition to a Taliban delegation, it was also attended by former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, as well as other high-profile opposition figures. Topics of discussions included how the country could be governed in the future, if the Taliban were to become a mainstream political force. Early 1990s:The hardline Islamic movement emerges in northern Pakistan following Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. 1994:The predominantly Pashtun movement comes to prominence in Afghanistan, which is in the grip of civil war. 1996:Taliban seize control of Kabul and introduce hardline version of Islam, banning women from work and introducing punishments including stonings and amputations. 2001:Taliban are toppled in US-led invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11 attacks in the US. The Taliban had sheltered al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, who was blamed for the attacks. 2014:Nato ends combat operations in Afghanistan. The Taliban, who retreated and regrouped after they were driven from power, are by now back with a vengeance. 2018:BBC study found the militants openly active in 70% of Afghanistan. Taliban meet US officials and attend a peace conference in Moscow. Afghanistan timeline Mr Stanikzai addressed the meeting in a hotel in Moscow, saying the group did not want ""a monopoly of power"" - but that Afghanistan's constitution had been ""imported from the West"" and was an ""obstacle to peace"". The Taliban governed Afghanistan in 1996-2001 with an ultra-conservative and often brutal interpretation of Islamic law. The group was notorious for its treatment of women, banning most of them to work or go to school. However, Mr Stanikzai said ""women should not worry"" about the prospect of increasing Taliban influence as they would seek to grant women all their ""rights according to Islamic rule and Afghan culture"". ""They can go to school, they can go to universities, they can work,"" he added. US soldiers provide training for the Afghan military Fawzia Koofi, an Afghan MP and one of only two women present at the Moscow meeting, told the BBC: ""It's a positive step that the Taliban who were using bullets against the people of Afghanistan, especially women, are now using microphone and listening to women's voices."" She said a Taliban member had told her a woman should not be able to become president but could serve in political office. ""We need to make sure everything they say here, they mean it,"" Ms Koofi added. The Afghan government were not part of the talks in Moscow. President Ashraf Ghani has repeatedly called on the Taliban to begin direct negotiations with his representatives, but so far the group has refused, dismissing them as puppets of the US. US negotiators have tried to persuade the Taliban to meet Afghan officials, but Mr Stanikzai remained vague when questioned about the circumstances under which they would ever agree to do so. He said that ""when the American forces announce the withdrawal of their troops"" there could be further ""intra-Afghan dialogue"". It could include representatives of the current Afghan government, alongside others, to ""select or elect a future government"". Officials in Kabul have suggested the discussions in Russia are an attempt by political rivals to undermine the Afghan government, and explore a potential deal with the Taliban without their input. Mr Stanikzai said the Taliban had decided in Moscow to meet Afghan political figures who had ""manpower"" on the ground. Speaking to Afghan TV channel TOLOnews, President Ghani said: ""Those who have gathered in Moscow have no executive authority. They can say what they want."" How does the Taliban make money? Despite the talks in Moscow, and a further round of US-Taliban discussions being scheduled for 25 February, violence in Afghanistan continues.

Apple retail boss Angela Ahrendts to go,"Angela Ahrendts, the former high fashion boss of Burberry brought in to revitalise Apple's retail stores, is stepping down after five years. Apple said Ms Ahrendts will leave the company in April ""for new personal and professional pursuits"". She is one of its highest paid executives, earning nearly twice as much as boss Tim Cook in 2017. Ms Ahrendts will be replaced by Deirdre O'Brien, whose role as vice president of people will expand to cover retail. During her time at Apple, Ms Ahrendts opened a number of flagship stores, aimed at creating a ""community space"" as opposed to just selling the firm's latest product. Mr Cook said: ""She has been a positive, transformative force, both for Apple's stores and the communities they serve. We all wish her the very best as she begins a new chapter."" Ms Ahrendts was previously chief executive of Burberry, where she oversaw its transformation from a British brand best-known for its checked raincoats to a leading name on the world's catwalks. By the time she left in 2014, she was one of the FTSE 100's highest paid chief executives. In 2017, Ms Ahrendts earned $24.2m, compared to Mr Cook who took home $12.8m. Deirdre O'Brien, Ms Ahrendts' successor, has worked at Apple for 30 years Apple recently reported a sharp fall in revenue from its iPhone and hinted that it could lower prices to boost demand. Overall, first quarter revenue fell by 5% to $84.3bn compared to the same period last year. Analysts at Wedbush Securities said its initial reaction to Ms Ahrendts departure was surprise ""as she was one of the key executives at Apple and a linchpin around running 500-plus retail stores on five continents and potentially was seen by some as a future heir to Cook as chief executive further down the line"". But it said because Apple is entering a critical period amid sluggish demand for the iPhone, Ms O'Brien's 30 years working for the firm is positive ""as an outsider running retail going into one of the most pivotal, defining periods for Cook & Co in the company's history would have been a risky endeavour"".

Oscars 2019 ceremony to go without host,"Jimmy Kimmel hosting the 2018 Oscars This year's Oscars will be held without an official host - for the first time in 30 years. The head of ABC Entertainment, which airs the Academy Awards ceremony, said it would instead highlight celebrities presenting the trophies. Reports had suggested the broadcaster was struggling to fill the role - one of the toughest in US show business. In December, comedian Kevin Hart pulled out of hosting the ceremony following a controversy over old homophobic tweets. He said he did not want to be a distraction and that he was ""sorry he had hurt people"". Kevin Hart withdrew as host following criticism of past tweets Kevin Hart quits as host amid tweets row And the winner is... recent Oscars hosts rated The Oscars host usually delivers an opening monologue as well as being responsible for many of the ceremony's memorable comedic moments. As well as the main host, the ceremony also usually enlists an array of movie stars to present the individual statuettes. ABC Entertainment president Karey Burke said this year's ceremony on 24 February in Los Angeles would ""just have presenters host the Oscars"". The decision was taken after Hart's withdrawal, she said. Ms Burke added that ""the mystery"" hanging about this year's event ""has been compelling"", proving that viewers were keen to watch it. Rob Lowe performed a duet with Snow White the last time the Oscars had no host A number of Academy Awards ceremonies have had no host. The last time, in 1989, proved highly controversial, not least due to an opening number featuring Rob Lowe and an actress dressed as Disney's Snow White. A group of leading Hollywood figures wrote an open letter after the ceremony, calling the telecast ""an embarrassment to both the Academy and the entire motion picture industry"". The Walt Disney Company also filed a legal action against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, accusing the organisation of copyright infringement. The role of anchoring the Oscars has thrown up problems for a number of hosts since then. The Hollywood Reporter has described it as""the least wanted job in Hollywood,external"". The controversy about Hart's tweets and the choice not to replace him with a single host follows a difficult few years for the Academy. This video can not be played What's happened since the the #OscarsSoWhite controversy of 2015 The 2017 ceremony was rocked by the so-called ""Envelopegate"" scandal, in which La La Land was wrongly named best picture instead of the actual winner Moonlight. Plans to introduce apopular film award categorywere shelved last year following widespread criticism. The Academy has also been stung by the#OscarsSoWhitecampaign, prompted by the all-white line-ups in the four categories for acting in 2015 and 2016. The role of Oscar host traditionally involves a number of staple ingredients that best suit those with a background in stand-up comedy. The evening usually begins with a light-hearted musical number, followed by a monologue poking gentle fun at the assembled nominees. Once the monologue is over, the host's role is to introduce the various awards presenters and comic interludes, and to smooth things over when things go awry. Billy Crystal last hosted the Academy Awards in 2012 Billy Crystal, who hosted the ceremony nine times between 1990 and 2012, proved particularly adept at this, as he showed in 1992 when he introduced veteran producer Hal Roach from the stage.

Key challenges at second summit,"The Singapore summit was a historic moment, but are Mr Kim and Mr Trump on the same page now? US President Donald Trump has said he will hold a second nuclear summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam on 27-28 February. The two leaders face a number of challenges as they prepare for the meeting. Both Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un made the most of the press extravaganza surrounding their choreographed reconciliation at the Singapore summit in June 2018. Perhaps they could just about get away with breaking the ice at that historic meeting. But the vaguely worded statement it produced hasn't resulted in any concrete action towards the US goal of dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons, and Pyongyang is frustrated by Washington's refusal to ease sanctions. So the pressure's on for them to come up with something tangible. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme When Trump met Kim: What happened next? The difficulty here is that they've personalised the nuclear confrontation: they like to deal with each other directly, and have done so by exchanging letters and warm words. The concern in Washington is that this arrangement works better for Mr Kim than for his pen pal Mr Trump - the president famously likes to rely on his instincts, while the chairman has mastered the brief. The solution to that is working-level negotiations to sort out details before the summit. That didn't happen last time, but it is happening now. A real achievement would be a summit agreement for a framework to keep them going at the expert level. At the Singapore summit, the US and North Korea agreed to the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"". But they didn't say what that meant, which gets to the heart of whether a deal is even possible. For the US denuclearisation involves North Korea unilaterally giving up its entire nuclear weapons arsenal and allowing verification by international inspectors. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on For North Korea it means that America take ""reciprocal"" steps pulling back its ability to threaten Pyongyang with nuclear armed forces in the region. Much of that is non-negotiable for the Americans, but perhaps not all. President Trump, to the chagrin of his generals, has made clear he would like to bring home US troops stationed in South Korea, although he has said he has no plans to do so at the moment. Whatever the case, Kim Jong-un has not formally committed to a written definition of denuclearisation. Experts say he should be pushed to do so, and to agree to a detailed roadmap of how to get there. That's a real challenge. But last week the state department's North Korea envoy Stephen Biegun at least acknowledged the disconnect over disarmament goals, and said coming to an agreement with the North Koreans would have to happen ""over time"". Signals from both sides have raised expectations of some action at the summit. Pyongyang has offered to destroy all its facilities for making nuclear bomb fuel, according to Mr Biegun, if the Trump administration takes ""corresponding measures"". Kim Jong-un has telegraphed that these would have to involve some form of sanctions relief, and some form of security guarantees, such as a declaration formally ending the Korean War. The Americans seem to be softening their demands for significant denuclearisation steps upfront, apparently adopting more of the action-for-action approach advocated by Mr Kim. There are reports of a deal involving partial sanctions relief in exchange for a freeze on North Korea's nuclear and missile weapons production (Pyongyang has stopped the testing, but not the production). The challenge would be to ensure that this would lead to concrete steps for dismantling the nuclear weapons North Korea already has. The concern here is that Mr Trump might strike an ad-hoc interim deal without a clear path to denuclearisation. Virtually anyone in Washington who knows anything about North Korea thinks that Kim Jong-un won't abandon his nuclear weapons programme. It's too important a deterrent, director of national intelligence Dan Coats told a senate committee last week. He said the country's leaders ""ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival"", especially against a US attempt to overthrow it. Instead, experts believe Mr Kim is trying to create the diplomatic climate necessary for North Korea to be accepted as a nuclear state. He did make some intriguing statements in his New Year's Day speech, declaring that Pyongyang would neither make nor proliferate nuclear weapons as part of its commitment to denuclearisation. Some former Pentagon officials go so far as to argue that it would make more sense to pursue dialogue on arms control, rather than arms elimination. Regardless, many analysts conclude that progress on denuclearisation won't be possible unless the regime feels secure, and Kim Jong-un can be convinced he doesn't need his nuclear weapons to hold on to power.

Key takeaways from Trump's speech,"This video can not be played Trump slams 'ridiculous partisan investigations' as Nancy Pelosi looks on It's the halfway point of Donald Trump's first term in office, and - for more than an hour - the president had the nation's undivided attention. It was a speech that was billed as bipartisan, but beneath the flowery language were the same sharp divides and disagreements. Here are five takeaways from the president's address, plus analysis of the Democratic response. The feel-good moment of the 2019 State of the Union address occured when the president recognised the record number of women serving in the US Congress, prompting the white-clad legislators to stand and cheer in an unscripted show of exuberance. It probably wasn't lost on the president, however, that most of those cheering were Democrats - and that they won their recent elections by running against his policies. They - along with most other Democrats - were decidedly not cheering for the rest of the president's speech. They were stone-faced as the president spoke about immigration. They sat on their hands as he urged Congress to pass new anti-abortion legislation. There were audible groans when Mr Trump warned that ""ridiculous partisan investigations"" of his administration might threaten the ""economic miracle"" in the US. While the president leavened his speech with applause lines and tributes to World War Two veterans, childhood cancer patients and Holocaust survivors, the sharp divisions within US politics were also on full display. Trump announces second North Korean summit The address even started with a not-so-subtle slight. The president began to speak without waiting for a formal introduction from House Speaker, and top Democrat, Nancy Pelosi - a break with tradition. Ms Pelosi's office tweeted responses and criticisms of the president's speech while it was occurring, and several times her applause seemed less like an approbation than a sharp rebuke. The two adversaries started the year locked in mortal partisan combat, and this State of the Union address gave no indication of an end to the conflict. Perhaps the biggest issue looming over Mr Trump's State of the Union Address was the ongoing confrontation between Democrats and Republicans over immigration policy and Mr Trump's proposed border wall. It led to the recently concluded government shutdown and, if a compromise is not reached, could result in another shutdown a week from Friday. The president, who made the wall a central focus of his 2016 campaign, has backed away from his call for it to stretch along the entirety of the Mexican border. He's no longer saying it will be a concrete structure, instead describing it on Tuesday as a ""smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier"". And there was no mention of his pledge that Mexico would pay for the structure. The president insisted, however, that ""walls work and walls save lives"". Democrats have shown no indication that they will offer any sort of wall funding. Something has to give. This video can not be played ""You weren't supposed to do that!"" - Trump and Democratic women share an unexpected moment of unity On Tuesday night, Mr Trump didn't indicate a way out. There was no threat of a presidential ""emergency declaration"" that might allow Mr Trump to order the US military to build the wall without congressional approval. There were no signs of backing down. Instead, Mr Trump concluded his roughly 17 minutes of immigration talk with an open-ended bit of vagary, placing this political bag of snakes firmly in the laps of congressional negotiators. ""Let's work together, compromise and reach a deal that will truly make America safe,"" he said. Six surprising statistics about US immigrants With Democratic candidates - many sitting in the Capitol - already lining up to challenge Mr Trump in next year's presidential election, this address could also be viewed as the president's first big speech of his re-election campaign. First, he listed his accomplishments. He spoke of an ""unprecedented economic boom"", boasting of rising wages, 5.3 million new jobs, 600,000 new manufacturing jobs and low unemployment. The credit for this, he said, was his tax cut and reductions in government regulation.  And for the first time since 1955, he noted, the US is a net energy exporter, which he also took credit for (although the trends have been in place since the Obama-era fracking boom). Mr Trump also mentioned a couple of other legislative successes, including criminal justice reform and a law that allows patients with terminal disease to try experimental drugs. If the economy is still good, however, the economy will be the heart of his re-election pitch. A presidential campaign is about more than selling the candidate, however. It's also about convincing the public the alternative is the wrong choice. And in a few lines on Tuesday night, the president gave a preview of what's to come there, as well. After talking about the ""brutality"" of Nicolas Maduro's Venezuelan government, Mr Trump pivoted to an attack on his political opponents. Senator Bernie Sanders looks unimpressed by President Trump's attack on socialist policies ""Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,"" he said. ""America was founded on liberty and independence, not government coercion, domination and control."" Recent polls have showing a growing number ofDemocrats adopting a more positive view of ""socialism"" compared to capitalism,external- although, in this case, they are supporting policies more in line with European socialism and not Venezuelan dictatorship. The president, however, is making no such distinctions and, instead, appears poised to paint Democratic presidential hopefuls who are flocking to the left on issues like healthcare, education and income inequality as too radical to be trusted with power. ""We renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country,"" Mr Trump concluded to thunderous applause from the Republicans in the room. Expect to hear similar lines again and again, all the way to the November 2020 election day. The political battles over the wall for the past two months have effectively crowded out any discussion of other presidential priorities. In his State of the Union address, the president made an effort to breathe life into some of his other policy priorities, including areas that could - in less polarised times - find bipartisan support. Infrastructure investment, that long promised but never formally proposed presidential goal, again got a plug. He touted his newly negotiated trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, although he never explicitly called on Congress to approve the deal, which it must do at some point. There were a couple of lines about lowering prescription drug prices and eliminating HIV transmission and childhood cancer. When he turned to foreign policy - the final topic in his speech - the laundry list continued. He touted withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia and warned that if a new deal can't be reached, the US would ""outspend and out-innovate"" all others in nuclear weapons development. He boasted of ongoing negotiations with North Korea, including a new summit with Kim Jong-un later this month. He also spoke of concluding ""endless wars"", again asserting that the US will withdraw its military from Syrian and negotiate peace in Afghanistan. He gave no timeline for the process, however. Challenges for Trump-Kim summit On foreign policy, the president does have broad powers. If Mr Trump can ignore the criticisms from lawmakers and occasional disapproval within his administration, he could realise some of his objectives. When it comes to domestic policy, however, his proposals are effectively dead in the water. They were filler in the speech, delivered without enthusiasm. By tomorrow, most will be forgotten, as the whirlwind of modern American politics twists on. It's getting difficult for Democrats to find a voice for the party who also doesn't harbour, secretly or publicly, presidential ambitions. Rather than give a leg up to an aspiring White House candidate, the Democrats turned to someone whose most recent run at elective office ended in defeat, Stacey Abrams of Georgia. Although Ms Abrams isn't a current officeholder, her campaign for Georgia governor did reflect where the Democratic Party is today - ethnically diverse, and politically progressive. This video can not be played Stacey Abrams: 'We want Trump to tell the truth' Where the president's address was light on new policy proposals, Ms Abrams Democratic response was packed with policy. In around five minutes, she touched on gun control, the cost of higher education, climate change, healthcare reform and voting rights. She blamed the Republicans for the government shutdown, criticised the president's tax reform bill as being ""rigged against working people"" and touted the contribution of immigrants to US society. The woman vying to make US history The Democratic Party has more than its share of internal disagreements. There are questions over how to accomplish universal healthcare and low-cost college education, how to address income inequality and racism, and what taxes to cut and raise. They have their own debates about foreign policy, made clear when some Democratic presidential contenders in the House chamber applauded Mr Trump's line about endless foreign wars. Ms Abrams response, however, smoothed over those divides and presented the Democratic Party as the compassionate alternative to Mr Trump and the Republicans. ""Our progress has always been found in the refuge, in the basic instinct of the American experiment, to do right by our people,"" she said. As the Democratic presidential contest heats up, however, the differences within the party - and between the personalities battling to be the face of that party - will be impossible to ignore.

US runner suffocates cougar after attack,"Mountain lion attacks in North America are very rare. File image A man running on a popular park trail in the mountains of northern Colorado killed a mountain lion after it pounced on him from behind. Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) officials say the man sustained serious injuries after he was bitten on his face and wrist by the young male lion. The man, who has not been named, turned after hearing a noise behind him, just as the lion lunged, officials say. The cat died from suffocation, state wildlife officials have determined. Monday afternoon's attack occurred on the West Ridge Trail at Horsetooth Mountain Open Space near the city of Fort Collins - about 66 miles (106km) from Denver. The victim ""described hearing something behind him on the trail and was attacked by a mountain lion as he turned around to investigate,"" according to an official statement. ""The lion lunged at the runner, biting his face and wrist. He was able to fight and break free from the lion, killing the lion in self-defence."" After killing the predator, the man was able to leave the park on his own and call for help.

Cougars, also known as mountain lions, panthers or pumas, are members of the wild cat family. They live across the Americas, from British Columbia to Argentina. Mountain lion attacks in North America are very rare, officials say - CPW says fewer than a dozen people have been killed in more than a century. Instances of attacks are often seen among sick or starving lions, which normally are elusive and tend to avoid humans. The animal in Monday's attack has been taken to a nearby lab for a post-mortem examination to be performed. The Horsetooth Mountain Open Space is a popular hiking spot outside Fort Collins If you ever see a big cat, authorities say not to run, since that may trigger the lion's hunting reflexes. ""Running may stimulate a lion's instinct to chase and attack,"" the park service said. Cougar kills US cyclist and mauls another Victims of 'emaciated' US cougar named Instead people should stand firm and make an effort to look larger, and if attacked, fight back using any weapon at hand. ""What you want to do is convince the lion you are not prey and that you may in fact be a danger to the lion,"" officials said in a statement. ""People have fought back with rocks, sticks, caps or jackets, garden tools and their bare hands successfully,"" the park statement read, adding that sensitive areas such as the eyes should be targeted first. Last May, one cyclist was killed and another injured by what authorities described as an ""emaciated"" cougar in Washington state.

"Man 'filmed dying girlfriend' at festivalJurors hear Ceon Broughton told Louella Fletcher-Michie's family she was being a ""drama queen"".Dorset","Louella Fletcher-Michie was found dead in a wooded area on the edge of the Bestival festival site A man who gave his girlfriend drugs at a music festival filmed her and branded her a ""drama queen"" as she lay dying, a court has heard. Louella Fletcher-Michie, 24, the daughter of Holby City actor John Michie, was found dead in woods on the Bestival site in Dorset in 2017. Boyfriend Ceon Broughton, 29, failed to seek help because he feared breaching a suspended jail sentence, jurors heard. He denies manslaughter and supplying drugs. William Mousley QC, prosecuting at Winchester Crown Court, said the defendant had given his girlfriend the Class A drug 2CP while they attended the event in the grounds of Lulworth Castle in September 2017. ""He did not intend to cause her harm and Louella willingly took that which she was given, but it had a terrible effect,"" he said. Ms Fletcher-Michie died after a ""significant period of suffering"", he said, and Mr Broughton had continued filming ""when she was disturbed, agitated, and then seriously ill"" over several hours. ""He even did so, the prosecution suggest, after she was apparently dead,"" Mr Mousley said. In video clips shown to the court, Ms Fletcher-Michie repeatedly shouts at Mr Broughton to telephone her mother but he tells her to ""put your phone away"". Carol Fletcher-Michie eventually spoke to her daughter at 18:48 BST, growing concerned when she ""could hear her screeching"". Her parents were so worried they set off for the festival, repeatedly messaging and calling Mr Broughton, the prosecutor told the jury. Sam, her brother, also contacted Mr Broughton and urged him to seek medical help. However, Mr Broughton replied, saying ""call back in an hour"" and referred to Louella as a ""drama queen"", jurors heard. Ceon Broughton, 29, denies manslaughter and supplying Class A drugs The court was told Mr Broughton was handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended for one year, a month before Ms Fletcher-Michie's death. ""His failure to get her treatment which may well have saved her life was borne of selfishness and in self-preservation,"" Mr Mousley said. ""Because to have done otherwise, to have acted positively, he knew would have exposed him to the possibility of arrest and prosecution for a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment."" ""Failure to act was a substantial cause of her death,"" he added. Stephen Kamlish QC, defending, denied claims Mr Broughton acted out of selfishness, saying he tried to carry his ""loving girlfriend"" out of the woods but failed because the terrain was hilly and full of thorns and nettles. He told jurors Ms Fletcher-Mitchie bought the drugs before Mr Broughton arrived at the festival and they could only find him guilty of gross negligence manslaughter if he had given her the drugs and she had been at an ""obvious risk of dying"". Mr Kamlish said no-one had ever been known to have died from taking 2CP. He added: ""Ceon and Louella were in love with each other and willingly chose to take drugs together. Mistakes, even serious mistakes... are nowhere near enough for a crime such as this to be guilty."" Jurors have been asked if they watch Holby City, which stars Ms Fletcher-Michie's father John Michie Mr Kamlish said Mr Broughton had tried to get people to his girlfriend at an earlier stage and had tried to restrain her when she was ""thrashing about, injuring herself"". He said: ""He couldn't actually have done any more than he did... in this difficult and frightening situation."" He told the court the couple liked to film each other when they were taking drugs. Mr Broughton, 29, of Island Centre Way, Enfield, London, denies manslaughter and supplying Class A drugs. The trial continues.

Pride of place for boy called Trump,"Joshua Trump has been bullied for sharing a name with the president A schoolboy bullied for his surname - Trump - will attend the president's State of the Union address on Tuesday. Joshua Trump, an 11-year-old boy from Wilmington in Delaware, is not related to US President Donald Trump. But his parents say his classmates call him an ""idiot"" and ""stupid"" for sharing the Trump name. Senators and members of Congress also invite guests to the Capitol, with both parties using their choices to make clear political statements. Joshua, however, will beone of 13 people specially invited to the address,externalby the president and the First Lady. His parents, Megan Trump and Bobby Berto, told ABC affiliate WPVI last December that the bullying had started in 2015, when President Trump first announced that he was running for office. Despite sharing a surname, the president is not related After finding out he was being called names, they pulled him out of school and home-educated him for a year until he joined middle school. They hoped that he wouldn't be bullied in his new school, but he was. ""He said he hates himself, and he hates his last name, and he feels sad all the time, and he doesn't want to live feeling like that anymore,"" Ms Trump said at the time. A White House statement says that although Joshua has been bullied for sharing the president's last name, ""he is thankful to the First Lady and the Trump family for their support"". Other people invited by the president and First Lady includea survivor of a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, a young woman recovering from long-term substance abuse, and the family of a couple that were killed in a shooting last month - which was allegedly carried out by an illegal immigrant. There's no denying that there's a political message behind many of the guests the president has chosen. Mainly, he wants to make clear that he's tough on terrorism and immigration. But senators and Congress members from both main political parties are grabbing the opportunity to send messages of their own. Senators and members of Congress invite their own guests to the address at the Capitol Many Democrats and Republicans are bringing guests from either side of the border wall dispute - a cornerstone of President Trump's electoral campaign in 2016, which continues to be extremely contentious. Democrats Jimmy Gomez and Bonnie Watson Coleman have both invited former employees of Trump National Golf Club, who were reportedly undocumented at the time they worked there. ""President Trump justified shutting the government down for five weeks by demonising immigrants as the scourge of the country and the root of our nation's crime and insecurity,"" Ms Coleman wrote in a statement. ""Meanwhile, CEO Trump led a company that has relied extensively on the hard work of undocumented immigrants like my constituent... to keep his resorts clean and his putting greens trimmed."" Part of a fence at the US-Mexico border And Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, from Oregon, is bringing a mother and daughter from Guatemala who were separated for almost two months at the southern border last year. ""This child separation policy came from a dark and evil place within the heart of this administration,"" Mr Merkley said in a statement, adding that his guests would help the country ""bear witness to the suffering that this cruel policy inflicted"". Some Democrats have also invited transgender veterans, in response toa ban against trans people serving in the military that was enacted last month. Among them will be Tavion Dignard, a trans man who served in the US Navy for four years, and Logan Ireland, an air force sergeant who served in Afghanistan. Stacey Abrams to respond to Trump speech Migrants force-fed at Texas facility On the other side of the political spectrum, Republicans Marsha Blackburn and Tim Burchett have jointly invited a couple whose son was killed in a car crash - for which an undocumented migrant from Mexico has been charged. Republican congressmen Andy Biggs and Chip Roy are bringing border patrol officials. Mr Biggs has invited border patrol agent Art Del Cueto, while Mr Roy is bringing Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council. But this isn't the first time politicians have used their State of the Union invites to make a statement. Last year, as well as wearing black to show their solidarity with the #MeToo movement, many Democrats invited people from the Daca and Dream programmes for undocumented migrants who were brought to the US as minors.

What we know about NK nuclear programme,"The Hwasong-18 missile uses solid fuel North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un plans to meet President Putin this month about potentially providing Moscow with weapons for its war in Ukraine, according to a US official. There are concerns that in return, North Korea may seek advanced weapons technology from Russia. North Korea has continued regular tests of its missiles this year, after a significant increase in tests carried out in 2022. North Korea has tested a variety of ballistic and cruise missiles in recent years. It's also tested hypersonic missiles, which can fly at several times the speed of sound and at low altitude to escape radar detection, as well as others launched from submarines. In April, North Korea tested what it called ""its most powerful"" missile to date - the Hwasong-18. It's a solid-fuel missile, which are generally quicker to launch than liquid-fuel ones. It reportedly flew about 1,000km on its maiden flight, but its true range is estimated to be in excess of 15,000km, according to the US-based CSIS Missile Defense Project. A second test launch in July 2023 saw a Hwasong-18 reach a claimed altitude of over 6,600km, with a flight time of 74 minutes. In November last year, an intercontinental ballistic missilewas tested at a high angle, short-range trajectory. Launched at a lower trajectory, this same missile could have reached the US mainland, according to the Japanese government. Images from North Korean state media of Kim Jong-un with his daughter at the launch appear to show it was the Hwasong-17 - or possibly a modified version of it. The missile is believed to have a range of 15,000km or more, and could potentially carry three or four warheads, rather than only one. Several earlier attempts to launch the Hwasong-17 are thought to have failed, althoughit may have been used in a test carried out in March 2022.,external In October last year, North Korea fired another type of missile which flew over Japan - thought to have been the intermediate-range Hwasong-12. This can travel up to 4,500km - putting the US island of Guam in the Pacific within range. North Korea has also been testing the Hwasong-14 ballistic missile with a range of 8,000km - although some studies suggest it could travel as far as 10,000km, making it capable of reaching New York. And there is the Hwasong-15 missile, which is believed to have a range of 13,000km, putting all of the continental US in its sights. North Korea tested a record number of missiles in 2022, including ones capable of reaching US territory. The last time North Korea tested a nuclear bomb was in 2017. The explosion at its Punggye-ri test site had a force, or ""yield"", of between 100-370 kilotons. A 100 kiloton bomb is six times more powerful than the one the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. North Korea claimed this was its first thermonuclear device- the most powerful of all types of atomic weapon. However, North Korea may be aiming to test a smaller type of nuclear warhead with similar explosive force, according to Joseph Byrne, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. ""It seems they are now testing a new capability - a miniaturised warhead that can be fitted onto a range of missiles, including short-range missiles"" he says. North Korea says it simulated nuclear strike on South Six underground tests have previously been carried out at Punggye-ri. However, in 2018 North Korea saidit would shut the site down, because it had ""verified"" its nuclear capabilities. Some of the tunnels into the site were subsequently blown up in the presence of foreign journalists. However, North Korea did not invite international experts to verify if it had been put beyond use. In 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a promise to then-US president Donald Trumpthat North Korea would destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities. However, the UN's atomic energy agency, the IAEA, says satellite images suggest that North Korea has restarted the reactor which makes its weapons-grade plutonium. In September 2022, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said there were signs that a test site at Punggye-ri was open again.  And in March this year, Mr Grossi said that activity thereas well as at Yongbyon was ""deeply regrettable."",external The IAEA has not had physical access to North Korea's nuclear facilities since April 2009.

Three things to look for in speech,"On Tuesday night, a week later than originally scheduled (the protracted government shutdown got in the way), the president will take the short car ride from the White House to the Capitol and deliver his State of the Union speech. It's like the State Opening of Parliament at Westminster - except without the horses and carriages - and of course there's no throne or crown. But this is the big set-piece of the Washington year. So what to expect? Well, let's break it down into three bite size chunks: This is going to be a speech where Nancy Pelosi, the new Democratic Party Speaker of the House, is going to be looking over her shoulder. Literally. While Donald Trump will deliver the address from the House of Representatives floor, she sits behind a desk on a slightly raised level. Sitting to her right will be Vice-President Mike Pence. One will be applauding a lot and smiling broadly; the other less so. Why this matters is that there is a new political reality for Donald Trump: the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is no longer a friendly place for the president. Add to that the growing field of Democratic 2020 presidential challengers, all eager to become the voice of every single anti-Trump voter. Trump's border wall pledge may be his 'read my lips' moment The remarkable comeback of America's most powerful woman After he speaks on Tuesday, the Democratic response will be given by Stacey Abrams, the first African-American woman to give the formal ""rebuttal"" of a president's State of the Union. She narrowly lost a tight contest for Georgia governor last November, but impressed many in her party with her campaign and has now been marked out as a rising star. Front and centre of this speech is going to be the president's battle to get funding for his border wall. Those with pesky long memories will recall that Mexico was going to pay for it. But that hasn't happened so the American taxpayer is going to have to foot the bill. And before Christmas, Donald Trump shut down the government over his demand that $5.7bn (Â£4.3bn) be allocated for building work. Government workers queued for free food during the shutdown Just shy of a million workers were laid off. After five weeks, the government re-opened without a single extra cent pledged towards the wall. He'd got into an arm wrestle with the woman who'll be looking over his shoulder tonight, and came second. This State of the Union comes at a midway point - the president reopened the government for three weeks in the hope that a way forward could be found on funding his wall. Spoiler alert: They won't come up with the money. The US-Mexico border is already fenced for hundreds of miles. So look out for the president saying something about declaring a state of emergency on the southern border as a way of being able to secure the funding. It would be a risky move, as it will be subject to legal challenge - and that will delay things still further. It might also lead to a vote in the Senate in which some Republicans side with Democrats and pass a motion expressing disapproval of the president's move. With the numbers of illegal immigrants crossing the border falling annually, the president's opponents would ask, what is the national emergency? So he might prefer not to upset the apple cart on such an auspicious occasion and keep that trump card for the days ahead. The president still hopes he'll be able to make progress on rebuilding America's creaking infrastructure. More on the US government shutdown US shutdown cost $3bn, says budget office How Trump's own book explains his battle for the wall Eighteen ways the US shutdown is hurting Overseas he'll talk about the fight being nearly won against the Islamic State group; he'll trumpet America's support for Juan GuaidÃ³ in Venezuela. And of course the need for fair trade that protects the American worker. Expect a lot about ending political stalemates, bridging divisions, healing wounds, building new coalitions. Though just as important with a President Trump State of the Union speech is what is said either side of the speech. Remember Teleprompter Donald and Twitter Donald are not always the same person. If no deal is reached by 15 February, the shutdown may resume. Going back to choreography, remember that Mr Trump on Tuesday night will feel Nancy Pelosi breathing down his neck (this time more metaphorically than literally). It is true that in the mid-term elections the Republicans increased their majority in the Senate with wins in states that should never have gone to the Democrats. But more significant were the nationwide results in the House. Suburban America for the most part turned its back on the president. Large numbers of women who'd voted for him in 2016 also cocked a snook at him. Polls during and after the government shutdown showed a lot of blue-collar families walking away from the Trump brand. There is no path to victory in 2020 without bringing these people back into the fold. Until now, President Trump has focused on his core support and summonedhis inner Meghan Trainor and sung only one song,external- it's all about that base. But maybe with 2020 beckoning, the president is recognising the need to reach beyond a narrowing cohort of voters. As befitting a child of the 1960s, maybe he's now going to besinging Come Together,external.

US envoy heads to N Korea for nuclear talks,"Stephen Biegun is the US envoy for North Korea The US envoy for North Korea has been holding talks in Pyongyang, paving the way for a second leadership summit. Stephen Biegun arrived just as US PresidentDonald Trump confirmed he would meet North Korea's Kim Jong-unin Vietnam on 27-28 February. The two leaders will build on the vague denuclearisation commitments they made when they met in Singapore last June. Meanwhile, the UN has warned that North Korea is continuing its nuclear programme and breaking sanctions. The report said actions including the illegal transfer of banned goods at sea could make sanctions - the international community's main way of putting pressure on North Korea - ""ineffective"". The Singapore summit generated significant coverage and optimism, but delivered very few concrete developments. Both sides said they were committed to denuclearisation, but with no details of how this would be carried out or verified. The Kim-Trump summit was big on handshakes and rhetoric but low on detail Experts caution that despite Mr Trump's declaration that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat,the country has never said it would give up its nuclear weapons programmewithout similar concessions from the US. After holding talks with officials in South Korea, Mr Biegun travelled to Pyongyang to talk with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Hyok-chol. Mr Biegun said he wanted to achieve some ""concrete deliverables"". The US state department has said his visit will ""advance further progress on the commitments the president and Chairman Kim made in Singapore"". When Trump met Kim: What happened next? North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? The US wants North Korea to make a full declaration of all its nuclear weapons facilities and commit to destroying them, under international supervision - something North Korea has never said it will do. In a speech at Stanford University last week, Mr Biegun said the US would not agree to lift sanctions until this happens, but he indicated it could provide assistance in other ways, saying: ""We did not say we will not do anything until you do everything."" He also said Kim Jong-un had previously committed to ""the dismantlement and destruction"" of all North Korea's plutonium and uranium facilities, which provide the material for nuclear weapons. This video can not be played North Korea's leaders ""view nuclear as key to regime survival"" But a report to the UN Security Council on Monday suggested North Korea was continuing its nuclear and missiles programmes, while making efforts to protect its facilities from possible future strike. The confidential report, a copy of which was seen by news agencies, also said North Korea was routinely breaking international sanctions. The report said there had been a ""massive increase in illegal ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products and coal"" - where material is moved from non-North Korean ships out at sea to evade monitoring. The international sanctions against North Korea are designed to severely limit its import and export abilities, with the aim of putting pressure on the country to give up its nuclear ambitions. But Reuters quoted the report as saying that violations on this scale ""render the latest UN sanctions ineffective"". North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul This UN report states what to many is blindingly obvious - North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes ""remain intact"" despite the ""tremendous progress"" hailed by the Trump administration. But Pyongyang's pledges, which we have heard through either the South Koreans or the Americans, were very specific. They said they would destroy a nuclear testing site and dismantle a rocket launch site. The North Koreans have at no point said they will hand over all their weapons nor that they would stop building them. This is why getting a detailed deal is so important. North Korea has, through the South Korean president, pledged to destroy a nuclear processing plant, but only if the US takes corresponding steps. We expect this to be the focus of at least some of the talks between the two sides over the next few weeks. What is interesting about this report, and perhaps more worrying for the Trump administration, is that their main diplomatic tool to encourage Kim Jong-un to get to the negotiating table may now be ""ineffective"". There have been many reports of illegal ship-to-ship transfers of oil and coal over the last year, but sanctions monitors now say there is a ""massive increase"". If Pyongyang is finding a way around these strict sanctions, then it means Washington's maximum pressure strategy is never going to work. We are entering a pivotal month in this peninsula's future and this report highlights the challenges facing the Trump administration. It also raises the question, that if these talks fail, and sanctions are no longer effective, what does the US do next? Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? What missiles has North Korea been testing? Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore?

Trump calls for unity in Congress speech,"This video can not be played An eye-roll, a chant  and an unexpected ovation US President Donald Trump has announced in his State of the Union speech that he will hold a second nuclear summit with North Korea's leader this month. In an address to the nation with the theme ""Choosing Greatness"", he vowed once again to build a border wall. While appealing for political unity, the Republican president also said ""ridiculous partisan investigations"" could damage US prosperity. In a rebuttal, Democrats accused Mr Trump of abandoning US values. His primetime address came less than a fortnight after he backed down to end the longest ever US government shutdown when Democrats refused to fund a US-Mexico border wall. Fact-checking Trump's speech to Congress The Pelosi Clap and other curious talking points Federal agencies could close again if no spending plan is agreed by the end of next week. The president said in his 82-minute speech on Tuesday night that he would meet Kim Jong-un in Vietnam from 27-28 February. ""Much work remains to be done,"" Mr Trump said, ""but my relationship with Kim Jong-un is a good one."" Plans for a second summit have been in the works since the two leaders' historic talks last year. Mr Trump and Mr Kim's meeting last June in Singapore was the first ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. While Pyongyang has not conducted any atomic or ballistic missile tests since last summer, it has yet to agree to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme. The US envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, is in Pyongyang for talks,paving the way for the second leadership summit. Key challenges at second Trump-Kim summit When Trump met Kim: What happened next? Trump vows to end China's job 'theft' This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on Analysis by Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul Mr Trump's goal will be to extract pledges from Kim Jong-un without giving too much ground. The Trump administration has said it is not willing to lift sanctions, but it has mentioned helping out the North's economy. However, handing over such aid to a secretive state which has yet to declare a list of its weapons facilities or allow in independent inspectors is bound to raise more than eyebrows. So Mr Trump has to extract a written pledge from Mr Kim. Otherwise these summits will be seen as all show, and very little substance. As for Mr Kim's bargaining chips, we have been told he could be prepared to give up his nuclear production site known as Yongbyon. I've also been told by some sources close to Pyongyang that Mr Kim does want to achieve something his father and grandfather never did. A peace treaty. The prospect of becoming the US president who ended the 68-year long Korean War is bound to be a tantalising one for Mr Trump. After two years of rancorous partisanship, Mr Trump on Tuesday night repeated calls for political unity that he has made in his last two annual speeches to Congress. ""Together, we can break decades of political stalemate,"" he said. ""We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions."" Mr Trump raised potential areas of agreement, such as infrastructure improvements, lowering prescription drug costs and fighting childhood cancer. But he added: ""An economic miracle is taking place in the United States and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations."" Democrats have launched a flurry of inquiries into the Trump administration since they took over the US House of Representatives last month. This video can not be played ""You weren't supposed to do that!"" - Trump and Democratic women share an unexpected moment of unity A special prosecutor is still investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, which the president and Moscow deny. As Mr Trump delivered his nationally televised speech, his chief congressional antagonist was sitting at the rostrum over his shoulder. The Democratic leader of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, tweeted afterwards: ""It will take days to fact-check all the misrepresentations that the president made tonight."" Pride of place for a boy called Trump Donald Trump set for second visit to UK A photo of Nancy Pelosi clapping after Mr Trump's address has gone viral It was a speech that was billed as bipartisan, but beneath the flowery language were the same sharp divides and disagreements. Mr Trump has never really acknowledged his party's ballot-box defeat in the mid-term elections last November. By instigating the recently concluded government shutdown, he acted like he still had the political upper hand - even when it was clear to almost everyone that this was not the case. So this State of the Union address presented a quandary. How can a president reconcile himself to divided government while still asserting that everything is going great for him? For this president, the answer was to effectively shrug at the setbacks. To focus his message, where it counted, towards his political base. And to stick with the message that won him the presidency in 2016 and, he appears to believe, will keep him in the White House for another term next year. Five takeaways from Trump's speech This video can not be played Stacey Abrams delivered the Democratic response to President Trump Stacey Abrams, who lost her race last year to be governor of Georgia, delivered the Democrats' response to Mr Trump. She was the first African-American woman to give the party's rebuttal. Ms Abrams said: ""The shutdown was a stunt engineered by the president of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people - but our values."" She also said that while she is ""disappointed"" with Mr Trump, ""I still don't want him to fail."" Democratic female lawmakers who attended Mr Trump's speech wore white to celebrate the 100th anniversary of American women gaining the right to vote. They sat stony-faced as their Republican counterparts rose for the applause lines. But Democrats surprised Mr Trump with a standing ovation when he said there were more women in the workforce and in Congress than ever before. ""That's great!"" said the president, delighted by their reaction. ""Really great."" US First Lady Melania Trump (R) waves as Ivanka Trump (L) looks on Mr Trump said his administration was holding ""constructive talks"" with the Taliban to find a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan. ""The hour has come to at least try for peace,"" he added. The president also said ""virtually all"" of the territory once occupied in Syria and Iraq by the Islamic State group had been liberated from ""these bloodthirsty monsters"". ""It is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home,"" he told the chamber. He said 7,000 US troops had died and more than $7tn (Â£5.4tn) had been spent by America on nearly two decades of war in the Middle East. ""Great nations do not fight endless wars,"" said the president, who campaigned on an 'America First' platform. The president devoted much of his speech to border security, vowing once again to build a US-Mexico barrier and calling illegal immigration ""an urgent national crisis"". But he refrained from declaring a national emergency that might allow him to bypass Congress for wall funding. With another government shutdown deadline impending on 15 February, the president has few options to deliver his signature campaign promise. Mr Trump told his audience that working-class Americans pay the price for illegal immigration. At the scene - By Tara McKelvey, BBC News Despite the president's call for unity, the reception from Democrats was frosty for most of the evening. Meanwhile, Republicans shouted their approval - especially when Mr Trump talked about the wall along the southern border. When the president said: ""The state of our union is strong"", members of his party stood and chanted: ""USA!"" The Democrats stayed seated. But then the mood changed. As the president noted the record number of women in Congress, Democrats gave a standing ovation - and they began shouting: ""USA!"" Republicans joined in - they all chanted together. Bitter adversaries experienced a rare, happy moment of togetherness. And the president was right in the middle of it.

"Boy bullied for Trump name invited to speechMocked at school for his name, Joshua Trump is now a guest at the State of The Union address.US & Canada","Joshua Trump has been bullied for sharing a name with the president A schoolboy bullied for his surname - Trump - will attend the president's State of the Union address on Tuesday. Joshua Trump, an 11-year-old boy from Wilmington in Delaware, is not related to US President Donald Trump. But his parents say his classmates call him an ""idiot"" and ""stupid"" for sharing the Trump name. Senators and members of Congress also invite guests to the Capitol, with both parties using their choices to make clear political statements. Joshua, however, will beone of 13 people specially invited to the address,externalby the president and the First Lady. His parents, Megan Trump and Bobby Berto, told ABC affiliate WPVI last December that the bullying had started in 2015, when President Trump first announced that he was running for office. Despite sharing a surname, the president is not related After finding out he was being called names, they pulled him out of school and home-educated him for a year until he joined middle school. They hoped that he wouldn't be bullied in his new school, but he was. ""He said he hates himself, and he hates his last name, and he feels sad all the time, and he doesn't want to live feeling like that anymore,"" Ms Trump said at the time. A White House statement says that although Joshua has been bullied for sharing the president's last name, ""he is thankful to the First Lady and the Trump family for their support"". Other people invited by the president and First Lady includea survivor of a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, a young woman recovering from long-term substance abuse, and the family of a couple that were killed in a shooting last month - which was allegedly carried out by an illegal immigrant. There's no denying that there's a political message behind many of the guests the president has chosen. Mainly, he wants to make clear that he's tough on terrorism and immigration. But senators and Congress members from both main political parties are grabbing the opportunity to send messages of their own. Senators and members of Congress invite their own guests to the address at the Capitol Many Democrats and Republicans are bringing guests from either side of the border wall dispute - a cornerstone of President Trump's electoral campaign in 2016, which continues to be extremely contentious. Democrats Jimmy Gomez and Bonnie Watson Coleman have both invited former employees of Trump National Golf Club, who were reportedly undocumented at the time they worked there. ""President Trump justified shutting the government down for five weeks by demonising immigrants as the scourge of the country and the root of our nation's crime and insecurity,"" Ms Coleman wrote in a statement. ""Meanwhile, CEO Trump led a company that has relied extensively on the hard work of undocumented immigrants like my constituent... to keep his resorts clean and his putting greens trimmed."" Part of a fence at the US-Mexico border And Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, from Oregon, is bringing a mother and daughter from Guatemala who were separated for almost two months at the southern border last year. ""This child separation policy came from a dark and evil place within the heart of this administration,"" Mr Merkley said in a statement, adding that his guests would help the country ""bear witness to the suffering that this cruel policy inflicted"". Some Democrats have also invited transgender veterans, in response toa ban against trans people serving in the military that was enacted last month. Among them will be Tavion Dignard, a trans man who served in the US Navy for four years, and Logan Ireland, an air force sergeant who served in Afghanistan. Stacey Abrams to respond to Trump speech Migrants force-fed at Texas facility On the other side of the political spectrum, Republicans Marsha Blackburn and Tim Burchett have jointly invited a couple whose son was killed in a car crash - for which an undocumented migrant from Mexico has been charged. Republican congressmen Andy Biggs and Chip Roy are bringing border patrol officials. Mr Biggs has invited border patrol agent Art Del Cueto, while Mr Roy is bringing Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council. But this isn't the first time politicians have used their State of the Union invites to make a statement. Last year, as well as wearing black to show their solidarity with the #MeToo movement, many Democrats invited people from the Daca and Dream programmes for undocumented migrants who were brought to the US as minors.

Pope says priests kept nuns as sex slavesPope Francis admits that nuns have been sexually abused by clerics - and it is an ongoing problem.Europe,"Pope Francis made the admission while visiting the Middle East Pope Francis has admitted that clerics have sexually abused nuns, and in one case they were kept as sex slaves. He said in that case his predecessor, Pope Benedict, was forced to shut down an entire congregation of nuns who were being abused by priests. It is thought to be the first time that Pope Francis has acknowledged the sexual abuse of nuns by the clergy. He said the Church was attempting to address the problem but said it was ""still going on"". Last November, the Catholic Church's global organisation for nuns denounced the ""culture of silence and secrecy"" that prevented them from speaking out. The Pope's comments come amid long-running cases of sexual abuse of children and young men by priests at the Church. Child sex abuse and the Catholic Church Profile: Pope Francis Speaking to reporters while ona historic tour of the Middle Easton Tuesday, the pontiff admitted that the Church had an issue, and the roots lay in society ""seeing women as second class"". He said that priests and bishops had abused nuns, but said the Church was aware of the ""scandal"" and was ""working on it"", adding that a number of clerics had been suspended. ""It's a path that we've been on,"" he said. ""Pope Benedict had the courage to dissolve a female congregation which was at a certain level, because this slavery of women had entered it - slavery, even to the point of sexual slavery - on the part of clerics or the founder."" Pope Francis said sexual abuse of nuns was an ongoing problem, but happened largely in ""certain congregations, predominantly new ones"". ""I think it's still taking place because it's not as though the moment you become aware of something it goes away."" The female congregation dissolved in 2005 under Pope Benedict was the Community of St Jean, which was based in France, Alessandro Gisotti of the Vatican press office told CBS News. In 2013, the Community of St Jean admitted that priests had behaved ""in ways that went against chastity"" with several women in the order, according to the French Roman Catholic newspaper La Croix. In a separate case in India last year,a bishop was arrested over allegations that he raped a nun 13 timesbetween 2014 and 2016. Bishop Franco Mulakkal, who headed the diocese in Jalandhar in the northern state of Punjab, has denied the accusations. In Chile, reports of abuse of nuns carried out by priests led the Vatican to launch an investigation last year. The women were reportedly removed from the order after highlighting the abuse. Last year, the Associated Press news agency reportedcases of abuse in Italy and Africa,external. Just days ago theVatican's women's magazine, Women Church World, condemned the abuse,,externalsaying in some cases nuns were forced to abort priests' children - something Catholicism forbids. The magazine's editor, Lucetta Scaraffia, said Pope Francis's acknowledgement of the abuse ""can be of some help"", but warned that the Church needs to act. ""If the Church continues to close its eyes to the scandal... the condition of oppression of women in the church will never change,"" she wrote. The magazine saidthe #MeToo movement meant more women were now coming forwardwith their stories. Last year, French websiteLe Parisien reported the case of ""Christelle"" (in French),external, a former nun whose name was changed to preserve anonymity. Christelle said she had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of a priest of her congregation in France between 2010 and 2011. ""His gestures became more and more inappropriate,"" she said, adding: ""But he kept going... until the day he raped me. ""He was unable to control himself... he had a split personality.""
