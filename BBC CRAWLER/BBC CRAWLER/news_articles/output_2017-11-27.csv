Ms Markle will now find herself rubbing shoulders with the great and good of British high society. It is an experience familiar to the American nutritionist and author, and now Viscountess Hinchingbrooke, Julie Montagu. Ms Montagu, from Sugar Grove, Illinois, married John Montagu, the 11th Earl of Sandwich. ""It's about being respectful of the history, the history Megan is marrying into is older than America  itself,"" she told the BBC. ""At the same time, you don't want to lose who you are as a person and as an American."" Ms Markle has been dating Prince Harry since summer 2016 She said Ms Markle might face a steep learning curve when it came to pronunciation (""My first lesson was that 'viscount' doesn't rhyme with 'discount'"") and setting a table (""All those forks and knives and spoons... I had to have my husband show me how to set a table""). It would however be ""such a breath of fresh air to have an American"", she said.

"Corgis, camping... seven things we've learned","This video can not be played Meghan Markle has revealed that Prince Harry proposed on a Sunday night at home Prince Harry and Meghan Markle havegiven their first interviewsince their engagement was announced. Here are seven things we learned about their relationship. Just weeks after they met, Prince Harry convinced Ms Markle to join him on a trip to Botswana. ""We camped out with each other under the stars,"" the prince said. ""She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic."" He said being away allowed them to get to know each other without the usual pressures of royal life. The prince made sure his fiancee's engagement ring is personal to their relationship. Set in yellow gold - Ms Markle's ""favourite"" - the central diamond is from Botswana, where they first spent significant time together. It is flanked by two stones taken from the collection of Princess Diana, the prince's late mother. The couple spoke of how important it was to include Princess Diana in their engagement. Ms Markle said: ""Not being able to meet his mother, it's so important to me to know that she's a part of this with us."" Prince Harry said his mother would have been ""over the moon, jumping up and down"" at the engagement and ""best friends with Meghan"". ""It's days like this I really miss having her around,"" he added. Ms Markle credited her American background - and lack of exposure to British tabloids - with allowing her to get to know Prince Harry naturally and organically. For his part, the prince had never seen Suits, the American legal drama in which Ms Markle stars, and had never even heard of her before they met. They were both pleasantly surprised by their blind date. ""I was beautifully surprised when I walked into that room and saw her,"" he said. ""I was like, 'I'm really going to have to up my game here'."" What are your experiences of going on a blind date? Tell us your story athaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. The pair also announced that Ms Markle will not continue acting. ""I don't see it as giving anything up. I see it as a change. It's a new chapterâ¦"" she said. ""Now it's time to work as a team with you,"" she said as she turned to Prince Harry. They talked about forging a new role for themselves as a couple, focusing on the humanitarian causes over which they first bonded. The prince said Ms Markle would easily take to the role of being a member of the Royal Family and said they were a ""fantastic team"". The couple are living in Nottingham Cottage - circled above - in the grounds of Kensington Palace The couple described a quiet night at home, cooking a roast chicken together, when the prince surprised Ms Markle by getting down on one knee. Ms Markle described the moment. It was ""just a cosy night... trying to roast a chicken and it just - just an amazing surprise. ""It was so sweet and natural and very romantic,"" she said. And it was an instant ""yes"" from Ms Markle. ""I could barely let you finish proposing, I said - 'can I say yes now'?"" Ms Markle confirmed that one of her two dogs has followed her to London. And Prince Harry revealed the Queen's corgis took to her ""straight away"" when she met the monarch. ""I've spent the last 33 years being barked at,"" he said. ""This one walks in, absolutely nothing...  just wagging tails and I was just like argh."" Ms Markle said the corgis were ""just laying on my feet during tea, it was very sweet"". Prince Harry's brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are expecting their third child next year. But Ms Markle laughed when Prince Harry's answer to a question about their plans for having children was ""not currently"". The prince added: ""One step at a time and hopefully we'll start a family in the near future.""

Feud at US watchdog as Trump man arrives,"Mick Mulvaney - who has previously called the CFPB a ""sick, sad joke"" - brought donuts for staff on Monday The US consumer financial watchdog was plunged into turmoil on Monday as rival directors vied to take charge amid a lawsuit against the White House. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) director resigned last week and appointed his former chief of staff, Leandra English, to replace him. She has sued after President Donald Trump instead named his budget chief Mick Mulvaney to lead the CFPB. The CFPB, unpopular on Wall Street, was set up after the 2007 financial crash. Leandra English sent the agency's staff a brief email on Monday saying: ""It is an honor to work with all of you."" Ms English signed it, ""Acting Director"". Ms English (left) appeared for a photo-op with Democratic senators on Monday afternoon But Mr Mulvaney - who has previously called the CFPB a ""sick, sad joke"" that should be scrapped - arrived at the bureau on Monday morning carrying a bag of donuts for employees. Trump administration unveils plan to defang consumer watchdog He wrote in a memo to staff: ""Please disregard any instructions you receive from Ms English in her presumed capacity as Acting Director."" Mr Mulvaney also signed off as ""acting director"", urging staff to pop by his office on the fourth floor and ""grab a donut"". Allow Twitter content?

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News ""High drama"" and ""bureaucratic power struggle"" are words that don't usually go together, but these are unusual times in Washington, DC. A donut-carrying Republican who seemingly hates the controversial agency he's been tasked with running is up against a Democratic-appointed official who has filed a lawsuit that reaches new heights of legal snarkiness. Behind it all is the fact that the CFPB is a key component of Democratic attempts to rein in what they viewed as the recklessness and cruelty of big US financial institutions that contributed to the financial collapse of 2008. Republicans, on the other hand, consider the bureau to be a regulatory beast stifling economic growth. Republicans take aim at Dodd-Frank financial rules Given that conservative attempts to change the agency through legislation have run aground in the political morass that is the US Congress, the future of the CFPB largely rests in who is put in charge. In other government entities, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department and the Justice Department, Trump loyalists are hard at work altering the culture and curtailing the ambitions of federal bureaucrats. Now the administration has a chance to go to work on the CFPB. Democrats, however, are seemingly eager for a high-profile fight. The 1,600-employee watchdog was set up in 2010 to protect Americans from predatory lenders. Republicans say it has placed an excessive regulatory burden on Wall Street. Democrats say the CFPB is reining in the very excesses that helped spur the global financial crash a decade ago. Mr Trump took to Twitter on Saturday to criticise the agency, calling it a ""total disaster"". He argued that because of the CFPB ""financial institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public"". Trump tracker: How much has the president achieved so far? Richard Cordray quit as CFPB director on Friday amid speculation he may run for governor of Ohio next year. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Sunday, Ms English asked a judge at a federal court in Washington DC to issue a temporary restraining order against Mr Trump's appointment of Mr Mulvaney. In her lawsuit, she called herself the ""rightful acting director"" of the CFPB. The legal action said: ""The President's purported or intended appointment of defendant Mulvaney as Acting Director of the CFPB is unlawful."" The White House says the president has the authority to appoint Mr Mulvaney under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. But a lawyer for Ms English says the law states that as deputy director she is entitled to take power until the Senate can vote to confirm another director. The lawsuit has been assigned to a judge who was appointed this year by President Trump, Reuters news agency reports. A Trump administration lawyer who wrote the memo defending Mr Mulvaney's appointmentreportedly represented a Canadian payday lender,externalbefore the CFPB last year. Supporters of the consumer bureau held a demonstration on Monday Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the chamber's banking committee, called Ms English's lawsuit ""just the latest lawless action"" by the CFPB, which he called ""rogue"" and ""unconstitutional"". ""The President should fire her immediately and anyone who disobeys Director Mulvaney's orders should also be fired summarily,"" Mr Cotton wrote in a statement. But Illinois Democratic Senator Dick Durbin told CNN the White House decision was aimed at eradicating the CFPB. ""Wall Street hates it like the devil hates holy water,"" he said.

The left-wing senator from Massachusetts was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the CFPB and over the weekend she launched a stinging attack on the president. ""Less than a decade after taxpayers bailed out the big banks, the banking industry made record profits last year,"" she tweeted. ""That's who you're worried about, realDonaldTrump?"" It was therefore probably no coincidence that Mr Trump on Monday used his nickname for her, Pocahontas, to describe her to an audience of Native Americans. This video can not be played The US president makes a joke about Senator Elizabeth Warren in front of Native Americans. Mrs Warren, who has Native American heritage, responded by saying it was ""deeply unfortunate"" that the president ""can't even make it through a ceremony honouring these heroes without throwing out a racial slur"".

Gun background checks soar on Black Friday,"The FBI received over 200,000 requests for background checks to own a gun on Black Friday, overtaking last year's single-day record by nearly 10%. Black Friday, the day after the US Thanksgiving holiday, had previously set records for the most instant FBI background checks in 2015 and 2016. The database is meant to prevent criminals and other Americans barred from owning guns from purchasing them. Last week the US Justice Department ordered a full review of the database. The FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check (NICS) database system said they fielded 203,086 background checks on Black Friday, a day when US retailers mark down prices on their products to kick off the annual holiday gift-shopping period. The previous record of 185,713 background checks was set on Black Friday a year earlier,according to figures provided by the FBI,external. The FBI cautions that ""a one-to-one correlation cannot be made"" between checks and actual sales, since one background check may yield several gun sales. They did not indicate what may have caused the uptick in sales. Jeff Sessions announces review into background checks Las Vegas shooting: Gun shares rise in wake of attack Gun sales have generally risen during periods when lawmakers have indicated that they may take action to restrict gun ownership. Sales rose after former President Barack Obama's election - due to fears he would restrict them - and have fallen since Donald Trump became US president. Mr Obama had previously told BBC News that his biggest regret as president was not passing ""meaningful"" gun reform during his time in office. Last weekthe Department of Justice ordered a review of the background check system,externalto determine whether law enforcement agencies are properly reporting crimes to the FBI. The review was ordered by Attorney General Jeff Sessions following revelations that a gun rampage at a Texas church which left 26 people dead was committed by a former US airman who had been legally stripped of his right to own weapons. Devin P Kelley was convicted of assault and discharged from the military. The US Air Force later admitted that they had failed to notify the FBI's NICS of the gunman's conviction, allowing him to purchase several weapons from legal distributers.

Back in November last year, Prince Harry spoke out against what he called a ""wave of abuse and harassment"" against Ms Markle from the media and others. In a statement, he said there had been ""racial undertones"" in comment pieces and ""outright sexism and racism"" on social media. Ms Markle spoke in the interview earlier about her reaction to the coverage. ""Of course it's disheartening. It's a shame that is the climate in this world, to focus that much on that, or that it would be discriminatory in that sense,"" she said. ""At the end of the day I'm really proud of who I am and where I come from and we have never put any focus on that, we just focus on who we are as a couple."" Tonight's Eastenders will feature a short scene, filmed earlier today, which will make reference to the engagement. The scene is set in Kathyâs cafe. Prince Harry described the ring he gave to Ms Markle, which he designed and which includes diamonds from Diana's jewelry collection. He said the inclusion of the diamonds was ""to make sure she is with us on this crazy journey together"". Asked what it meant to her, Ms Markle said: ""Not being able to meet his mother, it's so important to me to know that she's a part of this with us."" Harry said Diana would have been ""over the moon, jumping up and down"" at the engagement and ""best friends with Meghan"". ""It's days like this I really miss having her around,"" he said. Ms Markle said she had met members of Harry's family on Charles and Diana's side, and described them as ""so welcoming"". She said she had met the Queen ""a couple of times"". ""It's incredible to meet her through his lens... The love that he has for his grandma, all of those layers have been so important to me."" Asked about their own plans, Harry said: ""One step at a time, hopefully we'll start a family in the near future."" You can watch the interview live now on BBC One using the player at the top of this page. Prince Harry described the couple as a ""fantastic team"" and said Ms Markle would easily take to the role of being a member of the Royal Family. ""The fact that I fell in love with Meghan so incredibly
quickly was confirmation to me that all the stars were aligned,"" he said. ""This beautiful
woman just tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life. I know that she
will be unbelievably good at the job part of it as well."" She said she would ""transition out of my career but into the role"" of being in the family. ""I'm excited to really get to know more about the different communities here and smaller organisations that are working on the same causes that I've always been passionate about."" The couple were introduced by a mutual friend in July 2016. Both knew they were being set up, but said they knew little about each other before the date. Ms Markle said the only thing she asked their mutual friend was: ""Is he nice?"" Harry said he had never heard of Ms Markle and never seen her TV drama, Suits. ""I was beautifully surprised when I walked into that room and saw her,"" he said. ""I was like, 'I'm really going to have to up my game here'."" Three or four weeks later, Prince Harry persuaded Ms Markle to join him in Botswana, he said, and the couple camped out under the stars for five days. ""We were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure we had a chance to get to know each other,"" he said. Prince Harry and his fiance Meghan Markle have described the night that he proposed to her, at the couple's shared cottage at Kensington Palace. In an interview with the BBC's Mishal Hussein, they revealed they were having an ordinary night in and ""trying to roast a chicken"" when Harry got down on one knee. ""It was just an amazing surprise,"" said Ms Markle. ""It was so sweet and natural and very romantic, he got on one knee."" It was an instant yes, she said. ""She didn't even let me finish,"" Harry said. Could the new Star Wars film be the newly-engaged couples first appearence? Meghan Markle's first official royal engagement could turn out to be the premiere of the Star Wars movie The Last Jedi. The European screening of the latest installment in the hit saga is set for 12 December at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The premiere will benefit the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of
Cambridge and Prince Harry, raising speculation that William, Kate and Harry
could attend. William and Harry are reported to have appeared in The Last Jedi in cameo roles
as Stormtroopers. The royals - both Star Wars fans - visited the set of movie in April 2016 and
were rumoured to have filmed a scene in disguise. Harry meets Chewie on the set of ""The Last Jedi"" last year The head of one of the UK's tourism bodies thinks that the next royal wedding is a ""potent mix"" which could boost visitor numbers. Bernard Donoghue, director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions,
said Ms Markle's American citizenship could generate even more interest than the marriage of William and Kate. ""The combination of Prince Harry's global fame, Meghan Markle's global fame as
an actress, her being American, Britain being much more affordable than it was
two years ago, really makes for a potent mix,"" he said. ""This is the first time an American actress has married a prince since Grace
Kelly,"" he added. Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Radlan (L) at the Invictus Games in Toronto earlier this year Since the announcement of the happy couple's engagement this morning, everyone from royal correspondents to Twitter users have been passing comment on Ms Markle's mixed-race heritage. In 2015, she wrote a first-person piece for Elle magazine laying out how she feels about it. In part, she spoke of having to fill out  a ""census"" for her English class, with the only options of black, white, Hispanic, or Asian. You could only choose one, but that would be to choose one parent over the other â and one half of myself over the other.  Her teacher told her to pick Caucasian, because - in the teacher's view - that's what she looked like. But a young Meghan refused. So, I didn't tick a box. I left my identity blank â a question mark, an absolute incomplete â much like how I felt. When I went home that night, I told my dad what had happened. He said the words that have always stayed with me: 'If that happens again, you draw your own box.'  Read the full feature at Elle magazine's website.,external Royal couple need 'something to sail around the sea with' Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee,
noted there is no  royal yacht and suggested the newly-engaged couple could make use of one. During a debate on new aircraft carrier provision Mr Tugendhat pleaded ""....with the royal wedding coming as early as next year, and with the absence
of the yacht Britannia, is there not a possibility the new prince and princess
will require something to sail around the sea with?"" Backbench Tory MPs have been leading the campaign for a new Royal Yacht. Allow Twitter content?

Police drop drug-test firm over probe,"Most of the 10,000 cases that could be affected involved traffic offences Police have suspended all contracts with a drug-testing company amid allegations of data manipulation. Randox Testing Services (RTS) in Manchester was investigated aftertwo scientists were arrestedon suspicion of tampering with data. Police minister Nick Hurd understands the RTS is no longer working for the National Police Chiefs' Council. He said the firm was ""co-operating"" in retesting samples after the probe led to a review of more than 10,000 cases. The council said forensic tests across 42 police forces, including rapes and murders, were being considered possibly unreliable and needed re-examining. Mr Hurd told MPs: ""The police have suspended all contracts as I understand it with Randox. ""Randox are co-operating with us fully on the priority, which is to identify the priority cases [and] get the retesting done as quickly as possible."" A data anomaly in a drug-driving case was reported to RTS earlier this year He also said the cases of alleged wrongdoing could go back to 2010. Five people have also been interviewed under caution by Greater Manchester Police over the alleged manipulation by individuals working at an RTS site. The alleged misconduct emerged earlier this year when a data anomaly in a drug-driving case was reported to RTS. Potential data manipulation at a separate facility, Trimega Laboratories, isalso being investigated. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott claimed the ""scandal"" ""flowed directly"" from the decision to privatise the industry. Mr Hurd accused Ms Abbott of ""trying to squeeze"" the issue into a Labour narrative of ""public good, private bad"".

The fraud costing the UK more than Â£1bn,"Panorama presenter Richard Bilton set up Bilton's Bargains to show how VAT fraud works A BBC Panorama team has smuggled goods into Britain and then sold them on eBay and Amazon to highlight a fraud costing the country a billion pounds a year. The undercover team imported goods from China and didn't pay VAT at the border. Amazon and eBay told the BBC that they take VAT fraud seriously and they work closely with HMRC to stop it happening. The fraud costs the UK more than Â£1bn a year and puts UK firms out of business because they cannot compete with sellers who have evaded VAT. British traders Roni and Neven Juretic sell phone and tablet covers online, but their sales fell by 60 per cent because they were undercut by fraudulent sellers. Roni Juretic said: ""If they're selling it 20% cheaper because they're not charging VAT, then it's impossible for us to reach those prices. That's why a lot of the other UK competitors have dropped away."" Importers should pay VAT when they bring goods into the UK, and charge it when they sell them to customers. But evidence suggests thousands of traders don't do either. Panorama set up a British company to show how the fraud works and imported bluetooth speakers and mobile phone cases from China. The company evaded more than Â£500 of import VAT and was not challenged by the tax authorities. And Amazon and Ebay profited by charging fees for the sales of the illegal goods. Meg Hillier, the chair of the parliamentary spending watchdog, told Panorama: ""It's pretty shocking that you can do it so easily and so openly, so blatantly. We need to make sure that there are systems in place to stop that happening."" HMRC says it has new powers and is tackling the problem. Tax Commissioner Jim Harra told Panorama: ""It's something that you should not have done. But do I believe it is completely impossible to smuggle goods into the UK without paying duties if you're determined to do so? Of course, it's not."" The BBC has now repaid the evaded tax to HMRC. Panorama's company, Bilton's Bargains, evaded VAT on two separate orders. The first was a consignment of Bluetooth speakers from Shenzhen in China. A local shipping agent told an undercover reporter the company could avoid VAT by sending the goods to the UK through Holland, with the speakers hidden inside a bigger order. The agent said it was: ""The special way, you don't need to have VAT.""  The speakers were shipped to the UK and VAT of Â£312 was evaded. The illegally imported goods were then sent to an Amazon warehouse, before Panorama bought them back. Amazon stored, sold and delivered the fraudulent goods. Amazon says it now has VAT numbers that cover 95% of sales from foreign sellers who use an Amazon warehouse Amazon says that no VAT fraud took place on its marketplace: ""We have multiple methods for checking the legitimacy of seller accounts and Bilton's Bargains has been suspended."" Amazon says Bilton's Bargains was not asked for a VAT number because it is a British company and might be exempt. But Amazon doesn't always ask foreign companies to provide a VAT number either. Research carried out for Panorama in September suggested 60% of the top Chinese sellers in Europe listed on Amazon did not display a valid VAT number. Amazon says it now has VAT numbers that cover 95% of sales from foreign sellers who use an Amazon warehouse. Both eBay and Amazon say fraud is bad for business For the second crime, Bilton's Bargains was registered as a Chinese seller on eBay.  Panorama imported 270 mobile phone covers without paying VAT and listed them for sale. The programme was able to buy one of the phone covers back, before eBay limited the account because Bilton's Bargains was a new seller. EBay says the seller limit is one of a range of anti-fraud measures and that it was largely effective in this case: ""By inserting a velocity limit on new accounts, eBay is able to reduce the risk of all fraud."" Both eBay and Amazon say fraud is bad for business and that they want fair play for all sellers on their sites. In last week's budget, the government announced the laws surrounding online VAT fraud would be tightened. Amazon and eBay warned over fraudsters Ebay paid UK tax of Â£1.6m in 2016 Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Computer science GCSE tasks leaked online,"The new computer science GCSE has been thrown into disarray after programming tasks worth a fifth of the total marks were leaked repeatedly online. Exams regulator Ofqual plans to pull this chunk of the qualification from the overall marks as it has been seen by thousands of people. Ofqual said the non-exam assessment may have been leaked by teachers as well as students who had completed the task. The breach affects two year groups. The first will sit the exam in summer 2018. Last year 70,000 students were entered for computer science GCSE. A quick internet search reveals numerous posts about the the non-exam assessment, with questions and potential answers. There are even posts from one of the exam boards reminding students that they are monitoring certain websites. A statement from the regulator said: ""Non-exam assessment in computer science is intended to test students' programming skills and is worth 20% of the overall nine to one grade. ""However, there is evidence that some of this year's tasks have been posted to online forums and collaborative programming sites, contrary to exam board rules. ""Detailed solutions have been provided in many cases, and some of these posts have been viewed thousands of times."" This is against the rules and changes would be needed so grades could be awarded fairly next summer, Ofqual added. The regulator is running a short consultation on how to proceed. Its preferred option would keep the non-exam assessment task, but to change it so it no longer contributes to the overall mark. Julie Swan, executive director for general qualifications, said: ""It is with great reluctance that we are proposing to change a qualification for which students are already studying. ""However, we must take immediate action to address these issues and the potential impact on public confidence in relation to this qualification. ""Subject to the consultation responses, we believe our preferred solution will deliver fairer and more reliable results than would otherwise be the case. ""It will also allow us to be confident that standards will be set appropriately."" Geoff Barton, of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the integrity of the assessment had been compromised by the ""widespread availability of solutions online"". He added that of all the subjects, computer science was the one where students were most likely to be aware of ""online opportunities"". ""It is an enormously frustrating situation for all concerned but we recognise that Ofqual has no option other than to consult on alternative arrangements,"" he said. He added that other options would be needed in the longer term as ""the ubiquity of online information"" made this form of assessment extremely vulnerable.

Bali volcano alert raised to highest level,"This video can not be played We ask an expert: Is a large volcanic eruption inevitable? About 100,000 people near Bali's Mount Agung have been ordered to evacuate as officials fear a major eruption. Indonesian authorities have raised the state of alert to its highest level, and expanded the exclusion zone around the rumbling volcano. The island's airport has now closed, leaving thousands stranded in the tourist hotspot. Authorities say dark gas and ash have been billowing up to 3,400m (11,150ft) above the mountain's summit. Officials have warned residents to stay away from rock and debris flows known as lahars, which have been spotted flowing down from the mountain. Mount Agung's volcanic tremors first began in September. Prayers and preparations Story behind the spectacular pictures What's it like waiting for an eruption? Bali tourism hit by volcano threat The National Board for Disaster Management raised the alert to level four from 06:00 local time (22:00 GMT Sunday) because of ""the possibility and imminent risk of disaster"". The volcano was seen emitting ""continuous ash puffs"" occasionally accompanied by ""explosive eruptions"" and ""weak booms"" that could be heard 12km (7 miles) away from the summit. ""The rays of fire are increasingly observed at night. This indicates the potential for a larger eruption is imminent,""it said in a statement (in Indonesian) on its Facebook page.,external This video can not be played Timelapse footage shows ash rising into the sky, disrupting flights Geologist Mark Tingay of the University of Adelaide told the BBC that Mount Agung now appears to be entering the next phase with a magmatic eruption, where the glow of lava is visible from the crater. But he added that as eruptions are difficult to predict, it was ""very hard to tell"" how the situation would develop. ""These eruptions can be quite large and extensive and violent, but this could also be a relatively minor eruption over time."" He added that Indonesian authorities had made preparations for an eruption for months, and said they appeared ""extremely well prepared"", with the situation ""well under control"". The main tourist stretch of Kuta and Seminyak is about 70km (43 miles) from the volcano, far beyond the exclusion zone. But the ash prompted officials toshut down Bali's Ngurah Rai airport from Monday to Tuesday morning,external. Airport authorities said 445 flights had been cancelled, affecting 59,000 travellers, while Indonesia's national hotel association said that stranded tourists staying at member hotels could stay one night for free. The Australian government,externalandthe UK's Foreign Office,externalhave advised travellers to be prepared for cancelled flights, closely monitor local media, and to heed local authorities' warnings. China,external(statement in Chinese) advised its citizens to be ""cautious"" if travelling to Bali. The airport on neighbouring island Lombok reopened on Monday morning after it was shut briefly. Flights were cancelled at Ngurah Rai airport on Monday Authorities have widened the exclusion zone to a 10km (6 mile) radius from the volcano, and have ordered people in the area to evacuate. On Monday, officials said about 100,000 residents needed to leave, but so far only 40,000 have done so. A spokesman for Indonesia's disaster agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said that some people within the exclusion zone did not leave because the area was not touched the last time it erupted - more than 50 years ago. The volcano first began belching thick gas last week. Officials have been distributing masks for local residents, as ash rains down in the vicinity. Anna Baranova, who works with non-governmental organisation Kopernik that is helping evacuees, said her group was trying to bring in better masks and possibly goggles. ""There's some effort to distribute information and also solar powered TV units which will broadcast information about the evacuation to the camps, should the electricity go out if there's an eruption,"" she told the BBC. Officials said the volcano has been emitting ""continuous ash puffs"" Lahars, also known as ""cold lava"",external, are slurries of rock fragments mixed with water, and have been spotted in fields and rivers near the volcano. Mr Nugroho warned that lahars may increase due to heavy rain and as Mount Agung continues to emit pyroclastic material. He has urged islanders to stay away from lahars,external, as well as avoid activities near rivers. This video can not be played Bali volcano: Warning over dangerous mud flows Authorities first issued warnings of an imminent eruption and raised the alert to the highest level two months ago, after detecting heightened volcanic activity. Following mass evacuations, some islanders returned to their homes in October when the alert level was lowered with a decrease in activity. According to official estimates, the holiday island lost at least $110m (Â£83m) in tourism and productivity during that major evacuation. The last time Mount Agung erupted, in 1963, more than 1,000 people died. Indonesia sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where tectonic plates collide, causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity. It ishome to more than 130 active volcanoes. This video can not be played Survivors of the 1963 eruption on the last time Mount Agung erupted By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent No-one can really say at this stage how things will turn out. The volcano might dampen down or the activity could evolve into a very big eruption. Scientists have a network of seismometers around Agung that allow them to follow its rumblings, which give them clues as to what is going on inside. This will be complemented by gas detectors. Again, this gives the researchers insights into the physical processes in play. On top of that the scientists have access to satellite observations. Already these have detected an increase in sulphur dioxide emissions. Radar spacecraft in particular are taking a close look at Agung. They can sense any subtle changes in the shape of the volcano that might indicate a very large volume of magma is moving closer to the surface. It is complex work but the experts in this field are relatively convinced that a slow uplift on the northern flank has been going on for some time. It may come to nothing, but high-resolution radar data is now being studied to see if more pronounced changes are occurring. Are you in the area? Have your travel plans been affected?

Threat of forced evacuation near volcano,"This video can not be played We ask an expert: Is a large volcanic eruption inevitable? People who have not left their homes around a rumbling volcano in Bali may be forcibly evicted, Indonesian authorities have said. Tens of thousands of people stayed put near Mount Agung after an alert was raised to its highest level. Some still felt safe while others did not want to leave livestock. A spokesman for the country's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said people were checking the exclusion zone for non-evacuees. ""There are personnel doing the sweeping, if they [residents] need to be forcibly evacuated,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said. The closure of the island's airport was extended for a second day, leaving thousands stranded in the tourist hotspot. Up to 100,000 people live in the area that could potentially be affected by streams of burning rock have been spotted flowing down from the mountain. But by Monday only 40,000 had left. Prayers and preparations Story behind the spectacular pictures What's it like waiting for an eruption? Bali tourism hit by volcano threat This video can not be played Timelapse footage shows ash rising into the sky, disrupting flights Mount Agung's volcanic tremors first began in September. Since last week dark gas and ash have been billowing up to 3,400m (11,150ft) above the mountain's summit. The BNPB raised the alert to level four from 06:00 local time (22:00 GMT on Sunday) because of an ""imminent risk of disaster"". The volcano is emitting ""continuous ash puffs"" with occasional ""explosive eruptions"" that could be heard 12km (7 miles) from the summit. ""The rays of fire are increasingly observed at night. This indicates the potential for a larger eruption is imminent,""it said in a statement (in Indonesian) on its Facebook page.,external Geologist Mark Tingay of the University of Adelaide told the BBC that eruptions were difficult to predict and it was ""very hard to tell"" exactly how the situation would develop. He added that Indonesian authorities appeared ""extremely well prepared"", with the situation ""well under control"". Authorities have widened the exclusion zone to a 10km (six-mile) radius, and have ordered people in the area to evacuate. Mr Sutopo said some people within the exclusion zone did not leave because the area was not touched during the last eruption, more than 50 years ago. Others are concerned about their animals. Local man Komang Gede told AFP news agency: ""We will try to go the evacuation centres in the afternoon, because in the morning we have to stay here to feed our livestock."" Lahars, also known as ""cold lava"",external, are slurries of rock fragments mixed with water, and have been spotted in fields and rivers near the volcano. They are chiefly caused by pyroclastic flows - fast-moving flows of gas and ash that can reach temperatures of 800C (1470F). Cold lava flows began to hit several villages in the southern slopes of Mount Agung as rainfall combined with the eruption Officials have been distributing masks for local residents, as ash rains down in the vicinity. Anna Baranova, who works with non-governmental organisation Kopernik that is helping evacuees, told the BBC her group was trying to bring in better masks and distribute solar-powered TVs for informational purposes in case the electricity cuts out. This video can not be played Bali volcano: Warning over dangerous mud flows Authorities first issued warnings of an imminent eruption and raised the alert to the highest level two months ago, after detecting heightened volcanic activity. Following mass evacuations, some islanders returned to their homes in October when the alert level was lowered with a decrease in activity. According to official estimates, the holiday island lost at least $110m (Â£83m) in tourism and productivity during that major evacuation. The main tourist stretch of Kuta and Seminyak is about 70km (43 miles) from the volcano, far beyond the exclusion zone. But the ash prompted officials toshut down Bali's Ngurah Rai airport from Monday to Tuesday morning,external. Airport authorities said 445 flights had been cancelled, affecting 59,000 travellers, while Indonesia's hotel association said stranded tourists staying at member hotels could stay one night for free. The Australian government,externalissued travel advice saying: ""Volcanic activity may escalate with little or no notice."" The UK's Foreign Office,externalhave advised travellers to be prepared for cancelled flights, closely monitor local media, and to heed local authorities' warnings. Are you in the area?

He added: ""We are particularly keen to hear from anyone who has seen the Clio and the manner of its driving in the time leading up to the collision. ""We would be interested in anyone who has dashcam footage relating to the vehicle's movements."" Police said a stolen Renault Clio crashed into a tree Police have also appealed to the local community to support the investigation Supt Matt Davison said: ""Clearly the families have suffered a devastating loss and we appreciate that emotions will be running high in the community. ""We would ask that people focus on supporting each other and on supporting the police investigation which will ensure that the circumstances of this incident are fully explored and that the criminal justice process is satisfied."" Police laid further floral tributes on Monday morning Dozens of people took part in a vigil near to the crash scene on Sunday night and floral tributes have been left nearby. One message read: ""Elliot and Ellis. Two beautiful boys taken too soon. We will never forget you both and love you both forever and always sleep tight boys.""

First UK civil claim against Weinstein,"The first UK civil claim against Harvey Weinstein has been issued in the High Court. A woman, who worked in the film industry and wishes to remain anonymous, is alleging a series of sexual assaults by the film producer. The claim, which was lodged by personal injury lawyer Jill Greenfield on the woman's behalf, is expected to exceed Â£300,000. Harvey Weinstein denies any allegations of non-consensual sex. The claim form, which has been seen by the BBC, states the woman is seeking damages for personal injury, expenses, and consequential loss. It also includes a claim against the Weinstein Company UK Ltd and the Weinstein Company LLC in the US, who are liable as employers of Weinstein. It's understood the woman has not yet submitted an official complaint to Scotland Yard, but Ms Greenfield confirmed to the BBC she expects a criminal case to run at the same time as the civil claim. UK police investigating the movie mogulconfirmed last monththey are now looking at sexual assault allegations from seven women. Meanwhile, an actress named Kadian Noble has accused Weinstein of luring her into a hotel room in the south of France and assaulting her in 2014. In a civil action,externalfiled in New York on Monday, she claims a violation of US federal sex trafficking laws by  Weinstein, his brother Bob and The Weinstein Company. As well as denying allegations of non-consensual sex, Weinstein has said - in a statement issued on his behalf - that ""there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances"". Bob Weinstein has yet to respond to the suit, but has denied any knowledge in his brother Harvey's alleged misconduct.

She caused anger just before she left the stationwhen she tweeted,externalthat there must be a ""final solution"" in dealing with terrorists following theManchester terror attack. Some followers questioned her use of the phrase ""final solution"" - a term used by the Nazis to refer to the Holocaust - but later Hopkins altered it to ""true solution"", describing the earlier version as a ""mis-type"". Hopkins is now deleting her tweets Earlier this year, food writer Jack Monroewon Â£24,000 in damages, plus Â£107,000 in legal costs, in a libel action against Hopkins after a row over two tweets, which Monroe said caused ""serious harm"" to her reputation.

Jailed Britons win India appeal,"(From top left, clockwise) Nick Dunn, Paul Towers, Nick Simpson, Ray Tindall, John Armstrong and Billy Irving Six British former soldiers who have been held on weapons charges in India since 2013 are to be released. They were arrestedwhile working as guards on a ship to combat piracy in the Indian Ocean. The so-called Chennai Six always denied the charges, which were initially quashed but later reinstated. They were sentenced to five years in 2016. The former soldiers appealed, and a judge has just ruled that they be acquitted. Get more updates on this story onBBC Local Live. The men, who were working on the anti-piracy ship MV Seaman Guard Ohio, are: Nick Dunn from Ashington, Northumberland Billy Irvingfrom Connel, Argyll Ray Tindall from Chester Paul Towers from Pocklington, East Yorkshire John Armstrong from Wigton, Cumbria Nicholas Simpson from Catterick, North Yorkshire This video can not be played Family of Nick Dunn react to news of release They were arrested on board a ship owned by an American company which offered armed protection services to vessels sailing through an area known as ""pirates' alley"" between the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. Customs officials and police found 35 guns, including semi-automatic weapons, and almost 6,000 rounds of ammunition on board the ship. Indian authorities said the weapons and ammunition had not been properly declared Initially charges were quashed when the men argued that the weapons were lawfully held for anti-piracy purposes and the paperwork, issued by the UK government, was in order. But a lower court reinstated the prosecution and they were convicted in January last year. Since then there has been a series of appeals. The families have long campaigned for the men's release, and took a petition to Downing Street The latest news has been welcomed by the men's families. Yvonne MacHugh, the partner of Billy Irving, said he had missed the birth of their son, William. She said: ""I just feel sheer relief - finally we're getting our family back together. ""Finally all the men are going to be home with their families. They've been acquitted of all charges, so they have done no wrongdoing and finally we've proven that."" Lisa Dunn, the sister of Nick Dunn, described it as ""the best news ever"". She said: ""The longer it went on, as much as you still have an element of hope, it does dwindle after having so many delays and setbacks. ""It will make all of our Christmases - all of our dreams have come true today."" Indian authorities said weapons and ammunition found on board MV Seaman Guard Ohio had not been properly declared The judge ruled that all charges against the men - and 29 others arrested with them - be dropped with immediate effect, and the fines they were ordered to pay be refunded. However, it is not yet known when they will be able to return home, as the authorities could appeal against the decision. John Armstrong's sister, Joanne Tomlinson, said: ""They still need to get police clearance before they can come home, so there are steps being taken to try to ensure that everything's in place. ""That they can come back as quickly as possible, but we don't have a time-frame for that yet."" Theresa May's official spokesman said: ""We are now working with the Indian authorities to discuss the next steps. ""We will continue to offer the men and their families consular assistance for as long as it is needed."" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson described the verdict as ""fantastic news"" and said the case ""has been a top priority for everybody"" at the Foreign Office (FCO). ""The FCO has worked tirelessly behind the scenes to reunite these men with their families,"" he added. ""I share their delight and I hope they can return home as soon as possible.""

The Brexit documents row isn't going away,"The government has handed over its analysis of the impact of Brexit on parts of the economy - but the reports are not complete. There has been a long-running row over the studies of 58 sectors. MPs voted on 1 November for them to be released. Labour and some Conservative MPs have demanded their publication, saying they were being kept in the dark about the impact Brexit might have. Documents have now been sent to the Brexit Committee of MPs. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says she now expects a ""big row"" because Brexit Secretary David Davis has admitted the reports are incomplete. Allow Twitter content?

In his letter to Brexit Committee chairman Hilary Benn, Mr Davis said the papers had been redacted because there was no guarantee the committee would keep them secret. He said: ""Given that we have received no assurances from the committee regarding how any information passed will be used, we have sought not to include commercially, market and negotiation sensitive information. ""Delivering a successful outcome to our EU exit negotiations for the whole country requires keeping some information confidential for the purposes of the negotiations."" By Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor Understanding the possible economic impact of Britain's decision to leave the European Union is a difficult business. It is likely to become easier when the Department for Exiting the European Union makes available its ""sector analyses"" on relations with our biggest trading partner. I am told in no uncertain terms that the reports - which will run to hundreds of pages - are not ""impact assessments"". That is, they will not put a figure on the possible costs if there is a sharp dislocation between the free trading arrangements we have with the EU now and what might follow after we leave. Rather, I understand the reports will show the size of each of the sectors and their worth to the UK economy and then detail how the sectors work at present within the EU single market and customs union. Read more of Kamal's blog here. The government said it had satisfied the Commons motion passed by MPs - in which Conservatives abstained - with the release of the documents to the committee. ""We have always been clear that our analysis does not exist in the form Parliament requested,"" a spokesman said. But Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said ""serious questions"" would be raised if the full reports were not handed to the Brexit Select Committee. He told BBC News: ""It was a decision of the House of Commons that was binding. ""It was clear that these reports, unredacted [and] in full should be handed over. ""The government didn't vote against that decision and they have accepted that decision, so if they are changing their position now, they are going to have to explain that. ""We in the Labour party will raise this in parliament when we know the full picture, but ultimately, it could be a question of contempt of Parliament."" Keir Starmer said ""serious questions"" will be raised if the reports are not handed over in full Labour committee member Seema Malhotra said it appeared the government had ""already decided what should and should not be seen"" by editing the studies. She added: ""The select committee must be given the full analyses which were completed, and nothing less. ""We cannot and should not be short-changed. This will not be in the national interest. The public and Parliament must no longer be kept in the dark.""

Warning over 'common law marriage' myths,"Millions of unmarried couples who live together could be unaware of their rights if the relationship breaks down, a family law group has warned. Resolution carried out a survey which found two-thirds of cohabiting couples wrongly believe ""common-law marriage"" laws exist when dividing up finances. The number of unmarried couples living together has more than doubled from 1.5 million in 1996 to 3.3 million in 2017. Resolution chairman Nigel Shepherd said current laws were ""behind the times"". He said: ""The government must listen to the public, legal professionals and a growing number of politicians who all agree that we need reform to provide basic rights to cohabiting couples should they separate."" Mr Shepherd said ""society has changed"", as cohabiting couples have become the fastest-growing family type in the UK. He said, under current law, it was possible to live with someone for decades - and have children together - but not take responsibility for the former partner if the relationship breaks down. Cohabiting couples can be recognised under Scots Law in some circumstances - and Scottish legislation introduced in 2006 enables a cohabitant to apply to the court for financial provision. If one cohabiting partner dies without leaving a will, the surviving partner will not automatically inherit anything - unless the couple jointly own property. A married partner would inherit all or some of the estate An unmarried partner who stays at home to care for children cannot make any claims in their own right for property, maintenance or pension-sharing Cohabiting partners cannot access their partner's bank account if they die - whereas married couples may be allowed to withdraw the balance providing the amount is small An unmarried couple can separate without going to court, but married couples need to go to a court and get divorced to end the marriage formally Cohabiting couples are not legally obliged to support each other financially, but married partners have a legal duty to support each other If you are the unmarried partner of a tenant, you have no rights to stay in the accommodation if you are asked to leave - but each married partner has the right to live in the ""matrimonial home"" Source: Citizens Advice The ComRes poll of 2,000 UK adults, by Resolution, found 84% of people thought the government should take steps to make sure unmarried cohabiting couples knew they did not have the same legal protection as married couples. Of these respondents, 281 people were in a cohabiting relationship - two-thirds of which thought they were common-law married. A further four in five cohabitants believed that the legal rights surrounding cohabiting people who separate were ""unclear"". If they have children, each cohabiting partner will still have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent. Mother-of-five Yvonne, who was with her ex-partner 17 years, said she was ""shocked to find out"" her legal rights when they ended the relationship. ""I was entitled to nothing,"" she said. ""I was no longer just dealing with a break-up - but with the fallout of not being legally entitled to share in any of what I thought were our joint assets."" Yvonne said she was ""devastated"" when she realised she lacked financial support Yvonne, who gave up paid work to look after their children, said she now has to move house - but has no independent funds or a pension. ""I'm devastated to have been left in this situation, and think it's wrong that the law is unable to provide people like me with any support whatsoever,"" she said. Resolution, which represents 6,500 family practitioners, said it had seen an increase in the number of cases involving cohabiting couples.

What will happen to Suits?,"It's official. Prince Harry and actress Meghan Markle will be tying the knot next spring. But there are so many more questions about the newest royal-to-be. What are her dogs called? Will she become a princess? What will happen to Rachel Zane in Suits? And - do we get a bank holiday? Here we bring you all you need to know. Meghan has been playing paralegal turned lawyer Rachel Zane in the US legal drama Suits since 2011. But the writers are going to have to plan for her departure after she announced she's going to give up acting all together. ""I don't see it as giving anything up. I see it as a change. It's a new chapterâ¦"" she said in a TV interview with Prince Harry on Monday. She's a UN women's advocate and campaigns on issues around feminism and racism and has previously hinted she wants to carry on working. Meghan said: ""I've never defined myself by my relationship."" Guy was found wandering alone in woods in Kentucky before being rescued by Meghan Markle as a companion for Bogart If there is one thing likely to make sure Meghan settles in well with the Royal Family, it will be her love of dogs. She has two rescue dogs, a beagle named Guy and a Labrador-shepherd mix called Bogart. Guy and Bogart have regularly featured on her Instagram account, with Guy even appearing in a patriotic knitted union flag jumper. It was chat show host Ellen DeGeneres who convinced Meghan to adopt Bogart - her first pet - after she bumped into her in a shelter. We were given an extra bank holiday when William and Kate got married, but William is a future king, whereas Harry is now fifth in line to the throne. And Downing Street has said there are no plans to give people an extra day off at the moment. So no. Prince Harry brought a personal touch to Meghan's engagement ring - he designed it himself. Two of the stones used to belong to his mum - Diana, Princess of Wales. At the centre is a diamond from Botswana in Africa, where Harry visited many times. The couple also spent time there during the last 18 months they've been together. In 2011 Meghan married film producer Trevor Engelson on a beach in Jamaica, but the pair split amicably after less than two years of marriage. Trevor Engelson is most famous for the 9/11 romance movie Remember Me, starring Robert Pattinson. At the moment he is working on a ""divorce comedy"" for Fox - based on the Royal Family. Thepitch,externalfor the show says: ""Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal Family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London's tabloid media, is next level."" In the US version of Deal or No Deal, they didn't have normal contestants holding the boxes - they had models holding briefcases with the money inside. Meghan was the model for briefcase number 24 throughout season two of the show, in 2006-2007, ""while I was auditioning to try to make ends meet"". Describing it to Esquire magazine, she said: ""I would end up standing up there forever in these terribly uncomfortable and inexpensive five-inch heels just waiting for someone to pick my number so I could go and sit down."" In the years between graduating and getting her big break on Suits, Meghan worked other jobs while she tried to break into Hollywood. But they weren't your run-of-the-mill waitressing jobs - she was a freelance calligrapher. ""I did calligraphy for the invitations for, like, Robin Thicke and Paula Patton's wedding,"" she toldEsquire,externalin 2013. Meghan says she learned the skill in Catholic school as a kid, and because so few people do it, she said it was a ""super-lucrative"" job. We're not sure if Harry's penned any love letters to her - but she did say that if a man ""takes the time to put pen to paper and not type something, there's something so incredibly romantic and beautiful about that"". It's tradition that on the morning of the wedding Harry will be given a dukedom by his grandmother the Queen. So once they are married, Meghan will likely become a duchess and HRH (Her Royal Highness) - she will not be known as Princess Meghan. This is because she is only connected to the Royal Family through marriage. There are lots of titles available, but there are rumours the couple will take on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

The Queen gave them the title of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their wedding day Thousands of members of the public turned out for the couple's wedding Meghan and Prince Harry embarked on their first royal tour together in October 2018 - visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga over 16 days. The trip coincided with the coupleannouncing they were expecting their first baby. Meghan at the British High Commissioner's Residence in Suva, Fiji The duke and duchess followed in the footsteps of Prince Harry's parents - Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales - whose first royal tour was to Australia and New Zealand. Harry and Meghan at Taronga Zoo in Sydney Meghan and Prince Harry at the unveiling of the Labalaba Statue in Nadi, Fiji In February 2019 the Duke and Duchess travelled to Morocco for a three-day visit In September 2019, the couple undertook a 10-day tour of Africa, a continent that has always been particularly dear to Prince Harry's heart, leading to some speculation early in their marriage that they might at some stage choose to live there. Meghan met Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Sophia Williams-De Bruyn, as well as other key figures in South Africa's anti-apartheid movement. Sophia Williams-De Bruyn was aged 18 when she helped lead about 20,000 protesters Prince Harry and Meghan met Nelson Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, at a reception in Johannesburg She also made a speech to business people in Johannesburg in which she said such entrepreneurs had the power to change a world that seems ""aggressive, confrontational and dangerous"". But by the end of the tour, the couple's talk about fighting injustice was being reported alongside newsthat they were beginning legal action against the Mail on Sundayfor publishing a private letter sent by the Duchess of Sussex to her father. This video can not be played Harry and Meghan's royal engagements When Meghan gave birth to her son Archie Harrison - on 6 May 2019 - the reaction from the New York Times reflected the mass interest in the event around the world as it wrote: ""He is the first multiracial baby in the British monarchy's recent history, an instant star in a country where multiracial children make up the fastest-growing ethnic category."" But the royal couple had already decided to do things a little differently, underlining their determination not to follow the traditions of other recent royal births. In advance, they chose not to reveal where the baby would be born and said there would be no running commentary of what was happening, instantly stopping the spectacle of the press pack joining the ranks of ""royal superfans"" camped outside a hospital for several days waiting for the first glimpse of the new royal. And the birth wasn't initially announced in the traditional royal way of  being posted on a placard outside Buckingham Palace. Instead, Prince Harry popped out of their home to tell the world (although the placard then followed). The very private christening that followed just added to some media frustration that they could not, in their minds, fully report on one of the year's happiest stories. Held at Windsor Castle, the ceremony was not witnessed by any press photographers or TV cameras and the list of guests and godparents was not made public. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond surmised: ""It all points to a very different royal event, part of the continuing desire by the duke and duchess to raise their son Archie out of the spotlight."" Now you see them.... ...now you don't. Madame Tussauds removed Harry and Meghan from its royal set, leaving an empty space Amid ongoing spats with the media, increasingly through lawyers, it would soon become clear that both Meghan and her husband were becoming increasingly disenchanted with the expectations that came with their royal role. The announcement in June 2019 that they were breaking away from the Royal Foundation charity - which had seen them work closely with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - led to frenzied speculation about Prince Harry and Meghan's relationship with Prince William and Catherine. The cost to taxpayers of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's UK home at Frogmore Cottage reopened the debate about how the Royal Family is funded Then there was the revelation that their home, Frogmore Cottage,had been renovated with Â£2.4m of taxpayer-funded costs.It waslater announced that Prince Harry had paid back the cost. Meghan's comments during the couple's African tour that she had not felt supported as she struggled with motherhood and her new role did not go down well with senior royals, according to sources at the time. At the end of 2019, the couple took an extended Christmas break from royal duties, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia. The couple and their son Archie spent time in Canada over Christmas 2019 It gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped the bombshell announcement that they planned to step back as senior royals and become financially independent. Amid the further detail that the couple planned to split their time between the UK and North America, Buckingham Palace expressed its disappointment aspalace sources revealed that that no other royal - including the Queen or Prince William - was consultedbefore the statement was issued. The couple's final engagement as working royals saw them in the familiar surroundings of Westminster Abbey Talks then ensued between Prince Harry and the Queento iron out the detailsbefore it was confirmed that their couple's final duties as working members of the Royal Family would be in March 2020. The very final engagement saw them attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. The Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William were all there although one of the abiding memories of Meghan's royal exit - by now widely renamed ""Megxit"" - was getting a hug from singer Craig David. Prince Harry bumped forearms with Craig David when they met at the end of the service - while Meghan opted to hug him In February 2021, before a formal review of the situation had begun,Buckingham Palace confirmed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would not be returningas working members of the Royal Family. It meant Prince Harry and Meghan would return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. The couple will still attend some royal events in the future but these will not be classed as official duties. After time was spent in Canada, the couple settled at a new home in California. It has allowed them to spend much more time with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland, who lives in the state. But they are never completely out of the spotlight. There was a media fascination in tracking the couple's whereabouts in the early days of the coronavirus lockdown. In April 2020, they sued and eventually won an apology from a US news agency after drones were allegedly used to take pictures of their son, Archie, at their home. The same month, the couple announced that they were ending all co-operation with four tabloid newspaper groups in the UK, blaming ""distorted, false or invasive"" stories. But they do remain keen to seek publicity for the causes or issues they are interested in. As a duchess, Meghan took on portfolio of charitable work and patronages, which included the National Theatre and charity Smart Works. She also launched a charity cookbook in September 2018 to help those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. Meghan was joined be her mother, Doria Ragland, and Prince Harry for the cookbook launch After moving back to the US, she jointly wrote a newspaper article calling for the end of ""structural racism"" and the couple also urged US citizens to vote in the presidential election, saying that they should""reject hate"". In November 2020, Meghanwrote an article,externalrevealing her ""almost unbearable grief"" at enduring a miscarriage in July of that year. As for their future career plans, a big clue came when theyreached a deal with streaming giant Netflixto make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in. Meghan and Prince Harry featured in a succession of headlines in February 2021. At the High Court in London,Meghan won her claim for misuse of private informationagainst the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father.  A further hearing will decide the ""next steps"" in her legal action which covers claims of copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act. Days laterMeghan and Prince Harry announced they were expecting their second child. Then came the news the couple had decided to talk about their decision to step away from the monarchy, in a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey. And there was a statement fromBuckingham Palace that it would investigate claims the Duchess of Sussex bullied royal staffin 2018. Her spokesman said the duchess was ""saddened"" by the ""latest attack on her character"" - and the following day a clip from her Winfrey interview was issued by CBS in whichMeghan said Buckingham Palace could not expect her and Prince Harry to be silentif it was ""perpetuating falsehoods about us"". In June, Meghanhad her first daughter, Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, and she and Prince Harry said Lili ""is more than we could have ever imagined"". The couple named their second child Lilibet after the Royal Family's nickname for the Queen, the baby's great-grandmother. And her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honour her ""beloved late grandmother"", the Princess of Wales, they said.

No ordinary royal engagement,"This is no ordinary royal engagement. Meghan Markle brings something different to the British Royal Family. She is American, divorced, an actress and mixed race. She is also a campaigner with a variety of humanitarian interests and won't want her marriage to limit her ability to speak out and support various causes - particularly those of gender equality. As an advocate for UN Women, Ms Markle has worked on helping young girls reach their leadership potential. When she was first approached about working with the United Nations the Suits star insisted on undertaking a period of ""work experience"" first. Couple to marry next spring The prince and the actress Who is Meghan Markle? Prince Harry profile In her own time she shadowed Elizabeth Nyamayaro, a senior advisor at UN Women. Elizabeth was impressed by the intelligence, commitment and curiosity of the actress. The pair have since worked together closely on a number of UN missions and Elizabeth has no doubt that her friend and colleague will thrive in her new royal role. ""Her ability to listen, her passion for other people, wanting to create social change with that level of platform can only be a positive thing.  She'll be fine, she'll be great in fact."" Ms Markle addressed gender issues at the One Young World forum in Canada But the media coverage of the relationship in its early days unsettled sections of the British press and its readers. Prince Harry even took the unprecedented step ofissuing a public statement asking for privacyand describing some of the coverage as having ""racial undertones"". Much was made of his fiancÃ©e's upbringing in Los Angeles, with the area described as gang-infested and a place riddled with racial tension. However, Ms Markle actually grew up in avery middle class neighbourhood of Los Angelesand attended a private Catholic school. But in many ways she is an outsider. Prince Harry isn't following a traditional path - he's not marrying the daughter of a grand aristocratic family. His wife-to-be now has to negotiate her way through the British aristocracy, in a similar vein to her future sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge. It is an experience American nutritionist and author Julie Montagu knows well, as the future Countess of Sandwich. Born and brought up in Illinois, she married the son of the Earl of Sandwich and is now Viscountess Hinchingbrooke. She splits her time between London and the family estate, Mapperton, in Dorset. ""Even now I still get things wrong,"" she told me. ""The British upper classes have their own way of doing things. But as an American I bring my optimism, positivity and work ethic into the mix which I believe is hugely important."" Ms Markle is joining a family and entering a world unlike anything she has previously experienced. Yes it brings with it great privilege. But it also means a lack of privacy and the acceptance of a public life. As an actress she may find herself well equipped to deal with the scrutiny ahead.

How the relationship blossomed,"Prince Harry confirmed he was dating Meghan Markle in November 2016 US actressMeghan Markle and Prince Harry are to marryin spring 2018, Clarence House has announced. There had been much speculation about the pair since they were pictured together at the Invictus Games's opening ceremony in September. But how has their relationship developed? The couple met through mutual friends in London in July 2016 when one of Ms Markle's close friends, Markus Anderson, reportedly introduced her to the prince. No ordinary royal engagement Who is Meghan Markle? Prince Harry Profile Meghan Markle's life amongst Toronto 'royalty' Mr Anderson, who sat next to Ms Markle at the Invictus Games, is linked with private members club Soho House - of which Harry is a member. Markus Anderson with Meghan in Toronto supporting Harry But it wasn't until months after the initial London meeting that the press managed to get news of their blossoming romance. The Sunday Express was the first paper to reveal the 36-year-old was Prince Harry's new girlfriend with the news featuring on the front page last October. In the days after it broke, the pair went to a Halloween party where the prince reportedly donned a mask and went trick-or-treating. In November 2016, the prince officially confirmed he was dating the US actress. In astatement,externalfrom Kensington Palace, he also took the opportunity to condemn Ms Markle's treatment by the press. He referred to a ""smear"" on the front page of a national newspaper, racial undertones in comment  pieces and ""outright sexism and racism"" from online trolls. There had been a ""bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker, and loved one in her life"", the prince said. He was worried about her safety and was ""deeply disappointed"" to not have been able to protect her. Digital editor of OK! Online Kelby McNally says the statement came as a ""surprise"" because their relationship hadn't been officially confirmed. ""This is proof that the younger generation of royals are moving away from some of the stereotypical stiff-upper lip royal behaviour,"" she says. The Daily Mirror's Royal Correspondent, Victoria Murphy, said it showed Harry's ""strong desire to both protect her and hang onto her"". Could Meghan appear at the next fly-past? The Duke of Cambridge signed off Harry's plea to the press agreeing the situation had gone too far. Prince William ""understands the situation concerning privacy and supports the need for Prince Harry to support those closest to him"", a statement from Kensington Palace said. In mid-November of that year, Ms Markle was photographed out and about in Kensington doing some shopping in the high street, with the press suggesting she had been staying at Kensington Palace's Nottingham Cottage, where the prince lives. The couple have rarely been seen in public together Despite the couple trying to keep a lid on their affairs, a cheeky comment during a royal tour put the prince firmly back in the limelight. While on a 15-day trip to the West Indies later that month, Harry was made the offer to honeymoon in Antigua by the country's prime minister. In front of hundreds of guests, Gaston Browne said: ""I am told that there may be a princess and I just want to say that should you make the decision to honeymoon - then Antigua and Barbuda want to welcome you."" The PM continued to stress the honeymoon credentials of his country but the prince didn't seem to respond to the invitation. Miss Antigua and Barbuda (wearing crown), said ""everyone"" wanted to be the prince's princess In December the couple were gearing up for their first Christmas together. But where would they spend it - at Ms Markle's home in Toronto or London? The pair chose the latter to carry out their first festive tradition. They were pictured by the tabloids reportedly buying a Â£65 Nordmann Fir at the Pine and Needles store in Battersea Park, London. Actress Ms Markle was seen as a ""far cry"" from the prince's previous girlfriends which made their story all the more compelling, Ms McNally says. ""I think people are intrigued to see if much will change for her - after all, she is dating a real-life prince. Will she carry on her acting career as normal? Will they reside in the UK or the US?"" Ms Markle may have to join the other royals when they go to church on Christmas Day Later that month, the couple were pictured for the first time on a trip to London's West End. Prince Harry and Ms Markle were snapped strolling hand-in-hand before watching the play The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time at the Gielgud Theatre. New year, next milestone. According to reports, they went on their first holiday together in January 2017. For their trip, the prince reportedly took Ms Markle to see the Northern Lights in Tromso, Norway after spending New Year together. The pair are thought to have stayed in a cabin for seven days where they went whale-watching and spent time on the nearby lake. In March the prince took Ms Markle as his plus one to one of his best friend's weddings in Montego Bay, Jamaica, where he was an usher at the ceremony. Ms Markle cheered on boyfriend Harry in full view Fast forward to May and Ms Markle was pictured at a polo match supporting her boyfriend. She was seen smiling and clapping as she watched Prince Harry play at Coworth Park, Berkshire. They didn't seem to hide their affections for one another as the prince kissed Ms Markle before the event, which he went on to win. It was one of several matches Princes Harry and William have played for charity. While all eyes were on Pippa Middleton's summer wedding many were intrigued to see if Ms Markle would attend and really be part of the family. Ms Middleton married financier boyfriend James Matthews in May at a ceremony in Englefield, Berkshire where crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of the dress, the royals and to see if Harry's girlfriend would turn up. She didn't attend the ceremony, but was snapped arriving for the evening reception with the prince fuelling more speculation about the couple's romance. Prince Harry attended Pippa Middleton's wedding ceremony alone and Meghan joined him later In late August, the couple went on a three-week holiday to Africa to celebrate Meghan's 36th birthday and on their return Vanity Fair magazine declared Ms Markle was ""wild about Harry"". In an interviewwith the magazine,externalshe revealed they had been together for six months before the rest of the world found out. The actress said she had hoped people would understand ""this is our time"". ""We're two people who are really happy and in love. ""This is for us. It's part of what makes it so special, that it's just ours. But we're happy. Personally, I love a great love story."" The Suits actress said she was ""in love"" with Harry in September In September, the couple made their first public appearance at the Invictus Games, an international sporting event set up by Harry for injured soldiers. They sat separately at the opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada but were then pictured together as they arrived for the wheelchair tennis event a few days later. Crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of the couple strolling hand-in-hand and press rushed to capture the moment. Ms Markle's mother was also photographed with them at the closing ceremony of the games. Ms Markle seemed to adjust to royal duties with ease The Daily Mirror's Royal Correspondent, Victoria Murphy said their relaxed appearance shows they were ""keen to present themselves to the world as a couple"". ""Were they 10 years younger it may be a case of 'wait and see', but they are two people in their mid-30s who know what they want from life - and who they want to share it with. ""It seems the public won't have to wait long for another royal wedding.""

Feud at US watchdog as Trump man arrivesPresident Trump's pick and a director who refuses to step aside send duelling emails to employees.2h2 hours agoUS & Canada,"Mick Mulvaney - who has previously called the CFPB a ""sick, sad joke"" - brought donuts for staff on Monday The US consumer financial watchdog was plunged into turmoil on Monday as rival directors vied to take charge amid a lawsuit against the White House. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) director resigned last week and appointed his former chief of staff, Leandra English, to replace him. She has sued after President Donald Trump instead named his budget chief Mick Mulvaney to lead the CFPB. The CFPB, unpopular on Wall Street, was set up after the 2007 financial crash. Leandra English sent the agency's staff a brief email on Monday saying: ""It is an honor to work with all of you."" Ms English signed it, ""Acting Director"". Ms English (left) appeared for a photo-op with Democratic senators on Monday afternoon But Mr Mulvaney - who has previously called the CFPB a ""sick, sad joke"" that should be scrapped - arrived at the bureau on Monday morning carrying a bag of donuts for employees. Trump administration unveils plan to defang consumer watchdog He wrote in a memo to staff: ""Please disregard any instructions you receive from Ms English in her presumed capacity as Acting Director."" Mr Mulvaney also signed off as ""acting director"", urging staff to pop by his office on the fourth floor and ""grab a donut"". Allow Twitter content?

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News ""High drama"" and ""bureaucratic power struggle"" are words that don't usually go together, but these are unusual times in Washington, DC. A donut-carrying Republican who seemingly hates the controversial agency he's been tasked with running is up against a Democratic-appointed official who has filed a lawsuit that reaches new heights of legal snarkiness. Behind it all is the fact that the CFPB is a key component of Democratic attempts to rein in what they viewed as the recklessness and cruelty of big US financial institutions that contributed to the financial collapse of 2008. Republicans, on the other hand, consider the bureau to be a regulatory beast stifling economic growth. Republicans take aim at Dodd-Frank financial rules Given that conservative attempts to change the agency through legislation have run aground in the political morass that is the US Congress, the future of the CFPB largely rests in who is put in charge. In other government entities, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department and the Justice Department, Trump loyalists are hard at work altering the culture and curtailing the ambitions of federal bureaucrats. Now the administration has a chance to go to work on the CFPB. Democrats, however, are seemingly eager for a high-profile fight. The 1,600-employee watchdog was set up in 2010 to protect Americans from predatory lenders. Republicans say it has placed an excessive regulatory burden on Wall Street. Democrats say the CFPB is reining in the very excesses that helped spur the global financial crash a decade ago. Mr Trump took to Twitter on Saturday to criticise the agency, calling it a ""total disaster"". He argued that because of the CFPB ""financial institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public"". Trump tracker: How much has the president achieved so far?

On Sunday, Ms English asked a judge at a federal court in Washington DC to issue a temporary restraining order against Mr Trump's appointment of Mr Mulvaney. In her lawsuit, she called herself the ""rightful acting director"" of the CFPB. The legal action said: ""The President's purported or intended appointment of defendant Mulvaney as Acting Director of the CFPB is unlawful."" The White House says the president has the authority to appoint Mr Mulvaney under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. But a lawyer for Ms English says the law states that as deputy director she is entitled to take power until the Senate can vote to confirm another director. The lawsuit has been assigned to a judge who was appointed this year by President Trump, Reuters news agency reports. A Trump administration lawyer who wrote the memo defending Mr Mulvaney's appointmentreportedly represented a Canadian payday lender,externalbefore the CFPB last year. Supporters of the consumer bureau held a demonstration on Monday Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the chamber's banking committee, called Ms English's lawsuit ""just the latest lawless action"" by the CFPB, which he called ""rogue"" and ""unconstitutional"". ""The President should fire her immediately and anyone who disobeys Director Mulvaney's orders should also be fired summarily,"" Mr Cotton wrote in a statement. But Illinois Democratic Senator Dick Durbin told CNN the White House decision was aimed at eradicating the CFPB. ""Wall Street hates it like the devil hates holy water,"" he said.

The left-wing senator from Massachusetts was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the CFPB and over the weekend she launched a stinging attack on the president. ""Less than a decade after taxpayers bailed out the big banks, the banking industry made record profits last year,"" she tweeted. ""That's who you're worried about, realDonaldTrump?""

House of Cards filming to 'resume soon'Production on the show was halted following the recent allegations about Kevin Spacey.3h3 hours agoEntertainment & Arts,"Spacey is having treatment following the allegations House of Cards could be soon returning to production following the sexual harassment and assault allegations made against its star, Kevin Spacey. The hit Netflix show was forced to take a break following the claims and Spacey has now been dropped from the show. Pauline Micelli, senior vice president at the show's studio, Media Rights Capital, recently wrote to staff to say its hiatus was being extended. ""We continue to work with Netflix with the hope of resuming production soon."" Crew on the show will be paid until 8 December ""as we continue these discussions,"" her letter went on. Netflix previously announced it ""will not be involved with any further production of House of Cards that includes Kevin Spacey"". Kevin Spacey timeline Spacey film to be re-shot with different actor Scotland Yard investigate new sexual assault allegation Ms Micelli's letter addressed how stressful a period it had been for everyone working on the show. ""These last two months have tested and tried all of us in ways none of us could have foreseen,"" she wrote. ""The one thing we have learned throughout this process is that this production is bigger than just one person and we could not be more proud to be associated with one of the most loyal and talented production cast and crews in this business."" Spacey was at the Old Vic between 2004 and 2015 In the letter, published in theHollywood Reporter,external, she added: ""Our hope is that the entire crew will be able to reconvene when production resumes. ""But we want you to know that we will certainly understand if crew members need to find other work in the interim, which will prevent them from re-joining us. We sincerely appreciate all you have done"". She said that the writers would be continuing their work during the hiatus - presumably working on how to write Spacey out. Spacey, who was artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre, is currently being investigated by Scotland Yard over two allegations of sexual assault. He also faces claims of ""on-set sexual misconduct"" by members of the House of Cards production crew. Initial allegations about Spacey were made by actor Anthony Rapp in October.

Teenager guilty of four terror charges,"The trial heard he searched the internet for details of security at a Justin Bieber concert A teenager from south Wales has been found guilty of plotting a terror attack in Cardiff. The boy, from Rhondda Cynon Taff, who cannot be named, was arrested on the day of a Justin Bieber concert at the Principality Stadium on 30 June. The 17-year-old has been found guilty of five terror-related charges at Birmingham Crown Court. The trial heard he was found with a ""martyrdom letter"" when arrested, which revealed details of his planned attack. The court heard the A-level student, who is white and British, had set up an Instagram account encouraging jihad and supporting al-Qaeda. Police found the password for the account was ""truck attack"". One post read: ""May Allah bring terrorism to Cardiff on 30th June."" A claw hammer and a gutting knife were found in the boy's school rucksack Police also found he had conducted numerous online searches into how to carry out a vehicle ramming attack and how to stab and kill. Other targets he researched included Cardiff Castle, the New Theatre, the Capitol shopping centre, the Central Library and Bridgend's McArthur Glen shopping outlet. His internet history included searches for ""Isis beheading video"", ""how to create a terror attack"" and ""what does getting shot feel like"". The court heard he also researched the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby and information on how to steal a car. His mobile phone contained images of the truck attacks in Nice and Berlin. When arrested, the boy was found with a gutting knife and a hammer in his school rucksack, and the ""martyrdom letter"" said he was a ""soldier of the Islamic state"" and ""more attacks will follow"". He had also told police in an interview he had been talking to someone called ""Al Baghdadi"" online, who had told the boy he would go to hell as he did not believe in Islam. But his defence barrister Delroy Henry argued he was not planning an attack but had a ""stupid interest in the gory"". The boy told the jury he wanted to see how easy it was to research terror-related topics online. The boy was found guilty of one charge of engaging in the preparation of a terrorist act, two charges of encouraging terrorism, and a further two charges of possessing terrorist information. Sentencing will take place on 10 January. The court heard the teenager posted a picture of Cardiff Castle online Sue Hemming, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""This teenager's behaviour over many months leaves no doubt that he intended to kill and maim as many people as possible in an attack reminiscent of the incident on Westminster Bridge. ""He was also posting extremist content online that could have encouraged others to commit terrorist acts and downloading instructions on how to carry out 'lone wolf' attacks. ""He will now rightly face the prospect of a substantial prison sentence."" Det Supt Lee Porter, of Wales Extremism Counter Terrorism Unit, said the investigation ""prevented further offences being committed"" and warned the public to be ""vigilant"". He added: ""This case has highlighted the ongoing concerns with young people gaining access to extremist material on the internet and how quickly that can lead to radicalisation.""

Why I home-educate my daughter,"This video can not be played Lorna Lynch has decided to home-educate her daughter Emily who has a form of autism Lorna Lynch is one of a growing number of parents home-educating a child with special needs. In the last five years, their numbers have grown by 57% across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Almost a thousand children with recognised needs are waiting for a school place. Ministers in England say they're investing to improve the system. For the past year, 11-year-old Emily has been educated at home, with extra educational activities arranged by her mother Lorna. Emily has been diagnosed withautism,externalandADHD,external, and is now on medication to manage anxiety. Home-schooling was a decision Lorna Lynch reached reluctantly after her daughter struggled to understand both lessons and other children's behaviour. ""I couldn't cope with her going to school and then coming back with her so stressed out, so angry at me."" Emily found school confusing and overwhelming. ""I want to learn things that I'm interested in - but it's like I can't learn anything because I don't know how and they don't tell me how."" She would become angry and lash out at other children. ""The meltdowns were horrendous,"" says Lorna, who tried three different schools before deciding to home-educate. While she now feels it is the right decision, she also thinks if more support had been available, it is a step she would not have had to take. Lorna is currently appealing against a decision to refuse Emily an Education and Health Care Plan which is the official recognition of special needs. An investigation by BBC Breakfast suggests her case is part of a growing trend. Across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 106 councils were able to provide information stretching back five years. It revealed a 57% increase in children with a statement, or equivalent, being educated at home. There has also been a rise in the number of children with recognised needs, but without a school place. Almost 1,000 children with this highest level of special needs are waiting for a place. Dr Adam Boddison, the chief executive of the special needs charityNasen,,externalsaid schools are finding it hard to remain inclusive because of performance measures and pressure on their budgets. ""If word gets round that a school is meeting needs, it becomes a magnet. ""The school is overwhelmed, they can't meet the needs. ""All schools are judged on the same criteria. ""So some are very inclusive, others are not."" The data revealed by the BBC investigation is part of a trend that he has noticed with one important change. ""Now too many families don't think they have another option, and have to resort to home education, and that can't be right."" Cash boost for pupils with special needs and disability The children in care left without a school place Special needs pupils lack crucial support, poll suggests In England, where the increase in home education is highest, at 64% over the last five years, the government said it is creating more places at special schools, and is spending Â£222m over four years on reforms of special educational needs and disability support. Children and Families Minister Robert Goodwill said: ""We recognise the importance of ensuring that schools have the necessary resources to meet a wide range of special educational needs."" Mr Goodwill pointed out that all schools have a duty to admit children with special educational needs and are eligible for local authority top-up funding to provide additional support.

More young people acting as 'money mules',"The number of young people caught acting as ""money mules"" has doubled in the past four years, according to the UK's fraud prevention service, Cifas. A mule allows their bank account to be used by others to transfer money in and out of it, and in return, keep some of the money for themselves. The money to be laundered is likely to have come from drug smuggling, people trafficking and terrorism, experts say. If caught, money mules have their bank accounts closed and could face jail. Between January and September of this year, there were 8,652 cases involving 18-24-year-olds, Cifas said. It added that young people, including students, are often targeted because they are vulnerable and short of money. Adverts can appear online through a social media post, offering cash rewards for little work. The job advertised might be a ""financial manager"" or ""UK representative"", and a UK bank account will be a requirement. Criminals 'using children as money mules' Overseas students targeted by bank account fraudsters Do not give bank details to anyone you do not know or trust Be wary of job offers where all interactions and transactions are done online Be cautious of unsolicited offers of easy money Research any company that makes you a job offer Be wary of job offers written in poor English with grammatical errors or spelling mistakes Source:Don't Be Fooled,external The rise in cases has prompted a new campaign,Don't Be Fooled,external. It features a film called Sponsor a Child Trafficker, warning would-be mules of the key role they could play ""in the life of a criminal and the innocent people they enslave"". Money laundering is illegal and can lead to 14 years imprisonment. Those caught could struggle to obtain student loans, mobile phone contracts or other financial products if their bank account is closed due to money laundering. Katy Worobec, from UK Finance, said money muling is money laundering. ""We're urging people not to give their bank account details to anyone unless they know and trust them,"" she said. ""If an offer of easy money sounds too good to be true, it probably is."" Simon Dukes, chief executive of Cifas, said he hoped educating young people about how serious this type of fraud is, will make them think twice before getting involved.

Ethical hackers boost NHS cyber-defences,"About one-third of UK health trusts were caught out by the WannaCry ransomware worm TheNHS is spending Â£20m to set up a security operations,externalcentre that will oversee the health service's digital defences. It will employ ""ethical hackers"" to look for weaknesses in health computer networks, not just react to breaches. Such hackers use the same tactics seen in cyber-attacks to help organisations spot weak points. In May, one-third of UK health trusts were hit by the WannaCry worm, which demanded cash to unlock infected PCs. In a statement, Dan Taylor, head of the data security centre at NHS Digital, said the centre would create and run a ""near-real-time monitoring and alerting service that covers the whole health and care system"". The centre would also help the NHS improve its ""ability to anticipate future vulnerabilities while supporting health and care in remediating current known threats"", he said. And operations centre guidance would complement the existing teams the NHS used to defend itself against cyber-threats. NHS Digital, the IT arm of the health service, has issued an invitation to tender to find a partner to help run the project and advise it about the mix of expertise it required. Kevin Beaumont, a security vulnerability manager, welcomed the plan to set up the centre. ""This is a really positive move,"" he told the BBC. Many private sector organisations already have similar central teams that use threat intelligence and analysis to keep networks secure. ""Having a function like this is essential in modern-day organisations,"" Mr Beaumont said. ""In an event like WannaCry, the centre could help hospitals know where they are getting infected from in real time, which was a big issue at the time, organisations were unsure how they were being infected"". In October, the UK's National Audit Office said NHS trusts had been caught out by the WannaCry worm because they had failed to follow recommended cyber-security policies. The NAO report said NHS trusts had not acted on critical alerts from NHS Digital or on warnings from 2014 that had urged users to patch or migrate away from vulnerable older software.

The prince and the actress,"Prince Harry confirmed he was dating Meghan Markle in November 2016 US actressMeghan Markle and Prince Harry are to marryin spring 2018, Clarence House has announced. There had been much speculation about the pair since they were pictured together at the Invictus Games's opening ceremony in September. But how has their relationship developed? The couple met through mutual friends in London in July 2016 when one of Ms Markle's close friends, Markus Anderson, reportedly introduced her to the prince. No ordinary royal engagement Who is Meghan Markle? Prince Harry Profile Meghan Markle's life amongst Toronto 'royalty' Mr Anderson, who sat next to Ms Markle at the Invictus Games, is linked with private members club Soho House - of which Harry is a member. Markus Anderson with Meghan in Toronto supporting Harry But it wasn't until months after the initial London meeting that the press managed to get news of their blossoming romance. The Sunday Express was the first paper to reveal the 36-year-old was Prince Harry's new girlfriend with the news featuring on the front page last October. In the days after it broke, the pair went to a Halloween party where the prince reportedly donned a mask and went trick-or-treating. In November 2016, the prince officially confirmed he was dating the US actress. In astatement,externalfrom Kensington Palace, he also took the opportunity to condemn Ms Markle's treatment by the press. He referred to a ""smear"" on the front page of a national newspaper, racial undertones in comment  pieces and ""outright sexism and racism"" from online trolls. There had been a ""bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker, and loved one in her life"", the prince said. He was worried about her safety and was ""deeply disappointed"" to not have been able to protect her. Digital editor of OK! Online Kelby McNally says the statement came as a ""surprise"" because their relationship hadn't been officially confirmed. ""This is proof that the younger generation of royals are moving away from some of the stereotypical stiff-upper lip royal behaviour,"" she says. The Daily Mirror's Royal Correspondent, Victoria Murphy, said it showed Harry's ""strong desire to both protect her and hang onto her"". Could Meghan appear at the next fly-past? The Duke of Cambridge signed off Harry's plea to the press agreeing the situation had gone too far. Prince William ""understands the situation concerning privacy and supports the need for Prince Harry to support those closest to him"", a statement from Kensington Palace said. In mid-November of that year, Ms Markle was photographed out and about in Kensington doing some shopping in the high street, with the press suggesting she had been staying at Kensington Palace's Nottingham Cottage, where the prince lives. The couple have rarely been seen in public together Despite the couple trying to keep a lid on their affairs, a cheeky comment during a royal tour put the prince firmly back in the limelight. While on a 15-day trip to the West Indies later that month, Harry was made the offer to honeymoon in Antigua by the country's prime minister. In front of hundreds of guests, Gaston Browne said: ""I am told that there may be a princess and I just want to say that should you make the decision to honeymoon - then Antigua and Barbuda want to welcome you."" The PM continued to stress the honeymoon credentials of his country but the prince didn't seem to respond to the invitation. Miss Antigua and Barbuda (wearing crown), said ""everyone"" wanted to be the prince's princess In December the couple were gearing up for their first Christmas together. But where would they spend it - at Ms Markle's home in Toronto or London? The pair chose the latter to carry out their first festive tradition. They were pictured by the tabloids reportedly buying a Â£65 Nordmann Fir at the Pine and Needles store in Battersea Park, London. Actress Ms Markle was seen as a ""far cry"" from the prince's previous girlfriends which made their story all the more compelling, Ms McNally says. ""I think people are intrigued to see if much will change for her - after all, she is dating a real-life prince. Will she carry on her acting career as normal? Will they reside in the UK or the US?"" Ms Markle may have to join the other royals when they go to church on Christmas Day Later that month, the couple were pictured for the first time on a trip to London's West End. Prince Harry and Ms Markle were snapped strolling hand-in-hand before watching the play The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time at the Gielgud Theatre. New year, next milestone. According to reports, they went on their first holiday together in January 2017. For their trip, the prince reportedly took Ms Markle to see the Northern Lights in Tromso, Norway after spending New Year together. The pair are thought to have stayed in a cabin for seven days where they went whale-watching and spent time on the nearby lake. In March the prince took Ms Markle as his plus one to one of his best friend's weddings in Montego Bay, Jamaica, where he was an usher at the ceremony. Ms Markle cheered on boyfriend Harry in full view Fast forward to May and Ms Markle was pictured at a polo match supporting her boyfriend. She was seen smiling and clapping as she watched Prince Harry play at Coworth Park, Berkshire. They didn't seem to hide their affections for one another as the prince kissed Ms Markle before the event, which he went on to win. It was one of several matches Princes Harry and William have played for charity. While all eyes were on Pippa Middleton's summer wedding many were intrigued to see if Ms Markle would attend and really be part of the family. Ms Middleton married financier boyfriend James Matthews in May at a ceremony in Englefield, Berkshire where crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of the dress, the royals and to see if Harry's girlfriend would turn up. She didn't attend the ceremony, but was snapped arriving for the evening reception with the prince fuelling more speculation about the couple's romance. Prince Harry attended Pippa Middleton's wedding ceremony alone and Meghan joined him later In late August, the couple went on a three-week holiday to Africa to celebrate Meghan's 36th birthday and on their return Vanity Fair magazine declared Ms Markle was ""wild about Harry"". In an interviewwith the magazine,externalshe revealed they had been together for six months before the rest of the world found out. The actress said she had hoped people would understand ""this is our time"". ""We're two people who are really happy and in love. ""This is for us. It's part of what makes it so special, that it's just ours. But we're happy. Personally, I love a great love story."" The Suits actress said she was ""in love"" with Harry in September In September, the couple made their first public appearance at the Invictus Games, an international sporting event set up by Harry for injured soldiers. They sat separately at the opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada but were then pictured together as they arrived for the wheelchair tennis event a few days later. Crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of the couple strolling hand-in-hand and press rushed to capture the moment. Ms Markle's mother was also photographed with them at the closing ceremony of the games. Ms Markle seemed to adjust to royal duties with ease The Daily Mirror's Royal Correspondent, Victoria Murphy said their relaxed appearance shows they were ""keen to present themselves to the world as a couple"". ""Were they 10 years younger it may be a case of 'wait and see', but they are two people in their mid-30s who know what they want from life - and who they want to share it with.

Watchdog 'recommends vaginal mesh ban',"The mesh is made of polypropylene - the same material used to make certain drinks bottles The health watchdog NICE is to recommend that vaginal mesh operations should be banned from treating organ prolapse in England, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show has learned. Draft guidelines from NICE say the implants should only be used for research - and not routine operations. Some implants can cut into the vagina and women have been left in permanent pain, unable to walk, work or have sex. One expert said it is highly likely the NHS will take up the recommendation. However, the organisation is not compelled to act on findings it receives from NICE. Both NHS England and NICE declined to comment. This video can not be played Stephanie and Peter Williams say it's made it ""impossible"" for them to be intimate In the documents - to be published after consultation in December - NICE said there were ""serious but well-recognised safety concerns"" and that ""evidence of long-term efficacy [for implants treating organ prolapse] is inadequate in quality and quantity"". It added that ""when complications occur, these can be serious and have life-changing consequences"", but said ""most commentaries received from patients reported satisfaction with the procedure"". One woman, Margie Maguire, 41 - told theVictoria Derbyshire programmeshe cannot have any more children or walk unaided because of the damage caused by the mesh. ""I have chronic pelvic pain on a daily basis and I'm on nine different medications when I have a pain attack. ""These can last from two to six hours at a time and is like having a heart attack,"" she said. Kate Langley told the programme in April she had been admitted to hospital 53 times to try to end the pain, but - like many women - the mesh was so near the nerve it could not be fully removed. She has been left with nerve damage and in permanent pain by the implants, giving up her business as a childminder because the pain was so intense. The surgeon who first examined her, she explained, ""could see the [mesh] tape had come through my vagina - protruding through"". Kate Langley has been left in permanent pain by her vaginal mesh implant The plastic meshes are made of polypropylene - the same material used to make certain drinks bottles - and manufactured by many different companies. They are used to support organs such as the vagina, uterus, bowel, bladder or urethra which have prolapsed after childbirth. The University of Oxford's Prof Carl Heneghan, an expert in the subject, said the draft guidelines were an admission that health services had ""got this wrong"" - calling the use of mesh a ""catastrophe"". He described the draft guidelines as a ""backdoor ban"" on implants that would effectively end their use. But he said it had come too late. Prof Heneghan says the use of the implants has been ""absolutely farcical"" ""Seven years I have been watching this emerge - it is absolutely farcical how bad it is. Either they're burying their heads in the sand or they don't know what they're doing."" He called for a registry to be created for everyone who had been treated with the implants so that their effects could be fully understood. In April, the BBC learnedmore than 800 UK women are taking legal actionagainst the NHS and the makers of vaginal mesh implants. The NICE documents suggest ""randomised controlled trial data showed no added benefit of using mesh compared with native tissue repair"". Mesh implants are used to treat organ prolapse and urinary incontinence Between April 2007 and March 2015, more than 92,000 women had vaginal mesh implants in England, according to NHS data from the Hospital Episodes Statistics. About one in 11 women has experienced problems, the data suggests. The use of vaginal mesh to treat urinary incontinence is not mentioned in the draft NICE guidelines. In Scotland, former Scottish Health Secretary Alex Neil requested a suspension of mesh implants by the NHS in 2014, but figures obtained by the BBC in December 2016 showed hundreds of operations have been performed since. A number of Scottish health boards have stopped using mesh implants altogether. The mesh is also used routinely in hernia repairdespite concerns it is leaving many patients in chronic pain. The Department of Health declined to comment. Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.

Cat death linked to 'Croydon killer',"The animal was found on a car in Mendip Road, Northampton A cat was ""deliberately mutilated"" and its body placed on top of a car near the pet owner's home, police have said. The animal was found in Mendip Road, Northampton, on Sunday 19 November. The killing happened between 20:00 GMT on 18 November and 08:00 the next day. It is the third time in three months that a cat has been killed in the town and dumped near its owner's home. Northamptonshire Police said the attacks were all being linked to the ""Croydon cat killer"" investigation. In one case in August,a 14-year-old girl found the mutilated body of her petdumped on her doorstep. The head, limbs and ears of the ginger cat had been cut off and put into a bag before it was left outside the property in Betjeman Court, Northampton. The family's other cat was deliberately set on fire a few days earlier but survived. Rusty, a one-year-old cat, was mutilated and left on the doorstep of its owner's home in August The Met Police began investigatinga series of pet killings, which started in the Croydon area in 2015, after an animal charity raised concerns. Tony Jenkins, head of the South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty, said about 250 cats had been killed in similar circumstances since October 2015 and 50 foxes were found with ""identical injuries to the cats"". He is also investigating the deaths of five rabbits and two decapitated swans to see whether they might be linked.

'A real representation of British society',"This video can not be played When Harry met Meghan Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement is shining a light on inter-racial couples in the UK. Ms Markle, who is ofAfrican-American and white heritage,external, is set to become the first mixed-race member of the British Royal Family, with her and Prince Harry the first interracial royal couple. But inter-racial relationships in general in the UK are nothing new. According to the Office for National Statistics, the rate of mixed relationships has increased in the last few years,with one in 10 people being in them,externalat the last census. Some other inter-racial couples told us about their personal experiences of being in a mixed relationship - and their thoughts on the royal couple. Astrid and Mike say Prince Harry and Meghan represent true British society French native Astrid and her partner of 10 years, Mike, who is Kenyan and Rwandan, live together in Birmingham. Astrid says at first she did think about how some people might react to their relationship, particularly how her grandparents would react to Mike. ""Because of World War Two, my grandpa expressed certain views towards Africans, so I worried about how he would be. ""But when he met Mike, he loved him. Sometimes I over-think how people will react."" The couple, who are both 28, welcomed their first daughter a year ago and gave her five names so that she would have links to both her European and African descent. They say they think it is time for people to drop the inter-racial label, and see mixed couples as the norm. Speaking about the royal relationship, Astrid says: ""I think it's amazing. It shows how diverse and modern the Royal Family are. ""This will set a great example for England and it's an honest representation of British society."" Shantania and Billy have faced offensive insults online Shantania Beckford, 24, and Billy Clifford, 23, from Birmingham, are from Jamaican and English heritage. The couple, who met online, collectively have a social media following of over 300,000, and they say their public mixed relationship has resulted in some insults and trolling. ""Some people don't believe that black and white should be together, but we laugh it off. ""We can't let negative stuff get to us, we delete the comments and get over it. ""You can't live for other people, you have to live for you."" Despite being in a mixed relationship, Shantania says that when she first found out about Prince Harry and Ms Markle's relationship, she was surprised. ""To be honest with you, I didn't think they were going to let a black person into the Royal Family. ""Meghan really has substance to her, but I wonder how the Queen feels?"" The couple believe this is a step forward for the future of the Royal Family. ""People will be a lot more accepting of mixed couples now, and talk about interracial issues. ""I'm happy for them, it's a positive thing."" Sara and Adam say it's 'difficult' for people to still have bad views on mixed relationships Sara Khoo, 23, is of mixed Icelandic and Chinese heritage and Adam D'hill, 28, is Portuguese and African American. The couple have been together for two years, after meeting in Brighton. They say their families were accepting of their relationship, and say that in this day and age ""it's difficult to still have biased views"". Sara says: ""I was scared to introduce Adam to my family because he's a boy, not because he's black - that's never been a problem."" When asked about Prince Harry's relationship, they both felt it was a ""great thing"". ""We find it hard to comment, because I don't see how people would have an issue with their relationship; we don't see it as a problem."" Andrea, who met her husband in the 1980s, was worried about how her parents would react English-born Andrea Walker, from Sheffield, met her Pakistani husband Zahid in 1987. The couple got married and had three children before splitting up four years later. When introducing Zahid to her family, Andrea, 55, remembers her main worry being the fact he was from a different religious background. ""It wasn't about the race, but the religion. I was worried about how my parents would react. ""I was brought up in a Christian home, so in my head I thought 'what are my parents going to say about this?'"" She says both her and Zahid's family gave their blessing to the relationship, but her colleagues and some strangers were not as accepting. On one occasion, Andrea says, she was told off at work for wearing trousers. ""Someone told my boss I wore trousers because I was married to a Muslim man; he called me in and demanded I start wearing a skirt."" People were curious to see what Andrea's children would look like Following the birth of her first son, she says, people were often curious to see him. ""I would see them looking, and they'd try to look into the pram to see what colour the baby was."" Andrea says that since the 80s people's attitudes towards mixed marriages have changed, but she is unsure whether or not an interracial royal marriage will be met with open arms. ""I think royalists are going to be really torn with this relationship - yes, she's part black, but she's also very good looking and smart, so it may not be a huge problem. ""Racism is always going to be around no matter what, but you'd hope people would get over it."" And as for the prince and Ms Markle, she said: ""I think it's exciting.""

Actress fined for using VIP traffic lane,"Ms Lopez has been accused by the authorities of bragging out her act on social media Actress Maria Isabel Lopez has had her driving licence revoked in the Philippines after she used a driving lane reserved for dignitaries attending a key summit in Manila, officials say. The Filipina movie star has been fined and barred from reacquiring a driver's licence for the next two years. Ms Lopez is reported to have said she had to use the lane reserved for summit officials to have a ""bladder break"". The former beauty pageant winner has starred in several hit films. The award-winning actress, 55, said on Facebook that she needed ""a bladder break"" because she had been travelling by road for hours. But the country's transport department accused her of dangerously removing orange cones that cordoned off a lane in the road for officials attending the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) meeting earlier this month. Ms Lopez posted a video online, in which she could be heard shouting ""Yeeeeeo! Asean, here I come!"", as her vehicle entered the VIP lane. Ms Lopez described her actions on Facebook Transport officials accused her of endangering her own life, and the lives of dignitaries and commuters. Ms Lopez has been fined 8,000 pesos (Â£120; $160) for ignoring traffic signs, reckless driving and violating the Anti-Distracted Driving Act. Manila is renowned for having some of the worst traffic jams in the world The Transportation Office said that she had ""expressly admitted her failure to meet the conditions concomitant with the grant of her licence"", and that the defence she proffered was ""considered lame and self-serving"". End of the road for Jeepneys in the Philippines? Manila voted worst city to drive on Earth It added: ""Worse, she showed no remorse and even publicised with gusto her improper and illegal acts on social media, which betrays her utter lack of responsibility as a licensed driver, thus making her an improper person to operate a motor vehicle."" Ms Lopez wrote on Facebook,externalthat she had deceived traffic enforcers into believing she was an official Asean delegate. ""If you can't beat them, you join them,"" she wrote, alongside her video. ""I removed the divider cones!! Then all the other motorists behind me followed!"" She later apologised to those who were ""hurt and affected"" by her actions and has urged the authorities to treat her leniently.

Meghan Markle's life among Toronto 'royalty',"The children of Meghan Markle's close friends have been given key roles in the wedding What does Meghan Markle's life in Toronto tell us about the new royal? For years, she lived in the Canadian city relatively under the radar. That was before she became publicly linked to Prince Harry - arguably the world's most eligible bachelor - and subsequently the most googled actress of 2016. The Los Angeles native had settled into her adopted city of Toronto where Suits, the cable legal drama in which she co-stars, is filmed. The American actress would spend time at Trinity Bellwoods Park in the trendy West Queen West neighbourhood, dine at restaurants near her home in the Annex, grab groceries at specialty shops in Kensington Market, and have drinks at the private Soho House club downtown. Harry condemns press 'abuse' of girlfriend 'Meghan who?' LA shrugs over Harry's girlfriend Here are five things about the actress's Toronto life that offer a hint into what she might be like as a royal. Vancouver's Amanda Dishaw, who runs the blog Meghan's Mirror along with US-based colleague Christine O'Brien, says Ms Markle is ""very loyal to a very small group of friends"". Even before meeting Prince Harry, Ms Markle was embraced by a duo that Toronto Life magazine called the city's""most polished power couple"",external- Jessica and Ben Mulroney. Ben Mulroney is the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and is a prominent TV host and entertainment reporter - Canada's answer to Ryan Seacrest. Ben and Jessica Mulroney, pictured in 2009 Jessica Mulroney, with a career in fashion and marketing, is from one of Montreal's most prominent clans, a descendant of the founder of a national shoe retail empire. She is also fashion adviser to Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, the wife of current Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. Until Ms Markle dialled down her once robust social media presence - her last Instagram post was in April, the same month she shuttered her lifestyle blog The Tig - the two regularly appeared in cameos on each other's feeds. They've posted pictures of themselves at a Toronto Blue Jays baseball game, holidaying on the Italian island of Capri and spending a weekend evening drinking wine on the sofa. The Mulroneys and Trudeaus - Canada's pre-eminent political families - are close, and Ms Markle knows the Trudeaus through her humanitarian work. Mulroney's children- Ivy, four, and seven-year-old twins Brian and John - are among the bridesmaids and pageboys at the wedding. It is also rumoured that the Canadian stylist was involved in helping to plan the event. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

She was photographed arriving at Heathrow Airport with her family on Tuesday night. Former society columnist Rosemary Sexton says the two families are ""Canadian royalty"". ""It seems only fitting that she hangs around with [them]."" Mr Trudeau, like other political leaders, was not invited to the wedding. The actress is also good friends with Markus Anderson, the Toronto-based global membership director of Soho House, who is rumoured to have introduced the couple and was another regular on Ms Markle's Instagram. This video can not be played Meghan Markle's 'low profile' in Toronto Dishaw says she's been surprised at how few paparazzi photographs have been taken of the actress in recent months. The photos that have emerged often show Ms Markle on the way to the gym, shopping with Mulroney, or walking her dogs. Despite her high-profile friendships, she seems to prefer more private spots over the fashionable ones.  She's often spotted heading to hot yoga at one of the more reasonably priced studios in the city. Dishaw says Ms Markle goes to places more focused on ""the overall sense of wellness rather than the trendiest kind of yoga classes"". Meghan Markle and Prince Harry hold hands during their first public appearance as a couple ""In London she won't be going to the really trendy popular places in Belgravia. She'll probably try to find a place a little bit quieter,"" she says. The actress' style is a casual and minimalist California-girl-meets-downtown-Toronto style that Ms Markle has dubbed ""Aspirational Girl Next Door,external"". It's a uniform - jeans, simple shirts, flats, a nice coat - and Dishaw says ""she's gotten it down to an art"". Ms Markle didn't veer from the look during her first public appearance at the Invictus Games with Prince Harry, even wearing a favourite pair of distressed jeans Dishaw says are still ""hotly, hotly debated"" on the blog. Meghan Markle's oxblood jacket from Canadian designer Mackage quickly sold out Her style, which includes accessible pieces from chain stores, is easy to imitate. UK fashion boosted by 'Kate effect' Meghan Markle on her love for Harry Ms Markle already had a reputation as a fashion maven from her now defunct lifestyle site, The Tig. She also helped design two quickly sold-out capsule collections for Canadian retailer Reitmans. The collections were made up of affordable pieces based on her personal style and that of her Suits character, Rachel Zane. Dishaw and her colleague also run a site dedicated to Ms Markle's future sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge. Dishaw says she's seen interest move from what the duchess wears to ""really getting on board with the Meghan style"". ""It's really interesting for us to see this shift in royal fandom - this big shift towards Meghan and distancing themselves from Kate,"" she says. Why the fashion industry loves Meghan Markle Last December, staff at Canadian fashion house Mackage came into work to find a single item - a double breasted coat Ms Markle wore during her first public appearance after the engagement announcement - had sold out overnight. A white coat she wore by another Canadian brand, Line the Label, also flew off shelves. The coat has since been christened ""The Meghan"". Meghan Markle and Prince Harry share a joke Ms Markle has become increasingly used to fame during her acting career. In 2016,she told the Toronto Star newspaper,externalthat when she first moved to the city, Suits wasn't even airing in the country. She said she spent her first two years going to yoga studio ""Moksha downtown and trolling for girlfriends"". As Suits got broader exposure, including a Netflix deal, she described ""getting used to being famous so far from my support and comfort systems"" as an odd experience that brought the cast closer together. Over time, she has proven adept at crafting a polished social media image, garnering 1.9 million Instagram followers. Ms Markle also appears comfortable in the public eye, sharing her passion for philanthropy and interest in social activism. She is a global ambassador for World Vision Canada and involved with the One Young World summits and the UN's gender equality campaign. Ms Markle (second from left) with Suits cast in 2014 She has written openly about her struggle in Hollywood as a biracial actress. ""I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches - I've always wanted to be a woman who works,"" she has said on The Tig. ""And this type of work is what feeds my soul, and fuels my purpose."" Still, the actress told Vanity Fair earlier this year the media storm that comes with dating Prince Harry ""has its challenges"". ""There's always been some titillation for society watchers to see members of very different social classes fall in love - it's a Cinderella fairy tale coming true,"" says Sexton. But the former columnist says Ms Markle seems to have ""a poise and a sweetness and a calm demeanour that should stand her in good stead to go into the Royal Family"". Unlike Prince Harry, the actress wasn't raised with media scrutiny. This video can not be played Meghan Markle: Meet Prince Harry's girlfriend She grew up in a middle-class family in LA - her father was a lighting director, her mother is a social worker and yoga instructor - and has spoken about struggling to make ends meet in her early acting days. Ms Markle graduated from Northwestern Universitywith a double major in theatre and international studies. ""There's a stability to a normal middle-class person that perhaps the skittish temperamental blueblood might not possess,"" Sexton says. Ms Markle has spoken about how she has embraced Canada as a second home, a place she has lived in for nine months of the year for seven years, even getting used to Canadian winters. Dishaw says that her blog's American readers like to think of  Ms Markle as the next Grace Kelly - an American princess - but that Canadian visitors like to argue she came into her own while living in Toronto. That connection to Canada is something Dishaw believes ""plays in her favour with the Royal family"", given the country's status as a Commonwealth nation. Sexton says ""it wouldn't matter a hoot who Prince Harry had on his arm as far as Canadian society goes, because he or she would be welcomed with open arms"". But she says that having a Canadian - even an adopted one - marrying royalty is ""a real feather in our cap"".

No ordinary royal engagementThe prince and the actressVideoVideoWhen Harry met MeghanMeghan Markle's life among Toronto 'royalty',"This is no ordinary royal engagement. Meghan Markle brings something different to the British Royal Family. She is American, divorced, an actress and mixed race. She is also a campaigner with a variety of humanitarian interests and won't want her marriage to limit her ability to speak out and support various causes - particularly those of gender equality. As an advocate for UN Women, Ms Markle has worked on helping young girls reach their leadership potential. When she was first approached about working with the United Nations the Suits star insisted on undertaking a period of ""work experience"" first. Couple to marry next spring The prince and the actress Who is Meghan Markle? Prince Harry profile In her own time she shadowed Elizabeth Nyamayaro, a senior advisor at UN Women. Elizabeth was impressed by the intelligence, commitment and curiosity of the actress. The pair have since worked together closely on a number of UN missions and Elizabeth has no doubt that her friend and colleague will thrive in her new royal role. ""Her ability to listen, her passion for other people, wanting to create social change with that level of platform can only be a positive thing.  She'll be fine, she'll be great in fact."" Ms Markle addressed gender issues at the One Young World forum in Canada But the media coverage of the relationship in its early days unsettled sections of the British press and its readers. Prince Harry even took the unprecedented step ofissuing a public statement asking for privacyand describing some of the coverage as having ""racial undertones"". Much was made of his fiancÃ©e's upbringing in Los Angeles, with the area described as gang-infested and a place riddled with racial tension. However, Ms Markle actually grew up in avery middle class neighbourhood of Los Angelesand attended a private Catholic school. But in many ways she is an outsider. Prince Harry isn't following a traditional path - he's not marrying the daughter of a grand aristocratic family. His wife-to-be now has to negotiate her way through the British aristocracy, in a similar vein to her future sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge. It is an experience American nutritionist and author Julie Montagu knows well, as the future Countess of Sandwich. Born and brought up in Illinois, she married the son of the Earl of Sandwich and is now Viscountess Hinchingbrooke. She splits her time between London and the family estate, Mapperton, in Dorset. ""Even now I still get things wrong,"" she told me. ""The British upper classes have their own way of doing things. But as an American I bring my optimism, positivity and work ethic into the mix which I believe is hugely important."" Ms Markle is joining a family and entering a world unlike anything she has previously experienced. Yes it brings with it great privilege. But it also means a lack of privacy and the acceptance of a public life. As an actress she may find herself well equipped to deal with the scrutiny ahead.

He referred to a ""smear"" on the front page of a national newspaper, racial undertones in comment  pieces and ""outright sexism and racism"" from online trolls. There had been a ""bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker, and loved one in her life"", the prince said. He was worried about her safety and was ""deeply disappointed"" to not have been able to protect her. Digital editor of OK! Online Kelby McNally says the statement came as a ""surprise"" because their relationship hadn't been officially confirmed. ""This is proof that the younger generation of royals are moving away from some of the stereotypical stiff-upper lip royal behaviour,"" she says. The Daily Mirror's Royal Correspondent, Victoria Murphy, said it showed Harry's ""strong desire to both protect her and hang onto her"". Could Meghan appear at the next fly-past? The Duke of Cambridge signed off Harry's plea to the press agreeing the situation had gone too far. Prince William ""understands the situation concerning privacy and supports the need for Prince Harry to support those closest to him"", a statement from Kensington Palace said. In mid-November of that year, Ms Markle was photographed out and about in Kensington doing some shopping in the high street, with the press suggesting she had been staying at Kensington Palace's Nottingham Cottage, where the prince lives. The couple have rarely been seen in public together Despite the couple trying to keep a lid on their affairs, a cheeky comment during a royal tour put the prince firmly back in the limelight. While on a 15-day trip to the West Indies later that month, Harry was made the offer to honeymoon in Antigua by the country's prime minister. In front of hundreds of guests, Gaston Browne said: ""I am told that there may be a princess and I just want to say that should you make the decision to honeymoon - then Antigua and Barbuda want to welcome you."" The PM continued to stress the honeymoon credentials of his country but the prince didn't seem to respond to the invitation. Miss Antigua and Barbuda (wearing crown), said ""everyone"" wanted to be the prince's princess In December the couple were gearing up for their first Christmas together. But where would they spend it - at Ms Markle's home in Toronto or London? The pair chose the latter to carry out their first festive tradition. They were pictured by the tabloids reportedly buying a Â£65 Nordmann Fir at the Pine and Needles store in Battersea Park, London. Actress Ms Markle was seen as a ""far cry"" from the prince's previous girlfriends which made their story all the more compelling, Ms McNally says. ""I think people are intrigued to see if much will change for her - after all, she is dating a real-life prince. Will she carry on her acting career as normal? Will they reside in the UK or the US?"" Ms Markle may have to join the other royals when they go to church on Christmas Day Later that month, the couple were pictured for the first time on a trip to London's West End. Prince Harry and Ms Markle were snapped strolling hand-in-hand before watching the play The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time at the Gielgud Theatre. New year, next milestone. According to reports, they went on their first holiday together in January 2017. For their trip, the prince reportedly took Ms Markle to see the Northern Lights in Tromso, Norway after spending New Year together. The pair are thought to have stayed in a cabin for seven days where they went whale-watching and spent time on the nearby lake. In March the prince took Ms Markle as his plus one to one of his best friend's weddings in Montego Bay, Jamaica, where he was an usher at the ceremony. Ms Markle cheered on boyfriend Harry in full view Fast forward to May and Ms Markle was pictured at a polo match supporting her boyfriend. She was seen smiling and clapping as she watched Prince Harry play at Coworth Park, Berkshire. They didn't seem to hide their affections for one another as the prince kissed Ms Markle before the event, which he went on to win. It was one of several matches Princes Harry and William have played for charity. While all eyes were on Pippa Middleton's summer wedding many were intrigued to see if Ms Markle would attend and really be part of the family. Ms Middleton married financier boyfriend James Matthews in May at a ceremony in Englefield, Berkshire where crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of the dress, the royals and to see if Harry's girlfriend would turn up. She didn't attend the ceremony, but was snapped arriving for the evening reception with the prince fuelling more speculation about the couple's romance. Prince Harry attended Pippa Middleton's wedding ceremony alone and Meghan joined him later In late August, the couple went on a three-week holiday to Africa to celebrate Meghan's 36th birthday and on their return Vanity Fair magazine declared Ms Markle was ""wild about Harry"". In an interviewwith the magazine,externalshe revealed they had been together for six months before the rest of the world found out. The actress said she had hoped people would understand ""this is our time"". ""We're two people who are really happy and in love. ""This is for us. It's part of what makes it so special, that it's just ours. But we're happy. Personally, I love a great love story."" The Suits actress said she was ""in love"" with Harry in September In September, the couple made their first public appearance at the Invictus Games, an international sporting event set up by Harry for injured soldiers. They sat separately at the opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada but were then pictured together as they arrived for the wheelchair tennis event a few days later. Crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of the couple strolling hand-in-hand and press rushed to capture the moment. Ms Markle's mother was also photographed with them at the closing ceremony of the games. Ms Markle seemed to adjust to royal duties with ease The Daily Mirror's Royal Correspondent, Victoria Murphy said their relaxed appearance shows they were ""keen to present themselves to the world as a couple"". ""Were they 10 years younger it may be a case of 'wait and see', but they are two people in their mid-30s who know what they want from life - and who they want to share it with. ""It seems the public won't have to wait long for another royal wedding.""

Pharma deals 'show confidence' in strategy,"A scientist at the Francis Crick Institute one of the UK's leading research centres The government has said two deals to invest in the UK's biotech industry illustrate confidence in its industrial strategy, which it published on Monday. MSD, known as Merck in North America, will support a new research centre in London creating around 950 new posts. Germany's Qiagen will expand its investment in a genomics and diagnostics campus in Manchester. Business Secretary Greg Clark said it represented ""a huge vote of confidence"" in the government's approach. ""People don't make the investments of this scale that are for the long term if they don't have the confidence that we are building in this country a very attractive base,"" he said. Will the government's economic medicine work? Why isnât the UK more productive? The industrial strategy white paper outlines the government's plans to support more research and development, encourage firms to embrace new technology and boost the economy. It includes: Sector deals- Partnerships between government, academia and business. Deals have been agreed in life sciences, artificial intelligence, automotive, construction sectors. More are expected in other sectors next year. Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund- Another Â£725m on top of the Â£1bn announced in April. The first tranche was to support innovation in robotics and battery technology. The new money is for the construction and life sciences sectors Research and Development (R&D) tax credit-  As announced in the Budget, R&D tax credit will rise to 12%. The UK spends 1.7% of its economic output on R&D. The government has promised to raise that to 2.4%, in line with the average in other developed economies. The industrial strategy comes just days afterofficial forecasting body the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)announced an aggressive downgrade of its UK growth forecast. The OBR concluded that a slowdown in the growth of productivity - or the value that each worker produces - since the financial crisis will persist for several more years. MSD's managing director in the UK and Ireland, Louise Houson, linked the company's investment to the government's approach to the economy: ""This investment presents a major opportunity for us to work in collaboration with the UK government to build on the forward thinking and ambitious industrial strategy white paper being published."" Qiagen expects to sign a deal early next year to expand its presence in Manchester where it works on DNA-based diagnostics for personalised healthcare. The firm said it would add to its current staff of 270. The government said the investment had the potential to create 800 skilled job overall in the Manchester life sciences hub at Qiagen and other firms. The chief executive of Qiagen, Peer Schatz, said the involvement of the University of Manchester, the NHS Trust and the UK government were ""essential"" to the partnership they are investing in. Mr Clark said the UK's decision to leave the EU meant the strategy  was ""even more important"" and he said political commitments to limit immigration would not hamper the development of research related industries. He said the government would ""make it easier for more scientists to come and work in the UK"". Here's the idiot's guide to how it's supposed to work. Pick an industry that the UK is already good at and needs investment. Chuck in a bit of government money, cluster the right institutions around it, commit to provide the skills base and give them somewhere to try their new stuff. That could mean faster trials for drugs in the NHS or using public roads to test driverless cars. Hey presto - private investment ensues. Some will see this as another example of government's dodgy track record in ""picking winners"" - the government insists it is backing excellence. Of course, all of these new initiatives are being born under the star sign of Brexit which makes them children of uncertainty. Read Simon's blog in full Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed the industrial strategy, saying it showed the government ""has its eye firmly on the horizon, not just the next few yards"". But she added: ""Today's announcement must be the beginning of a strategic race, not a tactical sprint. And it needs to last. This is a time for consistency and determination, not perpetual change with the political winds."" She commended the creation of an independent council to monitor progress. However Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour's shadow secretary for business, said the white paper contained ""re-announced policies and old spending commitments"", and failed to provide certainty. ""What detail there is concentrates on a few elite industries in which Britain already has an advantage, and will do nothing to help the millions of people who work in low productivity and low wage sectors such as retail, hospitality and social care, or those based outside the ""Golden Triangle"" made up by London, Oxford and Cambridge."" The government has already pledged to invest an additional Â£80bn in R&D over the next decade. The white paper lists some of the government's previously announced pledges to improve productivity including technical education and training, investment in electric vehicle infrastructure and faster broadband. It also outlined four global trends which it believes the UK needs to take advantage of. These are: artificial intelligence and the data revolution clean energy and low carbon technologies innovations to support an ageing population future mobility such as driverless cars and drone-delivered goods The government describes these as ""grand challenges"" and is inviting business, academia and civil society to work with the government to tackle them. ""More decisions about our economic future will be in our own hands and it is vital that we take them,"" Mr Clark said. Will the government's economic medicine work?

Pope begins tricky Myanmar trip,"This video can not be played Myanmar welcomes Pope Francis Pope Francis has met Myanmar's military chief, as he begins the first papal visit to a country widely accused of ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. Gen Min Aung Hlaing denied any ""religious discrimination"" in a military campaign in Rakhine state. Officials in the Buddhist-majority country are watching closely to see how the Pope responds to the crisis. He has been urged by governments and rights groups to pressure them over their treatment of the Rohingyas. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar (also called Burma) for neighbouring Bangladesh since August whendeadly attacks on police posts by Rohingya militants prompted a military crackdown in Rakhine state. Thousands gathered in Yangon for the first papal trip to the Buddhist-majority country As part of his visit to the region, the Pope is also due to meet de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. After Myanmar, he will move on to Bangladesh to meet a small group of Rohingya refugees in a symbolic gesture. The 80-year-old pontiff has become known for his moderate views and willingness to denounce global injustice. What you need to know about Rohingya crisis Myanmar's persecuted minority in pictures More UK aid pledged for Myanmar's Rohingya The Pope met military chief Gen Min Aung Hlaing within hours of arriving in Myanmar. Gen Hlaing said he had told the pontiff that ""there's no religious discrimination in Myanmar and there's the freedom of religion"", according to his latest Facebook post. It is not known how the Pope responded. He has previously used the term ""our Rohingya brothers and sisters"" while denouncing the violence, but Myanmar's sole Catholic cardinal has asked him to avoid using it on the trip, to avoid inflaming local feelings. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke told reporters on Monday that Pope Francis was taking advice he had been given about using the term ""Rohingya"" seriously, adding: ""We will find out together during the trip... it is not a forbidden word."" His motorcade was welcomed by hundreds as it swept through central Yangon Myanmar officials do not use the term, instead labelling Rohingya as ""Bengalis"", and say they migrated illegally from Bangladesh so should not be listed as one of the country's ethnic groups. Bangladesh denies they are its citizens. Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Myanmar army exonerates self on Rohingya crisis Myanmar says the crackdown in Rakhine is to root out violent insurgents there, butthe UN has described the violence as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing""- a sentiment echoed by international critics.

House of Cards filming to 'resume soon',"Spacey is having treatment following the allegations House of Cards could be soon returning to production following the sexual harassment and assault allegations made against its star, Kevin Spacey. The hit Netflix show was forced to take a break following the claims and Spacey has now been dropped from the show. Pauline Micelli, senior vice president at the show's studio, Media Rights Capital, recently wrote to staff to say its hiatus was being extended. ""We continue to work with Netflix with the hope of resuming production soon."" Crew on the show will be paid until 8 December ""as we continue these discussions,"" her letter went on. Netflix previously announced it ""will not be involved with any further production of House of Cards that includes Kevin Spacey"". Kevin Spacey timeline Spacey film to be re-shot with different actor Scotland Yard investigate new sexual assault allegation Ms Micelli's letter addressed how stressful a period it had been for everyone working on the show. ""These last two months have tested and tried all of us in ways none of us could have foreseen,"" she wrote. ""The one thing we have learned throughout this process is that this production is bigger than just one person and we could not be more proud to be associated with one of the most loyal and talented production cast and crews in this business."" Spacey was at the Old Vic between 2004 and 2015 In the letter, published in theHollywood Reporter,external, she added: ""Our hope is that the entire crew will be able to reconvene when production resumes. ""But we want you to know that we will certainly understand if crew members need to find other work in the interim, which will prevent them from re-joining us. We sincerely appreciate all you have done"". She said that the writers would be continuing their work during the hiatus - presumably working on how to write Spacey out. Spacey, who was artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre, is currently being investigated by Scotland Yard over two allegations of sexual assault. He also faces claims of ""on-set sexual misconduct"" by members of the House of Cards production crew. Initial allegations about Spacey were made by actor Anthony Rapp in October. Rapp said he was 14 when Spacey allegedly harassed him following a party in 1986. Spacey claimed to have no memory of the alleged incident whileoffering an apology to Rapp""for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour"". The Old Vic has saidthat an internal investigation found 20 people claimed they had been the victims of inappropriate behaviour by Spacey, who was at the theatre between 2004 and 2015. A spokesperson for Spacey said the Oscar-winning actor has been ""taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment"" since the allegations surfaced.

Back in November last year, Prince Harry spoke out against what he called a ""wave of abuse and harassment"" against Ms Markle from the media and others. In a statement, he said there had been ""racial undertones"" in comment pieces and ""outright sexism and racism"" on social media. Ms Markle spoke in the interview earlier about her reaction to the coverage. ""Of course it's disheartening. It's a shame that is the climate in this world, to focus that much on that, or that it would be discriminatory in that sense,"" she said. ""At the end of the day I'm really proud of who I am and where I come from and we have never put any focus on that, we just focus on who we are as a couple."" Tonight's Eastenders will feature a short scene, filmed earlier today, which will make reference to the engagement. The scene is set in Kathyâs cafe. Prince Harry described the ring he gave to Ms Markle, which he designed and which includes diamonds from Diana's jewelry collection. He said the inclusion of the diamonds was ""to make sure she is with us on this crazy journey together"". Asked what it meant to her, Ms Markle said: ""Not being able to meet his mother, it's so important to me to know that she's a part of this with us."" Harry said Diana would have been ""over the moon, jumping up and down"" at the engagement and ""best friends with Meghan"". ""It's days like this I really miss having her around,"" he said. Ms Markle said she had met members of Harry's family on Charles and Diana's side, and described them as ""so welcoming"". She said she had met the Queen ""a couple of times"". ""It's incredible to meet her through his lens... The love that he has for his grandma, all of those layers have been so important to me."" Asked about their own plans, Harry said: ""One step at a time, hopefully we'll start a family in the near future."" You can watch the interview live now on BBC One using the player at the top of this page. Prince Harry described the couple as a ""fantastic team"" and said Ms Markle would easily take to the role of being a member of the Royal Family. ""The fact that I fell in love with Meghan so incredibly
quickly was confirmation to me that all the stars were aligned,"" he said. ""This beautiful
woman just tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life. I know that she
will be unbelievably good at the job part of it as well."" She said she would ""transition out of my career but into the role"" of being in the family. ""I'm excited to really get to know more about the different communities here and smaller organisations that are working on the same causes that I've always been passionate about."" The couple were introduced by a mutual friend in July 2016. Both knew they were being set up, but said they knew little about each other before the date. Ms Markle said the only thing she asked their mutual friend was: ""Is he nice?"" Harry said he had never heard of Ms Markle and never seen her TV drama, Suits. ""I was beautifully surprised when I walked into that room and saw her,"" he said. ""I was like, 'I'm really going to have to up my game here'."" Three or four weeks later, Prince Harry persuaded Ms Markle to join him in Botswana, he said, and the couple camped out under the stars for five days. ""We were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure we had a chance to get to know each other,"" he said. Prince Harry and his fiance Meghan Markle have described the night that he proposed to her, at the couple's shared cottage at Kensington Palace. In an interview with the BBC's Mishal Hussein, they revealed they were having an ordinary night in and ""trying to roast a chicken"" when Harry got down on one knee. ""It was just an amazing surprise,"" said Ms Markle. ""It was so sweet and natural and very romantic, he got on one knee."" It was an instant yes, she said. ""She didn't even let me finish,"" Harry said. Could the new Star Wars film be the newly-engaged couples first appearence? Meghan Markle's first official royal engagement could turn out to be the premiere of the Star Wars movie The Last Jedi. The European screening of the latest installment in the hit saga is set for 12 December at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The premiere will benefit the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of
Cambridge and Prince Harry, raising speculation that William, Kate and Harry
could attend. William and Harry are reported to have appeared in The Last Jedi in cameo roles
as Stormtroopers. The royals - both Star Wars fans - visited the set of movie in April 2016 and
were rumoured to have filmed a scene in disguise. Harry meets Chewie on the set of ""The Last Jedi"" last year The head of one of the UK's tourism bodies thinks that the next royal wedding is a ""potent mix"" which could boost visitor numbers. Bernard Donoghue, director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions,
said Ms Markle's American citizenship could generate even more interest than the marriage of William and Kate. ""The combination of Prince Harry's global fame, Meghan Markle's global fame as
an actress, her being American, Britain being much more affordable than it was
two years ago, really makes for a potent mix,"" he said. ""This is the first time an American actress has married a prince since Grace
Kelly,"" he added. Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Radlan (L) at the Invictus Games in Toronto earlier this year Since the announcement of the happy couple's engagement this morning, everyone from royal correspondents to Twitter users have been passing comment on Ms Markle's mixed-race heritage. In 2015, she wrote a first-person piece for Elle magazine laying out how she feels about it. In part, she spoke of having to fill out  a ""census"" for her English class, with the only options of black, white, Hispanic, or Asian. You could only choose one, but that would be to choose one parent over the other â and one half of myself over the other.  Her teacher told her to pick Caucasian, because - in the teacher's view - that's what she looked like. But a young Meghan refused. So, I didn't tick a box. I left my identity blank â a question mark, an absolute incomplete â much like how I felt. When I went home that night, I told my dad what had happened. He said the words that have always stayed with me: 'If that happens again, you draw your own box.'  Read the full feature at Elle magazine's website.,external Royal couple need 'something to sail around the sea with' Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee,
noted there is no  royal yacht and suggested the newly-engaged couple could make use of one. During a debate on new aircraft carrier provision Mr Tugendhat pleaded ""....with the royal wedding coming as early as next year, and with the absence
of the yacht Britannia, is there not a possibility the new prince and princess
will require something to sail around the sea with?"" Backbench Tory MPs have been leading the campaign for a new Royal Yacht. Allow Twitter content?

Jailed Britons win India appealThe six former British soldiers were jailed on weapons charges in 2013.15m16 minutes agoEngland,"(From top left, clockwise) Nick Dunn, Paul Towers, Nick Simpson, Ray Tindall, John Armstrong and Billy Irving Six British former soldiers who have been held on weapons charges in India since 2013 are to be released. They were arrestedwhile working as guards on a ship to combat piracy in the Indian Ocean. The so-called Chennai Six always denied the charges, which were initially quashed but later reinstated. They were sentenced to five years in 2016. The former soldiers appealed, and a judge has just ruled that they be acquitted. Get more updates on this story onBBC Local Live. The men, who were working on the anti-piracy ship MV Seaman Guard Ohio, are: Nick Dunn from Ashington, Northumberland Billy Irvingfrom Connel, Argyll Ray Tindall from Chester Paul Towers from Pocklington, East Yorkshire John Armstrong from Wigton, Cumbria Nicholas Simpson from Catterick, North Yorkshire This video can not be played Family of Nick Dunn react to news of release They were arrested on board a ship owned by an American company which offered armed protection services to vessels sailing through an area known as ""pirates' alley"" between the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. Customs officials and police found 35 guns, including semi-automatic weapons, and almost 6,000 rounds of ammunition on board the ship. Indian authorities said the weapons and ammunition had not been properly declared Initially charges were quashed when the men argued that the weapons were lawfully held for anti-piracy purposes and the paperwork, issued by the UK government, was in order. But a lower court reinstated the prosecution and they were convicted in January last year. Since then there has been a series of appeals. The families have long campaigned for the men's release, and took a petition to Downing Street The latest news has been welcomed by the men's families.

Councils 'make Â£819m from parking fees',"English councils generated Â£819m from parking fees and fines in 2016-17, an increase of 10% on the previous year, a study has suggested. This figure represents income from parking charges and penalty notices with running costs deducted. The RAC Foundation, which carried out the research, said motorists should ask how their council spends the cash. The Local Government Association said parking charge surpluses were spent on ""essential transport projects"". Income collected by the 353 English local authorities was up 6% and costs rose 2% compared with 2015-16, when the surplus was Â£744m. Many of the highest totals were seen in London, with the largest in Westminster, which had a surplus of Â£73.2m. Outside the capital, big surpluses were recorded in Brighton and Hove, Milton Keynes and Birmingham. Driver reverse parks on top of another car Parking space in St Ives sells for up to Â£40,000 'No change' parking meters make Â£650,000 in three years RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said the rise in profits reflects the ""record number of cars and volume of traffic"". ""We welcome the fact that councils are increasingly investing in technology to help make parking easier and less stressful,"" he added. Westminster Council has created an app to direct drivers to free parking spaces. Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said parking charges keep the roads clear, help pedestrians, motorists and cyclists safe and enable people to park near their homes. They also go towards tackling the UK's Â£12bn roads repair backlog, he added. An annual report from the Asphalt Industry Alliance this year found that almosta fifth of roadsin England and Wales were in ""poor"" condition. Councils were almost Â£730m short of what was needed to keep the road network in ""reasonable order"", it said. Westminster Â£73.2m Kensington and Chelsea Â£32.1m Camden Â£26.8 m Hammersmith and Fulham Â£23.1m Brighton and Hove Â£21.2m Wandsworth Â£20.5m Islington Â£19.1 m Haringey Â£14.6m Hackney Â£14.5m Hounslow Â£12.0m Source: the RAC Foundation Â£37m parking bill for drivers in Wales Parking space sells for up to Â£40,000 Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Pope begins tricky Myanmar tripOfficials have warned him not to use the term ""Rohingya"" to describe Muslims who have fled violence.","This video can not be played Myanmar welcomes Pope Francis Pope Francis has met Myanmar's military chief, as he begins the first papal visit to a country widely accused of ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. Gen Min Aung Hlaing denied any ""religious discrimination"" in a military campaign in Rakhine state. Officials in the Buddhist-majority country are watching closely to see how the Pope responds to the crisis. He has been urged by governments and rights groups to pressure them over their treatment of the Rohingyas. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar (also called Burma) for neighbouring Bangladesh since August whendeadly attacks on police posts by Rohingya militants prompted a military crackdown in Rakhine state. Thousands gathered in Yangon for the first papal trip to the Buddhist-majority country As part of his visit to the region, the Pope is also due to meet de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. After Myanmar, he will move on to Bangladesh to meet a small group of Rohingya refugees in a symbolic gesture. The 80-year-old pontiff has become known for his moderate views and willingness to denounce global injustice. What you need to know about Rohingya crisis Myanmar's persecuted minority in pictures More UK aid pledged for Myanmar's Rohingya The Pope met military chief Gen Min Aung Hlaing within hours of arriving in Myanmar. Gen Hlaing said he had told the pontiff that ""there's no religious discrimination in Myanmar and there's the freedom of religion"", according to his latest Facebook post. It is not known how the Pope responded. He has previously used the term ""our Rohingya brothers and sisters"" while denouncing the violence, but Myanmar's sole Catholic cardinal has asked him to avoid using it on the trip, to avoid inflaming local feelings. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke told reporters on Monday that Pope Francis was taking advice he had been given about using the term ""Rohingya"" seriously, adding: ""We will find out together during the trip... it is not a forbidden word."" His motorcade was welcomed by hundreds as it swept through central Yangon Myanmar officials do not use the term, instead labelling Rohingya as ""Bengalis"", and say they migrated illegally from Bangladesh so should not be listed as one of the country's ethnic groups. Bangladesh denies they are its citizens. Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Myanmar army exonerates self on Rohingya crisis Myanmar says the crackdown in Rakhine is to root out violent insurgents there, butthe UN has described the violence as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing""- a sentiment echoed by international critics.

Back in November last year, Prince Harry spoke out against what he called a ""wave of abuse and harassment"" against Ms Markle from the media and others. In a statement, he said there had been ""racial undertones"" in comment pieces and ""outright sexism and racism"" on social media. Ms Markle spoke in the interview earlier about her reaction to the coverage. ""Of course it's disheartening. It's a shame that is the climate in this world, to focus that much on that, or that it would be discriminatory in that sense,"" she said. ""At the end of the day I'm really proud of who I am and where I come from and we have never put any focus on that, we just focus on who we are as a couple."" Tonight's Eastenders will feature a short scene, filmed earlier today, which will make reference to the engagement. The scene is set in Kathyâs cafe. Prince Harry described the ring he gave to Ms Markle, which he designed and which includes diamonds from Diana's jewelry collection. He said the inclusion of the diamonds was ""to make sure she is with us on this crazy journey together"". Asked what it meant to her, Ms Markle said: ""Not being able to meet his mother, it's so important to me to know that she's a part of this with us."" Harry said Diana would have been ""over the moon, jumping up and down"" at the engagement and ""best friends with Meghan"". ""It's days like this I really miss having her around,"" he said. Ms Markle said she had met members of Harry's family on Charles and Diana's side, and described them as ""so welcoming"". She said she had met the Queen ""a couple of times"". ""It's incredible to meet her through his lens... The love that he has for his grandma, all of those layers have been so important to me."" Asked about their own plans, Harry said: ""One step at a time, hopefully we'll start a family in the near future."" You can watch the interview live now on BBC One using the player at the top of this page. Prince Harry described the couple as a ""fantastic team"" and said Ms Markle would easily take to the role of being a member of the Royal Family. ""The fact that I fell in love with Meghan so incredibly
quickly was confirmation to me that all the stars were aligned,"" he said. ""This beautiful
woman just tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life. I know that she
will be unbelievably good at the job part of it as well."" She said she would ""transition out of my career but into the role"" of being in the family. ""I'm excited to really get to know more about the different communities here and smaller organisations that are working on the same causes that I've always been passionate about."" The couple were introduced by a mutual friend in July 2016. Both knew they were being set up, but said they knew little about each other before the date. Ms Markle said the only thing she asked their mutual friend was: ""Is he nice?"" Harry said he had never heard of Ms Markle and never seen her TV drama, Suits. ""I was beautifully surprised when I walked into that room and saw her,"" he said. ""I was like, 'I'm really going to have to up my game here'."" Three or four weeks later, Prince Harry persuaded Ms Markle to join him in Botswana, he said, and the couple camped out under the stars for five days. ""We were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure we had a chance to get to know each other,"" he said. Prince Harry and his fiance Meghan Markle have described the night that he proposed to her, at the couple's shared cottage at Kensington Palace. In an interview with the BBC's Mishal Hussein, they revealed they were having an ordinary night in and ""trying to roast a chicken"" when Harry got down on one knee. ""It was just an amazing surprise,"" said Ms Markle. ""It was so sweet and natural and very romantic, he got on one knee."" It was an instant yes, she said. ""She didn't even let me finish,"" Harry said. Could the new Star Wars film be the newly-engaged couples first appearence? Meghan Markle's first official royal engagement could turn out to be the premiere of the Star Wars movie The Last Jedi. The European screening of the latest installment in the hit saga is set for 12 December at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The premiere will benefit the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of
Cambridge and Prince Harry, raising speculation that William, Kate and Harry
could attend. William and Harry are reported to have appeared in The Last Jedi in cameo roles
as Stormtroopers. The royals - both Star Wars fans - visited the set of movie in April 2016 and
were rumoured to have filmed a scene in disguise. Harry meets Chewie on the set of ""The Last Jedi"" last year The head of one of the UK's tourism bodies thinks that the next royal wedding is a ""potent mix"" which could boost visitor numbers. Bernard Donoghue, director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions,
said Ms Markle's American citizenship could generate even more interest than the marriage of William and Kate. ""The combination of Prince Harry's global fame, Meghan Markle's global fame as
an actress, her being American, Britain being much more affordable than it was
two years ago, really makes for a potent mix,"" he said. ""This is the first time an American actress has married a prince since Grace
Kelly,"" he added. Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Radlan (L) at the Invictus Games in Toronto earlier this year Since the announcement of the happy couple's engagement this morning, everyone from royal correspondents to Twitter users have been passing comment on Ms Markle's mixed-race heritage. In 2015, she wrote a first-person piece for Elle magazine laying out how she feels about it. In part, she spoke of having to fill out  a ""census"" for her English class, with the only options of black, white, Hispanic, or Asian. You could only choose one, but that would be to choose one parent over the other â and one half of myself over the other.  Her teacher told her to pick Caucasian, because - in the teacher's view - that's what she looked like. But a young Meghan refused. So, I didn't tick a box. I left my identity blank â a question mark, an absolute incomplete â much like how I felt. When I went home that night, I told my dad what had happened. He said the words that have always stayed with me: 'If that happens again, you draw your own box.'

Why I home-educate my daughterLorna Lynch is one of a growing number of parents educating a child with special needs at home.4h4 hours agoFamily & Education,"This video can not be played Lorna Lynch has decided to home-educate her daughter Emily who has a form of autism Lorna Lynch is one of a growing number of parents home-educating a child with special needs. In the last five years, their numbers have grown by 57% across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Almost a thousand children with recognised needs are waiting for a school place. Ministers in England say they're investing to improve the system. For the past year, 11-year-old Emily has been educated at home, with extra educational activities arranged by her mother Lorna. Emily has been diagnosed withautism,externalandADHD,external, and is now on medication to manage anxiety. Home-schooling was a decision Lorna Lynch reached reluctantly after her daughter struggled to understand both lessons and other children's behaviour. ""I couldn't cope with her going to school and then coming back with her so stressed out, so angry at me."" Emily found school confusing and overwhelming. ""I want to learn things that I'm interested in - but it's like I can't learn anything because I don't know how and they don't tell me how."" She would become angry and lash out at other children. ""The meltdowns were horrendous,"" says Lorna, who tried three different schools before deciding to home-educate. While she now feels it is the right decision, she also thinks if more support had been available, it is a step she would not have had to take. Lorna is currently appealing against a decision to refuse Emily an Education and Health Care Plan which is the official recognition of special needs. An investigation by BBC Breakfast suggests her case is part of a growing trend. Across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 106 councils were able to provide information stretching back five years. It revealed a 57% increase in children with a statement, or equivalent, being educated at home. There has also been a rise in the number of children with recognised needs, but without a school place. Almost 1,000 children with this highest level of special needs are waiting for a place. Dr Adam Boddison, the chief executive of the special needs charityNasen,,externalsaid schools are finding it hard to remain inclusive because of performance measures and pressure on their budgets. ""If word gets round that a school is meeting needs, it becomes a magnet. ""The school is overwhelmed, they can't meet the needs. ""All schools are judged on the same criteria. ""So some are very inclusive, others are not."" The data revealed by the BBC investigation is part of a trend that he has noticed with one important change. ""Now too many families don't think they have another option, and have to resort to home education, and that can't be right."" Cash boost for pupils with special needs and disability The children in care left without a school place Special needs pupils lack crucial support, poll suggests In England, where the increase in home education is highest, at 64% over the last five years, the government said it is creating more places at special schools, and is spending Â£222m over four years on reforms of special educational needs and disability support. Children and Families Minister Robert Goodwill said: ""We recognise the importance of ensuring that schools have the necessary resources to meet a wide range of special educational needs."" Mr Goodwill pointed out that all schools have a duty to admit children with special educational needs and are eligible for local authority top-up funding to provide additional support.

"Consumers warned of subscriptions riskConsumers still struggle to end unwanted subscriptions such as gym memberships, says Citizens Advice.10h10 hours agoBusiness","Many consumers still struggle to get out of unwanted subscriptions such as gym memberships and online streaming services, according to Citizens Advice. Analysis of almost 600 problems reported to the service found that in just three months consumers paid an average of Â£160 on unwanted services. Sometimes, consumers misunderstood terms and conditions, while some companies made cancellation difficult. The head of the consumer group, Gillian Guy, said firms must ""act responsibly"". ""Subscriptions are very easy to sign up to but can be difficult for consumers to get out of. We know people are wasting time and energy trying to cancel subscriptions while paying out of pocket,"" she said. Companies refused cancellations by asking for more notice - stretching to six months in some cases - or told people they needed to cancel through a specific route, such as phone or email. CA said one person who contacted the service said they tried to cancel a subscription after they were made redundant, and were asked for proof from their employer - including a P45. Most payments are thought to be through a Continuous Payment Authority, where companies can change the date or amount of a payment without giving advance notice. Frequently, consumers said they felt it was unclear they were being signed up to a recurring payment or that the contract may continue on an auto renewal basis. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, businesses can't enforce terms on consumers that are unfair. CA's report marks the start of National Consumer Week Always check cancellation rights Be aware that there is a cooling off period, usually 14 days Follow the cancellation policy, or you could be liable for missed payments Challenge unfair terms & conditions with the firm or its trade body It this fails, go to Trading Standards and/or Citizens Advice Consumer Minister Margot James said the UK's consumer protection regime was one of the strongest in the world, but there was always more to do. She said: ""With 40 million people in the UK now subscribing to at least one product or service, this campaign from Citizens Advice will help ensure consumers can shop with confidence and know what their rights are should things go wrong."" Leon Livermore, chief executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute said consumers should remember that if an offer ""sounds too good to be true, it generally is"". He added: ""We're also eagerly awaiting the government's upcoming green paper that sets out their vision for consumer protection in a post-Brexit landscape.

Brothers Ellis and Elliott Thornton, aged 12 and 15, died along with 15-year-old Darnell Harte and 24-year-old Robbie Meerun. Father-of-two Anthoney Armour, 28, whose partner is pregnant with a third child, also died. Police were called to Stonegate Road in the Meanwood area of the city at 21:54 GMT on Saturday.

Clockwise from top left: Ellis and Elliott Thornton, Darnell Harte, Anthoney Armour and Robbie Meerun A vigil was held opposite the crash scene late on Sunday night and floral tributes are being left. One message read: ""Elliot and Ellis. Two beautiful boys taken too soon. We will never forget you both and love you both forever and always sleep tight boys."" Julie, a former neighbour of the brothers, told BBC Radio Leeds: ""It's devastating, they were funny, cheeky lads, always a smile on their faces."" Police laid further floral tributes on Monday morning Some of those involved in the crash are understood to have gone to the nearby Carr Manor Community School. In a message posted on its website, the school said: ""We are aware of the tragic road accident in our local community and send our condolences and sympathies to the families and all those affected by this shocking and upsetting incident. ""Until the police confirm relevant details we are unable to comment further and we will continue to offer support and help to all our pupils who may be affected by this distressing event.""

Earlier, police said they were working on the assumption all seven were in the same vehicle - a Renault Clio. However, the force has since said: ""Whether they were all in the car or whether some of [the victims] were pedestrians we can't say at this point in time."" West Yorkshire Police described the crash as a ""tragic incident"" Stonegate Road is about three miles north of Leeds city centre and has semi-detached houses and wide grass verges between the houses and the road. Investigators were back at the scene on Monday morning, with anyone with information asked to contact West Yorkshire Police.

"Pharma investments to create 1,850 jobs","A scientist at the Francis Crick Institute one of the UK's leading research centres The government has said two deals to invest in the UK's biotech industry illustrate confidence in its industrial strategy, which it published on Monday. MSD, known as Merck in North America, will support a new research centre in London creating around 950 new posts. Germany's Qiagen will expand its investment in a genomics and diagnostics campus in Manchester. Business Secretary Greg Clark said it represented ""a huge vote of confidence"" in the government's approach. ""People don't make the investments of this scale that are for the long term if they don't have the confidence that we are building in this country a very attractive base,"" he said. Will the government's economic medicine work? Why isnât the UK more productive? The industrial strategy white paper outlines the government's plans to support more research and development, encourage firms to embrace new technology and boost the economy. It includes: Sector deals- Partnerships between government, academia and business. Deals have been agreed in life sciences, artificial intelligence, automotive, construction sectors. More are expected in other sectors next year. Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund- Another Â£725m on top of the Â£1bn announced in April. The first tranche was to support innovation in robotics and battery technology. The new money is for the construction and life sciences sectors Research and Development (R&D) tax credit-  As announced in the Budget, R&D tax credit will rise to 12%. The UK spends 1.7% of its economic output on R&D. The government has promised to raise that to 2.4%, in line with the average in other developed economies. The industrial strategy comes just days afterofficial forecasting body the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)announced an aggressive downgrade of its UK growth forecast. The OBR concluded that a slowdown in the growth of productivity - or the value that each worker produces - since the financial crisis will persist for several more years. MSD's managing director in the UK and Ireland, Louise Houson, linked the company's investment to the government's approach to the economy: ""This investment presents a major opportunity for us to work in collaboration with the UK government to build on the forward thinking and ambitious industrial strategy white paper being published."" Qiagen expects to sign a deal early next year to expand its presence in Manchester where it works on DNA-based diagnostics for personalised healthcare. The firm said it would add to its current staff of 270. The government said the investment had the potential to create 800 skilled job overall in the Manchester life sciences hub at Qiagen and other firms. The chief executive of Qiagen, Peer Schatz, said the involvement of the University of Manchester, the NHS Trust and the UK government were ""essential"" to the partnership they are investing in. Mr Clark said the UK's decision to leave the EU meant the strategy  was ""even more important"" and he said political commitments to limit immigration would not hamper the development of research related industries. He said the government would ""make it easier for more scientists to come and work in the UK"". Here's the idiot's guide to how it's supposed to work. Pick an industry that the UK is already good at and needs investment. Chuck in a bit of government money, cluster the right institutions around it, commit to provide the skills base and give them somewhere to try their new stuff. That could mean faster trials for drugs in the NHS or using public roads to test driverless cars. Hey presto - private investment ensues. Some will see this as another example of government's dodgy track record in ""picking winners"" - the government insists it is backing excellence. Of course, all of these new initiatives are being born under the star sign of Brexit which makes them children of uncertainty. Read Simon's blog in full Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed the industrial strategy, saying it showed the government ""has its eye firmly on the horizon, not just the next few yards"". But she added: ""Today's announcement must be the beginning of a strategic race, not a tactical sprint. And it needs to last. This is a time for consistency and determination, not perpetual change with the political winds."" She commended the creation of an independent council to monitor progress. However Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour's shadow secretary for business, said the white paper contained ""re-announced policies and old spending commitments"", and failed to provide certainty. ""What detail there is concentrates on a few elite industries in which Britain already has an advantage, and will do nothing to help the millions of people who work in low productivity and low wage sectors such as retail, hospitality and social care, or those based outside the ""Golden Triangle"" made up by London, Oxford and Cambridge."" The government has already pledged to invest an additional Â£80bn in R&D over the next decade. The white paper lists some of the government's previously announced pledges to improve productivity including technical education and training, investment in electric vehicle infrastructure and faster broadband. It also outlined four global trends which it believes the UK needs to take advantage of. These are: artificial intelligence and the data revolution clean energy and low carbon technologies innovations to support an ageing population future mobility such as driverless cars and drone-delivered goods The government describes these as ""grand challenges"" and is inviting business, academia and civil society to work with the government to tackle them. ""More decisions about our economic future will be in our own hands and it is vital that we take them,"" Mr Clark said. Will the government's economic medicine work?

"Warning over 'common law marriage' mythsCohabiting partners could be unaware they lack legal rights of married couples, research suggests.19m20 minutes agoUK","Millions of unmarried couples who live together could be unaware of their rights if the relationship breaks down, a family law group has warned. Resolution carried out a survey which found two-thirds of cohabiting couples wrongly believe ""common-law marriage"" laws exist when dividing up finances. The number of unmarried couples living together has more than doubled from 1.5 million in 1996 to 3.3 million in 2017. Resolution chairman Nigel Shepherd said current laws were ""behind the times"". He said: ""The government must listen to the public, legal professionals and a growing number of politicians who all agree that we need reform to provide basic rights to cohabiting couples should they separate."" Mr Shepherd said ""society has changed"", as cohabiting couples have become the fastest-growing family type in the UK. He said, under current law, it was possible to live with someone for decades - and have children together - but not take responsibility for the former partner if the relationship breaks down. Cohabiting couples can be recognised under Scots Law in some circumstances - and Scottish legislation introduced in 2006 enables a cohabitant to apply to the court for financial provision. If one cohabiting partner dies without leaving a will, the surviving partner will not automatically inherit anything - unless the couple jointly own property. A married partner would inherit all or some of the estate An unmarried partner who stays at home to care for children cannot make any claims in their own right for property, maintenance or pension-sharing Cohabiting partners cannot access their partner's bank account if they die - whereas married couples may be allowed to withdraw the balance providing the amount is small An unmarried couple can separate without going to court, but married couples need to go to a court and get divorced to end the marriage formally Cohabiting couples are not legally obliged to support each other financially, but married partners have a legal duty to support each other If you are the unmarried partner of a tenant, you have no rights to stay in the accommodation if you are asked to leave - but each married partner has the right to live in the ""matrimonial home"" Source: Citizens Advice The ComRes poll of 2,000 UK adults, by Resolution, found 84% of people thought the government should take steps to make sure unmarried cohabiting couples knew they did not have the same legal protection as married couples. Of these respondents, 281 people were in a cohabiting relationship - two-thirds of which thought they were common-law married. A further four in five cohabitants believed that the legal rights surrounding cohabiting people who separate were ""unclear"". If they have children, each cohabiting partner will still have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent. Mother-of-five Yvonne, who was with her ex-partner 17 years, said she was ""shocked to find out"" her legal rights when they ended the relationship. ""I was entitled to nothing,"" she said. ""I was no longer just dealing with a break-up - but with the fallout of not being legally entitled to share in any of what I thought were our joint assets."" Yvonne said she was ""devastated"" when she realised she lacked financial support Yvonne, who gave up paid work to look after their children, said she now has to move house - but has no independent funds or a pension. ""I'm devastated to have been left in this situation, and think it's wrong that the law is unable to provide people like me with any support whatsoever,"" she said. Resolution, which represents 6,500 family practitioners, said it had seen an increase in the number of cases involving cohabiting couples. Some 98% of Resolution members report having worked with a couple who they say they could not help due to the lack of legal protection.

"Council tax prison threats 'rising''More than 4,800 people' were threatened with jail last year for not paying a council tax debt.8h8 hours agoUK","More than 4,800 people were taken to court and threatened with prison for not paying a council tax debt in 2016-17, data seen by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme suggests. The figure has risen 11% in four years, despite 2013 government guidance saying court action should be a ""last resort"", the Institute of Money Advisers said. At least 62 people were locked up in England and Wales in 2016-17. The Local Government Association said it was ""essential"" to collect funds. ""It is not fair for the overwhelming majority of citizens that pay their council tax to let those who don't pay their fair share continue to do so,"" it said. Council tax is spent on services such as care for vulnerable adults, looking after children, and road repairs. The majority of people formally threatened with prison cleared their debt, managed to negotiate a payment plan with their local authority or received a suspended sentence. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, people cannot be imprisoned for non-payment of council tax. The IMA's findings - seen by theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme- are based on the replies of 279 of 348 local ""billing"" authorities in England and Wales to a Freedom of Information request. The report's author, Alistair Chisholm from the debt advice firm PayPlan, said the approach to council tax debts was ""completely out of step with the way other debts can be recovered"". ""You can't go to prison for failing to pay an electricity bill or your rent,"" he added. ""It's time the law was changed in England and Wales so that council tax debt collection focuses on the circumstances, income and assets of a person and is not used to threaten their liberty."" The average council tax debt in the cases cited in the report was Â£2,213. A magistrate can impose up to three months in jail for non-payment of council tax. Concerns over councilsâ use of bailiffs 'Mentally impaired' missing out on tax discount Before imprisonment can be considered, the council should try to recover the debt using bailiffs and must ""enquire"" into the defendant's means to pay. But the IMA claims courts do not always interpret the law correctly and there is strong evidence that miscarriages of justice have occurred. In January 2017, London's High Court found that Melanie Woolcock from Bridgend in South Waleshad been unlawfully imprisonedfor failing to pay Â£10-a-week towards her council tax debt. After she failed to keep up with her payments, bailiffs were called, and although she had paid Â£100 towards the debt she was told it was ""too late"" and arrested. She spent 40 days of an 81-day sentence in prison, eventually being released on bail after lawyers launched emergency proceedings. Government guidance urges councils to explore other enforcement actions, like direct deductions from benefits or earnings. The Local Government Association said ""councils face a Â£5.8bn funding shortfall by 2020, which is why it's essential councils collect these funds. ""Councils offer a variety of support to people on low incomes, or who are struggling with financial difficulties.""

'The meltdowns were horrendous',"This video can not be played Lorna Lynch has decided to home-educate her daughter Emily who has a form of autism Lorna Lynch is one of a growing number of parents home-educating a child with special needs. In the last five years, their numbers have grown by 57% across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Almost a thousand children with recognised needs are waiting for a school place. Ministers in England say they're investing to improve the system. For the past year, 11-year-old Emily has been educated at home, with extra educational activities arranged by her mother Lorna. Emily has been diagnosed withautism,externalandADHD,external, and is now on medication to manage anxiety. Home-schooling was a decision Lorna Lynch reached reluctantly after her daughter struggled to understand both lessons and other children's behaviour. ""I couldn't cope with her going to school and then coming back with her so stressed out, so angry at me."" Emily found school confusing and overwhelming. ""I want to learn things that I'm interested in - but it's like I can't learn anything because I don't know how and they don't tell me how."" She would become angry and lash out at other children. ""The meltdowns were horrendous,"" says Lorna, who tried three different schools before deciding to home-educate. While she now feels it is the right decision, she also thinks if more support had been available, it is a step she would not have had to take. Lorna is currently appealing against a decision to refuse Emily an Education and Health Care Plan which is the official recognition of special needs. An investigation by BBC Breakfast suggests her case is part of a growing trend. Across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 106 councils were able to provide information stretching back five years. It revealed a 57% increase in children with a statement, or equivalent, being educated at home. There has also been a rise in the number of children with recognised needs, but without a school place. Almost 1,000 children with this highest level of special needs are waiting for a place. Dr Adam Boddison, the chief executive of the special needs charityNasen,,externalsaid schools are finding it hard to remain inclusive because of performance measures and pressure on their budgets. ""If word gets round that a school is meeting needs, it becomes a magnet. ""The school is overwhelmed, they can't meet the needs. ""All schools are judged on the same criteria. ""So some are very inclusive, others are not."" The data revealed by the BBC investigation is part of a trend that he has noticed with one important change. ""Now too many families don't think they have another option, and have to resort to home education, and that can't be right."" Cash boost for pupils with special needs and disability The children in care left without a school place Special needs pupils lack crucial support, poll suggests In England, where the increase in home education is highest, at 64% over the last five years, the government said it is creating more places at special schools, and is spending Â£222m over four years on reforms of special educational needs and disability support. Children and Families Minister Robert Goodwill said: ""We recognise the importance of ensuring that schools have the necessary resources to meet a wide range of special educational needs."" Mr Goodwill pointed out that all schools have a duty to admit children with special educational needs and are eligible for local authority top-up funding to provide additional support.

Councils 'make Â£819m from parking fees'English local authorities made 10% more in fines and fees in 2016-17 compared with the year before.4h4 hours agoUK,"English councils generated Â£819m from parking fees and fines in 2016-17, an increase of 10% on the previous year, a study has suggested. This figure represents income from parking charges and penalty notices with running costs deducted. The RAC Foundation, which carried out the research, said motorists should ask how their council spends the cash. The Local Government Association said parking charge surpluses were spent on ""essential transport projects"". Income collected by the 353 English local authorities was up 6% and costs rose 2% compared with 2015-16, when the surplus was Â£744m. Many of the highest totals were seen in London, with the largest in Westminster, which had a surplus of Â£73.2m. Outside the capital, big surpluses were recorded in Brighton and Hove, Milton Keynes and Birmingham. Driver reverse parks on top of another car Parking space in St Ives sells for up to Â£40,000 'No change' parking meters make Â£650,000 in three years RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said the rise in profits reflects the ""record number of cars and volume of traffic"". ""We welcome the fact that councils are increasingly investing in technology to help make parking easier and less stressful,"" he added. Westminster Council has created an app to direct drivers to free parking spaces. Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said parking charges keep the roads clear, help pedestrians, motorists and cyclists safe and enable people to park near their homes. They also go towards tackling the UK's Â£12bn roads repair backlog, he added. An annual report from the Asphalt Industry Alliance this year found that almosta fifth of roadsin England and Wales were in ""poor"" condition. Councils were almost Â£730m short of what was needed to keep the road network in ""reasonable order"", it said.

Pope facing tricky Myanmar trip,"This video can not be played Myanmar welcomes Pope Francis Pope Francis has met Myanmar's military chief, as he begins the first papal visit to a country widely accused of ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. Gen Min Aung Hlaing denied any ""religious discrimination"" in a military campaign in Rakhine state. Officials in the Buddhist-majority country are watching closely to see how the Pope responds to the crisis. He has been urged by governments and rights groups to pressure them over their treatment of the Rohingyas. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar (also called Burma) for neighbouring Bangladesh since August whendeadly attacks on police posts by Rohingya militants prompted a military crackdown in Rakhine state. Thousands gathered in Yangon for the first papal trip to the Buddhist-majority country As part of his visit to the region, the Pope is also due to meet de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. After Myanmar, he will move on to Bangladesh to meet a small group of Rohingya refugees in a symbolic gesture. The 80-year-old pontiff has become known for his moderate views and willingness to denounce global injustice. What you need to know about Rohingya crisis Myanmar's persecuted minority in pictures More UK aid pledged for Myanmar's Rohingya The Pope met military chief Gen Min Aung Hlaing within hours of arriving in Myanmar. Gen Hlaing said he had told the pontiff that ""there's no religious discrimination in Myanmar and there's the freedom of religion"", according to his latest Facebook post. It is not known how the Pope responded. He has previously used the term ""our Rohingya brothers and sisters"" while denouncing the violence, but Myanmar's sole Catholic cardinal has asked him to avoid using it on the trip, to avoid inflaming local feelings. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke told reporters on Monday that Pope Francis was taking advice he had been given about using the term ""Rohingya"" seriously, adding: ""We will find out together during the trip... it is not a forbidden word."" His motorcade was welcomed by hundreds as it swept through central Yangon Myanmar officials do not use the term, instead labelling Rohingya as ""Bengalis"", and say they migrated illegally from Bangladesh so should not be listed as one of the country's ethnic groups. Bangladesh denies they are its citizens. Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Myanmar army exonerates self on Rohingya crisis Myanmar says the crackdown in Rakhine is to root out violent insurgents there, butthe UN has described the violence as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing""- a sentiment echoed by international critics.

Consumers warned of subscriptions risk,"Many consumers still struggle to get out of unwanted subscriptions such as gym memberships and online streaming services, according to Citizens Advice. Analysis of almost 600 problems reported to the service found that in just three months consumers paid an average of Â£160 on unwanted services. Sometimes, consumers misunderstood terms and conditions, while some companies made cancellation difficult. The head of the consumer group, Gillian Guy, said firms must ""act responsibly"". ""Subscriptions are very easy to sign up to but can be difficult for consumers to get out of. We know people are wasting time and energy trying to cancel subscriptions while paying out of pocket,"" she said. Companies refused cancellations by asking for more notice - stretching to six months in some cases - or told people they needed to cancel through a specific route, such as phone or email. CA said one person who contacted the service said they tried to cancel a subscription after they were made redundant, and were asked for proof from their employer - including a P45. Most payments are thought to be through a Continuous Payment Authority, where companies can change the date or amount of a payment without giving advance notice. Frequently, consumers said they felt it was unclear they were being signed up to a recurring payment or that the contract may continue on an auto renewal basis. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, businesses can't enforce terms on consumers that are unfair. CA's report marks the start of National Consumer Week Always check cancellation rights Be aware that there is a cooling off period, usually 14 days Follow the cancellation policy, or you could be liable for missed payments Challenge unfair terms & conditions with the firm or its trade body It this fails, go to Trading Standards and/or Citizens Advice Consumer Minister Margot James said the UK's consumer protection regime was one of the strongest in the world, but there was always more to do. She said: ""With 40 million people in the UK now subscribing to at least one product or service, this campaign from Citizens Advice will help ensure consumers can shop with confidence and know what their rights are should things go wrong."" Leon Livermore, chief executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute said consumers should remember that if an offer ""sounds too good to be true, it generally is"". He added: ""We're also eagerly awaiting the government's upcoming green paper that sets out their vision for consumer protection in a post-Brexit landscape. ""We will continue to work actively with our partners... to build a safer future for UK consumers.""

More young people becoming 'money mules',"The number of young people caught acting as ""money mules"" has doubled in the past four years, according to the UK's fraud prevention service, Cifas. A mule allows their bank account to be used by others to transfer money in and out of it, and in return, keep some of the money for themselves. The money to be laundered is likely to have come from drug smuggling, people trafficking and terrorism, experts say. If caught, money mules have their bank accounts closed and could face jail. Between January and September of this year, there were 8,652 cases involving 18-24-year-olds, Cifas said. It added that young people, including students, are often targeted because they are vulnerable and short of money. Adverts can appear online through a social media post, offering cash rewards for little work. The job advertised might be a ""financial manager"" or ""UK representative"", and a UK bank account will be a requirement. Criminals 'using children as money mules' Overseas students targeted by bank account fraudsters Do not give bank details to anyone you do not know or trust Be wary of job offers where all interactions and transactions are done online Be cautious of unsolicited offers of easy money Research any company that makes you a job offer Be wary of job offers written in poor English with grammatical errors or spelling mistakes Source:Don't Be Fooled,external The rise in cases has prompted a new campaign,Don't Be Fooled,external. It features a film called Sponsor a Child Trafficker, warning would-be mules of the key role they could play ""in the life of a criminal and the innocent people they enslave"". Money laundering is illegal and can lead to 14 years imprisonment. Those caught could struggle to obtain student loans, mobile phone contracts or other financial products if their bank account is closed due to money laundering. Katy Worobec, from UK Finance, said money muling is money laundering. ""We're urging people not to give their bank account details to anyone unless they know and trust them,"" she said. ""If an offer of easy money sounds too good to be true, it probably is."" Simon Dukes, chief executive of Cifas, said he hoped educating young people about how serious this type of fraud is, will make them think twice before getting involved.

PM vows to cover Manchester attack costs,"Twenty-two people died in the attack at Manchester Arena on 22 May The government will fully fund the costs of dealing with the Manchester Arena attack, Prime Minister Theresa May has said. It comes after Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said an initial offer was""not good enough"". But the PMtold the Manchester Evening News,external: ""Be in no doubt, Manchester will get the financial support it needs."" She added in a statement that a Cabinet Office task force had been set up to oversee meeting the costs. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a device that killed 22 people and injured 512 in the foyer of the venue at an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. Andy Burnham said an initial government offer was ""not good enough"" The government had previously said Manchester would receive Â£12m to help cover the ""exceptional costs"" of the attack, with Â£3m being made available immediately. But Mr Burnham said more than Â£17.5m had already been spent and suggested at least Â£10.4m more could be needed, including for the inquests into the 22 deaths and an inquiry. The Â£12m figure would have meant local authorities being forced to cut services to make up the Â£5m shortfall on what had already been spent, he warned. On Friday, Mr Burnham outlined,externalÂ£10.5m projected costs to add to the Â£17.5m already spent. These are: Coroner's inquest - Â£5m Promotion of Greater Manchester as a ""safe, attractive"" tourist destination - Â£4m We Love Manchester Emergency Fund - Â£1.1m Arena inquiry costs - Â£320,000 Mrs May said the government would meet the ""unexpected and exceptional costs"" Mrs May told the Manchester Evening News: ""Be in no doubt, Manchester will get the financial support it needs - and if that costs Â£28m, as Andy Burnham has estimated, then that is what we will make available."" She added in a statement that the attack was ""one of the darkest moments in the city's history"". ""I promised in the wake of that appalling atrocity this government would do all it could to help victims recover and the city to heal. I repeat that commitment today,"" she said. ""Where your public services have had to bear, or will bear, unexpected and exceptional costs in coping with this terrible attack, these will be met by the government. ""The process of making those payments is ongoing and I understand the frustration felt at the pace of delivery. ""So I have taken steps to speed up our response. Over the weekend a taskforce has been established within the Cabinet Office to oversee progress and expedite payments when necessary."" Mrs May added that not all the funding would be needed immediately. ""For example the inquests, opened and adjourned this month, will not begin until next June,"" she said.

Five victims of fatal car crash namedTwo young brothers are among the five who died after a stolen car crashed into a tree in Leeds.3m3 minutes agoLeeds & West Yorkshire,"This video can not be played The crash happened on Stonegate Road in the Meanwood area of Leeds The five victims of a crash that saw a stolen car smash into a tree in a Leeds suburb have been named locally. Brothers Ellis and Elliott Thornton, aged 12 and 15, died along with 15-year-old Darnell Harte and 24-year-old Robbie Meerun. Father-of-two Anthoney Armour, 28, whose partner is pregnant with a third child, also died. Police were called to Stonegate Road in the Meanwood area of the city at 21:54 GMT on Saturday.

Archers 'fraud' storyline praisedScriptwriters worked with Radio 4's consumer programme You and Yours on fraud plot.4h4 hours agoBusiness,"Anti-fraud campaigners have praised a partnership between two BBC Radio 4 programmes for drawing attention to one of the UK's fastest growing crimes. For months a number ofThe Archers' characters have been caught up in an elaborate investment fraud. Archers editor Huw Kennair-Jones has now revealed that the station's consumer programmeYou and Yoursworked closely with scriptwriters on the plot. Action Fraud,externalsaid the storyline had raised vital awareness of the issue. ""We would like to thank The Archers and You and Yours for bringing attention to this important subject,"" said a spokesperson. Read more: The Archers website explains the Melling Investment Fraud in a Q&A with You and Yours reporter Shari Vahl The last Archers' storyline to draw praise from campaigners was thedomestic abuse of Helen Archerby former husband Rob Titchener. This year the soap has tackled another rapidly rising crime. The fraud revolves around the relationship between conman, Matt Crawford (played by Kim Durham) and Lilian Bellamy (Sunny Ormonde) According to the annual Crime Survey for England and Wales there were an estimated3.6 million cases of fraudlast year, making it the most commonly experienced offence. Police say investment scams are a costly and often under reported form of fraud. Earlier this year several of the soap's unsuspecting residents were given a presentation by fraudsters, Melling Equestrian Investments. The scam involved a love-triangle between husband and wife-to-be Justin Elliott and Lilian Bellamy, and old flame and conman Matt Crawford. Among the scam's victims were widowed pensioner Christine Barford, who was revealed on Friday to have invested more than Â£300,000. She had been persuaded to invest by the promise of 12% returns on a fictitious racecourse development in Costa Rica. In an interview with You and Yours, Huw Kennair-Jones, explained how the partnership with the consumer programme evolved. The fictional scam unravels when the location of the promised Costa Rican racecourse is discovered to be in a National Park ""We needed to hear Matt Crawford again because he's such a good character,"" he said. ""We were thinking about what he would be doing and then producer, Jenny Thompson, had the idea of getting in touch with You and Yours."" Fortunately, the consumer programme's award-winning fraud reporter, Shari Vahl, was a life-long Archers fan, and scriptwriters worked closely with her for months. ""Half of all reported crime is fraud so I knew this was important,"" she said. Sworn to secrecy, she told no one about her assignment. She explained how she helped create the plot: ""The producers wanted to make this fraud as real as possible,"" she said. ""I've just taken the experience of You and Yours listeners and what's happened to thousands of people, many of whom have contacted us. There were an estimated 3.6 million cases of fraud last year, making it the most commonly experienced offence ""They have been convinced enough to invest their pensions, large amounts of money, into what seem like really brilliant schemes,"" she added. Huw Kennair-Jones agrees: ""This is not an uncommon thing. ""It's about people who are not stupid at all who are taken in by the promise of this incredible return that just doesn't exist,"" he said. Shari Vahl says modern investment fraud can be highly believable. ""Victims are given really fantastic brochures with wonderful pictures and graphs pointing skywards, all run by extremely charming and very credible people. Shari explained the lengths she and Archers scriptwriters went to to create a convincing plot. ""At one point we decided it would be a good thing to actually call up the Costa Rican horse racing authorities to get a list of their courses - so that's what we did,"" she said. The scheme unravels when Lilian Bellamy begins to investigate the details and finds they don't add up. Action Fraud,external, which works closely with City of London Police, told the BBC that people need to be on their guard. ""Never take up offers of investments on the spot from cold calls,"" a spokesperson told You and Yours. ""To make safe investments you should first look at the Financial Conduct Authority'sScamSmart,externalwarning list. ""If you have been affected by fraud or would like to know more about how to report or prevent fraud, go to our website,"" they added.

More UK aid pledged for Myanmar's Rohingya,"More than 620,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh An extra Â£12m of UK aid will be sent to help Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt has said. Violence in the Rakhine state of the country, formerly known as Burma, has forced more than 620,000 Rohingya to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh. The money will be spent on drinking water, food, latrines, shelters, soap, cooking utensils and water cans. The extra cash brings the UK's support for the Rohingya to Â£59m since August. The Department of International Development has estimated that international funding for the crisis will start to run out by February next year, unless other countries pledge longer-term support. Tales of horror from Myanmar Rohingya appeal launched by UK charities Who will help Myanmar's Rohingya? UK suspends aid for Myanmar military On a visit to Bangladesh, Ms Mordaunt met refugees living in camps in the fishing port of Cox's Bazar. She said: ""This looks like ethnic cleansing. ""The Burmese military must end this inhumane violence and guarantee unrestricted humanitarian access so aid can reach those in need in Burma. ""Any return of families to their homes must be safe, voluntary and dignified."" This video can not be played Watch: Who are the Rohingya? Violence in the region began on 25 August when Rohingya militants allegedly killed 12 people in attacks on police posts. The attack was blamed on the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa). Since then hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims - a stateless minority in the Buddhist-majority state of Rakhine - have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh near the city of Cox's Bazar. The Rohingya claim that they are being forced out of their villages by the state's military, whereas the state says the refugees and Muslim militants are burning their own homes. Read more on what sparked the violence in Rakhine. The money will also be used to provide sanitary products, female-only bathing cubicles and counselling for 2,000 survivors of sexual violence and 10,000 women suffering the trauma of war. A separate Â£12m aid package, which will be spread across multiple countries to help protect women from sexual and gender-based violence, was also announced. ""The countless stories of sexual violence I have heard from Rohingya women and girls are truly shocking and the high rates of this crime across the world are a global scandal,"" Ms Mordaunt said.

Council tax prison threats 'rising',"More than 4,800 people were taken to court and threatened with prison for not paying a council tax debt in 2016-17, data seen by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme suggests. The figure has risen 11% in four years, despite 2013 government guidance saying court action should be a ""last resort"", the Institute of Money Advisers said. At least 62 people were locked up in England and Wales in 2016-17. The Local Government Association said it was ""essential"" to collect funds. ""It is not fair for the overwhelming majority of citizens that pay their council tax to let those who don't pay their fair share continue to do so,"" it said. Council tax is spent on services such as care for vulnerable adults, looking after children, and road repairs. The majority of people formally threatened with prison cleared their debt, managed to negotiate a payment plan with their local authority or received a suspended sentence. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, people cannot be imprisoned for non-payment of council tax. The IMA's findings - seen by theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme- are based on the replies of 279 of 348 local ""billing"" authorities in England and Wales to a Freedom of Information request. The report's author, Alistair Chisholm from the debt advice firm PayPlan, said the approach to council tax debts was ""completely out of step with the way other debts can be recovered"". ""You can't go to prison for failing to pay an electricity bill or your rent,"" he added. ""It's time the law was changed in England and Wales so that council tax debt collection focuses on the circumstances, income and assets of a person and is not used to threaten their liberty."" The average council tax debt in the cases cited in the report was Â£2,213. A magistrate can impose up to three months in jail for non-payment of council tax. Concerns over councilsâ use of bailiffs 'Mentally impaired' missing out on tax discount Before imprisonment can be considered, the council should try to recover the debt using bailiffs and must ""enquire"" into the defendant's means to pay. But the IMA claims courts do not always interpret the law correctly and there is strong evidence that miscarriages of justice have occurred. In January 2017, London's High Court found that Melanie Woolcock from Bridgend in South Waleshad been unlawfully imprisonedfor failing to pay Â£10-a-week towards her council tax debt. After she failed to keep up with her payments, bailiffs were called, and although she had paid Â£100 towards the debt she was told it was ""too late"" and arrested. She spent 40 days of an 81-day sentence in prison, eventually being released on bail after lawyers launched emergency proceedings. Government guidance urges councils to explore other enforcement actions, like direct deductions from benefits or earnings. The Local Government Association said ""councils face a Â£5.8bn funding shortfall by 2020, which is why it's essential councils collect these funds. ""Councils offer a variety of support to people on low incomes, or who are struggling with financial difficulties.""

Post-Brexit economy plan to be launched,"A scientist at the Francis Crick Institute one of the UK's leading research centres The government has said two deals to invest in the UK's biotech industry illustrate confidence in its industrial strategy, which it published on Monday. MSD, known as Merck in North America, will support a new research centre in London creating around 950 new posts. Germany's Qiagen will expand its investment in a genomics and diagnostics campus in Manchester. Business Secretary Greg Clark said it represented ""a huge vote of confidence"" in the government's approach. ""People don't make the investments of this scale that are for the long term if they don't have the confidence that we are building in this country a very attractive base,"" he said. Will the government's economic medicine work? Why isnât the UK more productive? The industrial strategy white paper outlines the government's plans to support more research and development, encourage firms to embrace new technology and boost the economy. It includes: Sector deals- Partnerships between government, academia and business. Deals have been agreed in life sciences, artificial intelligence, automotive, construction sectors. More are expected in other sectors next year. Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund- Another Â£725m on top of the Â£1bn announced in April. The first tranche was to support innovation in robotics and battery technology. The new money is for the construction and life sciences sectors Research and Development (R&D) tax credit-  As announced in the Budget, R&D tax credit will rise to 12%. The UK spends 1.7% of its economic output on R&D. The government has promised to raise that to 2.4%, in line with the average in other developed economies. The industrial strategy comes just days afterofficial forecasting body the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)announced an aggressive downgrade of its UK growth forecast. The OBR concluded that a slowdown in the growth of productivity - or the value that each worker produces - since the financial crisis will persist for several more years. MSD's managing director in the UK and Ireland, Louise Houson, linked the company's investment to the government's approach to the economy: ""This investment presents a major opportunity for us to work in collaboration with the UK government to build on the forward thinking and ambitious industrial strategy white paper being published."" Qiagen expects to sign a deal early next year to expand its presence in Manchester where it works on DNA-based diagnostics for personalised healthcare. The firm said it would add to its current staff of 270. The government said the investment had the potential to create 800 skilled job overall in the Manchester life sciences hub at Qiagen and other firms. The chief executive of Qiagen, Peer Schatz, said the involvement of the University of Manchester, the NHS Trust and the UK government were ""essential"" to the partnership they are investing in. Mr Clark said the UK's decision to leave the EU meant the strategy  was ""even more important"" and he said political commitments to limit immigration would not hamper the development of research related industries. He said the government would ""make it easier for more scientists to come and work in the UK"". Here's the idiot's guide to how it's supposed to work. Pick an industry that the UK is already good at and needs investment. Chuck in a bit of government money, cluster the right institutions around it, commit to provide the skills base and give them somewhere to try their new stuff. That could mean faster trials for drugs in the NHS or using public roads to test driverless cars. Hey presto - private investment ensues. Some will see this as another example of government's dodgy track record in ""picking winners"" - the government insists it is backing excellence. Of course, all of these new initiatives are being born under the star sign of Brexit which makes them children of uncertainty. Read Simon's blog in full Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed the industrial strategy, saying it showed the government ""has its eye firmly on the horizon, not just the next few yards"". But she added: ""Today's announcement must be the beginning of a strategic race, not a tactical sprint. And it needs to last. This is a time for consistency and determination, not perpetual change with the political winds."" She commended the creation of an independent council to monitor progress. However Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour's shadow secretary for business, said the white paper contained ""re-announced policies and old spending commitments"", and failed to provide certainty. ""What detail there is concentrates on a few elite industries in which Britain already has an advantage, and will do nothing to help the millions of people who work in low productivity and low wage sectors such as retail, hospitality and social care, or those based outside the ""Golden Triangle"" made up by London, Oxford and Cambridge."" The government has already pledged to invest an additional Â£80bn in R&D over the next decade. The white paper lists some of the government's previously announced pledges to improve productivity including technical education and training, investment in electric vehicle infrastructure and faster broadband. It also outlined four global trends which it believes the UK needs to take advantage of. These are: artificial intelligence and the data revolution clean energy and low carbon technologies innovations to support an ageing population future mobility such as driverless cars and drone-delivered goods The government describes these as ""grand challenges"" and is inviting business, academia and civil society to work with the government to tackle them. ""More decisions about our economic future will be in our own hands and it is vital that we take them,"" Mr Clark said. Will the government's economic medicine work?

Waiting for the eruption,"Experts think Bali's Mount Agung could erupt for the first time since 1963 The lifespan of a volcano can be measured in millennia, and so waiting a few days for it to erupt may not sound too stressful. But for the tens of thousands of Balinese people forced from their homes, the ""imminent"" danger that they have been living with for more than a week feels very real. Ketut Seri says she has already lost track of time since arriving at one of the emergency shelters. Sat surrounded by thin plastic bags stuffed with her children's clothes, she says she can't help but worry about what she's left behind. ""I wish I had brought my cooking utensils,"" she tells me, a sign that she expects to be here for the long haul. More than 140,000 people like Ketut Seri and her family are in temporary shelters ""I'm tired, I'm sad because I cannot work,"" she explains, ""I cannot find any solution."" Her children chase a football around the concrete hall they have been living in alongside another 100 evacuees. But Ketut's husband is absent after venturing back to their empty village to check on the animals. He is not the only one taking that risk. The fate of the cattle and chickens many had to leave behind in the hills weighs heavily on people's minds, and so some are crossing back and forth into the danger area every day to check on their well-being. This video can not be played Surivivors of the 1963 eruption on the last time Mount Agung erupted According to the volcanologists monitoring Mount Agung, this situation could continue for weeks, maybe even months. An eruption may not even happen, they simply don't know. At the government observation base, senior seismologist Devy Kamil remains patient - despite the long queue of journalists who have been knocking on his door all week, hoping for some news. ""There are some examples where you have swarms of activity for as long as six years,"" he explains, ""and it is not always ended by an eruption."" Hundreds of tremors have been detected since August When lava last flowed from Mount Agung in 1963, the measuring instruments they use today were not in place, and so it is impossible to know the signature behaviour of that shows an eruption is coming. What's happening at Mount Agung? Bali volcano evacuees 'broken-hearted' The evacuees who couldn't leave their pets But while some here scrutinise every little piece of scientific data, others are waiting for spiritual signs. At the Goa Lawah Hindu temple, daily prayers continue at the site of a cave that many Balinese believe is connected to the volcano's energy. When I ask Iputi Juliad, one of the temple officials, what people are praying for, he says most just want good luck. He sees the wait for news from Mount Agung as part of a much longer process. ""There is a circle of life, a circle of sacrifice"" he explains. The majority of Balinese people practise a distinct type of Hinduism associated with the island When I ask if the seismic activity is seen as a sign that the gods are angry, he is very careful in his reply. ""It is not a punishment, not a punishment,"" Mr Juliad repeats, anxious to move on from a sensitive subject. Instead his focus is on the need to accept fate. ""Maybe an eruption, maybe not, nobody knows."" The uncertainty is having an impact on everyone on Bali, even if they haven't been evacuated. The village of Rendang sits just outside the exclusion zone, and normally the market place would be bustling with the traders selling fruit, flowers and rice. Business at Rendang market has plummeted since the volcano warnings were issued But according to stallholder Ketut Astiningsih, most people have stopped coming and her income has taken a massive hit. ""No one is shopping. Before I could get 400,000 Rupiah ($30 USD) a day, now I can only earn 50,000 Rupiah ($3.7USD)"" she explains. So far the economic consequences for Bali's tourism industry have not been so grave. At the hotels, the busloads of holidaymakers keep on coming, reassured it seems by the government's message that they will be kept well out of harm's way. Tourism at most resorts has not been affected Of course every tourist has heard or read about the volcano, and many have been contacted by worried relatives back home. But for most the only concern is whether an eruption would mean they could be marooned here. As he sipped a beer on the beach at Sanur, Mathew Hunter from Cairns in Australia seemed pretty relaxed by that prospect. ""I could definitely do with a few more weeks here,"" he chuckles, before adding that he is far more concerned about the fate of the tens of thousands of evacuees in emergency shelters. Like most people on Bali, he says he would like to see this waiting game with Mount Agung come to a swift but peaceful conclusion. ""I just hope it has a few little belly rumbles and then life goes on.""

Pope sets off for tricky Myanmar tripThe pontiff is set for a diplomatically difficult trip to meet with officials and Rohingya refugees.1h38 minutes agoAsia,"This video can not be played Myanmar welcomes Pope Francis Pope Francis has met Myanmar's military chief, as he begins the first papal visit to a country widely accused of ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. Gen Min Aung Hlaing denied any ""religious discrimination"" in a military campaign in Rakhine state. Officials in the Buddhist-majority country are watching closely to see how the Pope responds to the crisis. He has been urged by governments and rights groups to pressure them over their treatment of the Rohingyas. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar (also called Burma) for neighbouring Bangladesh since August whendeadly attacks on police posts by Rohingya militants prompted a military crackdown in Rakhine state. Thousands gathered in Yangon for the first papal trip to the Buddhist-majority country As part of his visit to the region, the Pope is also due to meet de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. After Myanmar, he will move on to Bangladesh to meet a small group of Rohingya refugees in a symbolic gesture. The 80-year-old pontiff has become known for his moderate views and willingness to denounce global injustice. What you need to know about Rohingya crisis Myanmar's persecuted minority in pictures More UK aid pledged for Myanmar's Rohingya The Pope met military chief Gen Min Aung Hlaing within hours of arriving in Myanmar. Gen Hlaing said he had told the pontiff that ""there's no religious discrimination in Myanmar and there's the freedom of religion"", according to his latest Facebook post. It is not known how the Pope responded. He has previously used the term ""our Rohingya brothers and sisters"" while denouncing the violence, but Myanmar's sole Catholic cardinal has asked him to avoid using it on the trip, to avoid inflaming local feelings. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke told reporters on Monday that Pope Francis was taking advice he had been given about using the term ""Rohingya"" seriously, adding: ""We will find out together during the trip... it is not a forbidden word."" His motorcade was welcomed by hundreds as it swept through central Yangon Myanmar officials do not use the term, instead labelling Rohingya as ""Bengalis"", and say they migrated illegally from Bangladesh so should not be listed as one of the country's ethnic groups. Bangladesh denies they are its citizens. Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Myanmar army exonerates self on Rohingya crisis Myanmar says the crackdown in Rakhine is to root out violent insurgents there, butthe UN has described the violence as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing""- a sentiment echoed by international critics.

Archers 'fraud' storyline praised,"Anti-fraud campaigners have praised a partnership between two BBC Radio 4 programmes for drawing attention to one of the UK's fastest growing crimes. For months a number ofThe Archers' characters have been caught up in an elaborate investment fraud. Archers editor Huw Kennair-Jones has now revealed that the station's consumer programmeYou and Yoursworked closely with scriptwriters on the plot. Action Fraud,externalsaid the storyline had raised vital awareness of the issue. ""We would like to thank The Archers and You and Yours for bringing attention to this important subject,"" said a spokesperson. Read more: The Archers website explains the Melling Investment Fraud in a Q&A with You and Yours reporter Shari Vahl The last Archers' storyline to draw praise from campaigners was thedomestic abuse of Helen Archerby former husband Rob Titchener. This year the soap has tackled another rapidly rising crime. The fraud revolves around the relationship between conman, Matt Crawford (played by Kim Durham) and Lilian Bellamy (Sunny Ormonde) According to the annual Crime Survey for England and Wales there were an estimated3.6 million cases of fraudlast year, making it the most commonly experienced offence. Police say investment scams are a costly and often under reported form of fraud. Earlier this year several of the soap's unsuspecting residents were given a presentation by fraudsters, Melling Equestrian Investments. The scam involved a love-triangle between husband and wife-to-be Justin Elliott and Lilian Bellamy, and old flame and conman Matt Crawford. Among the scam's victims were widowed pensioner Christine Barford, who was revealed on Friday to have invested more than Â£300,000. She had been persuaded to invest by the promise of 12% returns on a fictitious racecourse development in Costa Rica. In an interview with You and Yours, Huw Kennair-Jones, explained how the partnership with the consumer programme evolved. The fictional scam unravels when the location of the promised Costa Rican racecourse is discovered to be in a National Park ""We needed to hear Matt Crawford again because he's such a good character,"" he said. ""We were thinking about what he would be doing and then producer, Jenny Thompson, had the idea of getting in touch with You and Yours."" Fortunately, the consumer programme's award-winning fraud reporter, Shari Vahl, was a life-long Archers fan, and scriptwriters worked closely with her for months. ""Half of all reported crime is fraud so I knew this was important,"" she said. Sworn to secrecy, she told no one about her assignment. She explained how she helped create the plot: ""The producers wanted to make this fraud as real as possible,"" she said. ""I've just taken the experience of You and Yours listeners and what's happened to thousands of people, many of whom have contacted us. There were an estimated 3.6 million cases of fraud last year, making it the most commonly experienced offence ""They have been convinced enough to invest their pensions, large amounts of money, into what seem like really brilliant schemes,"" she added. Huw Kennair-Jones agrees: ""This is not an uncommon thing. ""It's about people who are not stupid at all who are taken in by the promise of this incredible return that just doesn't exist,"" he said. Shari Vahl says modern investment fraud can be highly believable. ""Victims are given really fantastic brochures with wonderful pictures and graphs pointing skywards, all run by extremely charming and very credible people. Shari explained the lengths she and Archers scriptwriters went to to create a convincing plot. ""At one point we decided it would be a good thing to actually call up the Costa Rican horse racing authorities to get a list of their courses - so that's what we did,"" she said. The scheme unravels when Lilian Bellamy begins to investigate the details and finds they don't add up. Action Fraud,external, which works closely with City of London Police, told the BBC that people need to be on their guard. ""Never take up offers of investments on the spot from cold calls,"" a spokesperson told You and Yours. ""To make safe investments you should first look at the Financial Conduct Authority'sScamSmart,externalwarning list. ""If you have been affected by fraud or would like to know more about how to report or prevent fraud, go to our website,"" they added.

Post-Brexit economy plan to be unveiled,"A scientist at the Francis Crick Institute one of the UK's leading research centres The government has said two deals to invest in the UK's biotech industry illustrate confidence in its industrial strategy, which it published on Monday. MSD, known as Merck in North America, will support a new research centre in London creating around 950 new posts. Germany's Qiagen will expand its investment in a genomics and diagnostics campus in Manchester. Business Secretary Greg Clark said it represented ""a huge vote of confidence"" in the government's approach. ""People don't make the investments of this scale that are for the long term if they don't have the confidence that we are building in this country a very attractive base,"" he said. Will the government's economic medicine work? Why isnât the UK more productive? The industrial strategy white paper outlines the government's plans to support more research and development, encourage firms to embrace new technology and boost the economy. It includes: Sector deals- Partnerships between government, academia and business. Deals have been agreed in life sciences, artificial intelligence, automotive, construction sectors. More are expected in other sectors next year. Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund- Another Â£725m on top of the Â£1bn announced in April. The first tranche was to support innovation in robotics and battery technology. The new money is for the construction and life sciences sectors Research and Development (R&D) tax credit-  As announced in the Budget, R&D tax credit will rise to 12%. The UK spends 1.7% of its economic output on R&D. The government has promised to raise that to 2.4%, in line with the average in other developed economies. The industrial strategy comes just days afterofficial forecasting body the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)announced an aggressive downgrade of its UK growth forecast. The OBR concluded that a slowdown in the growth of productivity - or the value that each worker produces - since the financial crisis will persist for several more years. MSD's managing director in the UK and Ireland, Louise Houson, linked the company's investment to the government's approach to the economy: ""This investment presents a major opportunity for us to work in collaboration with the UK government to build on the forward thinking and ambitious industrial strategy white paper being published."" Qiagen expects to sign a deal early next year to expand its presence in Manchester where it works on DNA-based diagnostics for personalised healthcare. The firm said it would add to its current staff of 270. The government said the investment had the potential to create 800 skilled job overall in the Manchester life sciences hub at Qiagen and other firms. The chief executive of Qiagen, Peer Schatz, said the involvement of the University of Manchester, the NHS Trust and the UK government were ""essential"" to the partnership they are investing in. Mr Clark said the UK's decision to leave the EU meant the strategy  was ""even more important"" and he said political commitments to limit immigration would not hamper the development of research related industries. He said the government would ""make it easier for more scientists to come and work in the UK"". Here's the idiot's guide to how it's supposed to work. Pick an industry that the UK is already good at and needs investment. Chuck in a bit of government money, cluster the right institutions around it, commit to provide the skills base and give them somewhere to try their new stuff. That could mean faster trials for drugs in the NHS or using public roads to test driverless cars. Hey presto - private investment ensues. Some will see this as another example of government's dodgy track record in ""picking winners"" - the government insists it is backing excellence. Of course, all of these new initiatives are being born under the star sign of Brexit which makes them children of uncertainty. Read Simon's blog in full Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed the industrial strategy, saying it showed the government ""has its eye firmly on the horizon, not just the next few yards"". But she added: ""Today's announcement must be the beginning of a strategic race, not a tactical sprint. And it needs to last. This is a time for consistency and determination, not perpetual change with the political winds."" She commended the creation of an independent council to monitor progress. However Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour's shadow secretary for business, said the white paper contained ""re-announced policies and old spending commitments"", and failed to provide certainty. ""What detail there is concentrates on a few elite industries in which Britain already has an advantage, and will do nothing to help the millions of people who work in low productivity and low wage sectors such as retail, hospitality and social care, or those based outside the ""Golden Triangle"" made up by London, Oxford and Cambridge."" The government has already pledged to invest an additional Â£80bn in R&D over the next decade. The white paper lists some of the government's previously announced pledges to improve productivity including technical education and training, investment in electric vehicle infrastructure and faster broadband. It also outlined four global trends which it believes the UK needs to take advantage of. These are: artificial intelligence and the data revolution clean energy and low carbon technologies innovations to support an ageing population future mobility such as driverless cars and drone-delivered goods The government describes these as ""grand challenges"" and is inviting business, academia and civil society to work with the government to tackle them. ""More decisions about our economic future will be in our own hands and it is vital that we take them,"" Mr Clark said. Will the government's economic medicine work?

Will the government's economic medicine work?,"The MSD deal will be will be used as evidence the government's economic medicine is already working Last week we got the diagnosis - this week we get the attempted cure. Up to Â£1bn of investment in the UK by pharma company MSD - known as Merck in the US - will be used as evidence the government's economic medicine is already working. The long-awaited industrial strategy lands after a bleak economic assessment of the UK economy delivered by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility on budget day - which showed slowing economic growth and dismal productivity. Business Secretary Greg Clark said ""MSD's commitment today proves the process outlined in the industrial strategy can give companies the confidence and direction they need to invest in the UK."" There is more good news to come. I understand that there is a pipeline of similar investments which will include a multi-million pound announcement from GSK next week. The industrial strategy is a hard thing to describe and therefore a hard thing to sell to a business community whose last real memory of state intervention in industry was in the 1970s of British Leyland and British Steel. Hundreds of millions of pounds of public money were poured into companies that ultimately failed. The new version contains four great challenges, five favoured sectors and a rather opaque investment mega fund. The government insists it is not ""picking winners"", but is backing excellence Here's the idiot's guide to how it's supposed to work. Pick an industry that the UK is already good at and needs investment. Chuck in a bit of government money, cluster the right institutions around it, commit to provide the skills base and give them somewhere to try their new stuff. That could mean faster trials for drugs in the NHS or using public roads to test driverless cars. Hey presto - private investment ensues. Some will see this as another example of government's dodgy track record in ""picking winners"" - the government insists it is backing excellence. Of course, all of these new initiatives are being born under the star sign of Brexit which makes them children of uncertainty. UK business investment only rose by 0.2% in the last quarter - the weakest quarterly growth since the end of last year suggesting firms are reluctant to spend on new machinery and equipment in the current climate. So how much of this medicine is an antidote to Brexit? Greg Clark has talked of these deals as ""countervailing"" that uncertainty. He insists these are policies any government should be pursuing at any time but admits the need is particularly urgent right now. This deal with the pharmaceutical industry is just the first in line - there will be another three - outlined today and confirmed in the weeks ahead. Last week's economic forecasts seemed to show a deep economic malaise. They could be wrong and some ministers privately think the only way is up from the downbeat assessment of future productivity growth. According to the employers group, the CBI, 10% of businesses they surveyed have already triggered contingency plans by moving functions and people out of the UK. That figure will rise to 35% by December and 60% by March of next year if there is no greater clarity on future trading arrangements with the EU. It's unclear that this medicine will be fast-acting enough to delay those symptoms. There was a time when a Tory government would have shied away from the words ""industrial strategy"" and its attendant ideas of state intervention. This Tory government is unapologetic in saying it's useful, necessary and urgent.

Why isnât the UK more productive?,"At this Wednesday's Budget, the man whose pronouncements will be most carefully watched may not, for once, be the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond. Instead it will be the former journalist, economist and now director of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), Robert Chote. Why? Because it's down to him to arrive at a new, much more realistic view of a long, drawn-out economic calamity whose impact the government is only now accepting in full: a decade of flat productivity. Until 10 years ago, productivity was the motor that drove economic growth. Its definition is nothing more complicated than the value we produce per worker (or per hour). If you're a coffee shop worker, it's the value added in the sales of coffees, tea and food. On a pie-making production line, it's the pies you turn out. If you're a lorry driver, it's how much you deliver. Now think of that lorry driver stuck in a traffic jam. With too little investment in new roads and too many cars and lorries using them, his trips are slower. However hard he works, he can't keep delivering more than before. His productivity stalls. That flat productivity has knock-on effects. The driver's employer used to get a little more output from each worker each year - so they each made the company a bit more revenue. That made it possible to afford pay rises above inflation each year. In turn that meant the driver could afford to buy more, boosting spending, and therefore growth, in the rest of the economy. And the chancellor of exchequer also benefited when the driver was paid, collecting higher income tax and national insurance, and when the driver spent money, because more VAT came in. Until very recently the OBR was assuming that happy state of affairs would return. The 2008 crash had done its damage. But all being well the economy would recover - and with it the tax revenues that would enable the chancellor to close the gap between his income and his spending (also known as the Budget deficit). Now have a look at the chart. The OBR's been assuming at each Budget for years that output per worker would get back to its pre-crisis rate of growth - where we each produce about 2.1% more each year. Instead, the typical rate of growth in the past five years has been 0.2%. As Robert Chote said last month: ""Our assumption that productivity growth would return to a more normal rate within a few years reflected a judgement that whatever factors were depressing it in the wake of the financial crisis would fade as it receded further into the past. ""But as the period of weak performance gets longer, the explanations that people pointed to immediately after the crisis look less convincing and others seem more plausible."" Hope of a recovery has been replaced by acceptance of weaker productivity growth - itself a large part of the reason why wages too are no higher in real terms than they were 11 years ago. UK productivity growth to remain sluggish, says OBR UK pay squeeze tightens but unemployment dips Firms are 'wasting potential' of a fifth of workers Using jelly beans to explain productivity On Wednesday Mr Chote will publish his revised, more realistic assumption, accepting that something profound has changed. Accepting weaker productivity growth in the years to come means accepting lower tax revenue for the chancellor, which in turn means less scope for spending more, cutting taxes or reducing the deficit. But hold on: it's not as if we've been in recession all that time. Haven't we had economic growth? The answer is - yes. But not the sort we used to have. From one angle, an economy is simply people and their economic activity. If you add hundreds of thousands of people to the workforce each year, through people working into retirement and through immigration, then the economy will grow larger. But GDP per capita - the amount we produce per person - has grown far more slowly. It's not just the UK that has suffered from weak productivity growth, it's across all advanced countries. But in the UK, the weakness is worse. A period of weak productivity and weak wages this long hasn't happened since the 1860s. The words of the OBR's Robert Chote may be significant on Budget day One reason is weak business investment. A company trying to meet an expanding order book can try one of two methods: hire a few more people, or make its existing workforce more productive by investing in new, more efficient technology. As long as its cheaper and less risky to hire cheap labour, the business may hold off investment. But weaker private investment - and private investment has in any case been growing recently - can't account for the whole effect. Another attempted explanation is weak training and poor infrastructure, another is weak spending on research and development - all of which play a role but none of which can explain in full the breakdown of what is normally the engine of economic growth. The government hopes to address some of those weaknesses in a new industrial strategy, originally due to be published before the Budget but now postponed until next week. Michael Jacobs, former Downing Street economic adviser and now director of the Institute for Public Policy Research, says the real problem isn't the obvious industries, such as engineering or pharmaceuticals, where growth relies on big investment and high skills. ""The UK's productivity problem lies in the vast majority of ordinary firms, in sectors such as retail, light manufacturing, tourism, hospitality and social care,"" he says. ""Unless the White Paper includes a plan to raise productivity in these sectors, it will still not be addressing the real issue.""

Consumers 'struggle to end subscriptions',"Many consumers still struggle to get out of unwanted subscriptions such as gym memberships and online streaming services, according to Citizens Advice. Analysis of almost 600 problems reported to the service found that in just three months consumers paid an average of Â£160 on unwanted services. Sometimes, consumers misunderstood terms and conditions, while some companies made cancellation difficult. The head of the consumer group, Gillian Guy, said firms must ""act responsibly"". ""Subscriptions are very easy to sign up to but can be difficult for consumers to get out of. We know people are wasting time and energy trying to cancel subscriptions while paying out of pocket,"" she said. Companies refused cancellations by asking for more notice - stretching to six months in some cases - or told people they needed to cancel through a specific route, such as phone or email. CA said one person who contacted the service said they tried to cancel a subscription after they were made redundant, and were asked for proof from their employer - including a P45. Most payments are thought to be through a Continuous Payment Authority, where companies can change the date or amount of a payment without giving advance notice. Frequently, consumers said they felt it was unclear they were being signed up to a recurring payment or that the contract may continue on an auto renewal basis. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, businesses can't enforce terms on consumers that are unfair. CA's report marks the start of National Consumer Week Always check cancellation rights Be aware that there is a cooling off period, usually 14 days Follow the cancellation policy, or you could be liable for missed payments Challenge unfair terms & conditions with the firm or its trade body It this fails, go to Trading Standards and/or Citizens Advice Consumer Minister Margot James said the UK's consumer protection regime was one of the strongest in the world, but there was always more to do. She said: ""With 40 million people in the UK now subscribing to at least one product or service, this campaign from Citizens Advice will help ensure consumers can shop with confidence and know what their rights are should things go wrong."" Leon Livermore, chief executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute said consumers should remember that if an offer ""sounds too good to be true, it generally is"". He added: ""We're also eagerly awaiting the government's upcoming green paper that sets out their vision for consumer protection in a post-Brexit landscape. ""We will continue to work actively with our partners... to build a safer future for UK consumers.""
