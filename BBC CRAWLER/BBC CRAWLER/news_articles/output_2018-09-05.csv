Deal close after Channel scallop row,"French and British boats collided in the English Channel Britain and France have agreed on the principles of a deal that would end a dispute over scallop fishing in the English Channel. No UK vessels will fish for scallops in the Bay of Seine during the period when the French are not allowed to catch. A joint statement from the two governments said talks in London on Wednesday had been ""constructive"". But a finalised deal hinges on a ""reasonable compensation package"" for smaller British boats, which lose out. Around 40 French boats clashed with five UK crafts off the coast of northern France last week. Talks were held between representatives of the UK and French fishing industries and Defra officials on Wednesday in an attempt to resolve tensions. Scallop wars: Could Brexit calm troubled waters? Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops? Regulations allow British boats to fish in the Bay of Seine, a scallop-rich area off the Normandy coast, all year round. But French fishermen are banned from taking scallops from the area between May 15 and October 1 to conserve stocks. A previous industry agreement prevented UK vessels larger than 15 metres from fishing for scallops in the area during that period too, but smaller boats were free to do so. The deal agreed in principle on Wednesday would prevent smaller boats from taking advantage of this window. Those vessels will be compensated for their losses, with the amount to be agreed at a meeting in Paris on Friday. This video can not be played Scallop row: What's the EU's fishing feud about? But a UK industry representative involved in the talks said the deal would only be finalised if British fishermen did not lose out. Jim Portus, chief executive of the South Western Fish Producers Organisation, said: ""I'm very pleased that we've negotiated a deal which satisfies the honour of fishermen on both sides. ""The French are in a hurry to make sure that it happens because what they don't want either is another conflict. ""Quite frankly, if it's not good enough on Friday, it will be rejected."" He added he was ""pleased"" the French had expressed ""regret"" during the talks for the recent clashes. All British boats have been asked to voluntarily stop fishing for scallops in the conflict area until a deal is finalised. Speaking after the talks, French industry representative Pascal Coquet said it was a ""good deal"". The talks were held after French and British boats clashed off the coast of northern France last week, with UK crews reporting rocks, smoke bombs and other projectiles were hurled at them during the confrontation. The French boatsgathered overnighton Monday last week in protest against so-called ""pillaging"" by five larger British vessels. The British were chased away and two boats, Golden Promise and Joanna C, returned to Brixham harbour with damaged windows. The British crews say they had been surrounded and had rocks and metal shackles thrown at them. French police said UK boats responded in kind. A video published by French media showed a Scottish scallop dredger, the Honeybourne 3, colliding with French vessels.

Trump official: 'I am part of the resistance',"This video can not be played President Donald Trump called the senior White House official's anonymous editorial ""gutless"" An unnamed senior Trump official has said members of the administration are working to frustrate parts of the president's agenda to protect the country from his ""worst inclinations"". In a New York Times editorial,external, the author said President Trump's ""amorality"" and ""impulsiveness"" had led to ill-informed and reckless decisions. Mr Trump labelled the anonymous writer ""gutless"",externaland the newspaper as ""phony"". His press secretary said the mystery writer was a ""coward"" who should quit. The Times defended the editorial in a statement, saying: ""We are incredibly proud to have published this piece, which adds significant value to the public's understanding of what is going on in the Trump administration."" The opinion piece comes a day after excerpts of Bob Woodward's book on the Trump White House suggested that his top officials have been engaged in an ""administrative coup d'etat"" to protect the nation from the president, including removing key documents from his desk before he has a chance to sign them. Anonymous Trump op-ed passes key tests Does 'lodestar' guide us to Trump author? This, then, presents itself as first-hand acknowledgement that the coup is real. The author says that he/she isn't a liberal operative and agrees with many of the policy goals the administration is pursuing, but that those goals are being achieved in spite of - and not because of - the president. The laundry list of criticisms should be familiar to the president's opponents on the left and the right, however. Disorganised meetings, an impetuous and petty demeanour, an inability to stick to decisions, antipathy to a free press and ""anti-democratic"" instincts. ""Many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations,"" the author writes. ""I would know. I am one of them."" ""To be clear, ours is not the popular 'resistance' of the left. We want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous."" He/she describes a ""two-track presidency"", where the president's actions - such as his conciliatory attitude toward ""autocrats and dictators"", including Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin - are constrained and redirected by ""adults in the room"". ""This isn't the work of the so-called deep state,"" the author writes. ""It's the work of the steady state."" Trump denies he wanted Syria leader killed What's more, the author says that some in the administration have whispered about invoking the 25th Amendment, a constitutional provision that allows the vice-president and a majority of the Cabinet secretaries to vote to remove a president who is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office"". This video can not be played The 25th Amendment: Could it be used to unseat Trump? Such a manoeuvre has been, up until now, largely consigned to the fringes of American political discourse and the fever dreams of Mr Trump's angriest opponents. ""No-one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis,"" he/she writes. ""So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until - one way or another - it's over."" There has already been talk of an aggressive push within the White House to find out the identity of the sources Woodward relied on for his book, Fear: Trump in the White House. The Times essay is throwing fuel on an already raging fire. Mr Trump took to Twitter with a simple word: ""TREASON?"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in India, condemned the New York Times' ""relentless attacks"" He followed it up with a tweet questioning whether the official actually existed or had been made up by the Times. He added: ""If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!"" He added another tweet later, saying: ""I'm draining the Swamp, and the Swamp is trying to fight back. Don't worry, we will win!"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders sent out a sharply worded official response. ""The individual behind this piece has chosen to deceive, rather than support, the duly elected president of the United States,"" she writes. ""He is not putting country first, but putting himself and his ego ahead of the will of the American people."" On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is in India, attacked the New York Times for choosing to publish ""a disgruntled, deceptive, bad actor's word"", adding: ""It's sad."" He said: ""I find the media's efforts... to undermine this administration incredibly disturbing."" Amid social media speculation that Vice-President Mike Pence might be the author of the piece, his communications director, Jarrod Agen, tweeted that the vice-president ""puts his name on his Op-Eds"". Mr Agen added: ""The @nytimes should be ashamed and so should the person who wrote the false, illogical, and gutless op-ed. Our office is above such amateur acts."" Outside of the administration, the essay will set off one of Washington's favourite games - guessing the identity of an unknown author. Not since ""Anonymous"" wrote the novel Primary Colors, a thinly disguised fictional account of the 1992 Bill Clinton presidential campaign, has there been a mystery like this. Primary Colors was later revealed to have been written by journalist Joe Klein. Why the Woodward effect damages Trump Woodward on Trump - the explosive quotes Given that much of the focus of the piece is on conduct in international affairs, the spotlight will probably shine the brightest on the president's foreign policy team - in the Department of State, National Security Council and Department of Defense. There will also surely be calls for this administration official to reveal him/herself.""The crisis of our time is that people in positions of power see a president who shows 'a preference for autocrats and dictators' and 'anti-democratic impulses', but do not publicly stand against them, and so allow it to continue,""tweets Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia,external. An anonymous confession that only confirms the fears of Mr Trump's critics is hardly a profile in courage. Following so quickly on the heels of the Woodward book, however, the New York Times essay will make for a one-two punch that will be difficult to shake off.

Tests reveal E. coli at Egypt death hotel,"John and Susan Cooper died in August while staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel in Hurghada High levels of E. coli have been found at the Egyptian hotel where two British tourists died, tests have revealed. The independent food and hygiene tests were ordered by Thomas Cook at Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. John and Susan Cooper, from Burnley, died at the hotel on 21 August. The results of post-mortem examinations are not yet known. The travel firm said its experts did not think E. coli killed the Coopers. It said the results of the tests identified ""a high level of E. coli and staphylococcus bacteria"", which were reviewed by Dr Vanya Gant from University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Thomas Cook said: ""It is clear from these results that something went wrong....and that standards fell below what we expect from our hotel partners. ""It is likely that the presence of E. coli and staphylococcus would explain the raised level of illness reported among guests at the hotel during this time, supporting Thomas Cook's decision to remove our 300 customers. ""However, neither our independent specialists nor Dr Gant believe that these results shed any light on the still unexplained cause of death of Mr and Mrs Cooper."" Mr Cooper, 69, died in his room, while Mrs Cooper, 63, died after being taken to hospital. Thomas Cook said standards at the hotel fell below its expectations The hotel's air and water quality was also tested with no evidence found of carbon monoxide, and normal carbon dioxide levels in the vicinity of the Coopers' room. Normal levels of chlorine were found in the hotel swimming pool and tests did not identify the presence of shigella, listeria or salmonella. However, Thomas Cook said its specialists were unable to access the Coopers' hotel room, which ""has remained under the control of the Egyptian authorities due to their ongoing investigation"". The company said it had shared its findings with the Cooper family, the Egyptian authorities and the Deutsche Hospitality group, which has a franchise agreement with the hotel. Travel boss in Egypt to discuss deaths 'Raw' food and 'illness' at Egypt hotel 'I thought Mum would survive' Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said everyone at Thomas Cook was ""deeply saddened"" by the couple's deaths adding that Mrs Cooper, who worked for Thomas Cook, was a ""longstanding and much-loved colleague of ours."" He added: ""These results, while not establishing the cause of the tragic deaths of John and Susan Cooper, have prompted us to commit further resource to tackle hygiene standards in those hotels where we identify a higher than average level of sickness."" It said it was preparing a compensation package for any of its customers who stayed at the hotel during August who said they were taken ill during their stay. Mr Fankhauser said he was ""very sorry for all our customers who fell ill while on a Thomas Cook holiday at this hotel"". The company has stopped its bookings for the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel until further notice.

She tweeted: ""In the words of the legendary Frank S - I'm afraid the time has come my friends. And suddenly. ""I'm told I've only got days. It's very surreal. Thank you so much for all the support I've received."" In August, the Cardiff-born broadcaster said she was writing a memoir to leave for her two-year-old son Freddie as a ""love letter to my beautiful boy"", whose third birthday she missed by just days. She began her BBC career more than 15 years ago as Rachael Hodges and married fellow BBC journalist Steve Bland in 2013. As well as appearing on 5 Live, she worked as a news presenter on the BBC News Channel, BBC World and BBC North West Tonight. She was diagnosed with primary triple-negative breast cancer in November 2016 after finding a lump under her arm. Rachael with son Freddie The presenter began chemotherapy just after Christmas that year, had a mastectomy the following July and went into an immunotherapy clinical trial this May, but the cancer had spread too far for her to stay on that treatment. Throughout her illness, she earned admiration for her dignified and positive outlook, and for her efforts to give an honest portrayal of cancer on her podcast - with the tagline ""Putting the CAN in cancer"" - and her blog, titled Big C Little Me. Rachael presented the podcast with fellow cancer sufferers Lauren Mahon and Deborah James. They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest. The podcast reached number one on the iTunes chart on Tuesday - an ambition of Bland's, which her husband tweeted had made her ""very happy"". Allow Twitter content?

""It's been a real support to know that people have found them so helpful through their treatment, but in a selfish way they've helped me just as much."" But the 40-year-old also frequently spoke about how her biggest fear was leaving Freddie without a mother. Bland co-hosted You, Me and the Big C with Lauren Mahon and Deborah James ""I'm not scared of dying,""she wrote in The Daily Telegraph,externalin August. ""I only fear for those I leave behind. For my darling Freddie... for Steve and our families."" She added: ""Steve and I don't discuss how he'll cope without me, but we do talk about all the things I want him to do with Freddie when I'm gone. ""He's quite an emotional man, so I know he'll do a lot of crying. But he is also the most amazing father and will keep going and stay strong for our son's sake."" Bland said she was looking for a publisher for her memoir, which she described as ""my love letter to my beautiful boy that I hope will leave the imprint of me and my love for him around him forever"".

She will be hugely missed by her many listeners and by staff across the BBC. Our sympathies go out to her family and many friends at this difficult time."" The BBC's director of news Fran Unsworth paid her condolences in an email to all BBC staff: ""Rachael was a brilliant journalist and a much-loved colleague. The courageous way she shared her experiences with cancer have inspired and given strength to so many."" I met Rachael on my first 5 Live show in 2010 when she held my hand on-air as I learned the ropes. We subsequently broadcast together many, many times and most recently she was my co-presenter on Drive every Friday. She was never afraid to take the mickey, to subvert the norm and her default position was a cheeriness that has left many of us astounded as the chemo, cold cap, guinea pig pill tests and general hell that comes with cancer came and went. The ONLY time she privately expressed any concern to me was about how her husband Steve and son Freddie would cope without her. Even then, she rolled up her sleeves, wrote a life guide for Freddie, and found a publisher. 'Tell Freddie everything,' I urged her. 'He'll want to know all about his fabulous mum.' We here at 5 Live can certainly tell him some stories. There was the time she stole my moment of history. I was all set to become the first ever voice of 5 Live from our new home in Salford. The posters had been printed, the bigwigs were lined up through the glass. I'd prepped my first words: 'One small step etc...' Then, just as I drew breath, Rachael wandered into the studio, sat down and read the news. Hers was the first voice to be heard. She winked and walked out.

Twitter admits 'unfairly' hiding accounts,"Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey has told US lawmakers the company's algorithms have not always been ""impartial"". He said the platform ""unfairly"" reduced the visibility of 600,000 accounts, including some members of Congress. But he was unable to immediately say whether a majority of them were Republican, Democratic or otherwise. Mr Dorsey is being questioned by senators over allegations that Twitter censors conservative voices. Several Republicans, including US President Donald Trump, have accused Twitter of bias, which the company denies. ""Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions, whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules,"" said Mr Dorsey.

On Wednesday, the US Department of Justice said it would investigate ""growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms"". Allegations of censorship were fuelled when Twitter added a ""quality filter"" to the platform and its search results.

Missing plans 'hampered Grenfell rescue',"Station manager Peter Johnson told the inquiry his crew ""needed the plans"" ""Vital"" plans showing the layout of Grenfell Tower could not be found on the morning of the deadly fire, a station manager has told the inquiry. Peter Johnson said firefighters were unable to find documents detailing the location of utilities such as gas pipes, fire vents and dry-rise points. The plans should have been kept in a fireproof box in the building's lobby. Mr Johnson said the lack of any plans endangered firefighters and residents. ""I do remember there were issues concerning the fire box and the fire box not necessarily being fully stocked with what should be there,"" Mr Johnson told the hearing in central London. He recalled speaking to a female council officer twice during the fire on 14 June last year about the whereabouts of the plans. He said she assured him the plans were ""in the box"" - but no plans came to light. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Why was 'stay put' advice so disastrous? Listen: The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mair The only information fire crews had to go on was a photograph of Grenfell Tower, accessed via a mobile phone, which showed the building before the flammable cladding system was installed, he told the hearing. The 24-storey tower block had been recently renovated prior to the fire, including changes to the gas pipes and the re-numbering of flats. ""The plans themselves would have fed into the operational plan,"" said Mr Johnson, responding to a question about whether the lack of any plans hampered the rescue effort. He agreed that not having them, hampered search and rescue efforts on the night. ""It has a vital part and a vital role detailing fixed installations and detailing everything within the building,"" he said. ""It would detail the pipeline of gas, of water, where electricity was - it was vital that we needed those plans."" The west London block was owned by the council but managed and maintained by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation. Mr Johnson said he never saw the revised building plans. ""If, as you went higher, there were different layout of flats - that is something that would have definitely aided our crews,"" he told the inquiry. ""If we can't isolate items, if we can't operate smoke vents, if we can't isolate dry risers where the doors are, that is potentially going to make the incident significantly worse. ""That's going to affect our crews - that's going to make the response time significantly greater and it's going to put them in greater danger and the individuals inside the property in greater danger."" Dry rise vents are vertical mains fitted into staircase or lift enclosures utilised by the fire brigade to quickly get water in the event of a fire. The public inquiry continues.

Paltrow's Goop pays over vaginal egg claims,"Gwyneth Paltrow has been accused of using pseudoscience to sell products on her lifestyle website Goop The lifestyle website founded by actress Gwyneth Paltrow has agreed to pay $145,000 (Â£112,000) for making unscientific claims about vaginal eggs. The settlement also applies to a ""flower essence"", which Goop said could cure depression. Goop claimed its jade and rose quartz eggs, which are inserted vaginally, could balance hormones and regulate menstrual cycles, among other things. The lawsuit was brought by California's consumer protection office. ""The health and money of Santa Clara County residents should never be put at risk by misleading advertising,"" District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a written statement. ""We will vigilantly protect consumers against companies that promise health benefits without the support of good scienceâ¦or any science."" The scientists calling Tom Brady and Gwyneth Paltrow's bluff Goop said in a statement that while it ""believes there is an honest disagreement about these claims, the company wanted to settle this matter quickly and amicably. This settlement does not indicate any liability on Goop's part"". Both the jade and rose quartz eggs, which are sold for $66 and $55 respectively, are still for sale, but Goop is prohibited from making further health claims that are not backed up by science. Goop also will be banned from selling medical devices that are falsely advertised or unapproved. The company agreed to pay $145,000 in civil penalties, and is also offering a refund for customers who purchased the eggs or the flower essence under false claims. It said it has not received any complaints about the product claims. Paltrow has increasingly come under scrutiny from scientists and doctors who say the actress uses pseudoscience to sell products on her website Goop.

Pound rises on Brexit 'progress' report,"The pound has gained strongly against both the dollar and the euro following reports that the UK and Germany have made progress towards a Brexit deal. Sterling rose nearly 1% against the US currency and 0.5% against the euro after the reports on Bloomberg News. However, the pound later gave up some of its gains after London and Berlin both denied there had been any change. The agency said the German government was ready to accept a less detailed agreement on future UK-EU trade ties. The UK and Germany both denied any movement, while analysts warned the EU's stance was not decided by Berlin. ""Germany does not - despite its clear dominance of the bloc economically - actually speak for the EU position,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, ""[Chief EU negotiator] Michel Barnier may well have something to say about this report. As might Theresa May,"" he added. Mrs May's official spokesman later responded by saying there was no change in the UK's position that ""proper"" information about the future UK-EU relationship had to be available by the time Parliament voted on the withdrawal deal. ""We have always set out that when Parliament votes on this, it needs to be a meaningful vote based on proper information,"" he said. ""We have always been clear that Parliament needs to be able to make an informed decision, and Parliament has also been clear on that. There is no change in that position."" A German government spokesman said: ""The government's position is unchanged. The federal government has full trust in the leadership of Michel Barnier."" Mr Barnier has not yet commented on the report. In late afternoon trading, the pound was worth $1.2902, having earlier traded closer to the $1.30 mark. Against the euro, it fell below â¬1.11, having earlier reached â¬1.1155. ""The ease with which sterling has recently spiked on slim pieces of news tells us a lot about how quickly the pound is likely to rally in the event of any type of Brexit deal,"" said Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe. ""Any deal that avoids the worst-case scenario of a no-deal exit is likely to cause significant sterling strength, even if it is no more than a can-kicking exercise in the classic Brussels style.""

Review into treating misogyny as hate crime,"Stella Creasy is urging other MPs to support her changes to the upskirting ban A review is to take place into whether misogynistic conduct should be treated as a hate crime, following Labour MP Stella Creasy's call to change the law. The move was announced during a debate on proposed legislation to criminalise upskirting in England and Wales. The Law Commission will review how sex and gender characteristics are treated within existing hate crime laws and whether new offences are needed. Ms Creasy said it sent a message to ""young women we are on their side"". On Wednesday, MPs approved the Voyeurism Bill, which would ban the taking of unsolicited pictures under someone's clothing, known as upskirting, in England and Wales. Proposals to create a new criminal offence, which is already on the statute book in Scotland, will now be considered by the House of Lords. Upskirting law to be passed soon, says May Misogyny hate crime pilot 'shocking' 'Upskirting': It happened to me Ms Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, wanted to amend the draft law to allow judges to take into account whether people convicted of hate crimes against women should get a tougher sentence if it was ""motivated"" by misogyny or if misogyny was deemed to be an aggravating factor. Misogyny involves showing dislike, contempt or ingrained prejudice against women. This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women share their experience of upskirting Justice Minister Lucy Frazer said the Voyeurism Bill was not the right vehicle for seeking such a change in the law but said she sympathised with Ms Creasy's views. She said ministers would fund a review into the ""coverage and approach"" of hate crime laws. ""We, as a government, are concerned our hate crime legislation is up to date and consistent. ""This review will include how protected characteristics, including sex and gender characteristics, should be considered by new or existing hate crime law."" Ms Creasy said the government's commitment to review existing laws and consider whether there was a need for new offences sent a hugely positive signal. ""For the first time we are now saying as a country that misogyny is not a part of life, it is something that shouldn't be tolerated, and it is something we are going to tackle,"" she said. ""We have just sent a message to every young woman in this country that we are on their side."" She has called for an extension of a pilot project by Nottinghamshire Police, which has for two years been recording misogynistic behaviour as either hate crime or hate incidents, depending on whether or not it is criminal. Intimidating behaviour and unwanted sexual advances are also seen as misogyny hate crime Nottinghamshire Police, which has beenrecording misogyny as a hate crime since 2016, defines misogyny as ""incidents against women that are motivated by the attitude of men towards women and includes behaviour targeted at women by men simply because they are women"". Examples include sexual assault, indecent exposure, groping, taking unwanted photographs on mobiles, upskirting, online abuse, being followed home, whistling, sexually explicit language, threatening/aggressive/intimidating behaviour, and unwanted sexual advances. However, not all hate crimes are criminal offences according to the legal definition.

Trump denies he wanted Syria leader killed,"This video can not be played Trump: 'Woodward book a work of fiction' US President Donald Trump has denied assertions by prominent journalist Bob Woodward in his new book that he ordered the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Mr Trump said the idea was ""never even discussed"" with defence officials. Defence Secretary James Mattis has also denied words attributed to him in Woodward's book. The book Fear: Trump in the White House depicts a chaotic administration in a ""nervous breakdown of executive power"". Mr Trump has already condemned the new work as a ""con on the public"". In the book, senior aides are quoted as saying they hid sensitive documents to prevent Mr Trump signing them and as calling him an ""idiot"" and a ""liar"". Why the Woodward effect damages Trump The most explosive quotes from Woodward's book The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Woodward is a widely respected, veteran journalist who helped expose President Richard Nixon's role in the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. A day after extracts of the book were published in the Washington Post, another daily the New York Times posted an opinion piece attributed to an unnamed senior White House official saying thatthe root of the administration's problems was Mr Trump's amorality,external. The official said many Trump appointees had vowed to thwart the president's ""more misguided impulses"". ""It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room,"" the official adds. ""We fully recognise what is happening. And we are trying to do what's right even when Donald Trump won't."" Later in the day, Mr Trump told a meeting of US sheriffs the ""gutless editorial"" in the ""failing New York Times"" was a ""disgrace"". His spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said in a statement about the unnamed writer: ""This coward should do the right thing and resign."" The book says Mr Trump had ordered the Pentagon to arrange the assassination of the Syrian president after a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017 that was blamed on the Syrian government. ""Let's [expletive] kill him! Let's go in. Let's kill the [expletive] lot of them,"" Mr Trump is reported to have told Mr Mattis. Trump allegedly says of Assad: ""Let's [expletive] kill him!"" The book says Mr Mattis acknowledged Mr Trump's request but then, after the conversation, told an aide he would not do ""any of that"". But speaking to journalists on Wednesday, the president said: ""That was never contemplated, nor would it be contemplated."" He went on to describe the book as ""fiction"". Mr Trump sent out a series of tweets on Tuesday evening carrying his own views, along with statements from Mr Mattis, chief of staff John Kelly and White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

He says the book is ""already discredited"" with ""so many lies and phony sources"", rejecting an allegation that he had used the terms ""mentally retarded"" and ""dumb Southerner"" to describe Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The statement from Mr Mattis describes the book as ""a product of someone's rich imagination"". The statement from Mr Kelly says: ""The idea I ever called the president an idiot is not true...

Woodward says chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and White House staff secretary Rob Porter removed documents from the president's desk to keep Mr Trump from signing them.

Note and ÃÂ£10 left on ambulance windscreen,"The crew said it was ""really uplifting"" and ""restored their faith in humanity"" An ambulance crew that was forced to block a driveway while on a call out returned to find a Â£10 note on their vehicle's windscreen. Gary Turley and his colleague had been attending to a patient in Faversham. Along with the cash, the anonymous donor had also left a note which read: ""You're blocking our driveâ¦ No worries. Buy a coffee when you can."" Mr Turley said: ""It was just really uplifting and restored our faith in humanity."" He told BBC Radio Kent they had initially feared the worst. ""At the moment there's lots of negative notes on windscreens. Unfortunately it's the nature of the job,"" he said. ""We have to get to people quickly and sometimes it's not possible to park a little way down the road or find somewhere big enough to park an ambulance in."" He said the crew wanted to thank the person who left the note on 1 September, because their shift had been ""busy and emotional"" and it had ""made their day"". Ambulance abuse note woman pleads guilty Paramedics told 'don't block my drive' Ambulance services across the UK have had their fair share of notes left on windscreens, with many being less than friendly. In February, a woman who left a foul-mouthed note on an ambulance in Stoke-on-Trent admitted a public order offence. She was fined Â£120 and ordered to pay a victim surcharge.

Trump denies he wanted Syria leader killedA new book on Trump's White House says he ordered the assassination of Bashar al-Assad.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Trump: 'Woodward book a work of fiction' US President Donald Trump has denied assertions by prominent journalist Bob Woodward in his new book that he ordered the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Mr Trump said the idea was ""never even discussed"" with defence officials. Defence Secretary James Mattis has also denied words attributed to him in Woodward's book. The book Fear: Trump in the White House depicts a chaotic administration in a ""nervous breakdown of executive power"". Mr Trump has already condemned the new work as a ""con on the public"". In the book, senior aides are quoted as saying they hid sensitive documents to prevent Mr Trump signing them and as calling him an ""idiot"" and a ""liar"". Why the Woodward effect damages Trump The most explosive quotes from Woodward's book The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Woodward is a widely respected, veteran journalist who helped expose President Richard Nixon's role in the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. A day after extracts of the book were published in the Washington Post, another daily the New York Times posted an opinion piece attributed to an unnamed senior White House official saying thatthe root of the administration's problems was Mr Trump's amorality,external. The official said many Trump appointees had vowed to thwart the president's ""more misguided impulses"". ""It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room,"" the official adds. ""We fully recognise what is happening. And we are trying to do what's right even when Donald Trump won't."" Later in the day, Mr Trump told a meeting of US sheriffs the ""gutless editorial"" in the ""failing New York Times"" was a ""disgrace"". His spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said in a statement about the unnamed writer: ""This coward should do the right thing and resign."" The book says Mr Trump had ordered the Pentagon to arrange the assassination of the Syrian president after a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017 that was blamed on the Syrian government. ""Let's [expletive] kill him! Let's go in. Let's kill the [expletive] lot of them,"" Mr Trump is reported to have told Mr Mattis. Trump allegedly says of Assad: ""Let's [expletive] kill him!"" The book says Mr Mattis acknowledged Mr Trump's request but then, after the conversation, told an aide he would not do ""any of that"". But speaking to journalists on Wednesday, the president said: ""That was never contemplated, nor would it be contemplated."" He went on to describe the book as ""fiction"". Mr Trump sent out a series of tweets on Tuesday evening carrying his own views, along with statements from Mr Mattis, chief of staff John Kelly and White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

He says the book is ""already discredited"" with ""so many lies and phony sources"", rejecting an allegation that he had used the terms ""mentally retarded"" and ""dumb Southerner"" to describe Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The statement from Mr Mattis describes the book as ""a product of someone's rich imagination"". The statement from Mr Kelly says: ""The idea I ever called the president an idiot is not true... He always knows where I stand and he and I both know this story is total BS..."" Woodward says chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and White House staff secretary Rob Porter removed documents from the president's desk to keep Mr Trump from signing them.

No foul play in Instagrammer yacht deathIt is widely reported that 20-year-old Australian Sinead McNamara took her own life.Australia,"Conflicting reports about the 20-year-old's death had been circulating since last week There were no signs of foul play in the death of an Australian Instagrammer working on a yacht in Greece, coroners have told Australian media. It is believed Sinead McNamara, 20, took her own life. She was found in a critical condition by other crew members aboard the Mayan Queen IV last week and died while being airlifted to hospital. Her body is now due to be flown home to Australia by her family, who had been on their way to visit her. Greek police have said they do not believe her death was suspicious and have since allowed the boat to leave the island of Kefalonia, where it had been docked. The super-yacht is owned by Mexican mining magnate Alberto Bailleres, who is reported to have left the vessel days before her death. The Greek coroner's office has confirmed to several media outlets that there were no signs of violence on her body but added that toxicology results were pending. Ms McNamara, originally from Port Macquarie in New South Wales, regularly posted pictures of her travels to her Instagram account, where she had thousands of followers. Her mother and sister were on their way to Greece to visit her when they received news of her death, reports say. Fans and friends have paid tribute to Ms McNamara online in the days since her death.

Note and Â£10 left on ambulance windscreen,"The crew said it was ""really uplifting"" and ""restored their faith in humanity"" An ambulance crew that was forced to block a driveway while on a call out returned to find a Â£10 note on their vehicle's windscreen. Gary Turley and his colleague had been attending to a patient in Faversham. Along with the cash, the anonymous donor had also left a note which read: ""You're blocking our driveâ¦ No worries. Buy a coffee when you can."" Mr Turley said: ""It was just really uplifting and restored our faith in humanity."" He told BBC Radio Kent they had initially feared the worst. ""At the moment there's lots of negative notes on windscreens. Unfortunately it's the nature of the job,"" he said. ""We have to get to people quickly and sometimes it's not possible to park a little way down the road or find somewhere big enough to park an ambulance in."" He said the crew wanted to thank the person who left the note on 1 September, because their shift had been ""busy and emotional"" and it had ""made their day"". Ambulance abuse note woman pleads guilty Paramedics told 'don't block my drive' Ambulance services across the UK have had their fair share of notes left on windscreens, with many being less than friendly. In February, a woman who left a foul-mouthed note on an ambulance in Stoke-on-Trent admitted a public order offence. She was fined Â£120 and ordered to pay a victim surcharge.

Talks to solve scallop row 'constructive',"French and British boats collided in the English Channel Britain and France have agreed on the principles of a deal that would end a dispute over scallop fishing in the English Channel. No UK vessels will fish for scallops in the Bay of Seine during the period when the French are not allowed to catch. A joint statement from the two governments said talks in London on Wednesday had been ""constructive"". But a finalised deal hinges on a ""reasonable compensation package"" for smaller British boats, which lose out. Around 40 French boats clashed with five UK crafts off the coast of northern France last week. Talks were held between representatives of the UK and French fishing industries and Defra officials on Wednesday in an attempt to resolve tensions. Scallop wars: Could Brexit calm troubled waters? Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops? Regulations allow British boats to fish in the Bay of Seine, a scallop-rich area off the Normandy coast, all year round. But French fishermen are banned from taking scallops from the area between May 15 and October 1 to conserve stocks. A previous industry agreement prevented UK vessels larger than 15 metres from fishing for scallops in the area during that period too, but smaller boats were free to do so. The deal agreed in principle on Wednesday would prevent smaller boats from taking advantage of this window. Those vessels will be compensated for their losses, with the amount to be agreed at a meeting in Paris on Friday. This video can not be played Scallop row: What's the EU's fishing feud about? But a UK industry representative involved in the talks said the deal would only be finalised if British fishermen did not lose out. Jim Portus, chief executive of the South Western Fish Producers Organisation, said: ""I'm very pleased that we've negotiated a deal which satisfies the honour of fishermen on both sides. ""The French are in a hurry to make sure that it happens because what they don't want either is another conflict. ""Quite frankly, if it's not good enough on Friday, it will be rejected."" He added he was ""pleased"" the French had expressed ""regret"" during the talks for the recent clashes. All British boats have been asked to voluntarily stop fishing for scallops in the conflict area until a deal is finalised. Speaking after the talks, French industry representative Pascal Coquet said it was a ""good deal"". The talks were held after French and British boats clashed off the coast of northern France last week, with UK crews reporting rocks, smoke bombs and other projectiles were hurled at them during the confrontation. The French boatsgathered overnighton Monday last week in protest against so-called ""pillaging"" by five larger British vessels. The British were chased away and two boats, Golden Promise and Joanna C, returned to Brixham harbour with damaged windows. The British crews say they had been surrounded and had rocks and metal shackles thrown at them. French police said UK boats responded in kind. A video published by French media showed a Scottish scallop dredger, the Honeybourne 3, colliding with French vessels.

"Facebook, Twitter 'too slow' on meddling","Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg appeared at the hearing in Washington DC Facebook and Twitter have said that they took too long to tackle foreign campaigns to meddle in US elections. Responding to lawmakers, Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said the social network was ""too slow"" to act on election interference. Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey said his platform was ""unprepared and ill-equipped"" for the ""weaponisation"" of debate. Google did not show up to the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. Opening the hearing, Democratic senator Mark Warner said he was ""deeply disappointed"" that Google ""chose not to send its own top corporate leadership"". An empty chair was left for Google The senate committee focused on what the technology giants were doing to prevent future election meddling. It followed claims that Russia and other foreign actors spread misinformation and propaganda ahead of the 2016 presidential election. ""With the benefit of hindsight, it is obvious that serious mistakes were made by both Facebook and Twitter. You, like the US government, were caught flat-footed by the brazen attacks on our election.  Even after the election, you were reluctant to admit there was a problem,"" said Mr Warner. He warned that the social networks could face new regulations. ""The era of the wild west in social media is coming to an end. Where we go from here is an open question,"" he told the hearing. by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter at the Capitol Building The empty chair left for Google is what those in the public relations business refer to as ""terrible optics"". In other words, it really didn't look good. Google was accused of not taking the issue seriously enough to bother to send a senior executive - though I suspect Google's gamble was more about avoiding the inevitable questions about its plans in China. Of the companies that did turn up, this hearing felt like what we'd seen before. Senators' questions - while marginally more informed than in previous hearings - failed to land any serious punches. The companies now know the cheat codes that get them through these hearings: admit mistakes, pledge to do better, offer to work on regulation. But I felt the self-described ""shy"" Jack Dorsey offered something a little more profound, when he drifted into talking about the incentives social media provides: incentives that make us obsess about our follower count and level of engagement, arguably more than we care about the quality of what we share in the ""public square"". Mr Dorsey seems willing to look inward and rethink how his business works at its most basic level. I'm looking forward to seeing how that approach plays out. Facebook, on the other hand, is reaching out for help. It can't solve this problem alone, Ms Sandberg said. It needs government, law enforcement and security specialists to work on this issue. She's right, but Facebook will need to be more open about how it works in order for those kind of collaborations to be truly successful. Mr Warner asked whether Twitter would introduce an indicator to show which accounts were humans and which were automated bots. Mr Dorsey said Twitter had been ""considering"" the idea, and could label accounts as bots as long as it could detect them Mr Heinrich asked whether a US citizen ""intentionally spreading false information"" would violate Facebook's community standards. He gave the example of somebody claiming the victims of a mass shooting were actors. Ms Sandberg said Facebook did not want to be the ""arbiter of truth"" and worked with third-party fact-checkers to identify misinformation. Stories flagged as false had their distribution ""massively decreased"", she said Ms Sandberg and Mr Dorsey are giving evidence under oath Ms Collins asked whether the social networks would notify people if they had been engaging with fake accounts, once those accounts were identified and removed. Mr Dorsey said Twitter had not done enough. Ms Sandberg said Facebook had notified people in specific cases - including people who had indicated they would attend a fake event set up in Washington Ms Collins asked why Twitter did not notify politicians that were the subject of misinformation campaigns by foreign agents.

Mr King asked whether Facebook could help people judge the validity of sources in the same way that auction site eBay gives sellers ratings based on feedback. Ms Sandberg said people could decide for themselves which people and news sources to follow, and that it was easy to unfollow sources they did not trust Mr Manchin asked whether new laws should be introduced to hold social networks responsible for illegal drugs sold on the platforms. Facebook and Twitter both said selling drugs was against their terms of service and that they took action when they discovered such activity Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg Ahead of the hearing, Facebook submitted written testimony outlining how it had disabled 1.27 billion fake accounts globally between October 2017 to March 2018. It said it employed 20,000 people to work on safety and security. In July, the social network announced that it had removed 32 accounts and pages believed to have been set up to influence the mid-term US elections in November. A month later it said that it had removed hundreds more ""misleading"" pages and accounts which targeted people in the Middle East, Latin America, the UK and the US. Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey Twitter's Dorsey will also face questions from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce about perceived conservative censorship on its platform. President Trump has repeatedly accused Google, Facebook and Twitter of political bias and threatened regulation of the platforms. In written testimony submitted ahead of the hearing,external, Mr Dorsey denied that his firm de-emphasised certain accounts in search results, a practice known as ""shadow banning"". ""Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions, whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules,"" he said.

Calorie count on menus plan attacked,"Will burger bars have to display calorie counts with prices? Plans to force restaurants in England to put calorie counts on menus could push up prices and lead to thousands of job losses, the Treasury has warned. Some big chains like McDonalds and Wetherspoons already print the calories of dishes on their menus. The Department of Health wants to make it a legal requirement as part of its childhood obesity strategy. But the Treasury has said small independent cafes and restaurants should be exempt from the move. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss has said the policy would be a burden on 26,000 small businesses and could lead to job cuts. Checkout sweets targeted in obesity fight The Treasury estimates that working out the precise calorie count of individual dishes could cost up to Â£500 and menus would have to be reprinted when recipes changed, adding further costs. The Federation of Small Businesses said it would like to see more flexibility for its members in recognition of the fact that smaller operators would find it much harder to absorb the costs involved. ""Businesses will have to spend hundreds to work out a precise calorie count and when recipes change, which could well incur additional costs unless regulations are written with small business in mind,"" said the organisation's chairman Mike Cherry. The Department of Health and Social Care is set to launch a consultation on the plans and has said exempting small restaurants will be considered as part of that. A spokesman for the department said: ""The government announced its intention to consult on mandatory calorie labelling on menus as part of the second chapter of the childhood obesity plan in July and we will set out our next steps in due course."" Ms Truss has written to Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, Theresa May's de facto second-in-command, to express her concerns. In the letter,leaked to The Daily Telegraph,,externalshe says: ""At this stage I am not agreeing to any preferred or final policy change for small or micro businesses. ""We should take a final decision following this consultation and informed by the evidence submitted to it. ""HM Treasury clearance is required for government's response to this consultation."" Ministers have also been warned that requiring restaurants to include calorie counts on menus could cause added distress to people with eating disorders. Beat, a charity that supports people with eating disorders, said research indicated the number of calories someone consumed was not a reliable indicator of their health. ""Evidence shows that calorie labelling exacerbates eating disorders of all kinds,"" said the organisation's chief executive, Andrew Radford. ""Public health campaigns need to consider people's mental health as well as their physical health. ""They must move away from obesity shaming to emphasising healthy behavioural changes and instilling confidence into people.""

Tesco customers go bananas over price hike,"Supermarket chain Tesco has angered shoppers in its inner-city stores by hiking the cost of individual bananas. The retailer has stopped charging by weight and is instead charging by single banana, meaning the cost of each yellow fruit has more than doubled at its Tesco Metro and Express stores. The price rise, from around 10p-15p to 25p, has led to a flood of angry complaints on social media. The grocer blames the increase on ""more expensive"" leases. The move, first reported in the Mirror,external, means customers were paying 76p per kilogram at Tesco Metro stores, which worked out to about 10-15p per banana depending on the size. The new 25p price means some bananas cost more than twice as much now. Customers have been paying a higher price for single bananas in Express stores for some time. Charging per banana rather than by weight has only just been introduced to Tesco Metro stores, to bring them in line with Express stores. A Tesco spokesperson said: ""Due to the higher costs involved in operating our Express and Metro stores there is a small premium on a number of products. ""Our convenience stores are in prime, central locations where leases are more expensive in comparison to out of town Extras and Superstores."" It said it has no plans to roll-out the price change to larger stores. The supermarket has almost 3,500 stores in the UK of which around 2,700 are convenience stores, including 1,749 Express shops, 776 One-Stop, and 172 Metro stores. The change in pricing took effect last week and one Twitter user noticed right away that the new 25p price was a considerable premium on the 14p the store charges online. Allow Twitter content?

Could Novichok attack suspects be returned to the UK?,"Two Russian men suspected of the attempted murder of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, will not be extradited from Russia to be tried in the UK. That's because it is written into the Russian constitution that its citizens may not be extradited to another state. But if either of the suspects sets foot in any EU member state, they can then be brought to the UK under a mechanism called the European Arrest Warrant. If an EU country believes that someone suspected of having committed a crime has travelled to another member state, it can ask that state to arrest them. They must then be returned to the country that made the request, to be dealt with by its justice system. Use of this mechanism has risen steadily over the past 10 years. A European Arrest Warrant has already been issued for the two men, named as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, suspected members of Russian military intelligence. The system means that extradition doesn't require a political decision in order for a suspect to be handed over, since EU countries can no longer refuse to surrender a suspect. Novichok attack Russian 'agents' named Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? Before the process was introduced in 2004, extradition used to take an average of one year, but that has been cut to an average of 48 days, according to the European Commission. A suspect must be handed over within a maximum of 90 days after arrest. Between 2009 - when the data was first broken down by nationality - and 2017, two Russian nationals have been arrested and surrendered under a European Arrest Warrant at the request of the UK. One was wanted for fraud, the other for murder. In total in 2017, the UK made 278 requests for the return of individuals, leading to 201 arrests. Of those, 183 were eventually turned over to the UK. People wanted for child sex offences made up the largest group of wanted offenders, followed by murder and manslaughter. Use of the European Arrest Warrant has increased steadily over the past decade But the largest group actually arrested was wanted for ""offences against the person"", including assault, with the second largest group wanted for drug offences. Of all the people the UK requested that other EU states surrender to it, by far the biggest group were UK nationals, followed by Polish nationals. UK citizens suspected of crimes can also be extradited from the UK to other EU countries. In 2017, EU countries made 16,837 extradition requests, resulting in 1,510 arrests and 1,164 surrenders of suspects to be tried in other jurisdictions. Low-value theft and drug offences were the common reasons for these requests. And by far the most requests were made by Poland. The UK has said it wants to continue to be part of the scheme after Brexit, but it's not clear whether this will be possible. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Crime-hit bike sharing scheme quits city,"The cycle hire scheme launched in June 2017 with 1,000 bikes made available Bike sharing firm Mobike is to pull out of Manchester after losing 10% of its cycles each month to theft and vandalism. The Chinese firm said too many had been stolen, dumped in canals and bins, had locks hacked off or been set on fire. Manchester has become the only city among 200 worldwide to lose the service because of persistent crime. Mobike said it had already ""processed refunds"" and would start removing its fleet imminently from the city streets. Mobike General Manager Jan Van der Ven said the company was ""very grateful"" to the city, which was the first in Europe to adopt the scheme last July. However, he said: ""As a private company, we have a duty to ensure our revenues cover our costs since, unlike some operators, we do not use taxpayer money to help balance our books. ""Unfortunately the circumstances in Manchester have not made this possible."" He added: ""We have all learnt valuable lessons that will help cities continue to make urban life more sustainable, more active and more healthy through cycling."" Greater Manchester cycling commissioner and former Tour de France rider Chris Boardman said: ""This is disappointing news and an outcome that we've been preparing for. ""Anti-social behaviour is not a problem unique to Manchester, it has been encountered in other UK cities and other bike operators have found ways to deal with it."" Vandalism has proven a problem worldwide, as this photograph from Berlin shows The scheme operates along similar lines to London's ""Boris bikes"", with users paying a deposit to join the scheme and then a rate according to how long they use them. Unlike other cycle hire schemes, there are no fixed docking stations with users encouraged to ""park responsibly"" within the scheme's operating zone. Mobike had insisted its bikes were theft and vandal-proof but Greater Manchester Police received 17 reports in the first 10 days of the scheme. A gang in Ancoats, east Manchester,was filmed throwing rocks at a bike, trying to destroy it, while thieves would break locks and disable electronic tracking systems. In April the firm announceda price hikefrom 50p to 69p per half-hour in a bid to counter the damage. Mobike said it would conduct ""a full review of its time in Manchester"". The company said it would continue to operate in London, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Oxford and Cambridge. Ithad warned it could also withdraw from Newcastlebut said the ""threat to leave has gone"" after a review. ""We're keen to sit down with the police and city council and try to work up a new plan to run things more effectively,"" a spokesman said. ""We know the parts of the river where the bikes get thrown into; we have our truck driving down by the river twice a day."" By Tom Mullen, BBC News Mobike's distinctive orange-rimmed cycles had become a familiar sight in Manchester, and the scheme was well-used. I clocked up more than 79 miles (128km) on the bikes, which I found handy for whizzing to the gym or shops, or even all the way to work. But the bikes were obviously an easy target for vandals. The sight of stray bikes dumped by canals, broken or even set on fire was becoming more and more common. To combat this, Mobike began to shrink its operating area and ramp up fines for people who abused the service. But today's decision shows the company's losses had simply become unsustainable. With Mobike operating successfully in 200 cities around world, people are wondering why it couldn't work here. It's certainly not a great advert for Manchester. Tube train travels with doors wide open What's wrong with doing make-up on a train? Do you know your heart age?

"Tests reveal E. coli at Egypt death hotelThomas Cook says standards ""fell below expectations"" at the hotel where two tourists died.Lancashire","John and Susan Cooper died in August while staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel in Hurghada High levels of E. coli have been found at the Egyptian hotel where two British tourists died, tests have revealed. The independent food and hygiene tests were ordered by Thomas Cook at Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. John and Susan Cooper, from Burnley, died at the hotel on 21 August. The results of post-mortem examinations are not yet known. The travel firm said its experts did not think E. coli killed the Coopers. It said the results of the tests identified ""a high level of E. coli and staphylococcus bacteria"", which were reviewed by Dr Vanya Gant from University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Thomas Cook said: ""It is clear from these results that something went wrong....and that standards fell below what we expect from our hotel partners. ""It is likely that the presence of E. coli and staphylococcus would explain the raised level of illness reported among guests at the hotel during this time, supporting Thomas Cook's decision to remove our 300 customers. ""However, neither our independent specialists nor Dr Gant believe that these results shed any light on the still unexplained cause of death of Mr and Mrs Cooper."" Mr Cooper, 69, died in his room, while Mrs Cooper, 63, died after being taken to hospital. Thomas Cook said standards at the hotel fell below its expectations The hotel's air and water quality was also tested with no evidence found of carbon monoxide, and normal carbon dioxide levels in the vicinity of the Coopers' room. Normal levels of chlorine were found in the hotel swimming pool and tests did not identify the presence of shigella, listeria or salmonella. However, Thomas Cook said its specialists were unable to access the Coopers' hotel room, which ""has remained under the control of the Egyptian authorities due to their ongoing investigation"". The company said it had shared its findings with the Cooper family, the Egyptian authorities and the Deutsche Hospitality group, which has a franchise agreement with the hotel. Travel boss in Egypt to discuss deaths 'Raw' food and 'illness' at Egypt hotel 'I thought Mum would survive' Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said everyone at Thomas Cook was ""deeply saddened"" by the couple's deaths adding that Mrs Cooper, who worked for Thomas Cook, was a ""longstanding and much-loved colleague of ours."" He added: ""These results, while not establishing the cause of the tragic deaths of John and Susan Cooper, have prompted us to commit further resource to tackle hygiene standards in those hotels where we identify a higher than average level of sickness."" It said it was preparing a compensation package for any of its customers who stayed at the hotel during August who said they were taken ill during their stay. Mr Fankhauser said he was ""very sorry for all our customers who fell ill while on a Thomas Cook holiday at this hotel"". The company has stopped its bookings for the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel until further notice.

New Elon Musk rant at Thai cave rescuer,"Mr Musk (R) alleged that British diver Mr Unsworth (L) had a ""child bride"" Elon Musk has again attacked a British diver he has previously accused without evidence of being a child abuser. In an email to a reporter, Mr Musk said Vernon Unsworth - who assisted with the rescue of 12 Thai teenagers from a flooded cave - was a ""child rapist"". Mr Unsworth's lawyer said the allegation was ""completely false"". Mr Musk had earlier apologised for calling Mr Unsworth a ""pedo"". The pair first clashed over Mr Musk's offer of a mini-submarine to help with the rescue. The Briton had told CNN that the submarine was ""just a PR stunt [that] had absolutely no chance of working"". The Tesla founder responded with a series of tweets accusing Mr Unsworth of paedophilia without providing any evidence. Elon Musk in the hot seat, again The full story of Thailandâs extraordinary cave rescue In pictures: Thai artists' huge mural of cave rescue heroes In July he deleted the tweets but last weekhe appeared to repeat his allegation,external, tweeting that it was ""strange he hasn't sued me"" after Mr Unsworth said he was considering legal action. Writing in an email to Buzzfeed reporter Ryan Mac,Mr Musk went further,external. He told the reporter to ""call people you know in Thailand, find out what's actually going on and stop defending child rapists"". He alleged that Mr Unsworth, 63, had spent decades visiting and living in Thailand and had recently moved to Chiang Rai in northern Thailand ""for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time"". ""It isn't where you'd go for caves, but it is where you'd go for something else,"" Mr Musk wrote. ""Chiang Rai is renowned for child sex trafficking."" He added that he hoped Mr Unsworth would sue him. Mr Unsworth, in orange, provided information for the rescue Mr Unsworth's lawyer Mark Stephens from the firm Howard Kennedy told the BBC that Mr Musk's allegations were baseless. ""Just as we get a series of legal proceedings drafted, Mr Musk adds another libel to it,"" he said. ""He seems to have a reckless indifference about the truth of these things. There's not a shred or scintilla of evidence to back it up. ""Vernon Unsworth is in most people's minds a hero. He is not a paedophile as is alleged. We feel very strongly that the record should be put straight."" ""This is all about being upset that - as one of the divers, not my client, put it - Musk's shiny tube wasn't used,"" he added. Mr Stephens confirmed that Mr Unsworth was in a relationship with Woranan Ratrawiphukkun, a Thai woman who told Buzzfeed she was 40 and had been in a relationship with Mr Unsworth for seven years. The couple had met in London, where Mr Unsworth lives, and the relationship had continued while Mr Unsworth was in Thailand exploring the Tham Luang cave complex, Mr Stephens said. In his email, Mr Musk also said that Mr Unsworth had not been part of the cave dive rescue team and had been shunned by its members. Mr Unsworth did not take part in the dives but had previously explored the cave complex extensively. He knew about the raised ledge known as Pattaya Beach where the boys and their football coach could have sought shelter, travelled into the caves shortly after they went missing and called in the two expert British divers who eventually found the trapped group. Several divers told Buzzfeed that he had worked continuously on the rescue. ""He was pivotal to the entire operation,"" said British diver Rick Stanton. The Tesla founder also said Mr Unsworth had been shunned by other rescue divers Mr Musk also sent a copy of a letter from the Thai government thanking him for his offer of assistance and denied that he had been asked by the Thai government to leave the cave complex during the rescue operation - an assertion he alleged Mr Unsworth had made during his CNN interview. In the interview, Mr Unsworth said Mr Musk had been asked to leave the cave complex during the rescue operation but did not say by whom. Mr Stephens said Mr Musk had not initially asked for or been given surveys of the cave system when offering the use of a mini-submarine and it would not have fitted through the spaces available in the cave anyway. Mr Musk only arrived at the cave complex when eight of the boys had already been rescued, Mr Stephens said. The latest controversy follows weeks of erratic behaviour on social media. In July he shocked investors by announcing on Twitter that he had funding secured to take his car firm Tesla private.He later said the firm would stay public. He also tweeted thathe suffered from ""great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress"",external.He also tweeted that he might suffer from bipolar disorder,externalbut then said ""maybe not medically"". In Augusthe told the New York Times that he worked ""120-hour weeks"",externaland took sedatives. His brother Kimbal Musk told the newspaper that the reason Mr Musk ""seems to attract drama"" is because he is ""so transparent, so open, in a way that can come back to bite him"".

Jihadist knifeman shot in nine seconds,"Within minutes of the attack police determined that the man had acted alone A 19-year-old Afghan who stabbed two American tourists in Amsterdam was shot just nine seconds after he launched his attack, the city's police chief has revealed. Commissioner Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg said a special ""spotter"" had been watching the suspect when he pulled out a knife at Amsterdam's central station. Moments later teenager Jawed S was shot in the hip, he said. The suspect's lawyer has revealed the man had expected to die in the attack. Jawed S, an asylum seeker who arrived in Germany in 2015, had travelled by train to Amsterdam on Friday. The German authorities say they were tipped off in February that he had become radicalised while living at a youth facility. ""My client appears to have made the assumption that he wasn't going to survive his attack, because a will was found at his home in Germany,"" said lawyer Simon van der Woude. He believed the teenager had been acting in response to a cartoon competition proposed by anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders, as well as an earlier video involving the Prophet Muhammad. Dutch prosecutors said this week that Jawed S had had a ""terrorist motive"" and had been ""of the opinion that in the Netherlands the Prophet Muhammad, Islam and the Koran were insulted"". Mr Wilders had cancelled the competition the day before the attack but Mr Van der Woude said his client did not appear to know. In a statement on Wednesdaythe two victims of the attack thanked Dutch police,externaland praised hospital staff for delivering ""life altering news as gently as possible"". The Amsterdam police chief told Dutch TV that Jawed S had got off a train shortly before midday on Friday and a few minutes afterwards his ""abnormal behaviour"" had come to the notice of a member of a team of public transport police trained to spot pickpockets as well as potential terrorists. As the attack unfolded people in the station ran for safety ""He called two colleagues over,"" said Mr Aalbersberg. ""While they are working out how to go and talk to him, they see he starts stabbing."" One of the tourists was stabbed in the back at a kiosk before a second was attacked. Suspect shot after Amsterdam stabbing Wilders vote defeat celebrated by Dutch leader The police, who were by now 20m (65ft) away, drew their weapons. As Jawed S ran towards another potential victim, an officer opened fire and brought him down. Within minutes, police had looked through CCTV images and determined that the man had been acting on his own. ""There were two victims and that is very serious, but the number was kept to a minimum,"" the commissioner said. ""Within nine seconds it was over and the officers made the difference during one precise moment,"" he added, stressing that they had saved lives. Allow Twitter content?

The attacker was apparently unaware his victims were Americans. US ambassador Pete Hoekstra told Dutch TV late on Tuesday that it was an ""attack on Western values"". Police say the central station in Amsterdam has long been identified as a potential target for attack and that they have a permanent team on duty. They adapted an Israeli approach called ""predictive profiling"" whereby a suspect can be identified through suspicious patterns of behaviour. ""First of all a spotter assesses what behaviour is normal in a particular place,"" police trainer Geoffrey Rijtslag told the Volkskrant newspaper. Anyone who deviated from that or started hanging around aimlessly was considered abnormal. At that point they would be approached by at least two officers. The Amsterdam police chief said there were other indicators that spotters would consider too. Anyone who was waiting for a train would normally be expected to look at departure boards.

Families 'struggle to afford healthy food',"Up to 3.7 million UK children live in homes struggling to afford enough meat, fruit and vegetables to meet healthy eating advice, research suggests. The Food Foundation says the poorest fifth of homes with children would have to spend 42% of their disposable income (after housing costs) to meet guidance set out in theEatwell Guide,external. The guide, from Public Health England, aims to help people get a balance of ""healthier and more sustainable food"" and is estimated to cost Â£5.99 a day per adult or Â£41.93 a week. The guide sets out how much of what individuals eat should come from five food groups: fruit and vegetables carbohydrates proteins dairy oils and spreads TheFood Foundation's research,externalindicates that, on average, the poorest half of UK households would need to spend close to 30% of their disposable income to meet these official dietary recommendations. The richest half would need to spend about 12% of disposable income to do the same, it suggests. It also indicates households, with children, in the bottom two income categories - with an income of less than Â£15,860 a year - would need to spend 42% of their after-housing disposable income to afford the foods set out in the guide. ""There are 3.7 million children in the UK living in households that fall in the bottom two deciles,"" the report says. Holiday hunger cash a 'great first step' Poor pupils 'filling pockets with food' The foundation also disputes the official estimated cost - Â£41.93 a week - of following the guide, saying it would probably cost more in practice. Its report says: ""This cost was calculated on a per portion basis (eg cost of a single portion of bread), rather than how much a person would need to spend to buy the foods in question (eg a loaf of bread), and therefore it is likely to underestimate how much a person would need spend to buy a full weekly diet based on the Eatwell Guide."" Elaine, a mother of four from Kent, struggles to balance the weekly budget. She estimates she has between Â£50 and Â£60 per week to spend on food and often finds that its the least healthy options that are available within this budget. ""I really try and my kids eat well - but what we are eating is not how I would really like them to eat,"" says Elaine. ""I would never let my children go without - but I do go without. I have no social life unless it is something free - can't afford to go out for a coffee."" Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation, said: ""The government's measurement of household income highlights the fact that millions of families in the UK cannot afford to eat in line with the government's own dietary guidance. ""It's crucial that a coordinated cross-government effort develops policy that accounts for the cost of its recommended diet and creates a food system that does not consign those on lower incomes to the risk of diet-related illness."" But Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: ""This report suggests a healthy balanced diet in line with the Eatwell Guide costs around Â£6 per day for an adult - we are currently spending about the same amount eating poorly. ""Our food choices are affected by other factors such as the volume of fast food outlets on our streets and promotions of unhealthy foods in our shops, highlighting why our work to improve the nation's diet is so important."" The Food Foundation is calling for government policy to ensure that low income households can afford to follow government's own recommendations for a healthy diet. The research says: ""Ensuring this affordability could be achieved through two overarching two approaches: increasing the resources and incomes of low income households and ensuring that healthy foods are available and affordable to those on a low income.""

Doctor Who switches to Sunday timeslot,"Jodie Whittaker's first series of Doctor Who is to move from its traditional Saturday night slot, the BBC has confirmed. The 10-episode run will be broadcast on Sunday evenings, starting on 7 October. An hour-long episode titled The Woman Who Fell To Earth will launch the series. It's likely that the transmission day change to Sunday has been made in order ensure the series has a regular, earlier time slot. Previous series have sometimes seen the show's transmission time varying from week to week, something that may now be avoided. While Saturday nights are often seen as the showcase for some of TV's biggest shows, in recent years Sunday night programmes have often delivered some of the week's highest ratings. The most watched programme of 2017 was BBC One's Blue Planet II, which was broadcast on a Sunday night. And in recent weeks Bodyguard has achieved the highest launch ratings for any new drama since 2006. Charlotte Moore, Director of BBC Content said: ""With Chris Chibnall at the helm and Jodie Whittaker's arrival as the new Doctor, we are heralding a brand new era for the show and so it feels only right to give it a new home on Sunday nights at the heart of BBC One's Autumn schedule."" Meanwhile, BBC Studios, which makes the time travel drama, has been criticised by many fans after entertainment website Cultbox was threatened with legal action for reporting the launch date a day before the BBC's announcement. The site had referenced an official page for the BBC series on the iTunes store, which had published the launch date. A cease and desist letter sent on behalf of the BBC said that they considered the now removed story on Cultbox contained ""classified information"", that it constituted ""a breach of a trade secret"".

"Facebook, Twitter grilled on election meddling","Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg appeared at the hearing in Washington DC Facebook and Twitter have said that they took too long to tackle foreign campaigns to meddle in US elections. Responding to lawmakers, Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said the social network was ""too slow"" to act on election interference. Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey said his platform was ""unprepared and ill-equipped"" for the ""weaponisation"" of debate. Google did not show up to the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. Opening the hearing, Democratic senator Mark Warner said he was ""deeply disappointed"" that Google ""chose not to send its own top corporate leadership"". An empty chair was left for Google The senate committee focused on what the technology giants were doing to prevent future election meddling. It followed claims that Russia and other foreign actors spread misinformation and propaganda ahead of the 2016 presidential election. ""With the benefit of hindsight, it is obvious that serious mistakes were made by both Facebook and Twitter. You, like the US government, were caught flat-footed by the brazen attacks on our election.  Even after the election, you were reluctant to admit there was a problem,"" said Mr Warner. He warned that the social networks could face new regulations. ""The era of the wild west in social media is coming to an end. Where we go from here is an open question,"" he told the hearing. by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter at the Capitol Building The empty chair left for Google is what those in the public relations business refer to as ""terrible optics"". In other words, it really didn't look good. Google was accused of not taking the issue seriously enough to bother to send a senior executive - though I suspect Google's gamble was more about avoiding the inevitable questions about its plans in China. Of the companies that did turn up, this hearing felt like what we'd seen before. Senators' questions - while marginally more informed than in previous hearings - failed to land any serious punches. The companies now know the cheat codes that get them through these hearings: admit mistakes, pledge to do better, offer to work on regulation. But I felt the self-described ""shy"" Jack Dorsey offered something a little more profound, when he drifted into talking about the incentives social media provides: incentives that make us obsess about our follower count and level of engagement, arguably more than we care about the quality of what we share in the ""public square"". Mr Dorsey seems willing to look inward and rethink how his business works at its most basic level. I'm looking forward to seeing how that approach plays out. Facebook, on the other hand, is reaching out for help. It can't solve this problem alone, Ms Sandberg said. It needs government, law enforcement and security specialists to work on this issue. She's right, but Facebook will need to be more open about how it works in order for those kind of collaborations to be truly successful. Mr Warner asked whether Twitter would introduce an indicator to show which accounts were humans and which were automated bots. Mr Dorsey said Twitter had been ""considering"" the idea, and could label accounts as bots as long as it could detect them Mr Heinrich asked whether a US citizen ""intentionally spreading false information"" would violate Facebook's community standards. He gave the example of somebody claiming the victims of a mass shooting were actors. Ms Sandberg said Facebook did not want to be the ""arbiter of truth"" and worked with third-party fact-checkers to identify misinformation. Stories flagged as false had their distribution ""massively decreased"", she said Ms Sandberg and Mr Dorsey are giving evidence under oath Ms Collins asked whether the social networks would notify people if they had been engaging with fake accounts, once those accounts were identified and removed. Mr Dorsey said Twitter had not done enough. Ms Sandberg said Facebook had notified people in specific cases - including people who had indicated they would attend a fake event set up in Washington Ms Collins asked why Twitter did not notify politicians that were the subject of misinformation campaigns by foreign agents.

Mr King asked whether Facebook could help people judge the validity of sources in the same way that auction site eBay gives sellers ratings based on feedback. Ms Sandberg said people could decide for themselves which people and news sources to follow, and that it was easy to unfollow sources they did not trust Mr Manchin asked whether new laws should be introduced to hold social networks responsible for illegal drugs sold on the platforms. Facebook and Twitter both said selling drugs was against their terms of service and that they took action when they discovered such activity Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg Ahead of the hearing, Facebook submitted written testimony outlining how it had disabled 1.27 billion fake accounts globally between October 2017 to March 2018. It said it employed 20,000 people to work on safety and security. In July, the social network announced that it had removed 32 accounts and pages believed to have been set up to influence the mid-term US elections in November. A month later it said that it had removed hundreds more ""misleading"" pages and accounts which targeted people in the Middle East, Latin America, the UK and the US. Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey Twitter's Dorsey will also face questions from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce about perceived conservative censorship on its platform. President Trump has repeatedly accused Google, Facebook and Twitter of political bias and threatened regulation of the platforms. In written testimony submitted ahead of the hearing,external, Mr Dorsey denied that his firm de-emphasised certain accounts in search results, a practice known as ""shadow banning"".

Fifth of meat tests reveal unspecified DNA,"More than a fifth of meat sample tests in 2017 found DNA from animals not on the labelling, the BBC has learned. Out of 665 results from England, Wales and Northern Ireland collected by the Food Standards Agency, 145 were partly or wholly made up of unspecified meat. The FSA said the levels were consistent with ""deliberate inclusion"" - but added testing had targeted those businesses suspected of ""compliance issues"". The samples came from 487 businesses, including restaurants and supermarkets. A BBC Freedom of Information request to the FSA revealed that in total 73 of the contaminated samples came from retailers - including three supermarkets. A further 50 came from restaurants, while 22 originated from manufacturing or food processing plants. It also showed: Some samples contained DNA from as many as four different animals, while others contained no trace of the meat that appeared on the product's label Meat labelled as lamb was most likely to contain traces of other animals' DNA, followed by beef and goat Cow DNA was the most commonly-found contaminant, followed by pig, chicken, sheep and turkey The most commonly mis-labelled product was mince meat, while sausages, kebabs and restaurant curries also featured prominently Other products in the dataset include ready meals such as spaghetti Bolognese and curries, pizzas and a portion of ostrich meat, which contained only beef An FSA spokesman said it was up to the relevant local authorities - which procured the samples before sending the results to the FSA - to lead individual investigations and take ""appropriate action"" such as prosecutions. He added the results were ""not representative of the wider food industry"". However, a clear picture of the wider food industry is not readily available as less than half of local authorities actually submitted meat sampling data to the United Kingdom's Food Surveillance System - part of the FSA - in 2017. Some councils may have focused their food testing priorities ""in areas other than meat substitution"", the FSA said - adding that others may have carried out tests later in the financial year. Experts say replacing expensive meat with a cheaper product is a common reason behind food fraud -a global problem that has existed for centuries. This latest data comes five years afterthe horsemeat scandal, when processed beef products sold by a number of UK supermarket chains were found to contain significant amounts of horse DNA. While none of the 2017 samples contained horsemeat, the lack of transparency surrounding the quality and origin of meat products in the UK has raised concerns. Q&A: The 2013 horsemeat scandal What is the Food Standards Agency? Compassion in World Farming, which campaigns for better animal welfare in the meat industry, said untraceable ingredients made it hard for animal welfare to be ""part of consumers' shopping decisions"". Responding to the examples of pork hidden in meat sold as lamb, kosher agency the Kashrut Division London Beth Din (KLBD) said there was ""a lack of transparency"" in some parts of the food industry. The KLBD added, however, that there were ""robust protocols in place to avoid mislabelling"" in products labelled as kosher. Local authorities gathered samples from businesses in their area before sending them to laboratories for analysis. The results were then submitted to the FSA. The FSA explained the ""majority"" of samples were tested for cow, pig, sheep, goat, horse, chicken and turkey DNA because those animals represent the ""overwhelming majority"" of livestock reared, slaughtered and imported in the UK. DNA from other animals could have been present in some samples, but may not have been identified as testers were not looking for it. According to the FSA, the inclusion of DNA at a proportion of 1% or greater should be considered consistent with ""deliberate inclusion"". Samples contaminated by un-named DNA at a level of less than 1% were excluded from the results on the basis they could have been caused by poor hygiene. What is the Food Standards Agency?

With that, the week's business is over. We'll be back on Monday for more from the House of Commons, House of Lords and committee rooms. Mental Health Units Bill House of LordsParliament Baroness Massey of Darwen calls the debate ""most moving"" and hopes the family of Seni will see the debate as a ""tribute"". She says the House has done ""justice"" to a ""serious and important"" issue. She hopes progress moves on ""rapidly"". The Labour peer is of the view that violence never ""solves anything at all"" and there is a need for a different approach through training, discussion and sympathetic listening to patients. The Mental Health Units (Use of Force) Bill passes its second reading and the House adjourns. Mental Health Units Bill House of LordsParliament Labour's Baroness Massey of Darwen introduces the second reading debate on the Mental Health Units Bill. The bill was inspired by the case of Olaseni Lewis, known as Seni. The 23-year-old, from South Norwood, in London, died in September 2010, days after he fell unconscious while being restrained by 11 Metropolitan Police officers at Bethlem Royal Hospital. The measures aim to better govern the use of force in relation to patients in mental health units - and make those who use force more accountable. It would require police officers to wear body cameras while carrying out restraint unless there are legitimate operational reasons for not doing so. Any non-natural death in a mental health unit would automatically trigger an independent investigation under the plans. Labour MP Steve Reed, who brought forward the legislation in a private member's bill, said it was Mr Lewis's legacy and would prevent anyone else going through what he and his family had been through. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament Lord Adonis moves amendment 35A allows the public to appoint peers from the register when a hereditary vacancy occurs. The Labour peer says he is not proposing the amendment as a ""serious proposition"" but ""apologetically"" moves it. He says the amendment asks if the second chamber should move from a nominated/hereditary house to an elected house. He states that the House of Lords should carry on ""modernising"". He calls for ""more democracy"" and devolution. He says there is ""greater urgency"" after Brexit and the constitutional reform involved. He adds there is ""intense discontent"" at the state of government. He concludes that these issues cannot be ""swept under the carpet"" by ""tiny incremental changes"" such as Lord Grocott is proposing. Lord Grocott dismisses the amendment as ""silly"" and Lord Adonis withdraws the amendment. And with that, the Lords moves on to its next business. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament Lord True's amendment 33A is not passed. Contents: 21 Not Contents: 73 Majority: 52 Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament The chamber has divided on Lord True's amendment 33A, recognising that more hereditary peers are Conservative than Labour and attempting to maintain that balance after the passage of the bill. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament The Earl of Caithness withdraws his amendment and Lord True moves amendment 33A. The amendment deals with replacing the number of hereditary peers with the same party to maintain the balance of the House. The Conservative peer says that there is a ""grotesque"" over-representation of the Liberal Democrats in the chamber and that it is a ""more glaring"" matter in the management of democracy than the by-elections of hereditary peers. He will raise the question again at report stage. He is asked if there is an over-representation of ""white, privileged, well-off, middle-class men"". Lord True says he does not do ""identity politics"". Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament The Earl of Caithness says he has been ""provoked"" into moving his amendment 32 and says he does not want to preserve the by-elections ""in perpetuity"". The Conservative and hereditary peer says the amendment is an example of trying to ""improve"" the by-election system. The amendment makes all members of the House of Lords eligible to vote in the elections. Lord Trefgarne asks Lord Grocott to support his private member's bill regarding parity between the sexes in the inheritance of peerages. The Earl of Caithness welcomes the idea. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament Lord Northbrook moves amendment 17 dealing with the royal officials Lord Chamberlain and Earl Marshal. The families involved in these roles will change after the current reign of the monarch ends. Conservative peer Lord Cormack says that these positions are not subject to by-elections and therefore the amendment is redundant. Lord Grocott asks why these ceremonial positions should be in the House of Lords. Lord Northbrook withdraws the amendment. Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has sounded some positive notes on the UK's plans about the future relationship with the EU. The UK Brexit Select Committee has published a transcript of their evidence session with the chief negotiator in Brussels in Monday. Mr Barnier said there were positive elements of the UK's Chequers proposal, but he had concerns with the concept of a single rulebook for the trade in goods and a Facilitated Customs Arrangement - a position he has stated publicly several times. He said there would not be a series of mini-deals with the UK in the event of no overall Brexit deal. He said there had been no negotiations about the future relationship with the UK because the discussions so far have been about the political declaration that will spell out its general shape. He and his deputy Sabine Weyand also spelt out more details about their approach to ""de-dramatising"" the Irish border issue, namely that the two sides should discuss the location and technicalities of specific checks. The EU negotiators said they were happy for the UK to compete with the EU in future, but the level of divergence would affect the UK's level of access to the single market. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament Amendment 16A deals with the by-election procedure and hereditary peers after the Burns report is adopted. It means that a hereditary peer can remain a member for a fixed term for 15 years and allows a by-election after that period. Lord Grocott says this would make an exception for hereditary peers. Lord Colgrain says as an elected hereditary peer he feels more ""democratically represented"" than other members of the Lords. The amendment does not pass. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament Lord Northbrook's amendment 15 is defeated. Contents: 19 Not Contents: 107 Majority: 88 Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament The chamber has divided on Lord Northbrook's amendment calling for hereditary replacements to have fairer representation from Northern Ireland and Scotland. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament Lord Trefgarne's amendment 11 supporting the continuation by-elections is defeated. Contents: 23 Not Contents: 117 Majority: 94 Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament Lord Trefgarne moves amendment 11 and the House divides. There are calls for tellers from both sides and this time they are provided. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament Lord Northbrook rises to move amendment 15, which provides that future hereditary vacancies be filled in a way that gives fair representation to Northern Ireland and Scotland. Labour's Lord Grocott asks him to ""save words"" and confirm that the amendment will mean the continuation of by-elections. The Conservative peer says he supports the continuation of by-elections. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament Lord Grocott asks that Lord Trefgarne withdraw his amendment as it will ""ensure"" that the by election system will continue and adds that if the Conservative peer will not, Lord Grocott hopes he will no longer ""abuse the procedures of the House"". Lord Berkeley of Knighton says that he is embarrassed to have invited a young political student to the proceedings. The crossbencher urges the government to ""seize the nettle"" and says it is ""disgraceful"" that Lords are trying to advantage one section of society over another. He adds he is ""deeply ashamed"" by the debate. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament A division cannot take place on Lord Trefgarne's amendment because no tellers are appointed for the contents. Lord Adonis does not move his amendment regarding a second elected chamber. Lord Trefgarne moves his second amendment. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Grocott says the chamber has not ""covered ourselves in glory"" in the last 45 minutes. He accuses a small minority of peers of ""filibustering"" a bill that had overwhelming support at second reading. The Labour peer says that in the last ""absurd"" by-election, there were seven candidates for three peerages. He adds those who oppose this bill support these by-elections. He calls the process of by-elections a ""ridiculous assisted scheme"" and says someone who inherits a title has a 1/211 chance of becoming a member of parliament through the Lords. For the rest of the public, he approximates it is a 1/70,000 chance. He asks peers to ""desist"" their opposition. Â© 2025 BBC.

Prime Minister's Questions: The verdictTheresa May clashed with Jeremy Corbyn over the PM's Brexit proposals - here are the key bits.UK Politics,"Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. It was the first Prime Minister's Questions since MPs returned from their summer break - and to no one's great surprise Brexit dominated. Equally predictably, Theresa May tried to make the most of Labour's anti-Semitism row and used a planted question from a Conservative MP to call on Jeremy Corbyn to apologise to the Jewish community before the Labour leader had even got to his feet. Mr Corbyn said there was ""no place for racism in any form"" in his party and society as a whole - ""and that includes the Conservative Party"". Allow Twitter content?

He used all six of his questions to highlight Cabinet splits over the prime minister's Brexit proposals - starting with a quote from International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who said the chance of a ""no deal"" Brexit was 60/40. Was he right, Mr Corbyn asked the prime minister. Mrs May said she was working to ""get a good deal with the European Union"" but it was also ""right and proper that we should prepare for all eventualities"", including a ""no deal"" Brexit. It was a form of words she stuck to for the rest of her exchanges with Mr Corbyn. She called on the Labour leader to rule out a second referendum. Allow Twitter content?

The Labour leader threw quotes at her from Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Chancellor Philip Hammond warning about the dangers to the economy and Britain's place in the world of a ""no deal"" Brexit, starkly at odds, he suggested, with Liam Fox's attitude. Mrs May quoted the head of the World Trade Organisation who, she told MPs, had said a ""no deal"" scenario ""would not be a walk in the park but it would not be the end of the world"". Mr Corbyn then tried to pin her down on what Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab had meant when he said there were ""countervailing opportunities to a no deal Brexit"". In response she called on him to rule out a second EU referendum again. Mr Corbyn then made a crack about the prime minister's dancing -as seen on her summer trip to Africa. ""She can not keep dancing around all the issues,"" said the Labour leader. Mrs May grinned and pulled a face at him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The Chequers proposal is dead, already ripped apart by her own MPs, when will the prime minster publish a real plan that survives contact with her cabinet and reality and protects jobs,"" he asked. Mrs May repeated her standard line on her Brexit plans and ended with another swipe at Labour's anti-Semitism issues, saying Mr Corbyn ""should be ashamed of himself"". The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, also attacked the prime minister's Chequers plan for post-Brexit trade, claiming it was ""even more unpopular than the poll tax"" had been in Scotland.

BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy's verdict: I sometimes wonder if anyone would notice if a broadcaster were to substitute one of the previous weeks' PMQs exchanges on Brexit for today's. These formulaic, ritualistic clashes tell us little or nothing about the biggest issue confronting the country. Jeremy Corbyn brandishes the latest unhelpful quotes from cabinet ministers and other big figures. Theresa May says it's all going according to plan and challenges the Labour leader to rule out a second referendum. It's Kabuki dancing for Brexit nerdsâ¦ a rather niche form of, er, entertainment. The former Brexit minister Steve Baker, a long time organiser of the backbench Eurosceptics, asked a deceptively simple question about preparations for a no-deal Brexit - an issue which matters a great deal to the hardcore Brexiters. The answer from the PM was not the point - the aim was to underline how important this party faction thinks those preparations are. It is always hard to gauge the reaction of the troops on either side of the House to another helping of all this, but they were clearly less than ecstatic. If one of these two leaders were a really top parliamentary artist, the other would have been ousted by now. Instead the opposing sides cheered their ritual cheers - and on the Labour side the forced mirth at their leader's quip about the PM ""dancing around"" Brexit issues looked a little embarrassed. The question of the day was probably Meg Hillier's pithy inquiry about cash-strapped schools cutting the number of teaching days. The PM floundered around for a few minutes before grinding out a non-answer about more pupils being in good schools. This video can not be played Vince Cable asks if the scheme to attain settled status in UK has ""59 ways of saying no in a continued hostile environment"" Sir Vince Cable delivered a nice well-honed question about the process for giving EU nationals resident in Britain the ""settled status"" which will allow them to continue to live here after Brexit. There are 59 pages of guidance, he said, providing ""59 ways of saying no in a hostile environment"". It was a nice piece of parliamentary art, but it produced barely a splash. The PM did not even bother to make some sarcastic quip about the Lib Dem leader's rumoured plans to stand down. Perhaps the strategy is to starve him of publicity by declining to seriously engage with anything he says.

Trump condemns Woodward book as 'con',"Trump said of Woodward's work: ""It's just another bad book"" US President Donald Trump has condemned a book on his White House by renowned Watergate journalist Bob Woodward as a ""con on the public"". Mr Trump's chief of staff and defence secretary, in responses posted by the president on Twitter, described the book as ""pathetic"" and ""fiction"". In the book, senior aides are quoted as saying they hid sensitive documents to prevent Mr Trump signing them. They are quoted as calling him an ""idiot"" and a ""liar"". The book -Fear: Trump in the White House,external, scheduled for release on 11 September - reveals a chaotic administration having a ""nervous breakdown of executive power"". Why Woodward effect damages Trump The most explosive quotes from Woodward's book The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Woodward is a widely respected and veteran journalist who helped expose President Richard Nixon's role in the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. He sent out a series of tweets carrying his own views, along with statements from Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, chief of staff John Kelly and White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Mr Trump says quotes attributed to Mr Mattis and Mr Kelly were ""made up frauds, a con on the public. Likewise other stories and quotes"". He says the book is ""already discredited"" with ""so many lies and phony sources"", rejecting an allegation that he had used the terms ""mentally retarded"" and ""dumb Southerner"" to describe Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The statement from Mr Mattis describes the book as ""a product of someone's rich imagination"" and adds: ""The contemptuous words about the president attributed to me in Woodward's book were never uttered by me or in my presence."" Jim Mattis: ""[Woodward's] anonymous sources do not lend credibility"" The statement from Mr Kelly says: ""The idea I ever called the president an idiot is not true... He always knows where I stand and he and I both know this story is total BS... This is a pathetic attempt to smear people close to President Trump."" Ms Sanders said the book was ""nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the president look bad"". In an interview with the Daily Caller, Mr Trump said that ""it's just another bad book"", adding that Woodward ""has a lot of credibility problems"". The president resumed his attack on the book in a tweet on Wednesday morning: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One of the main claims is that current and former aides kept sensitive documents off his desk to prevent him from signing them, or took different actions to those demanded by the president. This amounts to an ""administrative coup d'Ã©tat"", Woodward says. The book says Mr Trump had ordered the Pentagon to arrange the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""Let's [expletive] kill him! Let's go in. Let's kill the [expletive] lot of them,"" Mr Trump is reported to have told Mr Mattis. Trump allegedly says on Assad: ""Let's [expletive] kill him!"" The book says Mr Mattis acknowledged Mr Trump's request but then, after the conversation, told an aide he would not do ""any of that"". Mr Mattis is also quoted as saying Mr Trump had the understanding of ""a fifth- or sixth-grader"" - the age of 10 or 11 - in understanding foreign affairs. Jeff Sessions: US attorney general hits back at Trump Woodward says chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and White House staff secretary Rob Porter removed documents from the president's desk to keep Mr Trump from signing them. The documents would have allowed the president to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement and a trade deal with South Korea. ""It felt like we were walking along the edge of the cliff perpetually,"" Mr Porter is quoted as saying. In other excerpts: The book quotes Mr Kelly as saying: ""We're in Crazytown... This is the worst job I've ever had"" Ex-Trump lawyer John Dowd calls the president ""a [expletive] liar"" Mr Trump compares his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to a rat. ""He just scurries around"" Mr Trump tells Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross he does not trust him, saying: ""I don't want you doing any more negotiations. You're past your prime"" Mr Trump's relationship with Rex Tillerson never recovered after reports the ex-secretary of state had called the president ""an [expletive] moron"" It would be hard to find a journalist with greater credentials. After all, his investigations with Washington Post colleague Carl Bernstein helped bring down Richard Nixon and he has written books on many leaders, including George W Bush and Barack Obama. He is certainly one of the most respected and well-informed political analysts. The BBC's North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says that Woodward has unrivalled access to the corridors of power, and the general Washington consensus is that it is better to talk to him than not, since colleagues - and enemies - are certainly giving him their side of the story. Back in 2013, Mr Trump had responded to a row between Woodward and the Obama administration with a tweet saying: ""Only the Obama WH can get away with attacking Bob Woodward."" The Washington Post released an audio recording and transcript,externalof a call the president made to Woodward in early August. In it, the president says to the reporter ""I think you've always been fair"" and claims he was never contacted for an interview or informed of Woodward's soon-to-be-published work. The assertion is rebutted by the reporter, and the transcript suggests White House aides, including adviser Kellyanne Conway, were aware of requests for Trump-Woodward talks. Trump attacks 'degenerate' Watergate reporter Bernstein Woodward says he has ""gained a lot of insight and documentation"" and that his book will be a ""tough look at the world and your administration and you"". ""I assume that means it's going to be a negative book,"" the president replies. ""So I have another bad book coming out. Big deal."" Woodward says: ""I believe in our country, and because you're our president, I wish you good luck.""

The Mental Health Units (Use of Force) Bill passes its second reading and the House adjourns. Mental Health Units Bill House of LordsParliament Labour's Baroness Massey of Darwen introduces the second reading debate on the Mental Health Units Bill. The bill was inspired by the case of Olaseni Lewis, known as Seni. The 23-year-old, from South Norwood, in London, died in September 2010, days after he fell unconscious while being restrained by 11 Metropolitan Police officers at Bethlem Royal Hospital. The measures aim to better govern the use of force in relation to patients in mental health units - and make those who use force more accountable. It would require police officers to wear body cameras while carrying out restraint unless there are legitimate operational reasons for not doing so. Any non-natural death in a mental health unit would automatically trigger an independent investigation under the plans. Labour MP Steve Reed, who brought forward the legislation in a private member's bill, said it was Mr Lewis's legacy and would prevent anyone else going through what he and his family had been through.

He calls for ""more democracy"" and devolution. He says there is ""greater urgency"" after Brexit and the constitutional reform involved. He adds there is ""intense discontent"" at the state of government.

The UK Brexit Select Committee has published a transcript of their evidence session with the chief negotiator in Brussels in Monday. Mr Barnier said there were positive elements of the UK's Chequers proposal, but he had concerns with the concept of a single rulebook for the trade in goods and a Facilitated Customs Arrangement - a position he has stated publicly several times. He said there would not be a series of mini-deals with the UK in the event of no overall Brexit deal. He said there had been no negotiations about the future relationship with the UK because the discussions so far have been about the political declaration that will spell out its general shape. He and his deputy Sabine Weyand also spelt out more details about their approach to ""de-dramatising"" the Irish border issue, namely that the two sides should discuss the location and technicalities of specific checks.

The Labour peer says that in the last ""absurd"" by-election, there were seven candidates for three peerages. He adds those who oppose this bill support these by-elections. He calls the process of by-elections a ""ridiculous assisted scheme"" and says someone who inherits a title has a 1/211 chance of becoming a member of parliament through the Lords. For the rest of the public, he approximates it is a 1/70,000 chance. He asks peers to ""desist"" their opposition. Â© 2025 BBC.

The crossbencher urges the government to ""seize the nettle"" and says it is ""disgraceful"" that Lords are trying to advantage one section of society over another. He adds he is ""deeply ashamed"" by the debate. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament A division cannot take place on Lord Trefgarne's amendment because no tellers are appointed for the contents. Lord Adonis does not move his amendment regarding a second elected chamber. Lord Trefgarne moves his second amendment. Hereditary Peers Bill House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Grocott says the chamber has not ""covered ourselves in glory"" in the last 45 minutes. He accuses a small minority of peers of ""filibustering"" a bill that had overwhelming support at second reading. The Labour peer says that in the last ""absurd"" by-election, there were seven candidates for three peerages. He adds those who oppose this bill support these by-elections. He calls the process of by-elections a ""ridiculous assisted scheme"" and says someone who inherits a title has a 1/211 chance of becoming a member of parliament through the Lords. For the rest of the public, he approximates it is a 1/70,000 chance. He asks peers to ""desist"" their opposition. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thousands charged twice in card glitch,"The issue affected many people who used debit cards to buy goods and services on 29 August Thousands of people in the UK were charged twice for debit card payments. The error occurred due to an issue with a particular card terminal run by Cardnet, a joint venture between Lloyds Bank and First Data. Money came out of bank accounts twice but transactions only showed up once on many shop, pub and restaurant receipts. Lloyds Banking Group said just under 5% of Cardnet machine transactions were affected on part of 29 August and all affectedcustomers had been refunded,external. However, customers are still being advised to check their statements and contact their bank if required. Many people banking with different organisations were charged twice for spending money in shops, restaurants and businesses using Cardnet terminals as their way of taking payment. The majority of affected transactions involved Visa debit cards. Simon Alton was charged twice for a meal at CÃ´te Brasserie Simon Alton, 39, discovered he had paid twice for a meal at CÃ´te Brasserie, in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, last Wednesday. ""It's a reminder to check your statement, it's an unexpected thing to happen,"" he said. ""I'm a bit lax, if it wasn't for the friends I had been out with who messaged me the next day, I might not have noticed."" Mr Alton, who works in PR, said he had spent about Â£60, adding: ""The restaurant's been very good. As far as we know, we'll get the money back."" CÃ´te Brasserie has been approached for comment. David Stewart, 61, lives in Edinburgh and was charged Â£1,060 twice when paying a hotel for his daughter's upcoming wedding. ""I found out Saturday 1 September. At first I thought it was the hotel error. I went down to the hotel but I found out they had nothing to do with it. ""I phoned Santander on Monday morning and they said I would get my money back. The main thing has been the stress of not knowing what was happening. ""I received my money this morning. I think they should look at what's happened and give compensation as a goodwill gesture."" Other customers took to social media to express their concern about duplicate payments. One woman, known as Lisa D, said she had visited the Oblix restaurant in The Shard, London, to celebrate her husband's birthday when she was charged twice. Allow Twitter content?

Cardnet handles more than 1.2 billion transactions every year, according to its website. It claims to make it ""easy for merchants to accept card transactions online, in person or by phone"". Simon Gompertz, BBC Personal Finance Correspondent We are all using cards more to make payments. Last year cards topped cash for the first time ever, as contactless paying took off. So it's vital we can have confidence in the security and reliability of the technology. It has taken Cardnet nearly a week to send out refunds for its double-charging mistake. In that time some customers will have been perplexed or even panicky about what happened to their accounts. If banks want us to embrace the future, they need to be much sharper at dealing with the glitches. A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said: ""A small number of transactions processed last Thursday by Cardnet were duplicated. ""All customers have now been automatically refunded, however customers can check their statements and get in touch with their banks if required.""

Paramedics grant dying man's sundae wish,"Ron McCartney, 72, was being transported to palliative care Australian paramedics have been thanked for fulfilling a terminally ill man's desire for an ice cream sundae on his final trip to hospital. The gesture happened last week but has been shared publicly in a Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) Facebook post. They said paramedics had acted after learning their patient, Ron McCartney, 72, had eaten little in previous days. ""The officers asked Ron, if you could eat anything... what would it be?"" the post by QAS said. ""To which Ron replied, a caramel sundae."" The ambulance service said it had been left ""humbled and tinged with sadness"" after receiving a message of gratitude from Mr McCartney's wife, Sharon. His daughter, Danielle Smith, said that her father had died on Saturday in palliative care, following a 17-year fight with pancreatic cancer. Ms Smith told the BBC that her family was grateful for the kindness and quality of care given to her father. Earlier, she wrote on Facebook: ""Dad enjoyed this so much and [it] was the last thing he was able to eat by himself. ""Mum and I cannot thank QAS enough for all the help and compassion you have all given towards us.""

Calorie count on menus plan attackedThe Treasury fears the health department's proposals could harm restaurants and push prices up.,"Will burger bars have to display calorie counts with prices? Plans to force restaurants in England to put calorie counts on menus could push up prices and lead to thousands of job losses, the Treasury has warned. Some big chains like McDonalds and Wetherspoons already print the calories of dishes on their menus. The Department of Health wants to make it a legal requirement as part of its childhood obesity strategy. But the Treasury has said small independent cafes and restaurants should be exempt from the move. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss has said the policy would be a burden on 26,000 small businesses and could lead to job cuts. Checkout sweets targeted in obesity fight The Treasury estimates that working out the precise calorie count of individual dishes could cost up to Â£500 and menus would have to be reprinted when recipes changed, adding further costs. The Federation of Small Businesses said it would like to see more flexibility for its members in recognition of the fact that smaller operators would find it much harder to absorb the costs involved. ""Businesses will have to spend hundreds to work out a precise calorie count and when recipes change, which could well incur additional costs unless regulations are written with small business in mind,"" said the organisation's chairman Mike Cherry. The Department of Health and Social Care is set to launch a consultation on the plans and has said exempting small restaurants will be considered as part of that. A spokesman for the department said: ""The government announced its intention to consult on mandatory calorie labelling on menus as part of the second chapter of the childhood obesity plan in July and we will set out our next steps in due course."" Ms Truss has written to Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, Theresa May's de facto second-in-command, to express her concerns. In the letter,leaked to The Daily Telegraph,,externalshe says: ""At this stage I am not agreeing to any preferred or final policy change for small or micro businesses. ""We should take a final decision following this consultation and informed by the evidence submitted to it. ""HM Treasury clearance is required for government's response to this consultation."" Ministers have also been warned that requiring restaurants to include calorie counts on menus could cause added distress to people with eating disorders. Beat, a charity that supports people with eating disorders, said research indicated the number of calories someone consumed was not a reliable indicator of their health. ""Evidence shows that calorie labelling exacerbates eating disorders of all kinds,"" said the organisation's chief executive, Andrew Radford. ""Public health campaigns need to consider people's mental health as well as their physical health. ""They must move away from obesity shaming to emphasising healthy behavioural changes and instilling confidence into people.""

Brexit approach incompetent - Lord King,"This video can not be played Lord King laments Brexit 'incompetence' Former Bank of England governor Lord King has blasted Brexit preparations as ""incompetent"". The Brexit supportersaid it ""beggared belief"" that the world's sixth-biggest economy should be talking of stockpiling food and medicines. This left the government without a credible bargaining position, he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) said that getting a good deal with the EU was ""by far, the most likely outcome"". Lord King said that ""a government that cannot take action to prevent some of these catastrophic outcomes illustrates a whole lack of preparation"". ""It doesn't tell us anything about whether the policy of staying in the EU is good or bad, it tells us everything about the incompetence of the preparation for it."" The 'Chequers' Brexit plan explained What do the Brexit 'no deal' papers reveal? Raab says Chequers EU feedback positive Lord King: Brexit brings real opportunities In a BBC interview to discuss the 10 years since the economic crisis - due to be aired next week - Lord King spent a significant amount of time saying the 11th hour preparation for a no-deal Brexit has undermined the government's negotiating position. He added: ""We haven't had a credible bargaining position, because we hadn't put in place measures where we could say to our colleagues in Europe, 'Look, we'd like a free-trade deal, we think that you would probably like one too, but if we can't agree, don't be under any misapprehension, we have put in place the measures that would enable us to leave without one.'"" In response, the government said it was ""focused on negotiating a deal of unprecedented scope and ambition"". ""We have already made significant progress,"" the DExEU spokesperson added. ""The vast majority of the Withdrawal Agreement has now been agreed, and we are making further progress on the outstanding separation issues"". But Lord King predicts that we will find ourselves with what's been dubbed as Brino - Brexit in name only - which he said was the worst of all worlds. It's also a state of affairs that he fears could drag on for years. ""I think the biggest risk to the UK, and this is what worries me most, is that this issue isn't going to go away, you know the referendum hasn't decided it, because both camps feel that they haven't got what they wanted."" Lord King expressed regret and surprise that it was more difficult for a single country to present a united front than the other 27 EU members. He said: ""They must have been really worried that they had 27 countries to try to corral, how could they have a united negotiating position, they were dealing with a country that was one country, made a clear decision, voted to leave, it knew what it wanted to do, how on earth could the EU manage to negotiate against this one decisive group on the other side of the Channel? ""Well, the reality's been completely the opposite. The EU has been united, has been clear, has been patient and it's the UK that's been divided without any clear strategy at all for how to get to where we want to go."" Please upgrade your browser He also said he found the current level of debate around Brexit ""depressing"" and said it obscured the real challenges ahead. ""The biggest economic problems facing the UK are, we save too little, we haven't worked out how to save for retirement, the pension system is facing I think a real challenge, we haven't worked out how to save enough for the NHS and finance it, we haven't worked out how we're going to save enough to provide care for the elderly. Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options ""These are the big economic challenges we face, but are they being discussed at present in an open way? ""No, because the political debate has been completely taken up by Brexit,"" he said. ""It's a discussion where both sides seem to be throwing insults at each other."" Lord King might argue he is being much more even-handed, with stinging criticism for all involved. His comments come as Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham calls for Brexit to be postponed, if a no-deal scenario seems likely. In a speech on Wednesday, the former Labour minister will say that although ""a price would undoubtedly be paid in terms of social cohesion,"" a suspension of the process would be necessary to avoid damaging jobs.

Labour appeals to anti-Semitism critics,"This video can not be played Labour MPs Margaret Hodge and Shami Chakrabarti discuss the future of Labour and Jewish relations Critics of Labour over anti-Semitism should ""come back into the room"" now it has changed its guidelines, Baroness Chakrabarti says. The shadow attorney general defended extra wording added to an international definition of anti-Semitism, which has now been adopted in full. The statement says the definition and examples should not undermine free speech on Israel. Critics say the new code has been ""sullied"" by the extra wording. Separately, Labour MPs held their own vote to adopt theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance,externaldefinition in full, with no caveats, by 205 votes to eight, with 12 spoiled ballots. Labour anti-Semitism 'caveats' criticised A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Reality Check: Is anti-Semitism on the rise? The extra statement to the code adopted by the National Executive Committee says that ""this will not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians"". Baroness Chakrabarti, who carried out a review into anti-Semitism in Labour for Jeremy Corbyn, told the Today programme: ""There was no sullying. ""The words were not a caveat, were not a dilution. The words are true, which is that accepting these examples, in my view, in no way negates reasonable free speech around these difficult issues around Israel and Palestine."" After the executive meeting on Tuesday night, it emerged that Mr Corbyn had proposed a more detailed statement - which would have allowed criticism of the foundation of the state of Israel as racist - a move described as ""deeply concerning"" by one of his critics. Mr Corbyn's longer wording was not accepted by the executive committee. Asked if she thought it was acceptable to describe the circumstances around the foundation of the state of Israel as racist, Lady Chakrabarti said: ""It depends how you do it. People have called Britain racist. ""There has to be a space for disagreement in a reasonable way, otherwise we cannot move forward around one of the biggest geopolitical problems of my lifetime."" Rival protesters gathered outside Labour's headquarters as its senior officials discussed the issue By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg Perhaps this marks the beginning of the end of this sorry mess. But what makes an early resolution tricky is the caveat that Labour has included alongside. It will be important to many of Mr Corbyn's supporters who want the right to criticise Israel. But for those campaigning against anti-Semitism, it still sends a message that Labour might want to make exceptions, that the party is saying ""yes, but"", rather than ""yes, of course"", to loud demands from the Jewish community that they take the strongest action possible against those who would foment tension. Read full Laura's blog The adoption of all of the examples of anti-Semitism cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance comes after a long-running row about the party's code of conduct. The previous version, adopted in July, was criticised for not including, in full, all of the examples in the IHRA version. In a message to Mr Corbyn's critics, including some Labour MPs and Jewish community leaders, Baroness Chakrabarti added: ""We have accepted these examples. It took so long because of genuine anxieties - however misplaced - about free speech on one of the most intractable problems in the world. ""Come back into the room. I will open the door. I will put the kettle on. But come back into the room because it's time for reasonable debate."" But one critic, MP Dame Margaret Hodge, said it appeared that Mr Corbyn had sought a ""get-out clause"" from the IHRA wording and that his had ""sullied"" its adoption. She said the leader ""now has to own the problem, he has to act and he has to start rebuilding trust"".

Big Shaq comedian wins at grime awards,"Michael Dapaah, the comedian behind Big Shaq, has been honoured at the GRM Daily Rated Awards - winning personality of the year. Rapper Not3s took home artist of the year at the ceremony, which celebrates the UK grime scene. Fredo won mixtape of the year, while Steel Banglez was named best producer for the second-year running. Accepting his award, Michael said: ""Don't let anyone stop you from what you want to do."" He added: ""Big up to the females in this category and all the other entertainers, big up yourself, this one's for you."" It wasn't a great night for the women nominated at the award ceremony, which took place in Hammersmith, west London, on Wednesday. Out of the 14 females up for awards, Kenzo was the only winner - taking home the KA Get Rated Award. The rapper claimed the genre was being used as a ""scapegoat"" by politicians Speaking on the red carpet, Big Narstie said it was ""100% percent unfair"" that drill music was being blamed for a surge in violence in London. It comes after the UK's most senior police officer Cressida Dicklinked the genreto an increase in murders and crime in the capital. ""It's a scapegoat, isn't it? If cowboy films started making everyone start shooting guns, would they ban John Wayne?"" he asked. ""Going back 10 years ago, the only thing a black kid could do to get out of the ghetto was being a sports star. ""Now we can add music to that, which is a good achievement in itself. ""Drill has a lot about it but it's the truth. It's what's happening out there. You can't ask these kids to talk about living in a stable household if they don't."" Steel Banglez wants more prizes for producers Ahead of scooping producer of the year, Steel Banglez told Newsbeat there should be more awards up for grabs for people working behind the scenes. ""I think we are the unsung heroes in terms of what we do for the artists,"" he explained. ""I think people like the Mobos and the Brits should have producer categories and also songwriter awards as well. Because that's a big part of tracks coming together. ""It's to recognise everyone's talents so people don't feel disheartened.""

Japan typhoon leaves trail of destruction,"This video can not be played Thousands of people had to be evacuated from Kansai airport A major international airport in western Japan has been closed, with thousands of people evacuated, in the wake of deadly Typhoon Jebi. Kansai airport, a major transport hub serving Osaka, Kobe and Kyoto, was cut off when an ocean tanker hit and damaged its bridge to the mainland. Jebi, Japan's most powerful storm in 25 years, has killed at least 10 people. In a separate incident, a 6.6 magnitude earthquake caused a landslide on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido. A number of houses in the town of Atsumi were engulfed and several people were said to be trapped. There were no reports of fatalities. The quake came as Typhoon Jebi left a trail of damage to infrastructure, ripping off roofs, overturning vehicles and cutting power. Have you been affected by Typhoon Jebi?

Images showing how Jebi wreaked havoc Kansai International Airport is built on a man-made island and is linked to the mainland by the bridge. The airport's bridge to the mainland was damaged when a tanker hit it About 3,000 passengers were stranded overnight, some for more than 18 hours in terminals without power, before ferries and speedboats were deployed to evacuate them on Wednesday. One passenger told broadcaster NHK: ""We had a blackout so there was no air conditioning. It was hot."" Some people were able to leave on buses, using an unaffected part of the damaged bridge. This video can not be played Earlier footage of the destruction of Typhoon Jebi Runways were also severely hit by surging water, with some aircraft flooded up to their engines. All flights have been cancelled and there is no confirmation of when the airport will reopen.The Kansai airport website,externalcould only say that the runways and bridge would reopen on ""6 September or later"". Some reports said it could take a week. Runways were also flooded at Kansai airport In 2016, Kansai handled some 25 million passengers, making it the third busiest in Japan. It recorded winds of up to 216km/h (135mph) and made landfall at about noon local time on Tuesday (03:00 GMT). It moved quickly northwards over the mainland in the west of the country. In addition to the deaths, some 300 people were injured, officials said. Some 400,000 households are said to be still without power. The winds brought down part of the ceiling in the main railway station in the tourist hub of Kyoto. Hurricanes: A perfect storm of chance and climate change? Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? Images showed containers in ports thrown about like toy bricks and vehicles scattered across roads. Dozens of cars were engulfed in fire at a depot in Nishinomiya as water short-circuited electrics. Some 1.2 million people had been advised to leave evacuated areas as the storm approached and local media say some 16,000 took to designated shelters overnight. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe tweeted: ""We continue to make utmost efforts to respond to disaster damage and restore infrastructure."" The Universal Studios Japan theme park in Osaka was closed again on Wednesday but should reopen on Thursday.

Bland told the BBC she had been ""absolutely overwhelmed by all the wonderful messages"", adding that ""whatever happens, I feel like I have such amazing support from everyone"". After going through a strict screening process, Bland started immunotherapy - which works by harnessing the immune system to destroy cancer cells - at the Christie Hospital in Manchester last Wednesday. She is taking a new trial drug that is designed to make immunotherapy - usually used for other cancers - more effective in treating breast cancer. It was very early in the process, she said, but she felt ""an odd sense of pride"" that she was one of fewer than 150 people in the world to test it. ""If it doesn't help me then I hope the data I provide will at some point in the future help others in the same position,"" she added. ""I feel a bit like a grenade with the pin outâ¦ just waiting for some odd sensations to appear. Tick tock."" She said she will stay on the trial if, when she has a scan in six weeks, the cancer is stable or has shrunk, or if it has grown by more than 20% she will be put on a different trial.

She will be hugely missed by her many listeners and by staff across the BBC. Our sympathies go out to her family and many friends at this difficult time."" The BBC's director of news Fran Unsworth paid her condolences in an email to all BBC staff: ""Rachael was a brilliant journalist and a much-loved colleague. The courageous way she shared her experiences with cancer have inspired and given strength to so many."" I met Rachael on my first 5 Live show in 2010 when she held my hand on-air as I learned the ropes. We subsequently broadcast together many, many times and most recently she was my co-presenter on Drive every Friday. She was never afraid to take the mickey, to subvert the norm and her default position was a cheeriness that has left many of us astounded as the chemo, cold cap, guinea pig pill tests and general hell that comes with cancer came and went. The ONLY time she privately expressed any concern to me was about how her husband Steve and son Freddie would cope without her. Even then, she rolled up her sleeves, wrote a life guide for Freddie, and found a publisher. 'Tell Freddie everything,' I urged her. 'He'll want to know all about his fabulous mum.' We here at 5 Live can certainly tell him some stories. There was the time she stole my moment of history. I was all set to become the first ever voice of 5 Live from our new home in Salford. The posters had been printed, the bigwigs were lined up through the glass. I'd prepped my first words: 'One small step etc...' Then, just as I drew breath, Rachael wandered into the studio, sat down and read the news. Hers was the first voice to be heard. She winked and walked out.

"Gin society rapped over Facebook advertsRegulators uphold complaints against 10 ""light-hearted"" Facebook posts by the Scottish Gin Society.Scotland business","The advertising regulator ruled that this Facebook post by the gin society encouraged excessive drinking A gin appreciation society has been left with a sour taste in its mouth after falling foul of advertising regulators. Complaints over 10 ""light-hearted"" Facebook posts by the Scottish Gin Society (SGS) have been upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). It ruled the ads encouraged excessive drinking and implied alcohol could lead to sexual success, among other things. SGS claimed the posts were memes and therefore were not in ASA's remit. It added it was ""the most po-faced, fun-free, nanny-state judgement imaginable"". The posts have since been removed. The ASA had been alerted to a number of Facebook entries, seen around the turn of the year, by Aberdeenshire Alcohol and Drug Partnership. The authority ruled three of them encouraged excessive drinking. This Facebook post was one of 10 which fell foul of the advertising regulator One featured an image of a glass of gin and tonic accompanied by the text: ""Shut up liver, you're fine! Gin?"" The image featured the SGS logo and was captioned: ""Come on, be honest. How many of you are thinking this right now?"" Another post read: ""I only drink gin on two occasions: When I'm thirsty and when I'm not thirsty"". Two other posts were found to have contravened rules covering nutrition and health claims made on foods. One read: ""This gin and tonic has 91 calories. A banana has 105 calories. My doctor told me to make the healthy choice. I love my doctor."" A further four posts were found to have implied alcohol had therapeutic qualities and could enhance physical and mental capabilities. One referred to gin as being able to ""settle nerve disturbances and period cramps"", while another featured the text ""gin distilled for the eradication of seemingly incurable sadness"". The ASA acknowledged the captions had been ""presented in a light-hearted tone"" but ""still implied that gin could help people overcome emotional problems, and treat depression and pain, and that the ads therefore suggested that gin had therapeutic qualities and could help to treat health conditions"". The gin society had argued its Facebook posts did not fall within the remit of the ASA as they did not sell or promote any products or receive income from the sale of third-party products. But the authority said it considered the posts were subject to advertising rules, because they were ""directly connected to the promotion of the Scottish Gin Society's membership service and the intention to sell gin, which was therefore directly connected to the supply of Scottish gin"". A spokesman for SGS said: ""The ASA freely admits in its judgement that these posts were light-hearted and humorous and they aren't even adverts - nor did we write them. ""They were re-posts of funny memes to members by a not-for-profit organisation so shouldn't fall under the ASA's remit. ""We completely support responsible drinking, but if this is justice then I am a Long Island iced tea."" SGS, which is sponsoring the Scottish Gin Awards in Glasgow later this month, said it would be nominating the ASA for the ""Humour Bypass Award"".

Raab: EU feedback positive,"The UK government says it has received ""positive and constructive feedback"" from the rest of the EU on its Brexit proposals. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the Chequers plan had proved ""challenging"" for some in Brussels - but that European counterparts were ""engaging seriously"". The EU's chief negotiator has said he ""strongly"" opposes parts of the plan. It has also come under fire from some Tory MPs. After updating MPs on his latest meeting with the EU's Michel Barnier, Mr Raab was urged by a number of his own Brexiteer colleagues to ""chuck Chequers"". Christopher Chope told him that persisting with Theresa May's blueprint for future relations was an act of ""self-delusion"" given what he said was the EU's unwillingness to accept it. Meanwhile, campaigners for the public to have the final say on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations have welcomedthe GMB union's decisionto come out in favour of a new referendum. At-a-glance: The 'Chequers' Brexit plan 'No new ideas' in Johnson Brexit criticism Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options The UK will leave the EU on 29 March and negotiations are taking place on the terms of its departure and its future relationship with the remaining members. In July, the UK governmentpublished proposals,externalfor how trade with the EU could be managed in years to come. It includes a ""common rulebook"" for goods and treating the UK and the EU as a ""combined customs territory"" in an attempt to minimise red tape for businesses and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. But Brexiteer critics - including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson - say this will leave the UK too closely tied to the EU in years to come, and are campaigning for it to be ""ditched"". Addressing MPs, Mr Raab was urged by one Tory backbencher to ""chuck Chequers"" in the face of recent criticism from EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Mr Raab said the European Commission had indeed ""raised concerns"" but that positive feedback had been received from member states. Since the government published its proposals in a White Paper, ministers have held more than 60 meetings with EU counterparts, he said. Mr Raab said the ""scope and contours"" of the agreement covering the UK's withdrawal were clear. This would protect citizens' rights and put in place a temporary transition period after the UK leaves, he added. He also defended the UK's plans for the possibility of no deal being reached, which included publishing 25 notices last month offering advice on how best to prepare for such a scenario, saying: ""The UK will be ready for Brexit, deal or no deal."" Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said his statement would ""reassure nobody"", dismissed the Chequers plan as a ""fudge"" and said there were ""huge gaps"" in the government's plans for no deal, notably on the Irish border. Writing in theDaily Telegraph,external, former Tory leader Lord Hague warned that disunity in the party could trigger a ""terrible chain of events over the next seven months"". If there is no agreement that can win the backing of the House of Commons, the UK could face a choice of leaving with no deal or deferring Brexit and holding a new referendum, he said. ""Either of those outcomes could variously involve more serious economic consequences than anything seen so far, the fall of the Conservative government, a general election, and either the election of the dysfunctional Labour Party or another hung Parliament."" Mr Barnier's objections to the plan were underlined during a meeting with the Brexit committee of UK MPs on Monday. One member of the committee, former Conservative minister John Whittingdale, said it had become clear in the meeting that the EU ""just can't accept"" the Chequers plan, because it thinks it goes against the principles of the single market. Mr Whittingdale, who said he was personally ""very unhappy"" about the PM's plan, said Mr Barnier had instead been open to a free trade deal of ""unprecedented closeness"".

"Brexit approach incompetent - Lord KingThe former Bank of England governor blasts the UK's ""lack of preparation"" for Brexit.BusinessComments","This video can not be played Lord King laments Brexit 'incompetence' Former Bank of England governor Lord King has blasted Brexit preparations as ""incompetent"". The Brexit supportersaid it ""beggared belief"" that the world's sixth-biggest economy should be talking of stockpiling food and medicines. This left the government without a credible bargaining position, he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) said that getting a good deal with the EU was ""by far, the most likely outcome"". Lord King said that ""a government that cannot take action to prevent some of these catastrophic outcomes illustrates a whole lack of preparation"". ""It doesn't tell us anything about whether the policy of staying in the EU is good or bad, it tells us everything about the incompetence of the preparation for it."" The 'Chequers' Brexit plan explained What do the Brexit 'no deal' papers reveal? Raab says Chequers EU feedback positive Lord King: Brexit brings real opportunities In a BBC interview to discuss the 10 years since the economic crisis - due to be aired next week - Lord King spent a significant amount of time saying the 11th hour preparation for a no-deal Brexit has undermined the government's negotiating position. He added: ""We haven't had a credible bargaining position, because we hadn't put in place measures where we could say to our colleagues in Europe, 'Look, we'd like a free-trade deal, we think that you would probably like one too, but if we can't agree, don't be under any misapprehension, we have put in place the measures that would enable us to leave without one.'"" In response, the government said it was ""focused on negotiating a deal of unprecedented scope and ambition"". ""We have already made significant progress,"" the DExEU spokesperson added. ""The vast majority of the Withdrawal Agreement has now been agreed, and we are making further progress on the outstanding separation issues"". But Lord King predicts that we will find ourselves with what's been dubbed as Brino - Brexit in name only - which he said was the worst of all worlds. It's also a state of affairs that he fears could drag on for years. ""I think the biggest risk to the UK, and this is what worries me most, is that this issue isn't going to go away, you know the referendum hasn't decided it, because both camps feel that they haven't got what they wanted."" Lord King expressed regret and surprise that it was more difficult for a single country to present a united front than the other 27 EU members. He said: ""They must have been really worried that they had 27 countries to try to corral, how could they have a united negotiating position, they were dealing with a country that was one country, made a clear decision, voted to leave, it knew what it wanted to do, how on earth could the EU manage to negotiate against this one decisive group on the other side of the Channel? ""Well, the reality's been completely the opposite. The EU has been united, has been clear, has been patient and it's the UK that's been divided without any clear strategy at all for how to get to where we want to go."" Please upgrade your browser He also said he found the current level of debate around Brexit ""depressing"" and said it obscured the real challenges ahead. ""The biggest economic problems facing the UK are, we save too little, we haven't worked out how to save for retirement, the pension system is facing I think a real challenge, we haven't worked out how to save enough for the NHS and finance it, we haven't worked out how we're going to save enough to provide care for the elderly. Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options ""These are the big economic challenges we face, but are they being discussed at present in an open way? ""No, because the political debate has been completely taken up by Brexit,"" he said. ""It's a discussion where both sides seem to be throwing insults at each other."" Lord King might argue he is being much more even-handed, with stinging criticism for all involved. His comments come as Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham calls for Brexit to be postponed, if a no-deal scenario seems likely. In a speech on Wednesday, the former Labour minister will say that although ""a price would undoubtedly be paid in terms of social cohesion,"" a suspension of the process would be necessary to avoid damaging jobs.

Gin society rapped over Facebook adverts,"The advertising regulator ruled that this Facebook post by the gin society encouraged excessive drinking A gin appreciation society has been left with a sour taste in its mouth after falling foul of advertising regulators. Complaints over 10 ""light-hearted"" Facebook posts by the Scottish Gin Society (SGS) have been upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). It ruled the ads encouraged excessive drinking and implied alcohol could lead to sexual success, among other things. SGS claimed the posts were memes and therefore were not in ASA's remit. It added it was ""the most po-faced, fun-free, nanny-state judgement imaginable"". The posts have since been removed. The ASA had been alerted to a number of Facebook entries, seen around the turn of the year, by Aberdeenshire Alcohol and Drug Partnership. The authority ruled three of them encouraged excessive drinking. This Facebook post was one of 10 which fell foul of the advertising regulator One featured an image of a glass of gin and tonic accompanied by the text: ""Shut up liver, you're fine! Gin?"" The image featured the SGS logo and was captioned: ""Come on, be honest. How many of you are thinking this right now?"" Another post read: ""I only drink gin on two occasions: When I'm thirsty and when I'm not thirsty"". Two other posts were found to have contravened rules covering nutrition and health claims made on foods. One read: ""This gin and tonic has 91 calories. A banana has 105 calories. My doctor told me to make the healthy choice. I love my doctor."" A further four posts were found to have implied alcohol had therapeutic qualities and could enhance physical and mental capabilities. One referred to gin as being able to ""settle nerve disturbances and period cramps"", while another featured the text ""gin distilled for the eradication of seemingly incurable sadness"". The ASA acknowledged the captions had been ""presented in a light-hearted tone"" but ""still implied that gin could help people overcome emotional problems, and treat depression and pain, and that the ads therefore suggested that gin had therapeutic qualities and could help to treat health conditions"". The gin society had argued its Facebook posts did not fall within the remit of the ASA as they did not sell or promote any products or receive income from the sale of third-party products. But the authority said it considered the posts were subject to advertising rules, because they were ""directly connected to the promotion of the Scottish Gin Society's membership service and the intention to sell gin, which was therefore directly connected to the supply of Scottish gin"". A spokesman for SGS said: ""The ASA freely admits in its judgement that these posts were light-hearted and humorous and they aren't even adverts - nor did we write them. ""They were re-posts of funny memes to members by a not-for-profit organisation so shouldn't fall under the ASA's remit. ""We completely support responsible drinking, but if this is justice then I am a Long Island iced tea."" SGS, which is sponsoring the Scottish Gin Awards in Glasgow later this month, said it would be nominating the ASA for the ""Humour Bypass Award"".

NHS deal for exciting new cancer therapy,"A deal has been struck to let the NHS offer children an expensive new cancer therapy that has been called the most exciting treatment advance for decades. CAR-T is a cutting-edge treatment for aggressive leukaemia when other drugs have failed but usually costs hundreds of thousands of pounds per patient. NHS England boss Simon Stevens says a fair and affordable price has been reached with manufacturer Novartis. Hospitals could start giving it to a small number of children within weeks. The first three NHS hospitals to apply to use the CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T-cell) therapy are in London, Manchester and Newcastle. The NHS has a limited pot of money, meaning tough choices have to be made about which treatments are affordable. The CAR-T treatment from Novartis has a list price of Â£282,000 per patient, though the actual figure NHS England will pay for it has not been disclosed. The cash for CAR-T will come from theCancer Drugs Fund,external, set up to fast-track access to the most promising new cancer treatments. CAR-T is a novel way of treating cancer that is ""personalised"" to the individual patient. It involves giving patients genetically modified immune cells. Immune cells, called T-cells, are taken from a sample of the patient's blood and reprogrammed in the lab to create ones that are genetically coded to recognise and destroy the patient's cancer cells. This ""living therapy"" is then given to the patient. It has been shown in trials to cure some patients, even those with advanced cancers where other treatments have failed, although it can also cause serious side-effects and is not guaranteed to work. Plus it is complex and expensive to make. The deal means the NHS can use the CAR-T treatment called Kymriah for eligible patients, those up to 25 years old who have advanced B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that is not responding to standard therapies. About 400 children are diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia - a type of blood cancer - every year in the UK. But only about 15 of these might be suitable for the CAR-T treatment each year. It is the first in what is expected to be a rapidly expanding class of personalised cancer therapies available on the NHS. Dr Alasdair Rankin, from the blood cancer charity Bloodwise, said: ""CAR-T cell therapy is the most exciting advances in treatment for childhood leukaemia for decades. ""Intensive chemotherapy can now cure the vast majority of children but a significant number still tragically die every year because they do not respond to treatment. ""CAR-T cell therapy offers the genuine chance of a long-term cure for children who otherwise would have no other hope.""

"UK taxes must rise, says Archbishop Welby","This video can not be played UK economy is unjust, says Archbishop of Canterbury The Archbishop of Canterbury has called for a fundamental rethink of how the economy works, including more public spending and higher taxes on technology giants and the wealthy. In an interview with the BBC to mark the launch of a major report by the Commission on Economic Justice, of which he is a leading member, Archbishop Justin Welby said the present economy was ""unjust"". He backed demands from the commission for a new regulator for technology firms, similar to those that oversee public utilities such as energy and water. The spiritual leader of the Church of England said a new regulator would be tasked with ensuring that technology giants such as Google and Facebook were using people's personal data in a way that was socially responsible. ""They have enormous power and the use and handling of data has huge implications for people's security,"" he said. ""But it also has huge implications for the flourishing of individuals and the prosperity and fairness of our society. ""If you corner the market in data, you have probably more wealth advantages than if you corner the market in gold or oil. ""Data is the real place where the money is, and we've always said that people with huge power should be regulated."" Google tracks users who turn off location history Corbyn: Tech firm tax could fund journalism National Living Wage 'fails to cover families' basic needs' Archbishop Welby also argued for an increase in the minimum wage to better reflect the cost of living and support struggling families and said that without action, ""bitter resentment"" would grow. The commission, set up by the left-leaning think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the present ""living wage"", as it is described by the government, should be increased by Â£1 an hour to Â£8.83 for those over 25. It said people on zero-hours contracts should be paid 20% more on top of that figure. It also called for higher levels of corporation tax on businesses, a ""minimum tax rate"" on multinationals such as technology firms to stem ""tax avoidance"" and the scrapping of inheritance tax - to be replaced by a ""lifetime gift tax"" on any gifted income above Â£125,000. The tax would be levied on individuals rather than estates. ""People suffer from injustice in the economy,"" Archbishop Welby told me. ""People suffer from the need to go to a food bank, even when you've got two adults both working. ""People suffer from being caught in a debt trap, because they can't replace a basic bit of equipment they need like a new stove, a washing machine - let alone have luxuries. ""I think one of the regrettable things in the last few years has been to call what we used to call the minimum wage a 'living wage'. ""We need a living wage because that enables people to live with dignity, and the dignity of the human being is fundamental to our understanding of what a just economy is about."" The commission's board members include the archbishop, as well as: union leaders, such as Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress; business leaders, such as Helena Morrissey of Legal and General Investment Management; Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of Google's artificial intelligence arm, DeepMind; and Dominic Barton, global managing partner of the consultancy firm, McKinsey Lord Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, is also a member. The commission was launched in 2016 after the vote to leave the European Union, which some believe was driven in part by the economic difficulties faced by many millions of people. Its report says that problems in the economy are fundamental and have been building for more than 40 years. Low levels of investment by businesses and the government in anything from a new piece of technology to new digital and transport links have meant that growth has suffered, it said. And low levels of wealth creation, called productivity, have left many millions of people struggling as wages fail to keep up with the increase in prices. ""I start with the dignity of the human being which is what I learn from Jesus Christ - the dignity and value of each individual human being, whoever they are,"" the archbishop said, arguing that he was ""non-political"" and that his was not an attack on any particular government or party, as the problems had long-term roots. He said he had met many politicians who were trying to tackle ingrained problems and that there was much to be optimistic about, including high levels of employment. A government spokesman said: ""Since 2010, we've supported more people into work, introduced the National Living Wage worth Â£7.83 per hour, doubled free childcare and helped workers keep more of the money they earn at the end of every month by cutting taxes for 31 million people by an average of Â£1,000."" The spokesman added the government was spending Â£20bn more per year on the NHS and increasing pay for teachers, nurses and soldiers. Archbishop Welby said there were widespread problems. ""For a lot of people, even if their income has gone up a bit, it's become a lot less secure. ""You don't know from one week to the next what you'll be earning. ""And so for people trying to budget, people trying to just save a bit so that, I don't know, once a month they could have fish and chips with their kids or go to the cinema or go down to the beach on a nice hot summer, they can't plan. ""It comes back to justice and the common good."" I asked the archbishop if he agreed with the commission that taxes needed to increase on technology firms and the wealthy. ""What is clear is that tax should be a fundamental part of being a citizen, and that those who have the most should pay the most,"" he said. ""And that no company, through being multinational, being global, can evade the responsibilities of paying its proper amount of tax, based on the revenues it earns in this country. ""So yes, some people will need to pay more. ""I'm not going to point at individuals, but certainly we see people and companies that seem not to pay what sounds like a reasonable amount of tax.""

Labour anti-Semitism 'caveats' criticised,"The Labour leader leaving the NEC meeting on Tuesday Jewish groups have criticised Labour's ruling body for including ""caveats"" when it adopted an anti-Semitism definition in full. The National Executive Committee on Tuesday accepted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance'sdefinition and accompanying examples,external. But a statement was also agreed by the NEC aimed at protecting free speech. The Jewish Leadership Council said this addition would ""drive a coach and horses"" through the IHRA definition. It also criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as he is understood to have suggested a more extensive additional statement focussed on allowing criticism of Israel - but that failed to win enough support from NEC members. Reality Check: Is anti-Semitism on the rise? Laura Kuenssberg: Way out of the mess? A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Jewish Labour peer Lord Dubs told BBC Newsnight that the party had done the ""right thing"" and seemed to have ""turned a corner"". Lord Dubs, who arrived in Britain in the 1930s as a six-year-old fleeing Nazi persecution, said he did not think Mr Corbyn's reported suggestion was a ""helpful one but where the NEC ended up, including the additions, are sensible"". In a separate process, Labour MPs will vote later on whether the parliamentary party's rules should be amended to include the full IHRA definition and the accompanying examples. John Mann, Labour MP and chair of the all-parliamentary group on anti-Semitism, said: ""The MPs will vote overwhelmingly, hopefully unanimously - but I suspect there will be one or two notable abstentions - for the IHRA definition. ""But this has got absolutely nothing to do with the rights of Palestinians, the perfectly justified rights of Palestinians. It's got to do with abuse, attacks and racism against Jewish people. That's why it's so astonishing the Labour party has had this turmoil over something that's internationally recognised."" The NEC agreed to incorporate all 11 examples of anti-Semitismcited by the IHRA,externalinto its code of conduct, includingfour it left out in July. It also added a statement ensuring ""this will not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians"". Rival protesters gathered outside Labour's headquarters as its senior officials discussed the issue In response, Labour Against Anti-Semitism said adding the statement appeared ""to be about protecting the freedom of racists to present vile views"". A spokesman said: ""There can be no caveats, no conditions and no compromises with racism. ""We are disappointed by the decision of Labour's governing body, the NEC, to diminish the IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism via the attachment of a 'clarification' that risks giving racists in the party a get-out-of-jail card."" Jennifer Gerber, director of Labour Friends of Israel, said: ""It is appalling that the Labour Party has once again ignored the Jewish community... it should adopt the full IHRA definition without additions, omissions or caveats."" She added: ""A freedom of expression on Israel clause is unnecessary and totally undermines the other examples the party has supposedly just adopted."" Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge,who has been highly critical of Mr Corbyn'sapproach to tackling anti-Semitism, said the party had taken ""two steps forward and one step back"". Allow Twitter content?

Protesters outside the NEC meeting By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg Perhaps this marks the beginning of the end of this sorry mess. But what makes an early resolution tricky is the caveat that Labour has included alongside. It will be important to many of Mr Corbyn's supporters who want the right to criticise Israel. But for those campaigning against anti-Semitism, it still sends a message that Labour might want to make exceptions, that the party is saying ""yes, but"", rather than ""yes, of course"", to loud demands from the Jewish community that they take the strongest action possible against those who would foment tension. Read full Laura's blog While Mr Corbyn urged the party to adopt the IHRA definition in full with all examples at the NEC meeting, he also set out concerns some Labour members had raised about limitations on freedom of speech. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood the Labour leader suggested a more extensive accompanying statement stating that ""it should not be considered anti-Semitic to describe Israel, its policies or the circumstances around its foundation as racist because of their discriminatory impact, or to support another settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict"". Jewish Leadership Council's chief executive Simon Johnson said: ""It is clearly more important to the Labour leader to protect the free speech of those who hate Israel than it is to protect the Jewish community from the real threats that it faces."" Joan Ryan, chair of Labour Friends of Israel, also told BBC Newsnight Mr Corbyn's statement was ""deeply concerning"". The party has struggled to contain a long-running row over claims of anti-Semitism within its ranks. Labour's Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that adopting the full definition ""has been needed for some time"". He added: ""What has to happen now is that Jeremy personally, and leading figures at the top of the party, have to work hard to rebuild trust with the Jewish community. ""There is a lot of damage that has been done here and the party needs to draw a line and begin that work in earnest."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the NEC's decision on Tuesday was a ""clear indication of our direction of travel"", and Labour would now hold a consultation on changing the wording of its code of conduct. But she maintained the party was not trying to ""water down"" the IHRA definition and examples when it agreed to the freedom of expression statement. Labour MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Mr Corbyn, said Jewish opinion was not ""homogenous"" when it came to backing the definition and the party's decision to adopt it was a ""pragmatic"" one. ""He set out the position and said it was important, in view of the pressure, the party needed to adopt all the examples notwithstanding the criticisms by the original author of them,"" he told the BBC.

Google bosses expected to snub Senate,"Google's Sundar Pichai won't be attending the Senate hearing When Silicon Valley companies once again appear in front of the US Senate on Wednesday, there will be one major absentee: Google. The Senate Intelligence Committee wanted to hear from Sundar Pichai, Googleâs chief executive, or his boss Larry Page, the chief executive of Googleâs parent firm, Alphabet. Barring a dramatic, last-minute change of plan, the BBC understands neither will attend. It would mark the first time a technology firm has refused to comply with the wishes of Congress since the far-reaching inquiries into misinformation and meddling began in the wake of the 2016 election. Google had instead hoped to send Kent Walker, one of its top lawyers. The offer was abruptly shut down by the committee. Its vice chairman, the Democratic Senator Mark Warner, said an empty chair would be left out to represent Googleâs non-appearance. Eventually, senators may issue a subpoena, forcing an appearance under the threat of prosecution. âIf Google thinks weâre just going to go away, theyâre sadly mistaken,â said Senator Warner,speaking to Wired magazine,external. The hearing, scheduled to begin at 09:30 (13:30 GMT), is entitled âForeign Influence Operationsâ Use of Social Media Platformsâ. As well as Google, Twitter and Facebook have been called to appear. Twitter will be represented by its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, while Facebook is sending its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. It will be the first time either executive has faced a congressional committee. Mr Dorsey will also appear, alone, in a hearing on Wednesday afternoon looking specifically at transparency on his platform. He is expected to strongly oppose the suggestion that conservative voices are being silenced on Twitter â a growing claim from the US political right, one that has not been backed up with reliable data. âConservative voices have a strong presence on Twitter,âhe is expected to say,external. Senator Mark Warner says Google is ""mistaken"" if they think the Senate ""will just go away"" âFor example, in 2017, there were 59.5 million tweets about Make America Great Again or MAGA. According to the Pew Research Center, people on Twitter used #MAGA an average of 205,238 times per day from Election Day 2016 through May 1, 2018. It was the third most Tweeted hashtag in 2017.â Where Mr Dorsey may come under fire, however, is over his decision not to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from Twitter, instead giving him what was described as a âtime outâ. It was later reported by the Wall Street Journal that Mr Dorsey had overruled staff who had decided to ban Mr Jones altogether â though Twitter later described that suggestion as âtotally falseâ. In short, the question facing Mr Dorsey on Wednesday is to what extent his own politics and power influences how Twitter conducts itself. Facebookâs chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg is sufficiently famous to satisfy the Senateâs demand for a big company name at its hearing. It means chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who appeared here in April, can sit this one out. Sheryl Sandberg will represent Facebook at the hearing - she is the firm's chief operating officer On Tuesday Ms Sandberg spent the day in private meetings with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss the issues. In Wednesday morning's hearing, Facebook will go over familiar territory - Ms Sandberg will try to draw attention to its expanding workforce, and share statistics showing its efforts to block millions of suspicious accounts automatically. The company may also share details about its so-called âwar roomâ â a division of specialists solely working on policing content that may be wrongly targeting US voters as they prepare to cast their votes. Based on her testimony â released on Tuesday by Facebook â she will offer little new information to the Senate about the companyâs efforts, other than to update some statistics relating to the amount of content being removed. But one important moment may arise when Ms Sandberg argues that Facebook needs more help to solve the crisis, turning the demand to âdo moreâ back on the US government. âThe threat we face is not new,â she is expected to say. âAmerica has always confronted attacks from opponents who wish to undermine our democracy. What is new are the tactics they use. âThat means itâs going to take everyone - including industry, governments, and experts from civil society - working together to stay ahead.â This may be Ms Sandbergâs first hearing, but sheâs no stranger to Washington politics. Before working at the social network she was chief of staff at the US Treasury. Googleâs Mr Walker submitted a written testimony for the hearing, despite the fact he will not be attending the session.In a blog post he said he would be providing private briefings to senators,external, but did not address the row over his seniority. Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey faces two hearings on Wednesday The affair risks becoming a public relations crisis for Google, which just last week was doing its best to bat back claims from President Donald Trump that it was censoring conservative news outlets in its search results. The White House did not provide any evidence to support the presidentâs complaints, but the topic may well come up at Wednesdayâs hearing. âI don't know if it's because [Page] wants to avoid being asked about those things or because they think they're so important and so powerful that they don't need to provide congressional testimony,â said Republican Senator Marco Rubio,speaking to the Washington Post,external. He also told the newspaper: âThey should be careful with that. When a company gets too big to become accountable, they become a monopoly.â The question of new regulation designed to control the powers of technology companies has been a recurring theme since the firms first appeared here to talk about this issue, almost a year ago to the day. Any regulation concocted in the wake of these hearings would likely end up being enforced by the US telecoms regulator, the Federal Communications Commission. Ahead of the hearings â which the FCC is not a part of â its chairman Ajit Pai criticised what he sees as a serious lack of transparency among the tech giants. âThe public deserves to know more about how these companies operate,âhe wrote in a blog post on Tuesday,external. âAnd we need to seriously think about whether the time has come for these companies to abide by new transparency obligations. âAfter all, just as is the case with respect to broadband providers, consumers need accurate information in order to make educated choices about whether and how to use these tech giantsâ platforms.â Also under scrutiny will be the ability of Congress to competently probe the tech bosses. During Aprilâs hearing with Mark Zuckerberg, many members were mocked for asking basic, easily-ducked questions of the Facebook chief executive. Senator Warner has said he is hopeful questions this time round will be better. He suggested his colleagues on the committee had âdone their homeworkâ. _____ Follow Dave Lee onTwitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

1.4 billion 'not doing enough exercise',"The transition towards more sedentary jobs in wealthier countries is likely to be making people less active, experts say Very little progress has been made in reducing levels of inactivity worldwide, experts have warned. A WHO report estimates that more than a quarter of people worldwide - 1.4 billion - are not doing enough physical exercise, a figure that has barely improved since 2001. Inactivity raises the risk of a raft of health problems, such as heart disease, type-2 diabetes and some cancers. High-income countries, including the UK, were among the least active. And women were found to be more sedentary throughout the world, with the exception of two regions of Asia. Twenty million Britons 'physically inactive' Do you know your heart age? Researchers from the World Health Organization (WHO) looked at self-reported data on activity from 358 population-based surveys in 168 countries, including 1.9 million people, for theirstudy in The Lancet Global Health,external. They found in high-income countries, which include the UK and the USA, the proportion of inactive people had risen from 32% in 2001 to 37% in 2016, while in low-income countries it had remained stable at 16%. Those who were classed as inactive did less than 150 minutes of moderate exercise - or 75 minutes at a vigorous intensity - a week. Countries driving the upwards trend included Germany, New Zealand and the US. Women were less active than men in all but East and South-East Asia, with the biggest differences being in South Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, north Africa and high-income Western countries. The authors said this was likely to have been caused by a combination of factors, including extra childcare duties and cultural attitudes that made it harder for them to exercise. In the UK, inactivity levels in 2016 were 36% overall - 32% of men and 40% of women. Experts said the transition in wealthier countries towards more sedentary jobs and hobbies, along with increased use of motor transport, might explain their higher levels of inactivity. In lower-income countries people are more likely to be active in their jobs and walk or use public transport. The report's authors warned that as things stood the WHO's 2025 target of reducing global inactivity by 10% would be missed. Dr Regina Guthold, lead author of the study from the WHO, said: ""Unlike other major global health risks, levels of insufficient physical activity are not falling worldwide, on average, and over a quarter of all adults are not reaching the recommended levels of physical activity for good health. ""Regions with increasing levels of insufficient physical activity are a major concern for public health and the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases."" Co-author Dr Fiona Bull, also from the WHO, said: ""Addressing these inequalities in physical activity levels between men and women will be critical to achieving global activity targets and will require interventions to promote and improve women's access to opportunities that are safe, affordable and culturally acceptable."" How much? at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity every week strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles break up long periods of sitting with light activity What is moderate aerobic activity? Walking fast,water aerobics,riding a bike on level ground or with a few hills,doubles tennis,pushing a lawn mower,hiking,skateboarding,rollerblading,volleyball,basketball What counts as vigorous activity?

This video can not be played Age just a number for 100-year-old gym bunny The countries with the highest rates of inactivity were: Kuwait 67% Saudi Arabia 53% Iraq 52% The countries with the least inactivity were: Uganda and Mozambique 6% Experts called on governments to provide and maintain infrastructure that promoted sports and increased walking and cycling for transport. Dr Melody Ding, from the University of Sydney, who was not involved in the study, said that while economic development led to lifestyle changes that increased sedentary behaviour, governments could do more to help people be more active, such as improving public transport and making it easier to walk and cycle. Dr Mike Brannan, national lead for physical activity at Public Health England, said: ""These figures highlight the global issue of inactivity and the UK is no exception. ""We need action to reverse decades of decline in the nations level of physical activity. ""With our partners, we're working to get the nation moving more through supporting social and physical environments that foster healthier, active lifestyles and through our physical activity work.""

"UK economy is unjust, says archbishop","This video can not be played UK economy is unjust, says Archbishop of Canterbury The Archbishop of Canterbury has called for a fundamental rethink of how the economy works, including more public spending and higher taxes on technology giants and the wealthy. In an interview with the BBC to mark the launch of a major report by the Commission on Economic Justice, of which he is a leading member, Archbishop Justin Welby said the present economy was ""unjust"". He backed demands from the commission for a new regulator for technology firms, similar to those that oversee public utilities such as energy and water. The spiritual leader of the Church of England said a new regulator would be tasked with ensuring that technology giants such as Google and Facebook were using people's personal data in a way that was socially responsible. ""They have enormous power and the use and handling of data has huge implications for people's security,"" he said. ""But it also has huge implications for the flourishing of individuals and the prosperity and fairness of our society. ""If you corner the market in data, you have probably more wealth advantages than if you corner the market in gold or oil. ""Data is the real place where the money is, and we've always said that people with huge power should be regulated."" Google tracks users who turn off location history Corbyn: Tech firm tax could fund journalism National Living Wage 'fails to cover families' basic needs' Archbishop Welby also argued for an increase in the minimum wage to better reflect the cost of living and support struggling families and said that without action, ""bitter resentment"" would grow. The commission, set up by the left-leaning think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the present ""living wage"", as it is described by the government, should be increased by Â£1 an hour to Â£8.83 for those over 25. It said people on zero-hours contracts should be paid 20% more on top of that figure. It also called for higher levels of corporation tax on businesses, a ""minimum tax rate"" on multinationals such as technology firms to stem ""tax avoidance"" and the scrapping of inheritance tax - to be replaced by a ""lifetime gift tax"" on any gifted income above Â£125,000. The tax would be levied on individuals rather than estates. ""People suffer from injustice in the economy,"" Archbishop Welby told me. ""People suffer from the need to go to a food bank, even when you've got two adults both working. ""People suffer from being caught in a debt trap, because they can't replace a basic bit of equipment they need like a new stove, a washing machine - let alone have luxuries. ""I think one of the regrettable things in the last few years has been to call what we used to call the minimum wage a 'living wage'. ""We need a living wage because that enables people to live with dignity, and the dignity of the human being is fundamental to our understanding of what a just economy is about."" The commission's board members include the archbishop, as well as: union leaders, such as Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress; business leaders, such as Helena Morrissey of Legal and General Investment Management; Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of Google's artificial intelligence arm, DeepMind; and Dominic Barton, global managing partner of the consultancy firm, McKinsey Lord Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, is also a member. The commission was launched in 2016 after the vote to leave the European Union, which some believe was driven in part by the economic difficulties faced by many millions of people. Its report says that problems in the economy are fundamental and have been building for more than 40 years. Low levels of investment by businesses and the government in anything from a new piece of technology to new digital and transport links have meant that growth has suffered, it said. And low levels of wealth creation, called productivity, have left many millions of people struggling as wages fail to keep up with the increase in prices. ""I start with the dignity of the human being which is what I learn from Jesus Christ - the dignity and value of each individual human being, whoever they are,"" the archbishop said, arguing that he was ""non-political"" and that his was not an attack on any particular government or party, as the problems had long-term roots. He said he had met many politicians who were trying to tackle ingrained problems and that there was much to be optimistic about, including high levels of employment. A government spokesman said: ""Since 2010, we've supported more people into work, introduced the National Living Wage worth Â£7.83 per hour, doubled free childcare and helped workers keep more of the money they earn at the end of every month by cutting taxes for 31 million people by an average of Â£1,000."" The spokesman added the government was spending Â£20bn more per year on the NHS and increasing pay for teachers, nurses and soldiers. Archbishop Welby said there were widespread problems. ""For a lot of people, even if their income has gone up a bit, it's become a lot less secure. ""You don't know from one week to the next what you'll be earning. ""And so for people trying to budget, people trying to just save a bit so that, I don't know, once a month they could have fish and chips with their kids or go to the cinema or go down to the beach on a nice hot summer, they can't plan. ""It comes back to justice and the common good."" I asked the archbishop if he agreed with the commission that taxes needed to increase on technology firms and the wealthy. ""What is clear is that tax should be a fundamental part of being a citizen, and that those who have the most should pay the most,"" he said. ""And that no company, through being multinational, being global, can evade the responsibilities of paying its proper amount of tax, based on the revenues it earns in this country. ""So yes, some people will need to pay more. ""I'm not going to point at individuals, but certainly we see people and companies that seem not to pay what sounds like a reasonable amount of tax.""

UK and French talks to end scallop row,"French and British boats collided in the English Channel Britain and France have agreed on the principles of a deal that would end a dispute over scallop fishing in the English Channel. No UK vessels will fish for scallops in the Bay of Seine during the period when the French are not allowed to catch. A joint statement from the two governments said talks in London on Wednesday had been ""constructive"". But a finalised deal hinges on a ""reasonable compensation package"" for smaller British boats, which lose out. Around 40 French boats clashed with five UK crafts off the coast of northern France last week. Talks were held between representatives of the UK and French fishing industries and Defra officials on Wednesday in an attempt to resolve tensions. Scallop wars: Could Brexit calm troubled waters? Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops? Regulations allow British boats to fish in the Bay of Seine, a scallop-rich area off the Normandy coast, all year round. But French fishermen are banned from taking scallops from the area between May 15 and October 1 to conserve stocks. A previous industry agreement prevented UK vessels larger than 15 metres from fishing for scallops in the area during that period too, but smaller boats were free to do so. The deal agreed in principle on Wednesday would prevent smaller boats from taking advantage of this window. Those vessels will be compensated for their losses, with the amount to be agreed at a meeting in Paris on Friday. This video can not be played Scallop row: What's the EU's fishing feud about? But a UK industry representative involved in the talks said the deal would only be finalised if British fishermen did not lose out. Jim Portus, chief executive of the South Western Fish Producers Organisation, said: ""I'm very pleased that we've negotiated a deal which satisfies the honour of fishermen on both sides. ""The French are in a hurry to make sure that it happens because what they don't want either is another conflict. ""Quite frankly, if it's not good enough on Friday, it will be rejected."" He added he was ""pleased"" the French had expressed ""regret"" during the talks for the recent clashes. All British boats have been asked to voluntarily stop fishing for scallops in the conflict area until a deal is finalised. Speaking after the talks, French industry representative Pascal Coquet said it was a ""good deal"". The talks were held after French and British boats clashed off the coast of northern France last week, with UK crews reporting rocks, smoke bombs and other projectiles were hurled at them during the confrontation. The French boatsgathered overnighton Monday last week in protest against so-called ""pillaging"" by five larger British vessels. The British were chased away and two boats, Golden Promise and Joanna C, returned to Brixham harbour with damaged windows. The British crews say they had been surrounded and had rocks and metal shackles thrown at them. French police said UK boats responded in kind. A video published by French media showed a Scottish scallop dredger, the Honeybourne 3, colliding with French vessels.

"Fifth of meat tests reveal unspecified DNAThe food safety watchdog says levels of contamination are consistent with ""deliberate inclusion"".UK","More than a fifth of meat sample tests in 2017 found DNA from animals not on the labelling, the BBC has learned. Out of 665 results from England, Wales and Northern Ireland collected by the Food Standards Agency, 145 were partly or wholly made up of unspecified meat. The FSA said the levels were consistent with ""deliberate inclusion"" - but added testing had targeted those businesses suspected of ""compliance issues"". The samples came from 487 businesses, including restaurants and supermarkets. A BBC Freedom of Information request to the FSA revealed that in total 73 of the contaminated samples came from retailers - including three supermarkets. A further 50 came from restaurants, while 22 originated from manufacturing or food processing plants. It also showed: Some samples contained DNA from as many as four different animals, while others contained no trace of the meat that appeared on the product's label Meat labelled as lamb was most likely to contain traces of other animals' DNA, followed by beef and goat Cow DNA was the most commonly-found contaminant, followed by pig, chicken, sheep and turkey The most commonly mis-labelled product was mince meat, while sausages, kebabs and restaurant curries also featured prominently Other products in the dataset include ready meals such as spaghetti Bolognese and curries, pizzas and a portion of ostrich meat, which contained only beef An FSA spokesman said it was up to the relevant local authorities - which procured the samples before sending the results to the FSA - to lead individual investigations and take ""appropriate action"" such as prosecutions. He added the results were ""not representative of the wider food industry"". However, a clear picture of the wider food industry is not readily available as less than half of local authorities actually submitted meat sampling data to the United Kingdom's Food Surveillance System - part of the FSA - in 2017. Some councils may have focused their food testing priorities ""in areas other than meat substitution"", the FSA said - adding that others may have carried out tests later in the financial year. Experts say replacing expensive meat with a cheaper product is a common reason behind food fraud -a global problem that has existed for centuries. This latest data comes five years afterthe horsemeat scandal, when processed beef products sold by a number of UK supermarket chains were found to contain significant amounts of horse DNA. While none of the 2017 samples contained horsemeat, the lack of transparency surrounding the quality and origin of meat products in the UK has raised concerns. Q&A: The 2013 horsemeat scandal What is the Food Standards Agency? Compassion in World Farming, which campaigns for better animal welfare in the meat industry, said untraceable ingredients made it hard for animal welfare to be ""part of consumers' shopping decisions"". Responding to the examples of pork hidden in meat sold as lamb, kosher agency the Kashrut Division London Beth Din (KLBD) said there was ""a lack of transparency"" in some parts of the food industry. The KLBD added, however, that there were ""robust protocols in place to avoid mislabelling"" in products labelled as kosher. Local authorities gathered samples from businesses in their area before sending them to laboratories for analysis. The results were then submitted to the FSA. The FSA explained the ""majority"" of samples were tested for cow, pig, sheep, goat, horse, chicken and turkey DNA because those animals represent the ""overwhelming majority"" of livestock reared, slaughtered and imported in the UK. DNA from other animals could have been present in some samples, but may not have been identified as testers were not looking for it. According to the FSA, the inclusion of DNA at a proportion of 1% or greater should be considered consistent with ""deliberate inclusion"". Samples contaminated by un-named DNA at a level of less than 1% were excluded from the results on the basis they could have been caused by poor hygiene. What is the Food Standards Agency?

""People suffer from the need to go to a food bank, even when you've got two adults both working. ""People suffer from being caught in a debt trap, because they can't replace a basic bit of equipment they need like a new stove, a washing machine - let alone have luxuries. ""I think one of the regrettable things in the last few years has been to call what we used to call the minimum wage a 'living wage'. ""We need a living wage because that enables people to live with dignity, and the dignity of the human being is fundamental to our understanding of what a just economy is about."" The commission's board members include the archbishop, as well as: union leaders, such as Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress; business leaders, such as Helena Morrissey of Legal and General Investment Management; Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of Google's artificial intelligence arm, DeepMind; and Dominic Barton, global managing partner of the consultancy firm, McKinsey Lord Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, is also a member. The commission was launched in 2016 after the vote to leave the European Union, which some believe was driven in part by the economic difficulties faced by many millions of people. Its report says that problems in the economy are fundamental and have been building for more than 40 years. Low levels of investment by businesses and the government in anything from a new piece of technology to new digital and transport links have meant that growth has suffered, it said. And low levels of wealth creation, called productivity, have left many millions of people struggling as wages fail to keep up with the increase in prices. ""I start with the dignity of the human being which is what I learn from Jesus Christ - the dignity and value of each individual human being, whoever they are,"" the archbishop said, arguing that he was ""non-political"" and that his was not an attack on any particular government or party, as the problems had long-term roots. He said he had met many politicians who were trying to tackle ingrained problems and that there was much to be optimistic about, including high levels of employment. A government spokesman said: ""Since 2010, we've supported more people into work, introduced the National Living Wage worth Â£7.83 per hour, doubled free childcare and helped workers keep more of the money they earn at the end of every month by cutting taxes for 31 million people by an average of Â£1,000."" The spokesman added the government was spending Â£20bn more per year on the NHS and increasing pay for teachers, nurses and soldiers. Archbishop Welby said there were widespread problems. ""For a lot of people, even if their income has gone up a bit, it's become a lot less secure. ""You don't know from one week to the next what you'll be earning. ""And so for people trying to budget, people trying to just save a bit so that, I don't know, once a month they could have fish and chips with their kids or go to the cinema or go down to the beach on a nice hot summer, they can't plan. ""It comes back to justice and the common good."" I asked the archbishop if he agreed with the commission that taxes needed to increase on technology firms and the wealthy. ""What is clear is that tax should be a fundamental part of being a citizen, and that those who have the most should pay the most,"" he said. ""And that no company, through being multinational, being global, can evade the responsibilities of paying its proper amount of tax, based on the revenues it earns in this country. ""So yes, some people will need to pay more. ""I'm not going to point at individuals, but certainly we see people and companies that seem not to pay what sounds like a reasonable amount of tax.""

Experts confirm Novichok caused poisoningAn independent report finds Dawn Sturgess was killed by the same nerve agent used to poison the Skripals.UK,"Dawn Sturgess died on 8 July The substance that killed a woman in Amesbury was the same Novichok nerve agent that poisoned Sergei and Yulia Skripal, experts have confirmed. The independent Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons report backs up the UK government's findings. Dawn Sturgess, 44, died in hospital on 8 July after handling a contaminated container, months after the Skripals were poisoned in Salisbury. The foreign secretary said Russia's recklessness was ""appalling"". Russia has denied any involvement in the poisonings. The international chemical weapons experts reached their conclusions havingcollected samples from the UK. It was not possible to conclude whether the nerve agent used in the two incidents was from the same batch, the OPCW said. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked the OPCW and paid tribute to the ""high standards set by our world-leading scientists"". He said it was a reminder of the importance of upholding the the global ban on all use of chemical weapons. ""The recklessness of the Russian state in bringing a nerve agent in to the UK, and total disregard for the safety of the public, is appalling and irresponsible,"" he added. ""Our thoughts are with the family of Dawn Sturgess, and with Charlie Rowley."" Mr Rowley - a friend of Ms Sturgess - fell ill but survived the poisoning. Novichok bottle 'was found in branded box' Why Novichok stays deadly for so long Novichok 999 vehicles buried in landfill On 30 June, the couple collapsed in a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury. Police said they were exposed after handling what they believed to be perfume. Mr Rowley was discharged from hospital on 20 July. The Foreign Office said police investigations into the Amesbury and Salisbury poisonings were continuing. Meanwhile, the Russian Embassy in London has accused the UK of refusing it access to the Skripals. In a statement marking six months since the pair were admitted to hospital, the embassy said the pair had been ""kept in isolation and under full control of British authorities"". ""They remain out of the public eye at an unknown location, unable to communicate freely with their relatives, friends, journalists or Russian officials, deprived of the freedom of movement,"" the statement added. Ms Skripalhas previously thanked the Russian embassyfor its offer of assistance, but said she and her father were ""not ready to take it"".

Judy Garland's stolen ruby slippers found,"Multiple pairs of ruby slippers were made for the film, including these ones displayed in Beverly Hills in 2011 A pair of ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz has been found 13 years after being stolen, according to US authorities. They were taken from a Minnesota museum in 2005, when someone broke in through a window late at night. Three others pairs of ruby slippers worn by Garland in the 1939 film are known to exist. An anonymous donor once offered a $1m (Â£775,000) reward for the stolen pair's whereabouts and the thief's name. However, the reward expired on the tenth anniversary of the robbery. It is unknown if the shoes' recovery is related to any tip-offs. In press conference on Tuesday afternoon, no specific details were given about where they were found or how. FBI special agent Joan Sanborn indicated that the investigation was still ongoing. ""We've gathered lots of information on this case. We believe there's lots more to give,"" she said. Five stolen things that are still missing Public urged to help save Oz's ruby shoes Who stole Burma's royal ruby? The slippers are often said to among the most valued props in movie history. This pair was insured for $1m but experts have said they could be worth two times that now. Judy Garland played the lead role of Dorothy Gale in the classic musical The Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Garland's birthplace, had been loaned the slippers from a collector named Michael Shaw. The theft was described as a simple smash-and-grab, with the glass display case destroyed and the slippers snatched. Almost no clues were left behind, neither footprints nor fingerprints, and the surveillance camera was not working that night. ""I literally felt like I was hit in the stomach when I got the call,"" Mr Shaw told Newsweek in 2015. ""My knees buckled, and I went right down on the floor. I had taken care of those shoes for 35 years!"" Jon Miner, the museum's co-founder, told the magazine he was also devastated. ""I cried,"" he said. ""I couldn't believe this happened to us because it was the stupidest thing."" The museum has kept the podium - labelled ""Dorothy's Ruby Slippers"" - empty since they disappeared. A documentary about the theft - Who Stole The Ruby Slippers? - was released in 2015. The shoes are covered in about 2,300 sequins,external, according to the Hollywood Reporter In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz - L. Frank Baum's 1900 book on which the film is based - Dorothy wore silver shoes. However MGM Studios chose to turn them bright red to show off new Technicolor film techniques In 2016, theSmithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington DC raised more than $300,000for the restoration of a pair they had acquired In 2012, actor Leonardo DiCaprio was named as the lead benefactor in a group of movie lovers who bought one of the pairs. It will be displayed at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures when it opens in Los Angeles next year The fourth known pair is owned by a private collector, who bought them from a Tennessee schoolteacher who had won them in a 1940 competition Actress Debbie Reynolds was also once given some ruby slippers from the movie but these were used for screen tests and never worn by Garland.

WHO warning over global lack of exercise,"The transition towards more sedentary jobs in wealthier countries is likely to be making people less active, experts say Very little progress has been made in reducing levels of inactivity worldwide, experts have warned. A WHO report estimates that more than a quarter of people worldwide - 1.4 billion - are not doing enough physical exercise, a figure that has barely improved since 2001. Inactivity raises the risk of a raft of health problems, such as heart disease, type-2 diabetes and some cancers. High-income countries, including the UK, were among the least active. And women were found to be more sedentary throughout the world, with the exception of two regions of Asia. Twenty million Britons 'physically inactive' Do you know your heart age? Researchers from the World Health Organization (WHO) looked at self-reported data on activity from 358 population-based surveys in 168 countries, including 1.9 million people, for theirstudy in The Lancet Global Health,external. They found in high-income countries, which include the UK and the USA, the proportion of inactive people had risen from 32% in 2001 to 37% in 2016, while in low-income countries it had remained stable at 16%. Those who were classed as inactive did less than 150 minutes of moderate exercise - or 75 minutes at a vigorous intensity - a week. Countries driving the upwards trend included Germany, New Zealand and the US. Women were less active than men in all but East and South-East Asia, with the biggest differences being in South Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, north Africa and high-income Western countries. The authors said this was likely to have been caused by a combination of factors, including extra childcare duties and cultural attitudes that made it harder for them to exercise. In the UK, inactivity levels in 2016 were 36% overall - 32% of men and 40% of women. Experts said the transition in wealthier countries towards more sedentary jobs and hobbies, along with increased use of motor transport, might explain their higher levels of inactivity. In lower-income countries people are more likely to be active in their jobs and walk or use public transport. The report's authors warned that as things stood the WHO's 2025 target of reducing global inactivity by 10% would be missed. Dr Regina Guthold, lead author of the study from the WHO, said: ""Unlike other major global health risks, levels of insufficient physical activity are not falling worldwide, on average, and over a quarter of all adults are not reaching the recommended levels of physical activity for good health. ""Regions with increasing levels of insufficient physical activity are a major concern for public health and the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases."" Co-author Dr Fiona Bull, also from the WHO, said: ""Addressing these inequalities in physical activity levels between men and women will be critical to achieving global activity targets and will require interventions to promote and improve women's access to opportunities that are safe, affordable and culturally acceptable."" How much? at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity every week strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles break up long periods of sitting with light activity What is moderate aerobic activity? Walking fast,water aerobics,riding a bike on level ground or with a few hills,doubles tennis,pushing a lawn mower,hiking,skateboarding,rollerblading,volleyball,basketball What counts as vigorous activity? Jogging or running,swimming fast,riding a bike fast or on hills,singles tennis,football,rugby,skipping rope,hockey,aerobics,gymnastics,martial arts What activities strengthen muscles? lifting weights,working with resistance bands,doing exercises that use your own body weight, such as push-ups and sit-ups,heavy gardening, such as digging and shovelling,yoga What activities are both aerobic and muscle-strengthening? circuit training,aerobics,running,football,rugby,netball,hockey Source: NHS For more information, including guidelines for children and adults who are 65 or over,click here,external. This video can not be played Age just a number for 100-year-old gym bunny The countries with the highest rates of inactivity were: Kuwait 67% Saudi Arabia 53% Iraq 52% The countries with the least inactivity were: Uganda and Mozambique 6% Experts called on governments to provide and maintain infrastructure that promoted sports and increased walking and cycling for transport. Dr Melody Ding, from the University of Sydney, who was not involved in the study, said that while economic development led to lifestyle changes that increased sedentary behaviour, governments could do more to help people be more active, such as improving public transport and making it easier to walk and cycle. Dr Mike Brannan, national lead for physical activity at Public Health England, said: ""These figures highlight the global issue of inactivity and the UK is no exception. ""We need action to reverse decades of decline in the nations level of physical activity. ""With our partners, we're working to get the nation moving more through supporting social and physical environments that foster healthier, active lifestyles and through our physical activity work.""
