Met PC admits raping and kidnapping Sarah Everard,"Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton when she disappeared A Met Police officer has admitted kidnapping and raping Sarah Everard. The 33-year-old vanished as she walked home in Clapham, south London, on 3 March. Her body was found a week later in woodland near Ashford, Kent. Appearing at the Old Bailey via video-link, PC Wayne Couzens, of Deal, pleaded guilty both to kidnap and rape. The court heard he also accepted responsibility for Ms Everard's death but did not enter a plea on the charge of murder. Marketing executive Ms Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton on the night she disappeared. She was reported missing by her boyfriend on 4 March and her body was discovered hidden in an area of woodland on 10 March. PC Couzens was wearing khaki trousers and a grey sweatshirt as he appeared by video link from Belmarsh jail. He pleaded guilty to kidnapping Ms Everard ""unlawfully and by force or fraud"" on 3 March. He also pleaded guilty to a second charge of rape between 2 and 10 March. Four members of Ms Everard's family were present at the court as PC Couzens answered the two charges with: ""Yes, sir."" The court heard that he had accepted responsibility for the killing but medical reports were awaited. The next plea hearing is due to take place on 9 July.

UK and EU urge compromises over Irish Sea border,"This video can not be played Protecting trade flows east-west and north-south across the island of Ireland is ""easily doable"", says Boris Johnson The EU says its patience is ""wearing very thin"" with the UK in talks aimed at avoiding a post-Brexit trade war. Top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement. The UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation. Boris Johnson said a solution that protects trade flows and the peace process was ""easily doable"". And he dismissed talk of a trade war with the EU, saying he was ""not worried"" it would overshadow the G7 summit. The prime minister is in Cornwall, where he will host the leaders of the world's richest nations, including US President Joe Biden, who is said to have ""deep"" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland. Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU EU to begin legal action over NI Protocol 'breach' Asked about this, Mr Johnson said everyone needed to be ""absolutely clear"" that the purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol - the part of the Brexit deal at the centre of the row - was to ""uphold the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, to make sure that we keep the balance in relationships in Northern Ireland"". He said he was ""optimistic"" a solution could be found that ""protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom"". Lord Frost (L) has been discussing border issues with his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in central London Talks between Mr Sefcovic - a vice-president of the European Commission - and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost broke up earlier without agreement. Mr Sefcovic said he was ""positive we can find a solution"" but added: ""Our patience really is wearing very, very thin, and therefore we have to assess all options we have at our disposal."" This could include legal action, arbitration or retaliatory trade measures such as tariffs, he explained. He said ""trust"" had to be restored between the two sides, after the UK had broken the terms of the 2019 Northern Ireland protocol. A key flashpoint is a looming ban on the export of sausages and other chilled meats from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) no longer follows EU rules but Northern Ireland does - because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. EU food safety rules do not allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members like the UK. Frozen meat is not covered by the rules. In January, the two sides agreed a six month ""grace"" period to allow companies to set up alternative supply chains, but that runs out at the end of June. The UK has already held back from carrying out full checks on supermarket goods and parcels moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, prompting the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the protocol and tobegin legal proceedings. Mr Sefcovic said: ""If the UK were to take further unilateral action in the coming weeks the EU will not be shy in acting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure the UK abides by its international obligations."" A UK source close to the negotiations said: ""Nobody wants to get into a trade war or anything close to it."" It was ""much better to find agreed ways forward"", added the source, and ""the people in Northern Ireland want solutions not threats"". ""But unfortunately we have got used to living in an atmosphere where there are threats."" Asked by ITV's Robert Peston if the UK would take unilateral action, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said ""we're not at that stage yet but we've said we will keep all options open."" There's a clash of cultures at the heart of this increasingly serious dispute. The EU is a union of laws and rules - and once it has an agreement it tends to stick to the details. The British government, on the other hand, decided to kick some of the details down the road in its desire to ""Get Brexit Done"". But those details never went away, and now they are threatening to provoke another crisis in Britain's relationship with Europe, and to destabilise Northern Ireland. During the 2019 general election campaign Boris Johnson said there would be no checks on goods moving in either direction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of his Brexit deal, even though official documents at the time made clear that there would be. Now his government says the EU needs to show more flexibility, that it's being too legalistic. The practicalities of implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full are certainly pretty challenging. Northern Ireland's chief vet recently told Assembly members in Belfast that it would require more checks on food than are done in the whole of the EU. And he only has 12 vets. The EU says it is prepared to be flexible, but says the UK cannot walk away from its legal obligations. Both sides talk about ""considering all our options"" if a compromise can't be found. In public at least, it's hard to see where the common ground lies. Mr Sefcovic said the EU had offered a temporary solution to the chilled meats row, ahead of a comprehensive trade deal, but he said the UK was not prepared to accept it because it would involve signing up to EU food standards. ""Ideology prevails over what is good for the people of Northern Ireland,"" he added. Northern Irish ports such as Larne have seen additional border checks under the protocol Speaking after his meeting with Mr Sefcovic, Lord Frost said the protocol was ""being implemented in a way which is causing disruption in Northern Ireland and we had some pretty frank and honest discussions about that situation"". ""There weren't any breakthroughs, there weren't any breakdowns either and we are going to carry on talking,"" he added. ""What we really now need to do is very urgently find some solutions, which support the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, Support the peace process in Northern Ireland and allow things to return to normal."" Government 'knew NI Protocol was bad deal' Can sea border âteething problemsâ be solved? Lord Frost said the EU was insisting that the two sides ""operate the protocol in an extremely purist way"" and he did not see any problem with continuing to allow exports of chilled meats. ""We don't see what risk is caused to Northern Ireland if chilled meats are imported there from GB."" Northern Ireland's deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who also took part in the meeting - challenged the UK government to ""honour its commitments"" on the Brexit protocol. ""Certainly there's a frustration that the British government have signed up to this agreement, however they have failed to bring forward ways to implement the Protocol in its entirety,"" she added.

Scotland would 'move quickly' to vaccinate children,"More than half of Scotland's adult population has had both doses of a Covid vaccine Scotland will start to vaccinate children aged between 12 and 15 as quickly as possible if experts recommend it, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The Pfizer-BionTech vaccine was approved for use among the age group by the UK's medicine regulator last week. The Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization on whether it should begin vaccinating children. Ms Sturgeon said the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated. But she told the Scottish Parliament that if the JCVI recommends the use of the vaccine for children over the age of 12, the country would ""move as quickly as possible to implement the advice"". UK approves Pfizer jab for 12 to 15-year-olds Should all children get a Covid vaccine? The first minister added: ""It is vital that we rely on expert advice in all of our vaccination decisions. ""However, vaccination may well be an important way of giving children greater protection, minimising any further disruption to schooling, and further reducing community transmission of the virus."" Ms Sturgeon also insisted that the decision was not simply a choice between ""vaccinating children and playing our part in global vaccination"". More than half of Scotland's adult population has now had both doses of a Covid vaccine - with the total number standing at 2,282,203. Pfizer has said its vaccine trials had shown 100% efficacy and a strong immune response in children between 12 and 15, and that the vaccine was safe with no unusual side-effects. Its use among children in the UK was approved by the MHRA on Friday of last week, with the regulator saying it had carried out a ""rigorous review"" which showed the vaccine was safe and effective in adolescents. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) must now advise governments on whether this age group should be vaccinated as part of the UK rollout. The UK government has also said it will be guided by expert advise from the JCVI, and that any decision would be ""clinically based"". And it has said that the UK has enough supplies to vaccinate children if the move was recommended by the JCVI. But some experts have questioned whether it is morally right to vaccinate children - who have an extremely low risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from Covid - in wealthy countries such as the UK rather than donating the extra doses to the rest of the world.

Some experts want extra vaccine doses to be donated to less wealthy countries rather than used to immunise teenagers The World Health Organization has already called on wealthy countries to postpone any plans to immunise children. And Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland at the weekend that she hoped the UK would ""step up"" to donate vaccines to poorer countries rather than vaccinating teenagers. Prof Bauld said there were good reasons for vaccinating 12-15 year olds as well over 80% of the total population would need to be vaccinated to achieve population immunity against the virus. But she said there were many countries around the world where vaccination levels were low but cases were ""skyrocketing"". She said that not addressing vaccine roll-out issues in countries with high levels of infection would curtail global travel in the future and lead to a much higher risk of more dangerous variants emerging. A further 695 people tested positive for the virus in Scotland on Monday, which was 5% of the total number of tests carried out. Two council areas - Clackmannanshire and Dundee - currently have infection rates of more than 200 cases per 100,000 people. In addition, six areas which are currently in level one have a rate above 50 cases per 100,000, which has previously been the threshold for level three restrictions. These included Angus, where the rate is above 150 per 100,000. The number of people in hospital with the virus across Scotland now stands at 121 - one fewer than yesterday - while the number of patients in intensive care units remains at 12. There have been no deaths registered in the past 24 hours of people who had recently tested positive for Covid. Ahead of Ms Sturgeon's statement, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf was questioned over the controversial plans for a fan zone in Glasgow Green during the European Championships. Mr Yousaf said he understood the concerns, but that it was an attempt to cater ""in as safe a way as possible"" for fans who wanted to watch the matches. He said it was a ""low risk event"" which would be monitored on an ongoing basis, adding: ""Any changes considered necessary will be made, up to and including withdrawing permission, should significant concerns arise."" Public health officials in England have warned thatfootball fan zones for the European championships could become super spreader events, but the Scottish government seems content to press ahead. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf told parliament that the Glasgow zone would be outdoors and highly regulated. He dismissed calls for mandatory testing, highlighting concerns about digital exclusion, but revealed that Glasgow city council would be contacting ticket holders to encourage them to get a lateral flow test before attending. This is in contrast to the cautious approach ministers have adopted with soft play areas. The sector's been demonstrating outside Holyroodto highlight what is sees as an anomaly- that trampoline parks and bowling alleys can open in level two, but soft plays cannot. Ministers make the point that good leadership can involve making unpopular decisions. They may yet need to disappoint football fans. Mr Yousaf acknowledged that the zone will be monitored throughout, and the plug could be pulled if problems are perceived. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Tax details of US super-rich allegedly leaked,"The website says it has seen the tax returns of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet and Elon Musk Details claiming to reveal how little income tax US billionaires pay have been leaked to a news website. ProPublica says it has seen the tax returns of some of the world's richest people, including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett. The website alleges Amazon's Mr Bezos paid no tax in 2007 and 2011, while Tesla's Mr Musk paid nothing in 2018. A White House spokeswoman called the leak ""illegal"", and the FBI and tax authorities are investigating. ProPublica said it was analysing,externalwhat it called a ""vast trove of Internal Revenue Service data"" on the taxes of the billionaires, and would release further details over coming weeks. While the BBC has not been able to confirm the claims, the alleged leak comes at a time of growing debate about the amount of tax paid by the wealthy and widening inequality. This video can not be played G7 global tax 'levels the playing field' ProPublica said the richest 25 Americans pay less in tax - an average of 15.8% of adjusted gross income - than most mainstream US workers. Jesse Eisinger, senior reporter and editor at ProPublica, told the Today Programme: ""We were pretty astonished that you could get [tax] down to zero if you were a multi-billionaire. Actually paying zero in tax really floored us. Ultra-wealthy people can sidestep the system in an entirely legal way."" ""They have enormous ability to find deductions, find credits and exploit loopholes in the system,"" he said. So while the value of their wealth grows enormously through their ownership of shares in their company, that's not recorded as income. But there's more than that, he said: ""They also take aggressive tax deductions, often because they have borrowed to fund their lifestyle."" He said US billionaires buy an asset, build one or inherit a fortune, and then borrow against their wealth. Because they don't realise any gains or sell any stock, they're not taking any income, which could be taxed. ""They then borrow from a bank at a relatively low interest rate, live off that and can use the interest expenses as deductions on their income,"" he said. The website said that ""using perfectly legal tax strategies, many of the uber-rich are able to shrink their federal tax bills to nothing or close to it"" even as their wealth soared over the past few years. The wealthy, as with many ordinary citizens, are able to reduce their income tax bills via such things as charitable donations and drawing money from investment income rather than wage income. ProPublica, using data collected by Forbes magazine, said the wealth of the 25 richest Americans collectively jumped by $401bn from 2014 to 2018 - but they paid $13.6bn in income tax over those years. Rich nations 'millimetre away' from tech tax deal Joe Biden to 'propose hiking tax on rich' President Joe Biden has vowed to increase tax on the richest Americans as part of a mission to improve equality and raise money for his massive infrastructure investment programme. He wants to raise the top rate of tax, double the tax on what high earners make from investments, and change inheritance tax. However, ProPublica's analysis concluded: ""While some wealthy Americans, such as hedge fund managers, would pay more taxes under the current Biden administration proposals, the vast majority of the top 25 would see little change."" One of the billionaires mentioned, the philanthropist George Soros, is also alleged to have paid minimal tax. His office had not replied to a BBC request for comment, but said in a statement to ProPublica that Mr Soros did not owe tax some years because of losses on investments. The statement also pointed out that he had long supported higher taxes on America's wealthiest people. President Joe Biden has vowed to increase tax on the richest Americans According to reports in the US, Michael Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York whose tax details were among the documents, said the disclosure raised privacy concerns and he would use ""legal means"" to uncover the source of the leak. ProPublica, an investigative website, has written several articles about how budget cuts at the US Internal Revenue Service have hampered its ability to enforce tax rules on the wealthy and large corporations. The news organisation said it received the leaked documents in response to these articles. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that ""any unauthorised disclosure of confidential government information"" is illegal. Treasury Department spokeswoman Lily Adams said in an emailed statement to Reuters that the matter has been referred to the FBI, federal prosecutors and two internal Treasury Department watchdogs, ""all of whom have independent authority to investigate"". US Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Rettig said: ""I can't speak to anything with respect to specific taxpayers. I can confirm that there is an investigation, with respect to the allegations that the source of the information in that article came from the Internal Revenue Service."" What's going wrong here? Let's take a very simplified analysis. If the shares I own in the company I founded are worth Â£1bn at the beginning of the tax year and rise to a value of Â£2bn by the end of the tax year - how much income tax do I owe? Easy - zero. Because while I am twice as rich, I received zero income. On the other hand, if I have zero assets, and I make Â£30,000 in income, I will pay roughly Â£6,000 in income tax and national insurance. That's why the revelations that some of the richest Americans paid little or no income tax may provoke outrage but should not come as a surprise. It's not comparing apples with apples. That's not to say these super rich folks have no money coming in to pay their yacht bills. There is a widespread tactic employed by the rich to borrow cash secured against their vast wealth - which again is not income - it's proceeds of a loan and here's the (perfectly legal) biscuit-taking bit. The interest on that loan can be deducted from any other income to further reduce income tax liability. It sounds egregious - but it's legal. Small wonder that many politicians around the world (Elizabeth Warren in the US and Jeremy Corbyn/John McDonnell in the UK) and academics such as Thomas Piketty have argued that we need a way to tax wealth, not income. The billionaire in our example WILL pay capital gains, currently 20% in UK, the moment he or she sells those shares and realises a profit UNLESS, that is, the profit is sunk into another business, which the tax system as it stands is designed to encourage to promote economic growth and new jobs - jobs that will produce income and therefore tax. That, say its defenders, is capitalism at work - but as with the new global consensus on taxing multinationals - the clamour for tax change is getting louder.

Price rise fear for shoppers 'due to driver shortage',"Hauliers say they are struggling to find lorry drivers Shoppers face higher prices or possibly even empty shelves unless more is done to help end a shortage of lorry drivers, the industry has warned. One leading Welsh haulier said lorry firms were facing a ""perfect storm"", caught between Brexit and Covid. Owens Group in Carmarthenshire said it had lost 50 drivers who were EU citizens, as they did not meet the new criteria for skilled work visas. The UK government said it was working with hauliers on the issue. It said its new immigration system meant employers should invest in the domestic workforce. But Ian Jarman from Llanelli-based Owens Group has called for more action to be taken. ""In the pandemic we were seen as an important industry keeping the deliveries going in the UK,"" he said. ""If it doesn't improve in the coming months there could possibly be delivery shortages."" 'Crying out for help': The businesses hit by Covid How did Eddie Stobart become so famous? Life on the road as a woman HGV driver Wine importer Daniel Lambert said that was already happening. He brings in drinks to his warehouse near Bridgend and supplies pubs, restaurants and supermarkets across the UK. ""It's pretty dire at the moment,"" he said, highlighting one delivery service from Devon and Cornwall that used to deliver overnight but now takes three to four days. Ian Jarman wants HGV drivers to be classed as skilled and eligible for work visas ""What we have seen since Brexit is that transit times have dramatically increased,"" he claimed. ""I'm aware of a major haulier who has 550 containers of wine waiting in Belgium to come to the UK, but they can't because the paperwork isn't right."" He said some continental producers at a vineyard level did not realise they have to complete special paperwork to sell to the UK. ""They haven't left the EU but they still have to deal with Brexit,"" added Mr Lambert. Wine importer Daniel Lambert said he was already experiencing delivery delays The construction industry in Wales said it was also feeling the pinch. Richard Brian, the managing director of building merchants Hughes Forrest in Newport, said it felt like driver shortages meant haulage loads were being ""cherry picked"" - with fewer deliveries and rising prices. He said timber prices had doubled in the past 18 months and they have had to start rationing other products, such as cement. ""If someone is asking for 60 bags, I say I can only give you 40,"" said Mr Brian. The challenge of Covid comes on top of changes brought in by Brexit Since 1 January, EU citizens are included in a new immigration system in the UK, which gives priority to high-skilled roles. HGV drivers are not among the list of eligible skilled occupations,external, which means they are excluded from a skilled work visa. Owens Group has 1,000 vehicles and employs 950 drivers so it is the skills shortage that Mr Jarman is worried about. Standing by one of his new lorries, he said: ""Not everyone can take that out onto the road and manoeuvre into places customers want you to drive it."" His concerns have been echoed by industry body the Road Haulage Association. It said there were about 60,000 driver shortages and that there used to be about 60,000 drivers from the EU. It added about 30,000 HGV driving tests were lost last year because of Covid. Chief executive Richard Burnett has warned the UK government its Covid recovery plans will be hit ""if we do not do something soon"". ""The industry will be unable to maintain the integrated supply chains and cope with artificial spikes caused by hot weather and the easing of lockdown, increasing demand for food and drink into supermarkets, pubs and restaurants and goods into retail outlets,"" he said. The Home Office said its points-based immigration system said employers should ""focus on investing in our domestic workforce, especially those needing to find new employment, rather than relying on labour from abroad."" ""The government is working with the haulage sector to promote jobs, training and a range of other initiatives to get more people into HGV driving,"" added a spokesperson.

Websites begin to work again after major breakage,"A major outage has affected a number of high profile websites including Amazon, Reddit and Twitch. The UK government website - gov.uk - was also down as were the Financial Times, the Guardian and the New York Times. Cloud computing provider Fastly, which underpins a lot of websites, said it was behind the problems. The firm said there had been issues with its global content delivery network (CDN) which it was fixing. In a statement, it said: ""We identified a service configuration that triggered disruption across our POPs (points of presence) globally and have disabled that configuration."" A POP allows content to be sent from globally distributed servers that are close to the end user. ""Our global network is coming back online."" The issues began at around 11:00 BST and lasted for an hour. Other affected websites included CNN and streaming sites Twitch and Hulu. The outage also broke some parts of other services, including Twitter's emojis. Websites were also beginning to be restored, after around an hour of downtime. Fastly runs what is known as an ""edge cloud"", which is designed to speed up loading times for websites, as well as protect them from denial-of-service attacks and help them when traffic is peaking. It currently looks as if the problems were localised, meaning specific locations across Europe and the US were affected. Other websites knocked offline included: PayPal Shopify BBC.com HBO Max Vimeo Similar problems have also affected Amazon Web Services and Cloudflare in the past, two other huge cloud computing firms. Some websites managed to find workarounds to the problem, with tech site The Verge taking to Google Docs to publish its news, but forgetting to limit those who could write on it, leading to a series of amusing edits and tweets. The hashtag ""InternetOutage"" was soon trending on social media as more and more broken websites were discovered. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The disruption has led some to question the wisdom of having so much internet infrastructure in the hands of a few companies. Jake Moore, a cyber-specialist at security firm ESET said: ""This highlights the importance and significance of these vast hosting companies and what they represent."" Adam Smith, a software testing expert with the BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, said outages with content delivery networks ""highlight the growing ecosystem of complex and coupled components that are involved in delivering internet services"". ""Because of this, outages are increasingly hitting multiple sites and services at the same time."" Stephen Gilderdale, senior director at Dell Technologies, said such outages were bound to occur occasionally but that they would be rare and brief. ""Cloud providers build in redundancies for such events to give their users secure access to replicated copies of data. ""In most cases, services are only affected for a short time, and data is easily retrievable. Far from being a cause of concern, it shows the resilience of the network that it can recover so quickly."" It is estimated that even an hour's worth of downtime could cost companies up to $250,000 (Â£176,000), and some lawyers think there could be compensation claims. ""Liability for loss of service will probably be covered by the service level agreement with customers of paid-for cloud services but the agreements will typically not cover all losses sustained,"" said Prof Rebecca Parry of Nottingham Law School.

"Tigray conflict: âWe have no food, we face deathâ","Residents of western Tigray say their crops were looted by militias and they are surviving on the little they hid People in a district of Ethiopia's Tigray region have told the BBC they are on the verge of starvation. ""We don't have anything to eat,"" a man in Qafta Humera said, saying their crops and livestock had been looted during seven months of war. He added that they were being prevented from seeking aid by a militia fighting with government forces. The testimony comes as UN chief AntÃ³nio Guterres has warned that parts of Tigray are on the brink of famine. BBC Africa Live: Updates from the continent Warnings of genocide and famine A conflict erupted in November between the Ethiopian government and Tigrayan rebels, forcing close to two million people from their homes in Tigray, a region that was already food insecure. The Ethiopian authorities insist that order is now being restored across the region and humanitarian access expanded. But last week, the UN warned of a repeat of Ethiopia's devastating 1984 famine and called for an immediate ceasefire in Tigray. Dire and frightening, according to people living in Qafta Humera, an isolated district in the west of Tigray that is close to the borders of Sudan and Eritrea, who were contacted by the BBC Tigrinya service via phone. Cattle have also been lost during the conflict Since November 2020, the western Tigray zone has been occupied by pro-government forces and militias from the neighbouring region of Amhara. ""We are civilians, our crops and cattle have been taken by the armed men,"" one farmer in his 60s said. ""They took from me around 30 cows and oxen - there are some who lost 100-200 head of cattle."" Another farmer, in his 40s, told the BBC: ""We were eating small remains of crops  that we managed to hide, but now we don't have anything. ""Nobody has given us any aid. Almost everyone is on the verge of death - our eyes are affected by the hunger, the situation is perilous. ""Death is knocking on our door. You can see the hunger on the face of each of us."" Residents said they had seen vehicles carrying aid pass by, but no-one had bothered to inquire about their predicament. Because they are trapped. Qafta Humera residents said Amhara militias were preventing them from leaving the area The older farmer said people have been trying to travel elsewhere, like the towns of Shire and Sheraro - about 200km (125 miles) east of their district, to find food and humanitarian supplies. But transport has been difficult to come by and those that have vehicles have been prevented from leaving the area by the militia. ""When we want to go to the place where there is aid all roads are blocked,"" he said, adding that those who have tried to flee on foot have been asked to pay bribes, which they cannot afford. ""Even if we try on foot, if the militias from Amhara found us they force us to pay 4,000-5,000 birr [between $90 and $115] each."" The younger farmer added that people feared being killed if they came face-to-face with the militia in the bush. ""If we try to go to the place where there is aid we will be killed in the forest,"" he said. A local administrator appointed for the area in the wake of the conflict told the BBC that no federal aid was available and only limited assistance was coming through for neighbouring Amhara. Mr Guterres warned the situation would ""only keep getting worse,external"" unless funding was increased and humanitarian access was improved. The government says international humanitarian workers have been allowed into most parts of Tigray. Months after the conflict begun, many critical services have not been fully restored. Dozens of health centres and hospitals have been destroyed or looted. It erupted when Ethiopia's government launched an offensive to oust the region's then ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The party had had a massive fallout with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed over political changes to the country's ethnically based federal system - though the TPLF's capture of federal military bases in Tigray was the catalyst for the invasion. Mr Abiy, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, declared that the conflict was over at the end of November, but fighting has continued. Thousands of people have been killed and about 1.7 million have fled their homes. Tens of thousands have sought refuge in neighbouring Sudan. The conflict has also involved troops from neighbouring Eritrea fighting with the government. All sides have been accused of numerous human rights abuses.

LiveLiveMore help to beat Delta variant in North West England8 minutes ago,"Tougher restrictions have been advised in Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire to combat the Delta variant Residents are being encouraged to get tested twice a week and continue to work from home if possible Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, says people should be cautious and vigilant but should ""carry on living their lives"" There have been a further 6,048 coronavirus cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test Portugal has moved on to the amber list as UK holidaymakers scramble to get home Those returning to the UK from Portugal must now take two tests and quarantine for 10 days Scotland will vaccinate children aged between 12 and 15 as quickly as possible if experts recommend it, says Nicola Sturgeon The number of Covid-related deaths registered in the UK in week ending 28 May was 106 - nine fewer than the previous week People in England aged 25-29 can book a Covid vaccine from today Some over-25s in England report being unable to book their jabs through the NHS website Boris Johnson is expected to consult his cabinet this weekend on whether to push back the June 21 ""Freedom Day"" Unicef is calling for G7 rich countries to send 20% of their vaccines to poorer nations by August Edited by Julian Joyce We're bringing the coronavirus live page to a close for today, but we'll be back with more coverage tomorrow. Today's writers were Alex
Therrien, Jennifer Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Ella
Wills and Joseph Lee. The page was edited by Julian Joyce. We're wrapping up our live coverage in a short while, so here's a look back at some of the main stories of the day: Guidance recommending face masks in classrooms and communal areas was withdrawn on 17 May Unions representing teachers and support staff are calling for face masks to be used again in England's classrooms and vaccines to be given to pupils amid rising school absence due to Covid-19. The National Education Union, Unison, GMB and Unite say in a joint statement that more pupils are ""likely to be off self-isolating and missing out on face to face education"" in the coming weeks. Government figures showed attendance dropped at state schools in England in the week before half-term as more pupils were forced to self-isolate amid rising cases driven by the spread of the Delta variant, first identified in India. The unions say they are deeply concerned, with the health secretary having acknowledged a ""huge proportion"" of the latest cases are children, who ""pass the virus to the local community and face risks from long Covid"". They want the recommendaton for face masks in secondary schools and colleges to be reinstated after the Department for Education withdrew that part of its guidance on 17 May. And they say that pupils should be offered the vaccine, as they are in several other countries, following the approval of the Pfizer jab for children aged 12 and over. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill thanked Northern Ireland's healthcare workers There are no longer any Covid-19 patients in intensive care units in Northern Ireland, according to Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. She said it is the first time in ten months the coronavirus patient count in intensive care has been zero. ""A massive thank you to our healthcare
workers for their efforts - let's keep playing our part and making
progress,""she said on Twitter,external. Northern Ireland recorded another 81 confirmed cases today, but there were no deaths reported. There are currently 15 patients in non-ICU beds. Mobile testing units are being used in Kilkeen, County Down, after a small number of possible cases of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India. England's Euro 2020 group games at Wembley Stadium will be the first sporting event at which vaccine passports will be used in the UK. UK-based ticket holders must show proof of full vaccination, with both doses having been received at least 14 days before the match. Those not fully vaccinated must show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours. England play Croatia in their opening group game on Sunday. Ticket holders for matches taking place at Hampden Park will not be required to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test. Wembley will host a maximum of 22,500 fans - 25% of its capacity - for England's group D fixtures against Croatia, Scotland and Czech Republic. The stadium is also due to host a last-16 tie as well as both semi-finals and the final. Read more. Local public health directors will be able to reintroduce face coverings in communal areas in schools if they want to Measures to try to halt the rise of the variant of coronavirus first identified in India will cover 10% of England's population, as Matt Hancock said there was a ""challenging decision"" to be made over the further lifting of Covid restrictions later this month. The Health Secretary announced that a ""strengthened package of support"" will be provided for Greater Manchester and Lancashire, similar to that seen in Bolton, where case numbers remain high. It means 5.7 million people are now under what mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham stressed was ""not a lockdown"" but ""advice"". The help on offer includes military support with testing and supervised in-school testing, and greater communication with disadvantaged groups will be available. Less than a quarter of pubsare confident they will survive the next three months, official figures show. Only 24% have a high level of faith they will still be in business at the end of the summer, compared with 44% for all types of company. The figures,external, from the Office for National Statistics, are however a big improvement on previous surveys. Last October, the ONS found just six per cent of pubs were highly confident of survival - by February that was just one per cent. As non-essential businesses, pubs and bars have faced prolonged closures since the pandemic began in March 2020 and have had to lay off or furlough tens of thousands of workers. Despite reopening to outdoor drinkers on 12 April, and indoors from 17 May, the ONS said many establishments still reported ""significant profit losses"" last month. The seven-day average for cases is up 60.6%, with the increase in infections partly attributed to the greater transmissibility of the Delta variant. The figures also show there were another 112,941 first doses of the vaccine delivered and 306,068 second doses. It means in total there have now been 40,573,517 first doses - equivalent to 77% of the adult population and 28,227,362 second doses, or 53.6% of the adult population.  There have been a further 6,048 coronavirus cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according toTuesdayâs daily government figures,external. On Monday 5,683 cases and one death was reported. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent The Polish health ministry has announced it is shortening the time period between doses of vaccinations. The second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will now be given after a minimum 21 days, and the Moderna vaccine can be administered after 28 days. Previously, the earliest the second dose could be given was 35 days. The AstraZeneca vaccination interval will remain at 35 days. This week, Poland began giving vaccinations to 12-15 year olds. Previously, the rollout was hampered by a lack of vaccine supplies. Now, the main challenge is persuading people to have the vaccination, ministry officials say. To date, 47% of adult Poles have received one dose and 26.6% are fully vaccinated. Mabel, Ed Sheeran and Stormzy can play Liechtenstein without obtaining expensive work permits On Friday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden announced that a new frontier had been opened for British musicians who want to play live in Europe. Thanks to ""ambitious"" negotiations,he said,external, artists and their crews can now tour without visa requirements in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The deal comes after Brexit meant performers must obtain costly permits to play in many European countries. But touring musicians called Dowden's announcement ""tragic"" and ""a joke"". ""Iceland's population is roughly the same as Wigan. Liechtenstein has a similar number of residents as Wilmslow,""said The Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess,external. ""If it wasn't tragic it would be funny."" Read more  Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst In the last 24 hours, China
has recorded 33 new cases, 19 domestic cases, and 14 imports of Covid. Currently, there are
only two Chinese cities with local lockdown measures in place due to recent
outbreaks: Guangzhou and Foshan; both in southern Guangdong province. A Foshan-based artist
is going viral for his tribute piece to front-line medical workers. The artwork - by Chen Zhijie - looks like one of Chinaâs most famous
paintings, ""Along the River during the Qingming Festival"". But this version features
15 Foshan landmarks and 340 medical workers, who are helping people in the city
to get tested and vaccinated. China has now administered more than 794 million vaccine doses,external. On average, it is delivering around 20 million doses a day, and this number is set to rise, given that the government approved the use of vaccines on 3-17 year olds on Monday. But there are still concerns about how vaccination is being carried out, and whether people could be unfairly discriminated against if they donât get vaccinated. A shopping centre in eastern Shanghai is receiving criticism for denying entry to people who have not been vaccinated. It has since been asked to rectify its practices,the Global Times newspaper reports,external. In April,a town in southern Hainan apologised,external, after reports it âblacklistedâ local people who had not been vaccinated, and prevented them from entering restaurants and supermarkets. Scotland will start to vaccinate children aged between 12 and 15 as quickly as possible if experts recommend it, Nicola Sturgeon says. The Pfizer-BionTech vaccine was approved for use among this age group by the UK's medicine regulator last week. The Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on whether it should begin vaccinating children. Sturgeon says the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated. But she told the Scottish Parliament that if the JCVI recommends the use of the vaccine for children over the age of 12, the country would ""move as quickly as possible to implement the advice"". Andy Burnham said the new guidance was not a lockdown More from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. He said it was ""very important to keep a sense of proportion"" about the new advice. He said: ""This is guidance, it is advice to the public. It is not a lockdown. It is not a ban... this is not about telling people to cancel their plans, it is about asking them to be careful in setting any new ones, to minimise non-essential travel."" He said it was a ""sensible approach given the rise in cases that we've seen"" and that he was grateful to the government and Health Secretary Matt Hancock for the ""joint approach that has been taken to date"". Andy Burnham said he wanted to run a surge vaccination programme over the next three weeks Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has been giving a news conference afterupdated guidance was issued to the area and parts of Lancashireamid a rise in the Delta variant. He called for the government to allow the ""bringing forward"" of supplies of vaccines to the region to allow clinicians to accelerate the delivery of the jab. Burnham said: ""Obviously what we're seeing here is a localised approach to messaging, more localised support on testing and on tracing and isolation. We are also saying that also should apply to vaccination. ""We are not asking for any more vaccine here than our fair share - what we are asking for is the bringing forward of Greater Manchester's supplies so that we can run a surge vaccination programme over the next three weeks."" Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russia is preparing to offer package tours for foreign
nationals willing to get jabbed with one of Russian coronavirus vaccines,
reports say. Tour operators have already drafted their proposals and are
working with the government to âsort out visa support and legal entry issuesâ,
says Andrei Ignatyev, the head of the Russian Tourist Industry Union. Official news agency RIA Novosti quoted him as saying that
two types of vaccine tours were currently being considered. The first one costs between $1,500 and $2,500, excluding
flights. It involves a stay of 21 days in Russia, which is the recommended
interval between the first and second doses of the Sputnik V vaccine.
Sightseeing is included in the tour. The second option costs from $700 and involves two trips of
three days, one for each dose. The tours will mainly be targeted at residents of countries
with relatively low vaccination rates, Ignatyev says.  UK holidaymakers returning from Portugal now have to go straight home and self-isolate. Many couldn't afford the air-fare to get back earlier - like Yasmin Iqbal, 31, from Crawley, West Sussex. She was in Porto for three days, with her mother and nine-month-old daughter, to visit her grandmother, who has cancer. Speaking at Gatwick Airport this morning, she told the PA news agency she was due to return to work after maternity leave and her daughter was due to start nursery but she's had to delay both. ""We looked at flights to come back on Monday, it was Â£500 or more, as soon as you click on it, it just goes. ""It was just no option but to stick with what we were doing."" Ms Iqbal says her trip was booked a long time ago and she criticised the ""ridiculous"" and ""completely confusing"" rules, saying it was ""so difficult"" to get back before the rules changed at 04:00 BST. ""I've now got to sit at home with my daughter for 10 days when I've been in a country that's probably safer than this country,"" she says. Hospitals in Kenya are stepping up preparations for an expected surge in coronavirus infections, increasing bed capacity and stocking up on oxygen supplies,according to the country's Star newspaper,external. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe and other experts have warned of a likely increase in infections. He did not predict when the wave would begin, but Kenya's health research institute has warned that it will begin this month until August, the newspaper says. One city, Kisumu, has seen cases quadruple in the past month. Only a small fraction of Kenyans have been vaccinated and doses are in very short supply. The World Health Organization (WHO) had last week urged African nations to boost critical care capacity in hospitals as vaccination efforts in the continent have slowed down over delays in supply. âWeak observance of preventive measures, increased population movement and interaction as well as well as the arrival of winter in southern Africa have heightened the risk of Covid-19 resurgence in many countries,âthe WHO said in a statement,external. The continent has in the last two weeks recorded a 20% increase in cases compared with the previous fortnight, according to the WHO. Boris Johnson has told members of his Cabinet that the data needs to continue to be scrutinised ahead of any decision on lifting Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The PM told ministers that ""while the relationship between cases and hospitalisations has changed, we must continue to look at the data carefully ahead of making a decision on Step 4"". Some pubs and restaurant owners in England says their efforts to make up for lost time and money during lockdown are being hampered by booked-in customers not turning up. Becky King, general manager of the Anchor Inn in Nayland, Suffolk, says she had about 100 no-shows last weekend. The 33-year-old says the pub is now thinking about taking deposits, although they ""really don't want to"". ""We are casual dining and we don't want to put that in place, but to protect ourselves and the business, that's something we may have to do,"" she says. What are the Covid rules for restaurants and pubs?Read more here. Long-established Suffolk restaurateur Ruth Watson - former star of Channel 5's The Hotel Inspector - says her Italian restaurant Watson and Walpole in Framlingham has been plagued by no-shows. They have started to take card details for all bookings and a deposit of Â£25 for all Friday and Saturday dinner reservations and Sunday lunch. ""I don't know why people don't take it seriously. If you booked theatre tickets or an airline ticket, you'd get charged,"" she says. You can read about how other business owners are coping with no showshere. Â© 2025 BBC.

Despite reopening to outdoor drinkers on 12 April, and indoors from 17 May, the ONS said many establishments still reported ""significant profit losses"" last month. On Monday, the government was told hospitality, retail and leisure firms are also facing huge levels of debt as the economy reopens. Kate Nicholls, the boss of Hospitality UK, warned of ""long Covid for the economy, if you're not very careful"". Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, other trade bodies said government support had not been adequate during the pandemic and the industry had amassed Â£2.5bn of rent debt. It has also built up another Â£6bn worth of government debt accrued through schemes such as the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). The ONS report, titled ""The Economies Of Ale"", also revealed that furlough rates are still significantly higher than average in the pub sector. At the peak in the November 2020 lockdown, 91% of all pub and bar staff were on furlough. That stood at 55% in early May 2021, compared with around 8% of the UK's wider workforce. Furlough support is set to be reduced from next month with further cuts until it stops at the end of September.

"Websites begin to work again after major breakageCloud computing provider Fastly, which was behind the problems, said it was implementing a fix.TechnologyComments","A major outage has affected a number of high profile websites including Amazon, Reddit and Twitch. The UK government website - gov.uk - was also down as were the Financial Times, the Guardian and the New York Times. Cloud computing provider Fastly, which underpins a lot of websites, said it was behind the problems. The firm said there had been issues with its global content delivery network (CDN) which it was fixing. In a statement, it said: ""We identified a service configuration that triggered disruption across our POPs (points of presence) globally and have disabled that configuration."" A POP allows content to be sent from globally distributed servers that are close to the end user. ""Our global network is coming back online."" The issues began at around 11:00 BST and lasted for an hour. Other affected websites included CNN and streaming sites Twitch and Hulu. The outage also broke some parts of other services, including Twitter's emojis. Websites were also beginning to be restored, after around an hour of downtime. Fastly runs what is known as an ""edge cloud"", which is designed to speed up loading times for websites, as well as protect them from denial-of-service attacks and help them when traffic is peaking. It currently looks as if the problems were localised, meaning specific locations across Europe and the US were affected. Other websites knocked offline included: PayPal Shopify BBC.com HBO Max Vimeo Similar problems have also affected Amazon Web Services and Cloudflare in the past, two other huge cloud computing firms. Some websites managed to find workarounds to the problem, with tech site The Verge taking to Google Docs to publish its news, but forgetting to limit those who could write on it, leading to a series of amusing edits and tweets. The hashtag ""InternetOutage"" was soon trending on social media as more and more broken websites were discovered. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Wills and Joseph Lee. The page was edited by Julian Joyce. We're wrapping up our live coverage in a short while, so here's a look back at some of the main stories of the day: Guidance recommending face masks in classrooms and communal areas was withdrawn on 17 May Unions representing teachers and support staff are calling for face masks to be used again in England's classrooms and vaccines to be given to pupils amid rising school absence due to Covid-19. The National Education Union, Unison, GMB and Unite say in a joint statement that more pupils are ""likely to be off self-isolating and missing out on face to face education"" in the coming weeks. Government figures showed attendance dropped at state schools in England in the week before half-term as more pupils were forced to self-isolate amid rising cases driven by the spread of the Delta variant, first identified in India. The unions say they are deeply concerned, with the health secretary having acknowledged a ""huge proportion"" of the latest cases are children, who ""pass the virus to the local community and face risks from long Covid"". They want the recommendaton for face masks in secondary schools and colleges to be reinstated after the Department for Education withdrew that part of its guidance on 17 May. And they say that pupils should be offered the vaccine, as they are in several other countries, following the approval of the Pfizer jab for children aged 12 and over. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill thanked Northern Ireland's healthcare workers There are no longer any Covid-19 patients in intensive care units in Northern Ireland, according to Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. She said it is the first time in ten months the coronavirus patient count in intensive care has been zero. ""A massive thank you to our healthcare
workers for their efforts - let's keep playing our part and making
progress,""she said on Twitter,external. Northern Ireland recorded another 81 confirmed cases today, but there were no deaths reported. There are currently 15 patients in non-ICU beds. Mobile testing units are being used in Kilkeen, County Down, after a small number of possible cases of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India. England's Euro 2020 group games at Wembley Stadium will be the first sporting event at which vaccine passports will be used in the UK. UK-based ticket holders must show proof of full vaccination, with both doses having been received at least 14 days before the match. Those not fully vaccinated must show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours. England play Croatia in their opening group game on Sunday. Ticket holders for matches taking place at Hampden Park will not be required to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test. Wembley will host a maximum of 22,500 fans - 25% of its capacity - for England's group D fixtures against Croatia, Scotland and Czech Republic. The stadium is also due to host a last-16 tie as well as both semi-finals and the final. Read more. Local public health directors will be able to reintroduce face coverings in communal areas in schools if they want to Measures to try to halt the rise of the variant of coronavirus first identified in India will cover 10% of England's population, as Matt Hancock said there was a ""challenging decision"" to be made over the further lifting of Covid restrictions later this month. The Health Secretary announced that a ""strengthened package of support"" will be provided for Greater Manchester and Lancashire, similar to that seen in Bolton, where case numbers remain high. It means 5.7 million people are now under what mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham stressed was ""not a lockdown"" but ""advice"". The help on offer includes military support with testing and supervised in-school testing, and greater communication with disadvantaged groups will be available. Less than a quarter of pubsare confident they will survive the next three months, official figures show. Only 24% have a high level of faith they will still be in business at the end of the summer, compared with 44% for all types of company. The figures,external, from the Office for National Statistics, are however a big improvement on previous surveys. Last October, the ONS found just six per cent of pubs were highly confident of survival - by February that was just one per cent. As non-essential businesses, pubs and bars have faced prolonged closures since the pandemic began in March 2020 and have had to lay off or furlough tens of thousands of workers. Despite reopening to outdoor drinkers on 12 April, and indoors from 17 May, the ONS said many establishments still reported ""significant profit losses"" last month. The seven-day average for cases is up 60.6%, with the increase in infections partly attributed to the greater transmissibility of the Delta variant. The figures also show there were another 112,941 first doses of the vaccine delivered and 306,068 second doses. It means in total there have now been 40,573,517 first doses - equivalent to 77% of the adult population and 28,227,362 second doses, or 53.6% of the adult population.  There have been a further 6,048 coronavirus cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according toTuesdayâs daily government figures,external. On Monday 5,683 cases and one death was reported. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent The Polish health ministry has announced it is shortening the time period between doses of vaccinations. The second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will now be given after a minimum 21 days, and the Moderna vaccine can be administered after 28 days. Previously, the earliest the second dose could be given was 35 days. The AstraZeneca vaccination interval will remain at 35 days. This week, Poland began giving vaccinations to 12-15 year olds. Previously, the rollout was hampered by a lack of vaccine supplies. Now, the main challenge is persuading people to have the vaccination, ministry officials say. To date, 47% of adult Poles have received one dose and 26.6% are fully vaccinated. Mabel, Ed Sheeran and Stormzy can play Liechtenstein without obtaining expensive work permits On Friday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden announced that a new frontier had been opened for British musicians who want to play live in Europe. Thanks to ""ambitious"" negotiations,he said,external, artists and their crews can now tour without visa requirements in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The deal comes after Brexit meant performers must obtain costly permits to play in many European countries. But touring musicians called Dowden's announcement ""tragic"" and ""a joke"".

has recorded 33 new cases, 19 domestic cases, and 14 imports of Covid. Currently, there are
only two Chinese cities with local lockdown measures in place due to recent
outbreaks: Guangzhou and Foshan; both in southern Guangdong province. A Foshan-based artist
is going viral for his tribute piece to front-line medical workers. The artwork - by Chen Zhijie - looks like one of Chinaâs most famous
paintings, ""Along the River during the Qingming Festival"". But this version features
15 Foshan landmarks and 340 medical workers, who are helping people in the city
to get tested and vaccinated. China has now administered more than 794 million vaccine doses,external. On average, it is delivering around 20 million doses a day, and this number is set to rise, given that the government approved the use of vaccines on 3-17 year olds on Monday. But there are still concerns about how vaccination is being carried out, and whether people could be unfairly discriminated against if they donât get vaccinated. A shopping centre in eastern Shanghai is receiving criticism for denying entry to people who have not been vaccinated. It has since been asked to rectify its practices,the Global Times newspaper reports,external. In April,a town in southern Hainan apologised,external, after reports it âblacklistedâ local people who had not been vaccinated, and prevented them from entering restaurants and supermarkets. Scotland will start to vaccinate children aged between 12 and 15 as quickly as possible if experts recommend it, Nicola Sturgeon says. The Pfizer-BionTech vaccine was approved for use among this age group by the UK's medicine regulator last week. The Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on whether it should begin vaccinating children. Sturgeon says the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated. But she told the Scottish Parliament that if the JCVI recommends the use of the vaccine for children over the age of 12, the country would ""move as quickly as possible to implement the advice"". Andy Burnham said the new guidance was not a lockdown More from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. He said it was ""very important to keep a sense of proportion"" about the new advice. He said: ""This is guidance, it is advice to the public. It is not a lockdown. It is not a ban... this is not about telling people to cancel their plans, it is about asking them to be careful in setting any new ones, to minimise non-essential travel."" He said it was a ""sensible approach given the rise in cases that we've seen"" and that he was grateful to the government and Health Secretary Matt Hancock for the ""joint approach that has been taken to date"". Andy Burnham said he wanted to run a surge vaccination programme over the next three weeks Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has been giving a news conference afterupdated guidance was issued to the area and parts of Lancashireamid a rise in the Delta variant. He called for the government to allow the ""bringing forward"" of supplies of vaccines to the region to allow clinicians to accelerate the delivery of the jab. Burnham said: ""Obviously what we're seeing here is a localised approach to messaging, more localised support on testing and on tracing and isolation. We are also saying that also should apply to vaccination. ""We are not asking for any more vaccine here than our fair share - what we are asking for is the bringing forward of Greater Manchester's supplies so that we can run a surge vaccination programme over the next three weeks."" Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russia is preparing to offer package tours for foreign
nationals willing to get jabbed with one of Russian coronavirus vaccines,
reports say. Tour operators have already drafted their proposals and are
working with the government to âsort out visa support and legal entry issuesâ,
says Andrei Ignatyev, the head of the Russian Tourist Industry Union. Official news agency RIA Novosti quoted him as saying that
two types of vaccine tours were currently being considered. The first one costs between $1,500 and $2,500, excluding
flights. It involves a stay of 21 days in Russia, which is the recommended
interval between the first and second doses of the Sputnik V vaccine.
Sightseeing is included in the tour. The second option costs from $700 and involves two trips of
three days, one for each dose. The tours will mainly be targeted at residents of countries
with relatively low vaccination rates, Ignatyev says.  UK holidaymakers returning from Portugal now have to go straight home and self-isolate. Many couldn't afford the air-fare to get back earlier - like Yasmin Iqbal, 31, from Crawley, West Sussex. She was in Porto for three days, with her mother and nine-month-old daughter, to visit her grandmother, who has cancer. Speaking at Gatwick Airport this morning, she told the PA news agency she was due to return to work after maternity leave and her daughter was due to start nursery but she's had to delay both. ""We looked at flights to come back on Monday, it was Â£500 or more, as soon as you click on it, it just goes. ""It was just no option but to stick with what we were doing."" Ms Iqbal says her trip was booked a long time ago and she criticised the ""ridiculous"" and ""completely confusing"" rules, saying it was ""so difficult"" to get back before the rules changed at 04:00 BST. ""I've now got to sit at home with my daughter for 10 days when I've been in a country that's probably safer than this country,"" she says. Hospitals in Kenya are stepping up preparations for an expected surge in coronavirus infections, increasing bed capacity and stocking up on oxygen supplies,according to the country's Star newspaper,external. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe and other experts have warned of a likely increase in infections. He did not predict when the wave would begin, but Kenya's health research institute has warned that it will begin this month until August, the newspaper says. One city, Kisumu, has seen cases quadruple in the past month. Only a small fraction of Kenyans have been vaccinated and doses are in very short supply. The World Health Organization (WHO) had last week urged African nations to boost critical care capacity in hospitals as vaccination efforts in the continent have slowed down over delays in supply. âWeak observance of preventive measures, increased population movement and interaction as well as well as the arrival of winter in southern Africa have heightened the risk of Covid-19 resurgence in many countries,âthe WHO said in a statement,external. The continent has in the last two weeks recorded a 20% increase in cases compared with the previous fortnight, according to the WHO. Boris Johnson has told members of his Cabinet that the data needs to continue to be scrutinised ahead of any decision on lifting Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The PM told ministers that ""while the relationship between cases and hospitalisations has changed, we must continue to look at the data carefully ahead of making a decision on Step 4"". Some pubs and restaurant owners in England says their efforts to make up for lost time and money during lockdown are being hampered by booked-in customers not turning up. Becky King, general manager of the Anchor Inn in Nayland, Suffolk, says she had about 100 no-shows last weekend. The 33-year-old says the pub is now thinking about taking deposits, although they ""really don't want to"". ""We are casual dining and we don't want to put that in place, but to protect ourselves and the business, that's something we may have to do,"" she says.

When Mrs Foster resigns as first minister, Sinn FÃ©in deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill is automatically removed from her post as well - as the joint office can only function if both positions are filled. Both parties will then need to re-nominate their respective first and deputy first ministers within seven days. If one of the parties declines to re-nominate, then a functioning executive could not be formed and a snap election would become likely.  First Minister: Paul Givan Agriculture: Edwin Poots Education: Michelle McIlveen Economy: Paul Frew Junior minister: Gary Middleton New DUP leader Edwin Poots (right) remains the agriculture minister, while Paul Givan is his nomination to replace Arlene Foster as NI's new first minister Why are these Stormont committee positions important to assembly members? Some are more important than others, says BBC News NI political editor Enda McClaffety. ""Vice chairs don't amount to anything - they don't get any [extra] money,"" he explains. ""If you're a chair of a committee, you get Â£12,000 extra into your pay packet, which is a nice lift obviously if you're a politician, and that brings you up to about Â£63,000 a year. ""It's probably worth reflecting as well that you get more money as a chair of a committee than you do as a junior minister, because all they pick up is an extra Â£6,000 in their position. ""So you can see the attractiveness of some people basically saying 'well I might like to stay as chair of a committee as opposed to going into the executive and taking up a junior minister's position'."" Btw the first minister earns Â£123,000 a year. Edwin Poots started his reshuffle by announcing appointments to a number of committees and here's one we didn't have time to mention earlier... There's no change in the public accounts committee as William Humphrey stays as chairman. It was difficult to keep up during the flurry of announcements, so just in case you missed it - Gary Middleton is to become a junior minister in the excutive office. He takes over the role held by Gordon Lyons. Political commentator Alex Kane wonders where those who oppose Poots might find a new home? Allow Twitter content?

Scotland would 'move quickly' to vaccinate childrenThe country will vaccinate children aged between 12 and 15 as quickly as possible if experts recommend it.Scotland politicsComments,"More than half of Scotland's adult population has had both doses of a Covid vaccine Scotland will start to vaccinate children aged between 12 and 15 as quickly as possible if experts recommend it, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The Pfizer-BionTech vaccine was approved for use among the age group by the UK's medicine regulator last week. The Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization on whether it should begin vaccinating children. Ms Sturgeon said the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated. But she told the Scottish Parliament that if the JCVI recommends the use of the vaccine for children over the age of 12, the country would ""move as quickly as possible to implement the advice"". UK approves Pfizer jab for 12 to 15-year-olds Should all children get a Covid vaccine? The first minister added: ""It is vital that we rely on expert advice in all of our vaccination decisions. ""However, vaccination may well be an important way of giving children greater protection, minimising any further disruption to schooling, and further reducing community transmission of the virus."" Ms Sturgeon also insisted that the decision was not simply a choice between ""vaccinating children and playing our part in global vaccination"". More than half of Scotland's adult population has now had both doses of a Covid vaccine - with the total number standing at 2,282,203. Pfizer has said its vaccine trials had shown 100% efficacy and a strong immune response in children between 12 and 15, and that the vaccine was safe with no unusual side-effects. Its use among children in the UK was approved by the MHRA on Friday of last week, with the regulator saying it had carried out a ""rigorous review"" which showed the vaccine was safe and effective in adolescents. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) must now advise governments on whether this age group should be vaccinated as part of the UK rollout. The UK government has also said it will be guided by expert advise from the JCVI, and that any decision would be ""clinically based"". And it has said that the UK has enough supplies to vaccinate children if the move was recommended by the JCVI. But some experts have questioned whether it is morally right to vaccinate children - who have an extremely low risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from Covid - in wealthy countries such as the UK rather than donating the extra doses to the rest of the world. What do you think about vaccinating teenagers? Would you like to see young people aged 12-15 vaccinated before the beginning of the next school term?  Please share your stories and pictures with us.

Some experts want extra vaccine doses to be donated to less wealthy countries rather than used to immunise teenagers The World Health Organization has already called on wealthy countries to postpone any plans to immunise children. And Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland at the weekend that she hoped the UK would ""step up"" to donate vaccines to poorer countries rather than vaccinating teenagers. Prof Bauld said there were good reasons for vaccinating 12-15 year olds as well over 80% of the total population would need to be vaccinated to achieve population immunity against the virus. But she said there were many countries around the world where vaccination levels were low but cases were ""skyrocketing"". She said that not addressing vaccine roll-out issues in countries with high levels of infection would curtail global travel in the future and lead to a much higher risk of more dangerous variants emerging. A further 695 people tested positive for the virus in Scotland on Monday, which was 5% of the total number of tests carried out. Two council areas - Clackmannanshire and Dundee - currently have infection rates of more than 200 cases per 100,000 people. In addition, six areas which are currently in level one have a rate above 50 cases per 100,000, which has previously been the threshold for level three restrictions. These included Angus, where the rate is above 150 per 100,000. The number of people in hospital with the virus across Scotland now stands at 121 - one fewer than yesterday - while the number of patients in intensive care units remains at 12. There have been no deaths registered in the past 24 hours of people who had recently tested positive for Covid. Ahead of Ms Sturgeon's statement, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf was questioned over the controversial plans for a fan zone in Glasgow Green during the European Championships. Mr Yousaf said he understood the concerns, but that it was an attempt to cater ""in as safe a way as possible"" for fans who wanted to watch the matches. He said it was a ""low risk event"" which would be monitored on an ongoing basis, adding: ""Any changes considered necessary will be made, up to and including withdrawing permission, should significant concerns arise."" Public health officials in England have warned thatfootball fan zones for the European championships could become super spreader events, but the Scottish government seems content to press ahead. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf told parliament that the Glasgow zone would be outdoors and highly regulated. He dismissed calls for mandatory testing, highlighting concerns about digital exclusion, but revealed that Glasgow city council would be contacting ticket holders to encourage them to get a lateral flow test before attending. This is in contrast to the cautious approach ministers have adopted with soft play areas. The sector's been demonstrating outside Holyroodto highlight what is sees as an anomaly- that trampoline parks and bowling alleys can open in level two, but soft plays cannot. Ministers make the point that good leadership can involve making unpopular decisions. They may yet need to disappoint football fans. Mr Yousaf acknowledged that the zone will be monitored throughout, and the plug could be pulled if problems are perceived. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

""If you're a chair of a committee, you get Â£12,000 extra into your pay packet, which is a nice lift obviously if you're a politician, and that brings you up to about Â£63,000 a year. ""It's probably worth reflecting as well that you get more money as a chair of a committee than you do as a junior minister, because all they pick up is an extra Â£6,000 in their position. ""So you can see the attractiveness of some people basically saying 'well I might like to stay as chair of a committee as opposed to going into the executive and taking up a junior minister's position'."" Btw the first minister earns Â£123,000 a year. Edwin Poots started his reshuffle by announcing appointments to a number of committees and here's one we didn't have time to mention earlier... There's no change in the public accounts committee as William Humphrey stays as chairman. It was difficult to keep up during the flurry of announcements, so just in case you missed it - Gary Middleton is to become a junior minister in the excutive office. He takes over the role held by Gordon Lyons. Political commentator Alex Kane wonders where those who oppose Poots might find a new home? Allow Twitter content?

Gareth GordonBBC News NI Political Correspondent Paul Givan has already boldly gone where no DUP first minister has ever gone before - he's been to a Sinn FÃ©in Ard Fheis (annual conference). The year was 2008. His friend, Edwin Poots, had just been sacked as minister for culture arts and leisure, and so Mr Givan lost his job as special adviser. He went to work for a trade organisation and ended up on one of the many stands at Sinn FÃ©in's annual conference at the RDS in Dublin. It was an unlikely place for a rising politician from the DUP's right wing to find himself. Read morehere. BBC News NI's political editor Enda McClafferty tweets: Allow Twitter content?

New NHS patient data store delayed to September,"The creation of a central NHS digital database from GP records in England will be delayed by two months, the government has announced. The system was due to begin on 1 July, but the date has now been pushed back to 1 September. The NHS had been calling for a delay to allow patients more time to learn about the system. The British Medical Association and the Royal College of GPs had also expressed concern. Doctors urge delay to England GP data scrape Patient data transfer still set to start in July Speaking in the House of Commons, Health Minister Jo Churchill said the GP data programme would ""save lives"". However, she said the government was ""absolutely determined to take people with us on this journey"" and had therefore decided to push the implementation date back to the beginning of September. She said ministers would use the extra time to ""talk to doctors, patients and charities to strengthen the plan... and ensure data is accessed securely"". ""Patients own their own data,"" she added. Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris welcomed the delay but argued that the ""current plans to take data from GPs, assemble it in one place and sell it to unknown commercial interests for purposes unknown has no legitimacy."" He criticised the government for a lack of ""public engagement"" and said the plans had been ""snuck out under the cover of darkness"". NHS Digital said that the data would only be accessible to organisations ""which will legitimately use the data for healthcare planning and research purposes, and they will only get the specific data that is required"". It added that the information would never be used for insurance or marketing purposes, promoting or selling products or services, market research and advertising and any requests for data would be ""scrutinised by NHS Digital against stringent criteria"". GP data has been used to identify which groups should get the Covid vaccine first Under the proposed system - the General Practice Data for Planning and Research - information from surgeries in England will be added to an NHS Digital database. The includes data from records created up to 10 years ago. The collected data includes sex, ethnicity, sexual orientation, diagnoses, medications and information about a patients' physical, mental and sexual health. It does not cover names and addresses - except for a postcode which is replaced by a unique code generated by de-identification software. Simon Bolton, head of NHS Digital, said all collected data would be protected or pseudonymised before it leaves the GP ""to ensure patients cannot be directly identified"". He also said patients would be able to opt out of sharing their data. Patientscan prevent their new data being shared at anytime,,externalbut would need to opt out before 1 September to stop past data being transferred to the new system. During the pandemic, patient data was used to assess how effective certain treatments were and to identify which groups were most at risk from Covid. GP data has also been used to identify disparities in care for individuals with learning disabilities and to improve services for diabetics. Earlier this week, the British Medical Association and Royal College of General Practitioners expressed their concerns ""about the lack of communication with the public"". In a joint letter,,externalthey urged NHS Digital to ""take immediate action to run a public information campaign"". Welcoming the delay, Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said ""appropriate use"" of data was important for improving healthcare but added that any system should be ""built around trust"". He said the NHS should communicate with ""every patientâ¦ clearly articulating the benefits and risks of data sharing so that patients can make a genuinely informed decision about whether they are happy for their data to be shared - and if they are not, how they can opt out"". Analysis by Chris Vallance, BBC Technology reporter It was evident last week that NHS Digital wanted a delay to a programme that proposes to transfer information from the records of every GP patient in England to a central NHS database. Doctors representatives were clear: patients needed more time to learn about the programme to extract data and the job of informing them couldn't be left to GPs busy with the pandemic and its aftermath. Now the government have conceded that a delay is necessary after maintaining as late as Friday that none was needed. It's news that will be greeted with a strong sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu with those who remember the cancelledCare.data programme, a previous effort to collect centrally GP record data. It foundered in part because of a lack of awareness among patients, in spite of a national information campaign. Today the Information Commissioners Office told me ""the success of any project will rely on people trusting and having confidence in how their personal data will be used"". The NHS will need to use the time this delay affords to rebuild just that: trust. Speaking to the BBC's Politics Live programme, Caroline Cake, chief executive of Health Data Research UK, said using data during the pandemic had helped find new Covid treatments and provide information on the impact of vaccines. She said it was essential that all groups of society are ""represented"" within the new system.

People moving home drive mortgage borrowing surge,"Home movers were responsible for a record proportion of mortgage borrowing in the first three months of the year as they dominated demand for property. Some 42% of total mortgage lending went to this group - the highest level since comparable records began in 2007, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said.

'Five-day office week will become the norm again',"Jessica Bowles said firms wanted more flexible spaces and shorter leases, but most still wanted a five-day office The five-day office week could become the norm again within two years, the Centre for Cities think tank has told the BBC. A blend of home and office work is expected to be popular while the UK recovers from the pandemic. But some analysts then anticipate a shift back to pre-Covid working patterns for many. Currently, people who can work from home are still advised to do so. However, that is likely to change if the government ends all social distancing restrictions on 21 June. ""I expect we will see three or four days a week in the office as the UK recovers,"" Paul Swinney, director of policy and research at Centre for Cities, told Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme. ""Over the longer term, I'm quite hopeful that we will see people return five days a week. ""The reason for that is, one of the benefits of being in the office is having interactions with other people, coming up with new ideas and sharing information."" He said people could not do this by scheduling a three o'clock meeting on a Tuesday - it had to happen randomly. ""If you're in the office on a Monday but someone else is in the office on a Wednesday, then you're starting to miss out. Or, if your colleague is in the office and having a meeting with your boss and you're not there, all of a sudden that changes the dynamic again."" Can I ask to keep working from home? Apple employees rally against office working plan No full-time return to the office for over a million Office for National Statistics data published in May,externalrevealed most people did not work from home in 2020, however the proportion of workers who did more than doubled during the pandemic. That hit the office property market while prompting lots of discussion about the future of the workplace. Demand for more city centre office space does now appear to be rising - albeit from a very low point. Figures from Savills estate agency show office take-up by square footage in the UK's six biggest regional cities has gone up significantly since the second quarter of 2020, the start of the pandemic. The estate agency said it was also seeing ""record rents"" for some top tier office space in Greater London and regional city areas. Sectors signing some of the biggest regional office deals were public services, education and health. Office providers have struggled during the pandemic. On Monday, the shared office firm IWGwarned of a sharp profits drop. Nevertheless, the company said it was seeing ""unprecedented demand"" for its flexible office services as many more businesses adopted hybrid working. Jessica Bowles, director of strategy at commercial property developer Bruntwood, which operates in Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool, told the BBC her firm has also seen a lot of demand for flexible and serviced office space on short leases. ""We've had really strong take-up. People want flexible terms. ""What's interesting is that it's corporates wanting to do that as well as small businesses and SMEs."" Figures show a gradual rise in office space take-up in major UK cities, including Manchester But hybrid working does not mean flexible office space leases are any cheaper as ""flexibility is priced in"". Most firms also want to keep a five-day office, she said. ""Most businesses that have got space with us now want to maintain having an office, and they don't see that they could give up the office for a certain number of days a week - they just want to use the space differently. ""That means more collaborative space, fewer banks of desks, places where people can come together and create and innovate."" She added that while hybrid working was growing in popularity before Covid-19 struck, the working pattern could be ""challenging"" for firms if some staff were at home, while some were in the office. James Morris and his sister Naomi started their business before the pandemic to serve Birmingham commuters ""I think from a personal, and a business level, we'll see more people seeing the value in coming together to collaborate. But Fridays are always pretty quiet in the office and I don't expect that to change."" Businesses reliant on office worker trade are hopeful their fortunes will soon improve. In Birmingham, cafe owners and siblings James and Naomi Morris are looking forward to the arrival of more commuters to the city centre. They set up their business, Morridge, in 2019 specifically to target city workers. James told the BBC he'd started to see more commuters coming into the cafe again. ""Over the past few weeks, office workers have slowly been returning. People are starting to work in the cafe - a lady came in for breakfast the other day and took a couple of work calls. ""Wednesdays and Thursdays are our busiest days."" He said he is expecting more workers to return to the city centre later in the month if the remaining Covid restrictions are lifted on 21 June, and said his customers had told him they expected more of their colleagues to return in September. ""It's looking good. I think it will all come back around."" But the prospect of a post-Covid mass return to the office - on even a hybrid basis - will not necessarily be universally welcomed by employees. Staff at Applereportedly launched a campaign to push back againstboss Tim Cook's plans for workers to be in the office at least three days a week by September.

"Step forward for plan to extend pub opening timesThe assembly will debate legislation to modernise current licensing laws, which are 25 years old.Northern IrelandComments","Proposals to extend opening times for pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland have taken another step towards becoming law. It was a late night at Stormont as MLAs stayed to the early hours of Wednesdaydebating legislation to modernise NI's 25-year-old licensing laws,external. The bill aims to allow pubs and clubs to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend. It also proposes removing restrictions around Easter drinking. It is thought the legislation could pass its final stage in the assembly by the end of the month, with most of the changes then becoming law from October. The proposals have been a very long time in the making, with Stormont first putting forward changes eight years ago. A previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016,but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, who share power together at Stormont. As the lengthy debate began on Tuesday evening, Speaker Alex Maskey said it may run until the ""early hours of the morning and maybe some of us will be driven to drink afterwards"". Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey described the proposals as a ""great move which brings our drinking laws into the 21st Century"". After debating 63 amendments, the Licensing and Registration of Clubs Bill passed its consideration stage in the early hours of the morning. Some of assembly members who took part in the debate, including Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong and DUP Chief Whip Joanne Bunting, tweeted photos as they left work after 03:00 BST.

One amendment from independent unionist MLA Claire Sugden suggested extending the definition of a ""place of public entertainment"" to include cinemas, so they can sell alcohol on their premises. It is understood Ms Hargey has expressed reservations about that proposal. Longer pub opening times 'could cost police Â£7m' Easter 'could be overrun by alcohol' if laws change Alcohol licensing changes 'strike right balance' Her department has instead said it is preparing to carry out a 12-week public consultation on that specific matter over the summer. Ms Hargey told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster that the proposals were ""fundamental changes"" and it was important to consider ""what the consequences of those are"". She said no consultation had been done around cinemas, and ""there are very few places at which a family can go and enjoy entertainment where there is no alcohol sold"". ""I do think that there is a want within the community that that is retained on one hand, that said I am willing to listen as a minister in terms of doing further consultation on this,"" she added. ""I don't think it is good, at this point of laying legislation, of making a change that would be significant like this without doing the due consultation and seeing the impact. ""I want to make sure on the issue of cinemas and looking at that entertainment, which is very family focused, that we do more consultation on that issue."" Ms Sugden had questioned delaying a proposal that she believed was ""inevitable"". She said cinemas in other parts of the UK can already sell alcohol to customers and she hoped MLAs would support her amendment. ""Cinemas have had a really difficult year with the pandemic and anything we can do to support them can only be a good thing,"" she added. Other changes in the bill include the extension in ""drinking-up time"" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends. The law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol. The current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements. Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said that there had been a ""number of false dawns"" in relation to modernising licensing laws and now change was ""tantalisingly close"". Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster wants to see current licensing laws modernised ""We recognise alcohol is a controlled substance and needs to be treated as such, we haven't come asking for 24-hour drinking like England or deregulation, this is about looking at what the customer wants and actually modernise it. ""They are modest but significant in their impact measures, because people do go out later now, they want to go out and socialise. ""We have to be able to provide that (extended hours) particularly with tourists visiting here as well."" Michael McAdam, managing director of Movie House Cinemas, said adults could already sample alcohol if they were watching an event at theatres in Northern Ireland. ""All we are saying at cinema is please give us a chance to be in line, to serve our customers, to give our customers what they want,"" he said. ""That is the choice to make an adult decision if they want to have an alcoholic beverage or not."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An amendment that would require the Northern Ireland Executive to review the ""surrender principle"" in Northern Ireland licensing law was one of those passed at Stormont. The principle means no new licence can ever be granted unless another one is surrendered. Licences for selling alcohol on and off premises are also convertible in court, which means that every supermarket or convenience store seeking to add an off sales needs to acquire a licence from somewhere else. The SDLP's Matthew O'Toole, who proposed the amendment, said that was likely to have contributed to the decline in the number of pubs and made it very difficult for new rural or small town pubs to be created as licences are scarce and expensive assets. He emphasised that any review would have to carefully consider all the impacts - including on existing licensees. He said: ""My amendment simply requires the department to appoint an independent person to review the licensing system, including the surrender principle. ""Critically the amendment makes clear that the reviewer has to have regard to the interests of existing licence holders, by ensuring they consider options for compensation in the event of reform."" Colin Neill said Hospitality Ulster members were ""terrified"" by Mr O'Toole's proposal, saying that bar owners were ""incredibly vulnerable"" following the latest Covid-19 lockdown. Mr O'Toole is also proposing that the department should publish an annual report on the number of pubs and operational licenses by postcode. He added: ""These amendments are not about rushing into reform - they are about getting robust information to plan for reform.""

FBI app lures global criminals into police hands,"This video can not be played Hundreds of people in 18 countries were detained More than 800 suspected criminals have been arrested worldwide after being tricked into using an FBI-run encrypted messaging app, officials say. The operation, jointly conceived by Australia and the FBI, saw devices with the ANOM app secretly distributed among criminals, allowing police to monitor their chats about drug smuggling, money laundering and even murder plots. Officials called it a watershed moment. Targets included drug gangs and people with links to the mafia. Drugs, weapons, luxury vehicles and cash were also seized in the operation, which was conducted across more than a dozen countries. This included eight tonnes of cocaine, 250 guns and more than $48m (Â£34m) in various worldwide currencies and cryptocurrencies. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the operation had ""struck a heavy blow against organised crime"" around the world. European Union police agency Europol described Operation Trojan Shield/Greenlight as the ""biggest ever law enforcement operation against encrypted communication"". The FBI began operating an encrypted device network called ANOM, and covertly distributed devices with the chat app among the criminal underworld via informants. The idea for the operation came after two other encrypted platforms were taken down by law enforcement agencies, leaving criminal gangs in the market for new secure phones. The devices were initially used by alleged senior crime figures, giving other criminals the confidence to use the platform. The man who accidentally helped FBI spread spy app ""You had to know a criminal to get hold of one of these customised phones. The phones couldn't ring or email. You could only communicate with someone on the same platform,"" the Australian police explained. Items seized in the sting included motorbikes and money Australian fugitive and alleged drug trafficker Hakan Ayik was key to the sting, having unwittingly recommended the app to criminal associates after being given a handset by undercover officers, police said. Dubbed the ""Facebook gangster"" by Australian media outlets, Ayik is seen in social media photographs with large tattoos and a muscular physique. Local outlets say he has been living in Turkey since evading arrest, living a luxury lifestyle with a Dutch wife. Police said he was ""best off handing himself into us"" as soon as possible, as he may be in danger himself, having unwittingly helped the FBI with their sting. In total, some 12,000 encrypted devices were used by around 300 criminal syndicates in more than 100 countries. This is a fascinating example of law enforcement, perhaps growing tired of wrangling with US tech giants over accessing encrypted data and locked devices, taking matters into its own hands. Running a sort of WhatsApp platform for criminals is a bold move, and getting bespoke handsets into the hands of the very law-breakers they were trying to catch, was ambitious, to say the least. Officials reportedly took control of a communications firm called ANOM around three years ago, after a convicted criminal promised them access to it in return for a more lenient sentence. The devices were billed as super-secure and had a very specific target market - organised crime groups. The authorities even took advantage of a current trend in Silicon Valley - they charged a monthly subscription for the product. Officers were able to read millions of messages in ""real time"" describing murder plots, mass drug import plans and other schemes. ""All they talk about is drugs, violence, hits on each other, innocent people who are going to be murdered, a whole range of things,"" said Australian Federal Police commissioner Reece Kershaw. In total, some 9,000 police officers around the world were involved in the sting. Calvin Shivers of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division said the operation had enabled police agencies to ""turn the tables on criminal organisations"", with intelligence gathered preventing murders and a number of other crimes. ""We were actually able to see photographs of hundreds of tons of cocaine that were concealed in shipments of fruit,"" he said. Among the items seized was memorabilia from The Godfather Statements from law enforcement agencies did not name any of those arrested in the sting. In Australia, 224 people were arrested including members of outlaw motorcycle gangs, mafia groups, Asian crime syndicates, and serious and organised crime groups. Police said they also seized three tonnes of drugs and A$45m (Â£25m; $35m) in cash and assets, and acted on 20 ""threats to kill"", potentially saving the lives of a ""significant number of innocent bystanders"". Mr Morrison said the sting, which was called Operation Ironside, was ""a watershed moment in Australian law enforcement history"". New Zealand police said 35 people in the country had been arrested, and about NZ$3.7m (Â£1.9m, $2.7m) of assets seized. ""We believe the termination of these operations will have a significant impact on New Zealand's organised crime scene,"" National Organised Crime Group Director Detective Superintendent Greg Williams said. In the US, the FBI unsealed an indictment against 17 people for distributing the ANOM-enabled devices - eight have so far been arrested, while the rest are on the run. The FBI is expected to present more details later on Tuesday. Europol's deputy executive director Jean-Philippe Lecouffe described the operation as an ""exceptional success"". The agency did not break down the arrests in each country, but local officials said they included 70 people in Sweden and 49 in the Netherlands, according to Reuters news agency. Linda Staaf, the Swedish police's head of intelligence, said the operation had helped to prevent more than 10 planned murders in Sweden. Australian police arrest and confiscate.

LiveLiveDUP announcing ministerial line-up1 minute ago1 minute ago The shake-up after the internal revoltThe shake-up after the internal revolt3 minutes ago Surprise! Surprise!Surprise! Surprise!12 minutes ago Paul Givan to become NI's first ministerPaul Givan to become NI's first minister,"Paul Givan is to become Northern Ireland's next first minister, succeeding Arlene Foster, subject to a re-nomination process Michelle McIlveen is to replace Peter Weir as education minister and Paul Frew is the new economy minister, replacing Diane Dodds DUP leader Edwin Poots started his reshuffle by announcing appointments to a number of committees It comes as the DUP has been left reeling by a number of resignations after the ousting of Arlene Foster Mrs Foster, who was ousted as DUP leader following an internal revolt against her, is expected to resign at the start of next week Chris Andrews and Caroline McClatchey Edwin Poots putting the new First Minister Paul Givan in position Goodbye and thanks for your company. You can keep up-to-date with any further developments and read all the analysishere. Arlene Foster took part in a photocall at Stormont today to celebrate women in politics Arlene Foster is still currently first minister. Paul Givan will take over on Monday from Mrs Foster, who wasousted as Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader in Aprilafter an internal revolt. When Mrs Foster resigns as first minister, Sinn FÃ©in deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill is automatically removed from her post as well - as the joint office can only function if both positions are filled. Both parties will then need to re-nominate their respective first and deputy first ministers within seven days. If one of the parties declines to re-nominate, then a functioning executive could not be formed and a snap election would become likely.  First Minister: Paul Givan Agriculture: Edwin Poots Education: Michelle McIlveen Economy: Paul Frew Junior minister: Gary Middleton New DUP leader Edwin Poots (right) remains the agriculture minister, while Paul Givan is his nomination to replace Arlene Foster as NI's new first minister Why are these Stormont committee positions important to assembly members? Some are more important than others, says BBC News NI political editor Enda McClaffety. ""Vice chairs don't amount to anything - they don't get any [extra] money,"" he explains. ""If you're a chair of a committee, you get Â£12,000 extra into your pay packet, which is a nice lift obviously if you're a politician, and that brings you up to about Â£63,000 a year. ""It's probably worth reflecting as well that you get more money as a chair of a committee than you do as a junior minister, because all they pick up is an extra Â£6,000 in their position. ""So you can see the attractiveness of some people basically saying 'well I might like to stay as chair of a committee as opposed to going into the executive and taking up a junior minister's position'."" Btw the first minister earns Â£123,000 a year. Edwin Poots started his reshuffle by announcing appointments to a number of committees and here's one we didn't have time to mention earlier... There's no change in the public accounts committee as William Humphrey stays as chairman. It was difficult to keep up during the flurry of announcements, so just in case you missed it - Gary Middleton is to become a junior minister in the excutive office. He takes over the role held by Gordon Lyons. Political commentator Alex Kane wonders where those who oppose Poots might find a new home? Allow Twitter content?

Gareth GordonBBC News NI Political Correspondent Paul Givan has already boldly gone where no DUP first minister has ever gone before - he's been to a Sinn FÃ©in Ard Fheis (annual conference). The year was 2008. His friend, Edwin Poots, had just been sacked as minister for culture arts and leisure, and so Mr Givan lost his job as special adviser. He went to work for a trade organisation and ended up on one of the many stands at Sinn FÃ©in's annual conference at the RDS in Dublin.

Home movers dominate mortgage borrowing,"Home movers were responsible for a record proportion of mortgage borrowing in the first three months of the year as they dominated demand for property. Some 42% of total mortgage lending went to this group - the highest level since comparable records began in 2007, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said. This was up from 27% of lending a year earlier, the regulator said. It was in contrast to first-time buyers whose share of loans was up by just two percentage points in the same period. Why house prices are rising so fast in a pandemic House prices jump 10.9% as 'race for space' intensifies TheUK housing market has been surgingthis year with potential buyers competing for homes. This demand has not been matched by supply, which has led to rising prices. Official figures show they have been increasing at their fastest rate for more than a decade despite the country being gripped by a pandemic. Total gross mortgage lending in the first three months of the year was 26.5% higher than the same period a year ago at Â£83bn, figures from the FCA show. The data,externalconfirms that it is home movers who were being advanced an increasing proportion of home loans, whereas the share that went to owners who were remortgaging fell sharply, down by 14 percentage points to its lowest level since 2007. The share that went to buy-to-let property owners and first-time buyers was relatively unchanged. Part of the reason for this trend has beenhome movers' race for space, seeking larger homes to live and work after reconsidering their priorities during lockdown. Significant demand for property is expected to continue with stimulus measures such as stamp duty holidays in place. Lenders have suggested that activity levels could remain high even after those incentives are wound down.

Scramble to return as Portugal joins amber list,"This video can not be played Holidaymaker: ""I think people should have been given more notice"" British holidaymakers who dashed back from Portugal before the country came off the green travel list have spoken of their frustration, calling it an ""absolute joke"". One woman said it had been a ""massive inconvenience"" while another couple said they had lost hundreds of pounds. Portugal was moved to the amber list at 04:00 BST meaning arrivals must take two tests and quarantine for 10 days. Airlines put on dozens of extra flights as people scrambled to get home. The final commercial flight back to the UK from Portugal appeared to be a WizzAir plane from Faro to Doncaster Sheffield Airport, landing at 02:58 - little more than an hour before the deadline. At the same time Portugal was moved to the amber list, several countries went onto the red list which requires hotel quarantine, including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sudan, Trinidad and Tobago and Sri Lanka. What are the rules for green, amber and red lists? Is it possible to visit France, Spain or other destinations? 'It's not just holidays, I miss my family abroad' Can we get our money back if we can't go on holiday? Portugal was added to the UK's green list - indicating it is safe to travel for leisure - three weeks ago on 17 May and its reversal to amber has prompted criticism from the travel industry and holidaymakers. One woman who flew into Gatwick Airport on Monday night after cutting short her holiday said: ""To put it on the green list and then to take it off three weeks later is just kind of unbelievable."" ""I was part of a big group, there were 60 of us out there for a wedding... everyone's found it quite difficult."" She said it had been stressful booking new flights with just a few days' notice, adding: ""It's a massive inconvenience and obviously costs everyone a lot of money."" The Webster family, from Beckenham and Chichester, made it back from Portugal in the nick of time One couple said it cost them between Â£700 and Â£800 to come back a day early so they could still go to work, but that overall the trip was ""worth it"" to enjoy the sunshine and seaside with their children. The Cunningham family from Hampshire, who also arrived at Gatwick on Monday, said it was ""100% ridiculous"" to put Portugal on the amber list, and the government was ""getting people's hopes up and dashing them down"". ""Social distancing in Portugal is brilliant, everyone's wearing masks, even on the beaches,"" they said. Consumer experts have also criticised how the travel list change was handled. ""Between flights selling out, expensive fares, and difficulties obtaining tests in time, it's clear the government's current approach to managing the changing situation around travel is flawed,"" said Rory Boland, editor of consumer magazine Which? Travel. The head of industry body Airlines UK, Tim Alderslade, said ""three months in the summer"" now appeared to be the best case scenario for travel companies, and they could end up seeking further government financial support. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended tough rules on travel as being necessary to protect the UK's successful vaccine rollout. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the situation in Portugal ""required swift action to protect the gains made with the vaccine rollout"". It stated that the positivity rate for coronavirus tests in Portugal had nearly doubled since the travel lists were first created four weeks earlier. The DfT added that 68 cases of the India variant, known as the Delta variant, have been identified in Portugal. Separate NHS Test and Trace figures showed that of 200 arrivals from Portugal tested between 6 and 19 May, three were positive for the virus.

What's happening with foreign travel?,"International travel for non-essential reasons like going on holiday has been legal since 17 May, but with so few countries on the green list, the destinations where travellers can go without quarantining are few in number. While the government has always said that international travel would be limited, the travel industry had not foreseen that the list would be as limited as it is, particularly now thatPortugal has been moved to the amber list. So what could get travel going again and what are the roadblocks? While the government is concerned about importing new cases into the UK, the biggest concern is that tourists could bring in a vaccine-resistant variant that would render vaccination efforts useless and endanger public health. The difficulty is working out when a variant - or in Portugal's case - a mutation, is significant enough to change a country's traffic light status. Is it when it is classified as being ""of concern"", ""of interest"" or just when it's identified in the first place? ""The move from variant of interest, to variant of concern, has never been properly identified as the parameters to look at,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at University of Exeter's Medical School tells the BBC. ""They mostly all start off as variants of interest and become variants of concern when displaying activities and properties of being more infectious, severe disease causing and bypassing the current vaccines."" Is a 'Nepal variant' stopping travel to Portugal? Airline bosses demand UK-US travel corridor Holidays on the amber list - what you need to know UK holidays: What are the rules? But where that line is drawn is important, particularly if the identification of a variant or mutation is enough to move a country from one level to another. This video can not be played How one airline is keeping its aircraft and staff ready to fly Some in the industry think the government is becoming too risk-averse. ""There's talk of a new variant and everything shuts down,"" says budget airline Jet2's boss Steve Heapy. ""Is that how it's going to be going forward?"" ""If it is, then they're trying to defeat mother nature - virus do have variants all the time."" Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, says the sector isn't calling a reopening of travel everywhere. ""But if the government is going to have this kind of risk appetite...then it's going to be really difficult to see how we can have a summer season,"" he says. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""We have always been clear that protecting public health is our priority and that if decisive action was needed, it would be swiftly taken."" The industry had hoped that while mainland Greece and Spain might not yet be on the green list, at least some of the Spanish and Greek islands would be. The travel industry had hoped that some of the Greek Islands would be on the government's green list for foreign travel The island policy was used last year and Transport secretary Grant Shapps said in April that it was something his department wanted to consider. But there are difficulties with looking at individual islands, partly because of their size. ""Healthcare facilities are limited and they can provide what they can and no more,"" says Dr Pankhania. ""There could come a time when a British holidaymaker is told, wait - we have Spanish people here who are sick and they could take priority, leaving holidaymakers stuck."" There are also worries that while coronavirus testing is showing infection rates for island residents, it isn't including the test results for tourists, who might still spread it amongst one another. However, others argue that including smaller regions on the green list would helpful keep travel flowing where the risk is low. This is a sore point with the travel industry, which says it doesn't understand what tips a country between the different colours. The government is worried about tourists and visitors bringing in a variant of the coronavirus that could prove to be resistant to vaccines While the government has laid out criteria like vaccination rates, virus levels, variants and the quality of genomic sequencing offered by a country, it hasn't set out exactly what level of each leads to a move up or down the list. ""We can't plan what we're doing,' says Mr Heapy. ""We've either got to assume all the destinations will be green, none of the destinations will be green or use a lottery machine and try to work it out in the absence of a structured methodology."" Ultimately, this isn't just a decision about other countries' data. While ministers are given recommendations by the Joint Biosecurity Centre about other countries' positions, they also weigh up other issues too, like the UK's health situation, or the practicalities of putting a country on the red, amber or green list. This is still a political decision. There's nothing in the government's guidelines about international business travel, or taking what other nations are doing into account when deciding whether to put a country on the green list. Yesterday, transatlantic airline bosses came togetherto put pressure on UK and US politicians to reopen flights between the UK and USAfor business and leisure travel. They want to see US President Joe Biden and Boris Johnson commit to announcing a travel corridor at this weekend's G7 meeting in Cornwall. There is no doubt that time is of the essence for airlines, whose finances have been stripped by a year with minimal passengers. Delta Airline boss Ed Bastion said it was rare to see all his aviation competitors come together, but that they were ""speaking in one voice"". He warned that as Europe begins to open up to US travellers, the UK could be left behind, missing out on lucrative tourist income. The European Commission has announced that its EU Digital Covid-19 Passport will begin on 1 July, and may also be issued to non-European travellers, including visitors from the UK and the US. However, European nations are already beginning to welcome travellers. Mr Lundgren says people want to go on holiday as soon as they can Spain, which is on the amber list, started allowing British travellers to enter without the need for a Covid test or vaccination certificate from Monday. So you could visit Spain, but you'd still have to quarantine on your return. ""It just beggars belief,"" Travel Trade Gazette editor Sophie Griffiths tells the BBC. ""Especially as countries are opening up and Britain is closing down. People are just confused and frustrated about why that's happening."" EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren agrees: ""This decision has cut Britain off from Europe and from the world for that matter - it's utterly confusing for the British people."" It is becoming a fine and delicate dance to find the equilibrium between the demands of travel bosses and governments. ""I can see where [travel bosses] are coming from,"" says Dr Pankhania. ""But from an infection control point of view we are finely balanced now. We are nearly there - it would be better to be completely certain before opening the gates to all, [as] once opened, it is difficult to close them again.""

Step forward for plan to extend pub opening times,"Proposals to extend opening times for pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland have taken another step towards becoming law. It was a late night at Stormont as MLAs stayed to the early hours of Wednesdaydebating legislation to modernise NI's 25-year-old licensing laws,external. The bill aims to allow pubs and clubs to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend. It also proposes removing restrictions around Easter drinking. It is thought the legislation could pass its final stage in the assembly by the end of the month, with most of the changes then becoming law from October. The proposals have been a very long time in the making, with Stormont first putting forward changes eight years ago. A previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016,but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, who share power together at Stormont. As the lengthy debate began on Tuesday evening, Speaker Alex Maskey said it may run until the ""early hours of the morning and maybe some of us will be driven to drink afterwards"". Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey described the proposals as a ""great move which brings our drinking laws into the 21st Century"". After debating 63 amendments, the Licensing and Registration of Clubs Bill passed its consideration stage in the early hours of the morning. Some of assembly members who took part in the debate, including Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong and DUP Chief Whip Joanne Bunting, tweeted photos as they left work after 03:00 BST.

One amendment from independent unionist MLA Claire Sugden suggested extending the definition of a ""place of public entertainment"" to include cinemas, so they can sell alcohol on their premises. It is understood Ms Hargey has expressed reservations about that proposal. Longer pub opening times 'could cost police Â£7m' Easter 'could be overrun by alcohol' if laws change Alcohol licensing changes 'strike right balance' Her department has instead said it is preparing to carry out a 12-week public consultation on that specific matter over the summer. Ms Hargey told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster that the proposals were ""fundamental changes"" and it was important to consider ""what the consequences of those are"". She said no consultation had been done around cinemas, and ""there are very few places at which a family can go and enjoy entertainment where there is no alcohol sold"". ""I do think that there is a want within the community that that is retained on one hand, that said I am willing to listen as a minister in terms of doing further consultation on this,"" she added. ""I don't think it is good, at this point of laying legislation, of making a change that would be significant like this without doing the due consultation and seeing the impact. ""I want to make sure on the issue of cinemas and looking at that entertainment, which is very family focused, that we do more consultation on that issue."" Ms Sugden had questioned delaying a proposal that she believed was ""inevitable"". She said cinemas in other parts of the UK can already sell alcohol to customers and she hoped MLAs would support her amendment. ""Cinemas have had a really difficult year with the pandemic and anything we can do to support them can only be a good thing,"" she added. Other changes in the bill include the extension in ""drinking-up time"" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends. The law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol. The current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements. Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said that there had been a ""number of false dawns"" in relation to modernising licensing laws and now change was ""tantalisingly close"". Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster wants to see current licensing laws modernised ""We recognise alcohol is a controlled substance and needs to be treated as such, we haven't come asking for 24-hour drinking like England or deregulation, this is about looking at what the customer wants and actually modernise it. ""They are modest but significant in their impact measures, because people do go out later now, they want to go out and socialise. ""We have to be able to provide that (extended hours) particularly with tourists visiting here as well."" Michael McAdam, managing director of Movie House Cinemas, said adults could already sample alcohol if they were watching an event at theatres in Northern Ireland. ""All we are saying at cinema is please give us a chance to be in line, to serve our customers, to give our customers what they want,"" he said. ""That is the choice to make an adult decision if they want to have an alcoholic beverage or not."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An amendment that would require the Northern Ireland Executive to review the ""surrender principle"" in Northern Ireland licensing law was one of those passed at Stormont. The principle means no new licence can ever be granted unless another one is surrendered. Licences for selling alcohol on and off premises are also convertible in court, which means that every supermarket or convenience store seeking to add an off sales needs to acquire a licence from somewhere else. The SDLP's Matthew O'Toole, who proposed the amendment, said that was likely to have contributed to the decline in the number of pubs and made it very difficult for new rural or small town pubs to be created as licences are scarce and expensive assets. He emphasised that any review would have to carefully consider all the impacts - including on existing licensees. He said: ""My amendment simply requires the department to appoint an independent person to review the licensing system, including the surrender principle. ""Critically the amendment makes clear that the reviewer has to have regard to the interests of existing licence holders, by ensuring they consider options for compensation in the event of reform."" Colin Neill said Hospitality Ulster members were ""terrified"" by Mr O'Toole's proposal, saying that bar owners were ""incredibly vulnerable"" following the latest Covid-19 lockdown. Mr O'Toole is also proposing that the department should publish an annual report on the number of pubs and operational licenses by postcode. He added: ""These amendments are not about rushing into reform - they are about getting robust information to plan for reform.""

What's happening with foreign travel?A look at how to get travel going again - and some of the possible stumbling blocks.Business,"International travel for non-essential reasons like going on holiday has been legal since 17 May, but with so few countries on the green list, the destinations where travellers can go without quarantining are few in number. While the government has always said that international travel would be limited, the travel industry had not foreseen that the list would be as limited as it is, particularly now thatPortugal has been moved to the amber list. So what could get travel going again and what are the roadblocks? While the government is concerned about importing new cases into the UK, the biggest concern is that tourists could bring in a vaccine-resistant variant that would render vaccination efforts useless and endanger public health. The difficulty is working out when a variant - or in Portugal's case - a mutation, is significant enough to change a country's traffic light status. Is it when it is classified as being ""of concern"", ""of interest"" or just when it's identified in the first place? ""The move from variant of interest, to variant of concern, has never been properly identified as the parameters to look at,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at University of Exeter's Medical School tells the BBC. ""They mostly all start off as variants of interest and become variants of concern when displaying activities and properties of being more infectious, severe disease causing and bypassing the current vaccines."" Is a 'Nepal variant' stopping travel to Portugal? Airline bosses demand UK-US travel corridor Holidays on the amber list - what you need to know UK holidays: What are the rules? But where that line is drawn is important, particularly if the identification of a variant or mutation is enough to move a country from one level to another. This video can not be played How one airline is keeping its aircraft and staff ready to fly Some in the industry think the government is becoming too risk-averse. ""There's talk of a new variant and everything shuts down,"" says budget airline Jet2's boss Steve Heapy. ""Is that how it's going to be going forward?"" ""If it is, then they're trying to defeat mother nature - virus do have variants all the time."" Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, says the sector isn't calling a reopening of travel everywhere. ""But if the government is going to have this kind of risk appetite...then it's going to be really difficult to see how we can have a summer season,"" he says. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""We have always been clear that protecting public health is our priority and that if decisive action was needed, it would be swiftly taken."" The industry had hoped that while mainland Greece and Spain might not yet be on the green list, at least some of the Spanish and Greek islands would be. The travel industry had hoped that some of the Greek Islands would be on the government's green list for foreign travel The island policy was used last year and Transport secretary Grant Shapps said in April that it was something his department wanted to consider. But there are difficulties with looking at individual islands, partly because of their size. ""Healthcare facilities are limited and they can provide what they can and no more,"" says Dr Pankhania. ""There could come a time when a British holidaymaker is told, wait - we have Spanish people here who are sick and they could take priority, leaving holidaymakers stuck."" There are also worries that while coronavirus testing is showing infection rates for island residents, it isn't including the test results for tourists, who might still spread it amongst one another. However, others argue that including smaller regions on the green list would helpful keep travel flowing where the risk is low. This is a sore point with the travel industry, which says it doesn't understand what tips a country between the different colours. The government is worried about tourists and visitors bringing in a variant of the coronavirus that could prove to be resistant to vaccines While the government has laid out criteria like vaccination rates, virus levels, variants and the quality of genomic sequencing offered by a country, it hasn't set out exactly what level of each leads to a move up or down the list. ""We can't plan what we're doing,' says Mr Heapy. ""We've either got to assume all the destinations will be green, none of the destinations will be green or use a lottery machine and try to work it out in the absence of a structured methodology."" Ultimately, this isn't just a decision about other countries' data. While ministers are given recommendations by the Joint Biosecurity Centre about other countries' positions, they also weigh up other issues too, like the UK's health situation, or the practicalities of putting a country on the red, amber or green list. This is still a political decision. There's nothing in the government's guidelines about international business travel, or taking what other nations are doing into account when deciding whether to put a country on the green list. Yesterday, transatlantic airline bosses came togetherto put pressure on UK and US politicians to reopen flights between the UK and USAfor business and leisure travel. They want to see US President Joe Biden and Boris Johnson commit to announcing a travel corridor at this weekend's G7 meeting in Cornwall. There is no doubt that time is of the essence for airlines, whose finances have been stripped by a year with minimal passengers. Delta Airline boss Ed Bastion said it was rare to see all his aviation competitors come together, but that they were ""speaking in one voice"". He warned that as Europe begins to open up to US travellers, the UK could be left behind, missing out on lucrative tourist income. The European Commission has announced that its EU Digital Covid-19 Passport will begin on 1 July, and may also be issued to non-European travellers, including visitors from the UK and the US. However, European nations are already beginning to welcome travellers. Mr Lundgren says people want to go on holiday as soon as they can Spain, which is on the amber list, started allowing British travellers to enter without the need for a Covid test or vaccination certificate from Monday. So you could visit Spain, but you'd still have to quarantine on your return. ""It just beggars belief,"" Travel Trade Gazette editor Sophie Griffiths tells the BBC. ""Especially as countries are opening up and Britain is closing down. People are just confused and frustrated about why that's happening."" EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren agrees: ""This decision has cut Britain off from Europe and from the world for that matter - it's utterly confusing for the British people."" It is becoming a fine and delicate dance to find the equilibrium between the demands of travel bosses and governments. ""I can see where [travel bosses] are coming from,"" says Dr Pankhania. ""But from an infection control point of view we are finely balanced now. We are nearly there - it would be better to be completely certain before opening the gates to all, [as] once opened, it is difficult to close them again.""

Huge parts of internet currently offlineEarly reports blame problems with a cloud computing provider FastlyTechnology,"A major outage has affected a number of high profile websites including Amazon, Reddit and Twitch. The UK government website - gov.uk - was also down as were the Financial Times, the Guardian and the New York Times.

The issues began at around 11:00 BST and lasted for an hour. Other affected websites included CNN and streaming sites Twitch and Hulu. The outage also broke some parts of other services, including Twitter's emojis. Websites were also beginning to be restored, after around an hour of downtime. Fastly runs what is known as an ""edge cloud"", which is designed to speed up loading times for websites, as well as protect them from denial-of-service attacks and help them when traffic is peaking.

Other websites knocked offline included: PayPal Shopify BBC.com HBO Max Vimeo Similar problems have also affected Amazon Web Services and Cloudflare in the past, two other huge cloud computing firms. Some websites managed to find workarounds to the problem, with tech site The Verge taking to Google Docs to publish its news, but forgetting to limit those who could write on it, leading to a series of amusing edits and tweets.

Scramble to return as Portugal joins amber listHolidaymakers are left frustrated and out of pocket as they dash back to the UK to avoid quarantine.UK,"This video can not be played Holidaymaker: ""I think people should have been given more notice"" British holidaymakers who dashed back from Portugal before the country came off the green travel list have spoken of their frustration, calling it an ""absolute joke"". One woman said it had been a ""massive inconvenience"" while another couple said they had lost hundreds of pounds. Portugal was moved to the amber list at 04:00 BST meaning arrivals must take two tests and quarantine for 10 days. Airlines put on dozens of extra flights as people scrambled to get home. The final commercial flight back to the UK from Portugal appeared to be a WizzAir plane from Faro to Doncaster Sheffield Airport, landing at 02:58 - little more than an hour before the deadline. At the same time Portugal was moved to the amber list, several countries went onto the red list which requires hotel quarantine, including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sudan, Trinidad and Tobago and Sri Lanka. What are the rules for green, amber and red lists? Is it possible to visit France, Spain or other destinations? 'It's not just holidays, I miss my family abroad' Can we get our money back if we can't go on holiday? Portugal was added to the UK's green list - indicating it is safe to travel for leisure - three weeks ago on 17 May and its reversal to amber has prompted criticism from the travel industry and holidaymakers. One woman who flew into Gatwick Airport on Monday night after cutting short her holiday said: ""To put it on the green list and then to take it off three weeks later is just kind of unbelievable."" ""I was part of a big group, there were 60 of us out there for a wedding... everyone's found it quite difficult."" She said it had been stressful booking new flights with just a few days' notice, adding: ""It's a massive inconvenience and obviously costs everyone a lot of money."" The Webster family, from Beckenham and Chichester, made it back from Portugal in the nick of time One couple said it cost them between Â£700 and Â£800 to come back a day early so they could still go to work, but that overall the trip was ""worth it"" to enjoy the sunshine and seaside with their children.

Major newspaper and government websites down,"A major outage has affected a number of high profile websites including Amazon, Reddit and Twitch. The UK government website - gov.uk - was also down as were the Financial Times, the Guardian and the New York Times. Cloud computing provider Fastly, which underpins a lot of websites, said it was behind the problems. The firm said there had been issues with its global content delivery network (CDN) which it was fixing. In a statement, it said: ""We identified a service configuration that triggered disruption across our POPs (points of presence) globally and have disabled that configuration."" A POP allows content to be sent from globally distributed servers that are close to the end user. ""Our global network is coming back online."" The issues began at around 11:00 BST and lasted for an hour. Other affected websites included CNN and streaming sites Twitch and Hulu. The outage also broke some parts of other services, including Twitter's emojis. Websites were also beginning to be restored, after around an hour of downtime. Fastly runs what is known as an ""edge cloud"", which is designed to speed up loading times for websites, as well as protect them from denial-of-service attacks and help them when traffic is peaking. It currently looks as if the problems were localised, meaning specific locations across Europe and the US were affected. Other websites knocked offline included: PayPal Shopify BBC.com HBO Max Vimeo Similar problems have also affected Amazon Web Services and Cloudflare in the past, two other huge cloud computing firms. Some websites managed to find workarounds to the problem, with tech site The Verge taking to Google Docs to publish its news, but forgetting to limit those who could write on it, leading to a series of amusing edits and tweets. The hashtag ""InternetOutage"" was soon trending on social media as more and more broken websites were discovered. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The disruption has led some to question the wisdom of having so much internet infrastructure in the hands of a few companies. Jake Moore, a cyber-specialist at security firm ESET said: ""This highlights the importance and significance of these vast hosting companies and what they represent."" Adam Smith, a software testing expert with the BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, said outages with content delivery networks ""highlight the growing ecosystem of complex and coupled components that are involved in delivering internet services"". ""Because of this, outages are increasingly hitting multiple sites and services at the same time."" Stephen Gilderdale, senior director at Dell Technologies, said such outages were bound to occur occasionally but that they would be rare and brief. ""Cloud providers build in redundancies for such events to give their users secure access to replicated copies of data. ""In most cases, services are only affected for a short time, and data is easily retrievable. Far from being a cause of concern, it shows the resilience of the network that it can recover so quickly."" It is estimated that even an hour's worth of downtime could cost companies up to $250,000 (Â£176,000), and some lawyers think there could be compensation claims. ""Liability for loss of service will probably be covered by the service level agreement with customers of paid-for cloud services but the agreements will typically not cover all losses sustained,"" said Prof Rebecca Parry of Nottingham Law School.

"Donate jabs now or risk wasting doses, says Unicef","Billie Eilish, David Beckham and Priyanka Chopra Jonas signed the letter Millions of Covid vaccines could be wasted if rich countries send large amounts of leftover doses to poorer nations in one go, Unicef has warned. The charity said there needed to be a steady supply throughout the year because poor countries do not have resources to use them all at once. The UK and others have promised to donate their surplus doses - but they have been asked to give more earlier. Stars including Billie Eilish and David Beckham are backing Unicef's plea. The celebrities have signed a letter to the G7 group of rich countries - including the UK - asking them to donate 20% of their vaccines by August. ""The pandemic will not be over anywhere until it is over everywhere,"" said Beckham. The other stars who have signed the letter include Andy Murray, Olivia Colman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Payne, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Orlando Bloom, Katy Perry, Gemma Chan, Whoopi Goldberg, Claudia Schiffer and Chris Hoy. Unicef's vaccine lead Lily Caprani told BBC Newsnight that countries needed to vaccinate their own populations at the same time as the rest of the world. ""At some point, no doubt, we will need to vaccinate under-18s,"" she said. ""But the priority at this moment has to be making sure that all of the vulnerable and priority groups around the world get vaccines. ""So we're saying countries like the UK and the G7 need to donate their doses to those low income countries now, while still vaccinating their populations at home."" But last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said vaccinating children in the UK would take priority over sending doses abroad. Unlike other countries, the UK has not revealed how many doses it plans to donate to the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme, saying only that it will donate its excess doses. On Friday Mr Hancock said the UK did not currently have any spare doses. People queue to receive vaccines in Delhi, India, which has been hit hard by the virus Earlier this week more than 100 former prime ministers, presidents and foreign ministers urged leaders of the G7 countries to pay two-thirds of the Â£46.6bn needed to vaccinate low-income countries against Covid. Ex-PM Tony Blair said the ""reality"" was that governments are ""obliged to look after [their] own people"" and so will always prioritise vaccinating their own country first. But he said, ""you can't be absolutist about this, there may be some vaccine that we can ship out in advance"". Another former UK PM, Gordon Brown, said the G7 and other wealthy nations ""should pay their share"" to help parts of Africa and Asia. He said it should not be left to a ""whip round"" to deal with a ""disease that has got to be brought under control."" Vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Covid vaccine tracker: How's my country doing? Where are cases the highest? Unicef's Ms Caprani called on G7 countries to start donating jabs now as well as throughout the summer and the rest of the year. ""Low income countries need a steady supply that they can get off the tarmac and into the arms of health care workers,"" she said. ""The unintended consequence of saving all these vaccines up to Christmas time is that countries won't be able to absorb them and roll them out and therefore they could end up going to waste. We could see millions of doses of vaccines not used and expiring, and that will be a tragedy."" In their letter, the celebrities said Unicef was already delivering vaccines in poor countries - but the charity was 190 million doses short. The letter said the G7 countries  - the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US - will soon have enough to donate 20% of their doses between June and August without significant delay to their own rollouts, and doing that would provide more than 150 million doses to Covax. ""The virus is still spreading in many countries and producing new variants with the potential to put us all back where we started,"" said the letter to the G7 group. Some of the celebrities such as tennis star Murray are also urging people in the UK to donate to Unicef's VaccinAid appeal. This video can not be played Covax vaccine plan: What is it and how will it work? Some countries, like the UK which has ordered 400 million doses of various vaccines, have already vaccinated a large proportion of their citizens. But other countries are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax. At the G7 summit later this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonis planning to urge setting a targetto vaccinate the world by the end of 2022. Campaigners and critics - as well as a group of MPs - say action needs to be taken now and Britain should donate a dose for every jab imported into the UK. The UK governmenthas already donated Â£548min aid money to the Covax scheme, andhalf a billion doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab have been ordered,externalby other countries and sent abroad. The leaders of the seven G7 countries are meeting in Cornwall for their annual summit this weekend. The US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all said how many doses they will donate to Covax.

Can we get a holiday refund?,"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

"Step forward for plan to extend pub opening timesThe assembly will debate legislation to modernise current licensing laws, which are 25 years old.Northern Ireland","Proposals to extend opening times for pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland have taken another step towards becoming law. It was a late night at Stormont as MLAs stayed to the early hours of Wednesdaydebating legislation to modernise NI's 25-year-old licensing laws,external. The bill aims to allow pubs and clubs to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend. It also proposes removing restrictions around Easter drinking. It is thought the legislation could pass its final stage in the assembly by the end of the month, with most of the changes then becoming law from October. The proposals have been a very long time in the making, with Stormont first putting forward changes eight years ago. A previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016,but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, who share power together at Stormont. As the lengthy debate began on Tuesday evening, Speaker Alex Maskey said it may run until the ""early hours of the morning and maybe some of us will be driven to drink afterwards"". Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey described the proposals as a ""great move which brings our drinking laws into the 21st Century"". After debating 63 amendments, the Licensing and Registration of Clubs Bill passed its consideration stage in the early hours of the morning. Some of assembly members who took part in the debate, including Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong and DUP Chief Whip Joanne Bunting, tweeted photos as they left work after 03:00 BST.

One amendment from independent unionist MLA Claire Sugden suggested extending the definition of a ""place of public entertainment"" to include cinemas, so they can sell alcohol on their premises. It is understood Ms Hargey has expressed reservations about that proposal. Longer pub opening times 'could cost police Â£7m' Easter 'could be overrun by alcohol' if laws change Alcohol licensing changes 'strike right balance' Her department has instead said it is preparing to carry out a 12-week public consultation on that specific matter over the summer. Ms Hargey told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster that the proposals were ""fundamental changes"" and it was important to consider ""what the consequences of those are"". She said no consultation had been done around cinemas, and ""there are very few places at which a family can go and enjoy entertainment where there is no alcohol sold"". ""I do think that there is a want within the community that that is retained on one hand, that said I am willing to listen as a minister in terms of doing further consultation on this,"" she added. ""I don't think it is good, at this point of laying legislation, of making a change that would be significant like this without doing the due consultation and seeing the impact. ""I want to make sure on the issue of cinemas and looking at that entertainment, which is very family focused, that we do more consultation on that issue."" Ms Sugden had questioned delaying a proposal that she believed was ""inevitable"". She said cinemas in other parts of the UK can already sell alcohol to customers and she hoped MLAs would support her amendment. ""Cinemas have had a really difficult year with the pandemic and anything we can do to support them can only be a good thing,"" she added. Other changes in the bill include the extension in ""drinking-up time"" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends. The law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol. The current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements. Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said that there had been a ""number of false dawns"" in relation to modernising licensing laws and now change was ""tantalisingly close"". Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster wants to see current licensing laws modernised ""We recognise alcohol is a controlled substance and needs to be treated as such, we haven't come asking for 24-hour drinking like England or deregulation, this is about looking at what the customer wants and actually modernise it. ""They are modest but significant in their impact measures, because people do go out later now, they want to go out and socialise. ""We have to be able to provide that (extended hours) particularly with tourists visiting here as well."" Michael McAdam, managing director of Movie House Cinemas, said adults could already sample alcohol if they were watching an event at theatres in Northern Ireland. ""All we are saying at cinema is please give us a chance to be in line, to serve our customers, to give our customers what they want,"" he said. ""That is the choice to make an adult decision if they want to have an alcoholic beverage or not."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An amendment that would require the Northern Ireland Executive to review the ""surrender principle"" in Northern Ireland licensing law was one of those passed at Stormont. The principle means no new licence can ever be granted unless another one is surrendered. Licences for selling alcohol on and off premises are also convertible in court, which means that every supermarket or convenience store seeking to add an off sales needs to acquire a licence from somewhere else. The SDLP's Matthew O'Toole, who proposed the amendment, said that was likely to have contributed to the decline in the number of pubs and made it very difficult for new rural or small town pubs to be created as licences are scarce and expensive assets. He emphasised that any review would have to carefully consider all the impacts - including on existing licensees. He said: ""My amendment simply requires the department to appoint an independent person to review the licensing system, including the surrender principle. ""Critically the amendment makes clear that the reviewer has to have regard to the interests of existing licence holders, by ensuring they consider options for compensation in the event of reform."" Colin Neill said Hospitality Ulster members were ""terrified"" by Mr O'Toole's proposal, saying that bar owners were ""incredibly vulnerable"" following the latest Covid-19 lockdown. Mr O'Toole is also proposing that the department should publish an annual report on the number of pubs and operational licenses by postcode. He added: ""These amendments are not about rushing into reform - they are about getting robust information to plan for reform.""

"'Five-day office week will become the norm again'Traditional working patterns could return within two years, a think tank tells the BBC.Business","Jessica Bowles said firms wanted more flexible spaces and shorter leases, but most still wanted a five-day office The five-day office week could become the norm again within two years, the Centre for Cities think tank has told the BBC. A blend of home and office work is expected to be popular while the UK recovers from the pandemic. But some analysts then anticipate a shift back to pre-Covid working patterns for many. Currently, people who can work from home are still advised to do so. However, that is likely to change if the government ends all social distancing restrictions on 21 June. ""I expect we will see three or four days a week in the office as the UK recovers,"" Paul Swinney, director of policy and research at Centre for Cities, told Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme. ""Over the longer term, I'm quite hopeful that we will see people return five days a week. ""The reason for that is, one of the benefits of being in the office is having interactions with other people, coming up with new ideas and sharing information."" He said people could not do this by scheduling a three o'clock meeting on a Tuesday - it had to happen randomly. ""If you're in the office on a Monday but someone else is in the office on a Wednesday, then you're starting to miss out. Or, if your colleague is in the office and having a meeting with your boss and you're not there, all of a sudden that changes the dynamic again."" Can I ask to keep working from home? Apple employees rally against office working plan No full-time return to the office for over a million Office for National Statistics data published in May,externalrevealed most people did not work from home in 2020, however the proportion of workers who did more than doubled during the pandemic. That hit the office property market while prompting lots of discussion about the future of the workplace. Demand for more city centre office space does now appear to be rising - albeit from a very low point. Figures from Savills estate agency show office take-up by square footage in the UK's six biggest regional cities has gone up significantly since the second quarter of 2020, the start of the pandemic. The estate agency said it was also seeing ""record rents"" for some top tier office space in Greater London and regional city areas. Sectors signing some of the biggest regional office deals were public services, education and health. Office providers have struggled during the pandemic. On Monday, the shared office firm IWGwarned of a sharp profits drop. Nevertheless, the company said it was seeing ""unprecedented demand"" for its flexible office services as many more businesses adopted hybrid working. Jessica Bowles, director of strategy at commercial property developer Bruntwood, which operates in Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool, told the BBC her firm has also seen a lot of demand for flexible and serviced office space on short leases. ""We've had really strong take-up. People want flexible terms. ""What's interesting is that it's corporates wanting to do that as well as small businesses and SMEs."" Figures show a gradual rise in office space take-up in major UK cities, including Manchester But hybrid working does not mean flexible office space leases are any cheaper as ""flexibility is priced in"". Most firms also want to keep a five-day office, she said. ""Most businesses that have got space with us now want to maintain having an office, and they don't see that they could give up the office for a certain number of days a week - they just want to use the space differently. ""That means more collaborative space, fewer banks of desks, places where people can come together and create and innovate."" She added that while hybrid working was growing in popularity before Covid-19 struck, the working pattern could be ""challenging"" for firms if some staff were at home, while some were in the office. James Morris and his sister Naomi started their business before the pandemic to serve Birmingham commuters ""I think from a personal, and a business level, we'll see more people seeing the value in coming together to collaborate. But Fridays are always pretty quiet in the office and I don't expect that to change."" Businesses reliant on office worker trade are hopeful their fortunes will soon improve. In Birmingham, cafe owners and siblings James and Naomi Morris are looking forward to the arrival of more commuters to the city centre. They set up their business, Morridge, in 2019 specifically to target city workers. James told the BBC he'd started to see more commuters coming into the cafe again. ""Over the past few weeks, office workers have slowly been returning. People are starting to work in the cafe - a lady came in for breakfast the other day and took a couple of work calls. ""Wednesdays and Thursdays are our busiest days."" He said he is expecting more workers to return to the city centre later in the month if the remaining Covid restrictions are lifted on 21 June, and said his customers had told him they expected more of their colleagues to return in September. ""It's looking good. I think it will all come back around."" But the prospect of a post-Covid mass return to the office - on even a hybrid basis - will not necessarily be universally welcomed by employees. Staff at Applereportedly launched a campaign to push back againstboss Tim Cook's plans for workers to be in the office at least three days a week by September.

Hundreds arrested in massive global crime sting,"This video can not be played Hundreds of people in 18 countries were detained More than 800 suspected criminals have been arrested worldwide after being tricked into using an FBI-run encrypted messaging app, officials say. The operation, jointly conceived by Australia and the FBI, saw devices with the ANOM app secretly distributed among criminals, allowing police to monitor their chats about drug smuggling, money laundering and even murder plots. Officials called it a watershed moment. Targets included drug gangs and people with links to the mafia. Drugs, weapons, luxury vehicles and cash were also seized in the operation, which was conducted across more than a dozen countries. This included eight tonnes of cocaine, 250 guns and more than $48m (Â£34m) in various worldwide currencies and cryptocurrencies. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the operation had ""struck a heavy blow against organised crime"" around the world. European Union police agency Europol described Operation Trojan Shield/Greenlight as the ""biggest ever law enforcement operation against encrypted communication"". The FBI began operating an encrypted device network called ANOM, and covertly distributed devices with the chat app among the criminal underworld via informants. The idea for the operation came after two other encrypted platforms were taken down by law enforcement agencies, leaving criminal gangs in the market for new secure phones. The devices were initially used by alleged senior crime figures, giving other criminals the confidence to use the platform. The man who accidentally helped FBI spread spy app ""You had to know a criminal to get hold of one of these customised phones. The phones couldn't ring or email. You could only communicate with someone on the same platform,"" the Australian police explained. Items seized in the sting included motorbikes and money Australian fugitive and alleged drug trafficker Hakan Ayik was key to the sting, having unwittingly recommended the app to criminal associates after being given a handset by undercover officers, police said. Dubbed the ""Facebook gangster"" by Australian media outlets, Ayik is seen in social media photographs with large tattoos and a muscular physique. Local outlets say he has been living in Turkey since evading arrest, living a luxury lifestyle with a Dutch wife. Police said he was ""best off handing himself into us"" as soon as possible, as he may be in danger himself, having unwittingly helped the FBI with their sting. In total, some 12,000 encrypted devices were used by around 300 criminal syndicates in more than 100 countries. This is a fascinating example of law enforcement, perhaps growing tired of wrangling with US tech giants over accessing encrypted data and locked devices, taking matters into its own hands. Running a sort of WhatsApp platform for criminals is a bold move, and getting bespoke handsets into the hands of the very law-breakers they were trying to catch, was ambitious, to say the least. Officials reportedly took control of a communications firm called ANOM around three years ago, after a convicted criminal promised them access to it in return for a more lenient sentence. The devices were billed as super-secure and had a very specific target market - organised crime groups. The authorities even took advantage of a current trend in Silicon Valley - they charged a monthly subscription for the product. Officers were able to read millions of messages in ""real time"" describing murder plots, mass drug import plans and other schemes. ""All they talk about is drugs, violence, hits on each other, innocent people who are going to be murdered, a whole range of things,"" said Australian Federal Police commissioner Reece Kershaw. In total, some 9,000 police officers around the world were involved in the sting. Calvin Shivers of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division said the operation had enabled police agencies to ""turn the tables on criminal organisations"", with intelligence gathered preventing murders and a number of other crimes. ""We were actually able to see photographs of hundreds of tons of cocaine that were concealed in shipments of fruit,"" he said. Among the items seized was memorabilia from The Godfather Statements from law enforcement agencies did not name any of those arrested in the sting. In Australia, 224 people were arrested including members of outlaw motorcycle gangs, mafia groups, Asian crime syndicates, and serious and organised crime groups. Police said they also seized three tonnes of drugs and A$45m (Â£25m; $35m) in cash and assets, and acted on 20 ""threats to kill"", potentially saving the lives of a ""significant number of innocent bystanders"". Mr Morrison said the sting, which was called Operation Ironside, was ""a watershed moment in Australian law enforcement history"". New Zealand police said 35 people in the country had been arrested, and about NZ$3.7m (Â£1.9m, $2.7m) of assets seized. ""We believe the termination of these operations will have a significant impact on New Zealand's organised crime scene,"" National Organised Crime Group Director Detective Superintendent Greg Williams said. In the US, the FBI unsealed an indictment against 17 people for distributing the ANOM-enabled devices - eight have so far been arrested, while the rest are on the run. The FBI is expected to present more details later on Tuesday. Europol's deputy executive director Jean-Philippe Lecouffe described the operation as an ""exceptional success"". The agency did not break down the arrests in each country, but local officials said they included 70 people in Sweden and 49 in the Netherlands, according to Reuters news agency. Linda Staaf, the Swedish police's head of intelligence, said the operation had helped to prevent more than 10 planned murders in Sweden. Australian police arrest and confiscate.

NHS staff burnout at an emergency level - report,"NHS and care staff in England are so burnt out that it has become an ""emergency"" and risks the future of the health service, MPs have warned. A highly critical report said workers were exhausted and overstretched because of staff shortages. It said the problems existed before the pandemic - although coronavirus has worsened the pressures. Doctors' and nursing unions welcomed the report, saying it highlighted the stress and anxiety facing staff. It has already been well documented that the NHS is short of staff. Last July, the health and social care committee - made up of MPs and chaired by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt - launched an inquiry to look at the issue, including how burnt out NHS staff were. Its report, published on Tuesday,,externalsaid one of the main problems was that there was no accurate forecast of how many staff the NHS needed for the next five to 10 years - something it called ""workforce planning"". It said there needed to be a ""total overhaul of the way the NHS does workforce planning"" - and there should be annual reports published on how many workers the NHS would need for the next five, 10 and 20 years. ""It is clear that workforce planning has been led by the funding envelope available to health and social care rather than by demand and the capacity required to service that demand,"" said the report. And it said that NHS workers needed to know there was a solution on its way to fix the staff shortages. NHS staff left 'traumatised' by first Covid wave Liz Stavacre, an intensive care nurse, said her unit had seen a lot of resignations, including people leaving nursing altogether ""because they're so burnt out and can't deal with it anymore"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's been a very difficult year. We're very tired - we're physically tired, we're emotionally tired, and there's very little time to take a break from what's happening."" Dr Rosemary Leonard says the biggest issue is the lack of manpower Dr Rosemary Leonard told BBC Breakfast it felt like her GP surgery had been ""under siege"" since the end of lockdown as people were coming in with ""shopping lists of problems and we just don't have the manpower to deal with it"". She said everybody in primary care was working ""incredibly long days"" and was under ""huge, huge pressure"". Asked what would help alleviate the stress, she said: ""It really is manpower."" Before the pandemic began, the NHS faced shortages of around one in 10 or one in 12 staff, the report said - and there were 50,000 nursing posts unfilled in the UK. Meanwhile in adult social care, 7.3% of roles had been vacant during the financial year 2019-20, equivalent to around 112,000 vacancies at any one time, the report heard. According to the NHS staff survey in 2020, 44% of staff reported feeling unwell as a result of work-related stress in the previous year. Mr Hunt told the Today programme that a shortage of NHS staff was ""the single biggest problem"" as far as staff well-being was concerned. He said there weren't enough doctors or nurses in ""nearly every medical specialty"" but tackling the issue was ""never enough of a priority"" for the government because the amount of years required to train up staff meant there weren't immediate results. He added that training more doctors and nurses would save money in the long run as it would avoid the need to employ temporary staff which ""ends up costing tax payers much more"". This video can not be played WATCH: ICU hospital staff ""scared, sad, petrified, worried"" Many groups representing doctors have warned that having stressed and unwell staff risks safe patient care. The chairman of the Royal College of GPs, Prof Martin Marshall, said: ""We simply don't have enough GPs or other members of the practice team to meet demand and general practice is only set to get busier as we support our communities' recovery from the pandemic."" And Dr David Wrigley from the British Medical Association said: ""Health and care staff suffered stress and work-related anxiety before the pandemic but it is now far more serious and we believe the current level of staff burnout and stress presents a worrying risk to the future functioning of the health and care system and safe patient care. ""There's an urgent need to address the severe workforce crisis facing health and care services, and - as called for by the BMA and others - the report also calls for continuous and transparent assessments of workforce shortages and future staffing requirements."" The RCN's acting general secretary, Pat Cullen, said: ""The unprecedented demand on nursing staff during the pandemic has had a huge impact on their own well-being. ""But, as this report shows, the cracks in the systems designed to look after nursing staff appeared years ago.""

Wills and Joseph Lee. The page was edited by Julian Joyce. We're wrapping up our live coverage in a short while, so here's a look back at some of the main stories of the day: Guidance recommending face masks in classrooms and communal areas was withdrawn on 17 May Unions representing teachers and support staff are calling for face masks to be used again in England's classrooms and vaccines to be given to pupils amid rising school absence due to Covid-19. The National Education Union, Unison, GMB and Unite say in a joint statement that more pupils are ""likely to be off self-isolating and missing out on face to face education"" in the coming weeks. Government figures showed attendance dropped at state schools in England in the week before half-term as more pupils were forced to self-isolate amid rising cases driven by the spread of the Delta variant, first identified in India. The unions say they are deeply concerned, with the health secretary having acknowledged a ""huge proportion"" of the latest cases are children, who ""pass the virus to the local community and face risks from long Covid"". They want the recommendaton for face masks in secondary schools and colleges to be reinstated after the Department for Education withdrew that part of its guidance on 17 May. And they say that pupils should be offered the vaccine, as they are in several other countries, following the approval of the Pfizer jab for children aged 12 and over. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill thanked Northern Ireland's healthcare workers There are no longer any Covid-19 patients in intensive care units in Northern Ireland, according to Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. She said it is the first time in ten months the coronavirus patient count in intensive care has been zero. ""A massive thank you to our healthcare
workers for their efforts - let's keep playing our part and making
progress,""she said on Twitter,external. Northern Ireland recorded another 81 confirmed cases today, but there were no deaths reported. There are currently 15 patients in non-ICU beds. Mobile testing units are being used in Kilkeen, County Down, after a small number of possible cases of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India. England's Euro 2020 group games at Wembley Stadium will be the first sporting event at which vaccine passports will be used in the UK. UK-based ticket holders must show proof of full vaccination, with both doses having been received at least 14 days before the match. Those not fully vaccinated must show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours. England play Croatia in their opening group game on Sunday. Ticket holders for matches taking place at Hampden Park will not be required to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test. Wembley will host a maximum of 22,500 fans - 25% of its capacity - for England's group D fixtures against Croatia, Scotland and Czech Republic. The stadium is also due to host a last-16 tie as well as both semi-finals and the final. Read more. Local public health directors will be able to reintroduce face coverings in communal areas in schools if they want to Measures to try to halt the rise of the variant of coronavirus first identified in India will cover 10% of England's population, as Matt Hancock said there was a ""challenging decision"" to be made over the further lifting of Covid restrictions later this month. The Health Secretary announced that a ""strengthened package of support"" will be provided for Greater Manchester and Lancashire, similar to that seen in Bolton, where case numbers remain high. It means 5.7 million people are now under what mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham stressed was ""not a lockdown"" but ""advice"".

Less than a quarter of pubsare confident they will survive the next three months, official figures show. Only 24% have a high level of faith they will still be in business at the end of the summer, compared with 44% for all types of company. The figures,external, from the Office for National Statistics, are however a big improvement on previous surveys. Last October, the ONS found just six per cent of pubs were highly confident of survival - by February that was just one per cent. As non-essential businesses, pubs and bars have faced prolonged closures since the pandemic began in March 2020 and have had to lay off or furlough tens of thousands of workers. Despite reopening to outdoor drinkers on 12 April, and indoors from 17 May, the ONS said many establishments still reported ""significant profit losses"" last month. The seven-day average for cases is up 60.6%, with the increase in infections partly attributed to the greater transmissibility of the Delta variant. The figures also show there were another 112,941 first doses of the vaccine delivered and 306,068 second doses. It means in total there have now been 40,573,517 first doses - equivalent to 77% of the adult population and 28,227,362 second doses, or 53.6% of the adult population.  There have been a further 6,048 coronavirus cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according toTuesdayâs daily government figures,external. On Monday 5,683 cases and one death was reported. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent The Polish health ministry has announced it is shortening the time period between doses of vaccinations. The second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will now be given after a minimum 21 days, and the Moderna vaccine can be administered after 28 days. Previously, the earliest the second dose could be given was 35 days. The AstraZeneca vaccination interval will remain at 35 days. This week, Poland began giving vaccinations to 12-15 year olds. Previously, the rollout was hampered by a lack of vaccine supplies. Now, the main challenge is persuading people to have the vaccination, ministry officials say. To date, 47% of adult Poles have received one dose and 26.6% are fully vaccinated. Mabel, Ed Sheeran and Stormzy can play Liechtenstein without obtaining expensive work permits On Friday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden announced that a new frontier had been opened for British musicians who want to play live in Europe. Thanks to ""ambitious"" negotiations,he said,external, artists and their crews can now tour without visa requirements in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The deal comes after Brexit meant performers must obtain costly permits to play in many European countries. But touring musicians called Dowden's announcement ""tragic"" and ""a joke"". ""Iceland's population is roughly the same as Wigan. Liechtenstein has a similar number of residents as Wilmslow,""said The Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess,external. ""If it wasn't tragic it would be funny."" Read more  Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst In the last 24 hours, China
has recorded 33 new cases, 19 domestic cases, and 14 imports of Covid. Currently, there are
only two Chinese cities with local lockdown measures in place due to recent
outbreaks: Guangzhou and Foshan; both in southern Guangdong province. A Foshan-based artist
is going viral for his tribute piece to front-line medical workers. The artwork - by Chen Zhijie - looks like one of Chinaâs most famous
paintings, ""Along the River during the Qingming Festival"". But this version features
15 Foshan landmarks and 340 medical workers, who are helping people in the city
to get tested and vaccinated. China has now administered more than 794 million vaccine doses,external. On average, it is delivering around 20 million doses a day, and this number is set to rise, given that the government approved the use of vaccines on 3-17 year olds on Monday. But there are still concerns about how vaccination is being carried out, and whether people could be unfairly discriminated against if they donât get vaccinated. A shopping centre in eastern Shanghai is receiving criticism for denying entry to people who have not been vaccinated. It has since been asked to rectify its practices,the Global Times newspaper reports,external. In April,a town in southern Hainan apologised,external, after reports it âblacklistedâ local people who had not been vaccinated, and prevented them from entering restaurants and supermarkets. Scotland will start to vaccinate children aged between 12 and 15 as quickly as possible if experts recommend it, Nicola Sturgeon says. The Pfizer-BionTech vaccine was approved for use among this age group by the UK's medicine regulator last week. The Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on whether it should begin vaccinating children. Sturgeon says the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated. But she told the Scottish Parliament that if the JCVI recommends the use of the vaccine for children over the age of 12, the country would ""move as quickly as possible to implement the advice"". Andy Burnham said the new guidance was not a lockdown More from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. He said it was ""very important to keep a sense of proportion"" about the new advice. He said: ""This is guidance, it is advice to the public. It is not a lockdown. It is not a ban... this is not about telling people to cancel their plans, it is about asking them to be careful in setting any new ones, to minimise non-essential travel."" He said it was a ""sensible approach given the rise in cases that we've seen"" and that he was grateful to the government and Health Secretary Matt Hancock for the ""joint approach that has been taken to date"". Andy Burnham said he wanted to run a surge vaccination programme over the next three weeks Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has been giving a news conference afterupdated guidance was issued to the area and parts of Lancashireamid a rise in the Delta variant. He called for the government to allow the ""bringing forward"" of supplies of vaccines to the region to allow clinicians to accelerate the delivery of the jab. Burnham said: ""Obviously what we're seeing here is a localised approach to messaging, more localised support on testing and on tracing and isolation. We are also saying that also should apply to vaccination. ""We are not asking for any more vaccine here than our fair share - what we are asking for is the bringing forward of Greater Manchester's supplies so that we can run a surge vaccination programme over the next three weeks."" Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russia is preparing to offer package tours for foreign
nationals willing to get jabbed with one of Russian coronavirus vaccines,
reports say. Tour operators have already drafted their proposals and are
working with the government to âsort out visa support and legal entry issuesâ,
says Andrei Ignatyev, the head of the Russian Tourist Industry Union. Official news agency RIA Novosti quoted him as saying that
two types of vaccine tours were currently being considered. The first one costs between $1,500 and $2,500, excluding
flights. It involves a stay of 21 days in Russia, which is the recommended
interval between the first and second doses of the Sputnik V vaccine.
Sightseeing is included in the tour. The second option costs from $700 and involves two trips of
three days, one for each dose. The tours will mainly be targeted at residents of countries
with relatively low vaccination rates, Ignatyev says.  UK holidaymakers returning from Portugal now have to go straight home and self-isolate. Many couldn't afford the air-fare to get back earlier - like Yasmin Iqbal, 31, from Crawley, West Sussex. She was in Porto for three days, with her mother and nine-month-old daughter, to visit her grandmother, who has cancer. Speaking at Gatwick Airport this morning, she told the PA news agency she was due to return to work after maternity leave and her daughter was due to start nursery but she's had to delay both. ""We looked at flights to come back on Monday, it was Â£500 or more, as soon as you click on it, it just goes. ""It was just no option but to stick with what we were doing."" Ms Iqbal says her trip was booked a long time ago and she criticised the ""ridiculous"" and ""completely confusing"" rules, saying it was ""so difficult"" to get back before the rules changed at 04:00 BST. ""I've now got to sit at home with my daughter for 10 days when I've been in a country that's probably safer than this country,"" she says. Hospitals in Kenya are stepping up preparations for an expected surge in coronavirus infections, increasing bed capacity and stocking up on oxygen supplies,according to the country's Star newspaper,external. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe and other experts have warned of a likely increase in infections. He did not predict when the wave would begin, but Kenya's health research institute has warned that it will begin this month until August, the newspaper says. One city, Kisumu, has seen cases quadruple in the past month. Only a small fraction of Kenyans have been vaccinated and doses are in very short supply. The World Health Organization (WHO) had last week urged African nations to boost critical care capacity in hospitals as vaccination efforts in the continent have slowed down over delays in supply. âWeak observance of preventive measures, increased population movement and interaction as well as well as the arrival of winter in southern Africa have heightened the risk of Covid-19 resurgence in many countries,âthe WHO said in a statement,external. The continent has in the last two weeks recorded a 20% increase in cases compared with the previous fortnight, according to the WHO. Boris Johnson has told members of his Cabinet that the data needs to continue to be scrutinised ahead of any decision on lifting Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The PM told ministers that ""while the relationship between cases and hospitalisations has changed, we must continue to look at the data carefully ahead of making a decision on Step 4"". Some pubs and restaurant owners in England says their efforts to make up for lost time and money during lockdown are being hampered by booked-in customers not turning up. Becky King, general manager of the Anchor Inn in Nayland, Suffolk, says she had about 100 no-shows last weekend. The 33-year-old says the pub is now thinking about taking deposits, although they ""really don't want to"". ""We are casual dining and we don't want to put that in place, but to protect ourselves and the business, that's something we may have to do,"" she says. What are the Covid rules for restaurants and pubs?Read more here. Long-established Suffolk restaurateur Ruth Watson - former star of Channel 5's The Hotel Inspector - says her Italian restaurant Watson and Walpole in Framlingham has been plagued by no-shows. They have started to take card details for all bookings and a deposit of Â£25 for all Friday and Saturday dinner reservations and Sunday lunch. ""I don't know why people don't take it seriously.

Wills and Joseph Lee. The page was edited by Julian Joyce. We're wrapping up our live coverage in a short while, so here's a look back at some of the main stories of the day: Guidance recommending face masks in classrooms and communal areas was withdrawn on 17 May Unions representing teachers and support staff are calling for face masks to be used again in England's classrooms and vaccines to be given to pupils amid rising school absence due to Covid-19. The National Education Union, Unison, GMB and Unite say in a joint statement that more pupils are ""likely to be off self-isolating and missing out on face to face education"" in the coming weeks. Government figures showed attendance dropped at state schools in England in the week before half-term as more pupils were forced to self-isolate amid rising cases driven by the spread of the Delta variant, first identified in India. The unions say they are deeply concerned, with the health secretary having acknowledged a ""huge proportion"" of the latest cases are children, who ""pass the virus to the local community and face risks from long Covid"". They want the recommendaton for face masks in secondary schools and colleges to be reinstated after the Department for Education withdrew that part of its guidance on 17 May. And they say that pupils should be offered the vaccine, as they are in several other countries, following the approval of the Pfizer jab for children aged 12 and over. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill thanked Northern Ireland's healthcare workers There are no longer any Covid-19 patients in intensive care units in Northern Ireland, according to Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. She said it is the first time in ten months the coronavirus patient count in intensive care has been zero. ""A massive thank you to our healthcare
workers for their efforts - let's keep playing our part and making
progress,""she said on Twitter,external. Northern Ireland recorded another 81 confirmed cases today, but there were no deaths reported. There are currently 15 patients in non-ICU beds. Mobile testing units are being used in Kilkeen, County Down, after a small number of possible cases of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India. England's Euro 2020 group games at Wembley Stadium will be the first sporting event at which vaccine passports will be used in the UK. UK-based ticket holders must show proof of full vaccination, with both doses having been received at least 14 days before the match. Those not fully vaccinated must show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours. England play Croatia in their opening group game on Sunday. Ticket holders for matches taking place at Hampden Park will not be required to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test. Wembley will host a maximum of 22,500 fans - 25% of its capacity - for England's group D fixtures against Croatia, Scotland and Czech Republic. The stadium is also due to host a last-16 tie as well as both semi-finals and the final. Read more.

Previously, the earliest the second dose could be given was 35 days. The AstraZeneca vaccination interval will remain at 35 days. This week, Poland began giving vaccinations to 12-15 year olds. Previously, the rollout was hampered by a lack of vaccine supplies. Now, the main challenge is persuading people to have the vaccination, ministry officials say. To date, 47% of adult Poles have received one dose and 26.6% are fully vaccinated.

Thanks to ""ambitious"" negotiations,he said,external, artists and their crews can now tour without visa requirements in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The deal comes after Brexit meant performers must obtain costly permits to play in many European countries. But touring musicians called Dowden's announcement ""tragic"" and ""a joke"".

has recorded 33 new cases, 19 domestic cases, and 14 imports of Covid. Currently, there are
only two Chinese cities with local lockdown measures in place due to recent
outbreaks: Guangzhou and Foshan; both in southern Guangdong province. A Foshan-based artist
is going viral for his tribute piece to front-line medical workers. The artwork - by Chen Zhijie - looks like one of Chinaâs most famous
paintings, ""Along the River during the Qingming Festival"". But this version features
15 Foshan landmarks and 340 medical workers, who are helping people in the city
to get tested and vaccinated. China has now administered more than 794 million vaccine doses,external. On average, it is delivering around 20 million doses a day, and this number is set to rise, given that the government approved the use of vaccines on 3-17 year olds on Monday. But there are still concerns about how vaccination is being carried out, and whether people could be unfairly discriminated against if they donât get vaccinated. A shopping centre in eastern Shanghai is receiving criticism for denying entry to people who have not been vaccinated. It has since been asked to rectify its practices,the Global Times newspaper reports,external. In April,a town in southern Hainan apologised,external, after reports it âblacklistedâ local people who had not been vaccinated, and prevented them from entering restaurants and supermarkets. Scotland will start to vaccinate children aged between 12 and 15 as quickly as possible if experts recommend it, Nicola Sturgeon says. The Pfizer-BionTech vaccine was approved for use among this age group by the UK's medicine regulator last week. The Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on whether it should begin vaccinating children. Sturgeon says the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated. But she told the Scottish Parliament that if the JCVI recommends the use of the vaccine for children over the age of 12, the country would ""move as quickly as possible to implement the advice"". Andy Burnham said the new guidance was not a lockdown More from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. He said it was ""very important to keep a sense of proportion"" about the new advice. He said: ""This is guidance, it is advice to the public. It is not a lockdown. It is not a ban... this is not about telling people to cancel their plans, it is about asking them to be careful in setting any new ones, to minimise non-essential travel."" He said it was a ""sensible approach given the rise in cases that we've seen"" and that he was grateful to the government and Health Secretary Matt Hancock for the ""joint approach that has been taken to date"". Andy Burnham said he wanted to run a surge vaccination programme over the next three weeks Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has been giving a news conference afterupdated guidance was issued to the area and parts of Lancashireamid a rise in the Delta variant. He called for the government to allow the ""bringing forward"" of supplies of vaccines to the region to allow clinicians to accelerate the delivery of the jab. Burnham said: ""Obviously what we're seeing here is a localised approach to messaging, more localised support on testing and on tracing and isolation. We are also saying that also should apply to vaccination. ""We are not asking for any more vaccine here than our fair share - what we are asking for is the bringing forward of Greater Manchester's supplies so that we can run a surge vaccination programme over the next three weeks."" Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russia is preparing to offer package tours for foreign
nationals willing to get jabbed with one of Russian coronavirus vaccines,
reports say. Tour operators have already drafted their proposals and are
working with the government to âsort out visa support and legal entry issuesâ,
says Andrei Ignatyev, the head of the Russian Tourist Industry Union. Official news agency RIA Novosti quoted him as saying that
two types of vaccine tours were currently being considered. The first one costs between $1,500 and $2,500, excluding
flights. It involves a stay of 21 days in Russia, which is the recommended
interval between the first and second doses of the Sputnik V vaccine.
Sightseeing is included in the tour. The second option costs from $700 and involves two trips of
three days, one for each dose. The tours will mainly be targeted at residents of countries
with relatively low vaccination rates, Ignatyev says.  UK holidaymakers returning from Portugal now have to go straight home and self-isolate. Many couldn't afford the air-fare to get back earlier - like Yasmin Iqbal, 31, from Crawley, West Sussex. She was in Porto for three days, with her mother and nine-month-old daughter, to visit her grandmother, who has cancer. Speaking at Gatwick Airport this morning, she told the PA news agency she was due to return to work after maternity leave and her daughter was due to start nursery but she's had to delay both. ""We looked at flights to come back on Monday, it was Â£500 or more, as soon as you click on it, it just goes. ""It was just no option but to stick with what we were doing."" Ms Iqbal says her trip was booked a long time ago and she criticised the ""ridiculous"" and ""completely confusing"" rules, saying it was ""so difficult"" to get back before the rules changed at 04:00 BST. ""I've now got to sit at home with my daughter for 10 days when I've been in a country that's probably safer than this country,"" she says. Hospitals in Kenya are stepping up preparations for an expected surge in coronavirus infections, increasing bed capacity and stocking up on oxygen supplies,according to the country's Star newspaper,external. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe and other experts have warned of a likely increase in infections. He did not predict when the wave would begin, but Kenya's health research institute has warned that it will begin this month until August, the newspaper says. One city, Kisumu, has seen cases quadruple in the past month. Only a small fraction of Kenyans have been vaccinated and doses are in very short supply. The World Health Organization (WHO) had last week urged African nations to boost critical care capacity in hospitals as vaccination efforts in the continent have slowed down over delays in supply. âWeak observance of preventive measures, increased population movement and interaction as well as well as the arrival of winter in southern Africa have heightened the risk of Covid-19 resurgence in many countries,âthe WHO said in a statement,external. The continent has in the last two weeks recorded a 20% increase in cases compared with the previous fortnight, according to the WHO. Boris Johnson has told members of his Cabinet that the data needs to continue to be scrutinised ahead of any decision on lifting Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The PM told ministers that ""while the relationship between cases and hospitalisations has changed, we must continue to look at the data carefully ahead of making a decision on Step 4"". Some pubs and restaurant owners in England says their efforts to make up for lost time and money during lockdown are being hampered by booked-in customers not turning up. Becky King, general manager of the Anchor Inn in Nayland, Suffolk, says she had about 100 no-shows last weekend. The 33-year-old says the pub is now thinking about taking deposits, although they ""really don't want to"". ""We are casual dining and we don't want to put that in place, but to protect ourselves and the business, that's something we may have to do,"" she says.

Long-established Suffolk restaurateur Ruth Watson - former star of Channel 5's The Hotel Inspector - says her Italian restaurant Watson and Walpole in Framlingham has been plagued by no-shows. They have started to take card details for all bookings and a deposit of Â£25 for all Friday and Saturday dinner reservations and Sunday lunch. ""I don't know why people don't take it seriously.

"Hundreds arrested in massive global crime stingCriminals were lured into using the FBI-run ANOM app, where their messages were monitored.World","This video can not be played Hundreds of people in 18 countries were detained More than 800 suspected criminals have been arrested worldwide after being tricked into using an FBI-run encrypted messaging app, officials say. The operation, jointly conceived by Australia and the FBI, saw devices with the ANOM app secretly distributed among criminals, allowing police to monitor their chats about drug smuggling, money laundering and even murder plots. Officials called it a watershed moment. Targets included drug gangs and people with links to the mafia. Drugs, weapons, luxury vehicles and cash were also seized in the operation, which was conducted across more than a dozen countries. This included eight tonnes of cocaine, 250 guns and more than $48m (Â£34m) in various worldwide currencies and cryptocurrencies. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the operation had ""struck a heavy blow against organised crime"" around the world. European Union police agency Europol described Operation Trojan Shield/Greenlight as the ""biggest ever law enforcement operation against encrypted communication"". The FBI began operating an encrypted device network called ANOM, and covertly distributed devices with the chat app among the criminal underworld via informants. The idea for the operation came after two other encrypted platforms were taken down by law enforcement agencies, leaving criminal gangs in the market for new secure phones. The devices were initially used by alleged senior crime figures, giving other criminals the confidence to use the platform. The man who accidentally helped FBI spread spy app ""You had to know a criminal to get hold of one of these customised phones. The phones couldn't ring or email. You could only communicate with someone on the same platform,"" the Australian police explained. Items seized in the sting included motorbikes and money Australian fugitive and alleged drug trafficker Hakan Ayik was key to the sting, having unwittingly recommended the app to criminal associates after being given a handset by undercover officers, police said. Dubbed the ""Facebook gangster"" by Australian media outlets, Ayik is seen in social media photographs with large tattoos and a muscular physique. Local outlets say he has been living in Turkey since evading arrest, living a luxury lifestyle with a Dutch wife. Police said he was ""best off handing himself into us"" as soon as possible, as he may be in danger himself, having unwittingly helped the FBI with their sting. In total, some 12,000 encrypted devices were used by around 300 criminal syndicates in more than 100 countries. This is a fascinating example of law enforcement, perhaps growing tired of wrangling with US tech giants over accessing encrypted data and locked devices, taking matters into its own hands. Running a sort of WhatsApp platform for criminals is a bold move, and getting bespoke handsets into the hands of the very law-breakers they were trying to catch, was ambitious, to say the least. Officials reportedly took control of a communications firm called ANOM around three years ago, after a convicted criminal promised them access to it in return for a more lenient sentence. The devices were billed as super-secure and had a very specific target market - organised crime groups. The authorities even took advantage of a current trend in Silicon Valley - they charged a monthly subscription for the product. Officers were able to read millions of messages in ""real time"" describing murder plots, mass drug import plans and other schemes. ""All they talk about is drugs, violence, hits on each other, innocent people who are going to be murdered, a whole range of things,"" said Australian Federal Police commissioner Reece Kershaw. In total, some 9,000 police officers around the world were involved in the sting. Calvin Shivers of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division said the operation had enabled police agencies to ""turn the tables on criminal organisations"", with intelligence gathered preventing murders and a number of other crimes. ""We were actually able to see photographs of hundreds of tons of cocaine that were concealed in shipments of fruit,"" he said. Among the items seized was memorabilia from The Godfather Statements from law enforcement agencies did not name any of those arrested in the sting. In Australia, 224 people were arrested including members of outlaw motorcycle gangs, mafia groups, Asian crime syndicates, and serious and organised crime groups. Police said they also seized three tonnes of drugs and A$45m (Â£25m; $35m) in cash and assets, and acted on 20 ""threats to kill"", potentially saving the lives of a ""significant number of innocent bystanders"". Mr Morrison said the sting, which was called Operation Ironside, was ""a watershed moment in Australian law enforcement history"". New Zealand police said 35 people in the country had been arrested, and about NZ$3.7m (Â£1.9m, $2.7m) of assets seized. ""We believe the termination of these operations will have a significant impact on New Zealand's organised crime scene,"" National Organised Crime Group Director Detective Superintendent Greg Williams said. In the US, the FBI unsealed an indictment against 17 people for distributing the ANOM-enabled devices - eight have so far been arrested, while the rest are on the run. The FBI is expected to present more details later on Tuesday. Europol's deputy executive director Jean-Philippe Lecouffe described the operation as an ""exceptional success"". The agency did not break down the arrests in each country, but local officials said they included 70 people in Sweden and 49 in the Netherlands, according to Reuters news agency. Linda Staaf, the Swedish police's head of intelligence, said the operation had helped to prevent more than 10 planned murders in Sweden. Australian police arrest and confiscate.

NHS staff burn-out at an emergency level - report,"NHS and care staff in England are so burnt out that it has become an ""emergency"" and risks the future of the health service, MPs have warned. A highly critical report said workers were exhausted and overstretched because of staff shortages. It said the problems existed before the pandemic - although coronavirus has worsened the pressures. Doctors' and nursing unions welcomed the report, saying it highlighted the stress and anxiety facing staff. It has already been well documented that the NHS is short of staff. Last July, the health and social care committee - made up of MPs and chaired by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt - launched an inquiry to look at the issue, including how burnt out NHS staff were. Its report, published on Tuesday,,externalsaid one of the main problems was that there was no accurate forecast of how many staff the NHS needed for the next five to 10 years - something it called ""workforce planning"". It said there needed to be a ""total overhaul of the way the NHS does workforce planning"" - and there should be annual reports published on how many workers the NHS would need for the next five, 10 and 20 years. ""It is clear that workforce planning has been led by the funding envelope available to health and social care rather than by demand and the capacity required to service that demand,"" said the report. And it said that NHS workers needed to know there was a solution on its way to fix the staff shortages. NHS staff left 'traumatised' by first Covid wave Liz Stavacre, an intensive care nurse, said her unit had seen a lot of resignations, including people leaving nursing altogether ""because they're so burnt out and can't deal with it anymore"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's been a very difficult year. We're very tired - we're physically tired, we're emotionally tired, and there's very little time to take a break from what's happening."" Dr Rosemary Leonard says the biggest issue is the lack of manpower Dr Rosemary Leonard told BBC Breakfast it felt like her GP surgery had been ""under siege"" since the end of lockdown as people were coming in with ""shopping lists of problems and we just don't have the manpower to deal with it"". She said everybody in primary care was working ""incredibly long days"" and was under ""huge, huge pressure"". Asked what would help alleviate the stress, she said: ""It really is manpower."" Before the pandemic began, the NHS faced shortages of around one in 10 or one in 12 staff, the report said - and there were 50,000 nursing posts unfilled in the UK. Meanwhile in adult social care, 7.3% of roles had been vacant during the financial year 2019-20, equivalent to around 112,000 vacancies at any one time, the report heard. According to the NHS staff survey in 2020, 44% of staff reported feeling unwell as a result of work-related stress in the previous year. Mr Hunt told the Today programme that a shortage of NHS staff was ""the single biggest problem"" as far as staff well-being was concerned. He said there weren't enough doctors or nurses in ""nearly every medical specialty"" but tackling the issue was ""never enough of a priority"" for the government because the amount of years required to train up staff meant there weren't immediate results. He added that training more doctors and nurses would save money in the long run as it would avoid the need to employ temporary staff which ""ends up costing tax payers much more"". This video can not be played WATCH: ICU hospital staff ""scared, sad, petrified, worried"" Many groups representing doctors have warned that having stressed and unwell staff risks safe patient care. The chairman of the Royal College of GPs, Prof Martin Marshall, said: ""We simply don't have enough GPs or other members of the practice team to meet demand and general practice is only set to get busier as we support our communities' recovery from the pandemic."" And Dr David Wrigley from the British Medical Association said: ""Health and care staff suffered stress and work-related anxiety before the pandemic but it is now far more serious and we believe the current level of staff burnout and stress presents a worrying risk to the future functioning of the health and care system and safe patient care. ""There's an urgent need to address the severe workforce crisis facing health and care services, and - as called for by the BMA and others - the report also calls for continuous and transparent assessments of workforce shortages and future staffing requirements."" The RCN's acting general secretary, Pat Cullen, said: ""The unprecedented demand on nursing staff during the pandemic has had a huge impact on their own well-being. ""But, as this report shows, the cracks in the systems designed to look after nursing staff appeared years ago.""

Harris tells Guatemala migrants: 'Do not come',"This video can not be played Kamala Harris to illegal migrants: 'Do not come' US Vice President Kamala Harris has urged would-be migrants in Guatemala not to try to enter the United States illegally. Speaking on her first overseas trip since taking office, she said the journey north was dangerous and would mainly benefit people smugglers. Ms Harris warned people they would be turned back at the border. She has been tasked by President Joe Biden with controlling a surge in migration at the southern border. Ms Harris has described her task as finding solutions to tackle the root causes of the border crisis, including corruption and the lack of economic opportunities. Her staff say this first visit is primarily an information-gathering trip. In a news conference alongside Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, she warned against illegal migration to the US, saying: ""Do not come. Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our borders."" She added: ""If you come to our border, you will be turned back."" What is Biden doing differently at US border? Joe Biden's 'big problem' at the US border What voters think of Biden immigration policy Ms Harris said she wanted the US and Guatemala to ""work together"" to find solutions to ""long-standing problems"". She said people must be given a ""sense of hope that help is on the way"". ""It must be coupled with relationships of trust. It must be coupled with tangible outcomes, in terms of what we do as leaders to convince people that there is a reason to be hopeful about their future and the future of their children,"" Ms Harris added. President Giammattei defended his government's own record of fighting corruption and said the fight against drug trafficking should be an key part of tackling the issue. He announced a new processing centre for migrants who had been sent back from the US and Mexico and said that the focus for both countries should be on creating prosperity. Ms Harris said the US would send 500,000 coronavirus vaccines to Guatemala and provide $26m (Â£18.3m) to fight the pandemic there. The region has been hard hit by the virus, further worsening living conditions. She also met civil society leaders and entrepreneurs in the country before travelling on to Mexico where she will hold talks with President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador on Tuesday. President Biden has been criticised by Republicans who accuse him of ignoring the crisis on the southern border. But in a recent speech to Congress, he said: ""When I was vice president, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked."" For the Guatemalan government, there will have been some satisfaction in being the hosts of the vice-president's first international visit. It is a sign of improved ties with Washington after the Trump administration. However, in reality, the Biden administration has few other feasible partners in the region, embroiled as they are in diplomatic tension or open conflict with the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua. The joint news conference revealed a number of things. Certainly the rhetoric from the Biden administration is more compassionate than over the past four years. The vice-president mentioned ""hunger, hurricanes and pandemic"" as ""acute"" drivers of migration, and talked of empowering the indigenous community in Guatemala. Certainly the promise of 500,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine from the US will have been welcomed as the region lags well behind much of the world on the road towards a fully-vaccinated society. But many Guatemalans will have met other measures with some scepticism. The proposed anti-trafficking and anti-smuggling measures will struggle to unpick the sophisticated criminal networks, which run the migrant and drug routes north. Despite much talk of creating jobs and incentives inside Guatemala, many know that Washington's plan also involves bolstering the police and security forces to better prevent migrants from leaving in the first place. And the promise of hundreds of millions in development aid will also ring alarm bells over exactly how those funds will be administered. Indeed, the discussion of a corruption task force appeared to touch a raw nerve with President Giammattei, who became defensive as he denied ""meddling"" in the work of anti-graft prosecutors in the country. If nothing else, this trip has underlined the scale of the task ahead. The border More than 178,000 migrants arrived at the border this April, the highest one-month total in more than two decades, according to US border officials.

Workers watchdog launched to clamp down on abuse,"The government plans to launch a new workers' watchdog to take over protecting the rights of UK workers. The new body will be responsible for tackling modern slavery, enforcing the minimum wage and protecting agency workers. Currently these tasks are spread across three different bodies. It said it was looking at extra curbs targeting the garment sector including banning sales if brands' behaviour does not improve. The government is looking at these specific measures after reports of serious problems in the industry, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said. One of the leading online fashion retailers, Boohoo, came in for heavy criticism after concerns were raised that workers at its Leicester suppliers were being underpaid and not being protected against Covid-19 during the pandemic. It was alleged last year that some factories in the UK working for the firmwere paying staff as little as Â£3.50 an hourand had working conditions that did not meet Covid guidelines. Boohoo has said it is committed to raising standards and monitoring its suppliers more closely After an internal review, it cut its supplier network from an estimated 500 firmsto under 100 following the allegations. Boohoo said earlier this year that if it were to discover any suggestion of modern day slavery it would ""immediately disclose this to the relevant authorities."" The government said it was looking into either creating a Garment Trade Adjudicator to investigate companies' supply chains, or it could extend an agricultural licensing scheme. Under that scheme, businesses who provide agricultural workers must have a license, and can be inspected to make sure they are meeting employment standards. If brands' behaviour doesn't improve, the government warned it could introduce harsher measures, including bans on goods made in factories where workers have been underpaid. Job vacancies soar as skills shortage bites Workers 'sleeping on mattresses' inside factory Job placement scheme 'taking too long' Business minister Paul Scully said: ""This government has been absolutely clear that we will do whatever we can to protect and enhance workers' rights. ""The vast majority of businesses want to do right by their staff, but there are a minority who seem to think the law doesn't apply to them. Exploitative practices like modern slavery have no place in society."" He added that the new watchdog would enable the government to ""take action against companies that turn a blind eye to abuses in their supply chains"". The government also says the new watchdog will make it possible for vulnerable workers to get the holiday pay and statutory sick pay they are entitled to, without having to go through a lengthy employment tribunal process. Previously, the rights of UK workers were split into three bodies - the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate and HMRC's National Minimum Wage Enforcement. The new workers' watchdog will provide guidance to businesses on best practice, complementing existing work already being carried out by independent bodies like the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas). It will also have enforcement powers and will continue the government's existing Naming and Shaming scheme run by the Low Pay Commission, which in December 2020 named 139 businesses for failing to pay the national minimum wage.

How's my country doing?,"When it comes to the coronavirus vaccine there is one question most people are asking - when will I get it? A handful of countries have set very specific vaccination targets, but for the rest of the world the picture is less clear. Getting the world vaccinated against Covid-19 is a matter of life and death, involving complicated scientific processes, multinational corporations, government promises and backroom deals. So figuring out when and how everyone in the world will get the vaccine is not easy. Agathe Demarais is the director of global forecasting at the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has done some of the most comprehensive research on the topic. She has looked at the world's production capacity, along with the healthcare facilities needed to get vaccines into people's arms, the number of people a country has to contend with, and what they can afford. Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? The vaccines that work - and the others on the way Many of the findings seem to fall along predictable lines of rich v poor. The UK and the US are both well supplied with vaccines right now because they could afford to invest a lot of money into vaccine development and put themselves at the front of the queue. Rich countries that didn't do that, like Canada or those in the EU bloc, are a little further behind. Canada was criticised at the end of last year for buying up five times the supply it needs to cover its population, but it seems it wasn't positioned for priority delivery. That's partly because the country decided to invest in vaccines from European factories, afraid that the US under Donald Trump would issue export bans. It turned out to be a bad bet. European factories are struggling with supply and recently it has been the EU, not the US, that has been threatening export bans. ""As long as the European market doesn't have enough vaccines, I think that big imports to Canada are going to remain off the cards,"" says Ms Demarais. Most low-income countries haven't started vaccinating yet. But some countries in the middle are doing better than expected.       Source: Our World in Data  Serbia is eighth in the worldin terms of the percentage of its population vaccinated, ahead of any country in the EU. Its success is partly down to an efficient roll-out but it's also benefitting from vaccine diplomacy - a battle between Russia and China for influence in eastern Europe. It's one of the few places where the Russian vaccine Sputnik V and the Chinese vaccine SinoPharm are already available. On paper, Serbians are given a choice of what vaccine they would prefer - Pfizer, Sputnik or SinoPharm. In reality, most people end up being given SinoPharm. And the influence China is exerting here is likely to be long-term. Countries giving a first and second dose of one of theChinese vaccinesare also likely to look to Beijing for booster doses if needed. India: How do you vaccinate a billions people? Africa's long wait for the Covid-19 vaccine What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? The United Arab Emirates is also relying heavily on the SinoPharm vaccine - it makes up 80% of the doses being administered there right now. And the UAE is building a SinoPharm production facility. ""China is coming with production facilities, trained workers, so it's going to give long-term influence to China,"" says Ms Demarais. ""And it will make it very, very tricky for recipient governments to say no to China for anything in the future."" Being a global vaccine superpower, however, doesn't mean your population will be vaccinated first. The EIU's research predicts two of the world's vaccine production powerhouses, China and India, may not be sufficiently vaccinated until the end of 2022. That's because they have huge populations to contend with, as well as a shortage of health workers. In India, the country's success as a Covid vaccine producer is largely down to one man, Adar Poonawalla. He's chief executive of the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine producer. Last year, his family started to think he has lost his mind when he began betting hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money on vaccines that he didn't know would work. In January, the first of those vaccines, developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca, was delivered to the Indian government. Now he's producing 2.4 million doses a day. He's one of two main suppliers to the Indian government - and is also supplying Brazil, Morocco, Bangladesh and South Africa. ""I thought the pressure and all the madness would end now that we've made the product,"" he says. ""But the real challenge is trying to keep everybody happy. ""I thought there'd be so many other manufacturers who would be able to supply. But sadly, at the moment at least, in the first quarter, and perhaps even the second quarter of 2021, we're not going to see a substantial increase in supply."" He says production cannot be ramped up overnight. ""It takes time,"" Mr Ponnawalla adds. ""People think that the Serum Institute has got a magic sauce. Yes, we're good at what we do but it's not a magic wand."" He currently has an edge because he started building facilities in March last year, as well as stockpiling things like chemicals and glass vials in August. For manufacturers starting production now, it will take months to produce vaccines. And the same applies to any boosters that might be needed to tackle new variants. Mr Ponnawalla says he is committed to supplying India and then Africa through a scheme called the Covax facility. Covax, an initiative led by the WHO and other health organisations, aims to get affordable vaccines to every country in the world. Countries that can't afford vaccines will get them for free through a special fund. The rest will pay. But the theory is that they will get a better price by negotiating through the bloc than if they had done so on their own. Covax is planning to start delivering vaccines this month. But the plan is being undermined by the fact many countries involved are also negotiating their own deals on the side. Mr Poonawalla says almost every leader in Africa has been in touch with him to access vaccines independently. Last week, Uganda announced it had secured 18 million doses from the Serum Institute at $7 a jab - much more than the $4 being paid by Covax. The institute says it is in talks with Uganda but denies this deal was ever signed. In total, Mr Poonawalla's firm is due to supply 200m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Covax and has promised 900m more doses in the future. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has since advised against rollout of the vaccine in countries where the South African strain is present. He says he is still committed to the scheme, but admits it faces problems. It's dealing with too many different vaccine producers, he says, each offering varying prices and timelines for delivery. Ms Demarais and the EIU are not overly optimistic about what Covax can achieve either. The timelines for delivery of vaccines are still not clear and even if things go according to plan, the scheme only aims to cover 20-27% of a country's population this year. ""It's going to make a small marginal difference, but not a game-changer,"" she says. In her forecast, some countries may not get widespread coverage even by 2023. Some may never be fully covered. Vaccination may not be a priority for every country, especially one that has a young population and is not seeing huge numbers of people getting sick. The problem with that scenario is as long as the virus can prosper somewhere it will be able to mutate and migrate. Vaccine-resistant variants will continue to evolve. It's not all bad news. Vaccines are being produced faster than ever but the scale of the task - inoculating 7.8 billion people around the world - is gigantic. And it's never been attempted before. Ms Demarais believes governments should level with their people on what is possible. ""It's very difficult for a government to say, 'No, we're not going to achieve widespread immunisation coverage before several years.' Nobody wants to say that.""

Harris tells Guatemala migrants: 'Do not come'The US vice-president uses her first official foreign visit to try to tackle the migrant crisis.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Kamala Harris to illegal migrants: 'Do not come' US Vice President Kamala Harris has urged would-be migrants in Guatemala not to try to enter the United States illegally. Speaking on her first overseas trip since taking office, she said the journey north was dangerous and would mainly benefit people smugglers. Ms Harris warned people they would be turned back at the border. She has been tasked by President Joe Biden with controlling a surge in migration at the southern border. Ms Harris has described her task as finding solutions to tackle the root causes of the border crisis, including corruption and the lack of economic opportunities. Her staff say this first visit is primarily an information-gathering trip. In a news conference alongside Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, she warned against illegal migration to the US, saying: ""Do not come. Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our borders."" She added: ""If you come to our border, you will be turned back."" What is Biden doing differently at US border? Joe Biden's 'big problem' at the US border What voters think of Biden immigration policy Ms Harris said she wanted the US and Guatemala to ""work together"" to find solutions to ""long-standing problems"". She said people must be given a ""sense of hope that help is on the way"". ""It must be coupled with relationships of trust. It must be coupled with tangible outcomes, in terms of what we do as leaders to convince people that there is a reason to be hopeful about their future and the future of their children,"" Ms Harris added. President Giammattei defended his government's own record of fighting corruption and said the fight against drug trafficking should be an key part of tackling the issue. He announced a new processing centre for migrants who had been sent back from the US and Mexico and said that the focus for both countries should be on creating prosperity. Ms Harris said the US would send 500,000 coronavirus vaccines to Guatemala and provide $26m (Â£18.3m) to fight the pandemic there. The region has been hard hit by the virus, further worsening living conditions. She also met civil society leaders and entrepreneurs in the country before travelling on to Mexico where she will hold talks with President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador on Tuesday. President Biden has been criticised by Republicans who accuse him of ignoring the crisis on the southern border. But in a recent speech to Congress, he said: ""When I was vice president, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked."" For the Guatemalan government, there will have been some satisfaction in being the hosts of the vice-president's first international visit. It is a sign of improved ties with Washington after the Trump administration. However, in reality, the Biden administration has few other feasible partners in the region, embroiled as they are in diplomatic tension or open conflict with the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua. The joint news conference revealed a number of things. Certainly the rhetoric from the Biden administration is more compassionate than over the past four years. The vice-president mentioned ""hunger, hurricanes and pandemic"" as ""acute"" drivers of migration, and talked of empowering the indigenous community in Guatemala. Certainly the promise of 500,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine from the US will have been welcomed as the region lags well behind much of the world on the road towards a fully-vaccinated society. But many Guatemalans will have met other measures with some scepticism. The proposed anti-trafficking and anti-smuggling measures will struggle to unpick the sophisticated criminal networks, which run the migrant and drug routes north. Despite much talk of creating jobs and incentives inside Guatemala, many know that Washington's plan also involves bolstering the police and security forces to better prevent migrants from leaving in the first place. And the promise of hundreds of millions in development aid will also ring alarm bells over exactly how those funds will be administered. Indeed, the discussion of a corruption task force appeared to touch a raw nerve with President Giammattei, who became defensive as he denied ""meddling"" in the work of anti-graft prosecutors in the country. If nothing else, this trip has underlined the scale of the task ahead. The border More than 178,000 migrants arrived at the border this April, the highest one-month total in more than two decades, according to US border officials. Thousands of asylum seekers from Central America head for the US-Mexico border Of those migrants, more than 40% originated from the Central American region known as the Northern Triangle: Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
