PM's aide Cummings calls for civil service changes,"The PM's senior adviser has called for changes to how government works, saying there are ""profound problems"" with how decisions are made. In ablog post,external, Dominic Cummings said the civil service lacked people with ""deep expertise in specific fields"". He said he wanted ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to work in government. But a civil servants' union said currently staff were recruited on merit and ""because of what you can do, not what you believe"". The union also said recruiting world-class experts is hampered by the ""government's failure to pay a market rate"". Is Cummings right about civil service churn? In an unusual move, Mr Cummings also called for people keen to work in Downing Street to get in touch with him via a private Gmail address. The former Vote Leave campaign director said he wanted to hear from ""an unusual set of people with different skills and backgrounds"", some to work as special advisers and ""perhaps some as officials"". He said No 10 was keen to recruit data scientists, software developers and economists to improve the performance of government. In his blog, Mr Cummings added: The aim of the new recruits is to improve performance but also make Mr Cummings himself ""much less important â and within a year largely redundant"" A junior applicant will become his personal assistant for a year - a role which will involve ""very interesting work and lots of uninteresting trivia that makes my life easier which you won't enjoy"". The job will be so exhausting that ""frankly it will be hard having a boy/girlfriend at all"" He also urged against applications from ""confident public school bluffers"" and added anyone who plays office politics ""will be discovered and immediately binned"" He wants to hire ""some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole"" Mr Cummings added that the Conservatives' 80-seat majority meant ministers would try to solve political problems without worrying about ""short-term unpopularity"". ""The point of this government is to do things differently and better and this always looks messy,"" he wrote. ""We do not care about trying to 'control the narrative' and all that New Labour junk."" Cummings: Anger at MPs over Brexit not surprising Who is Dominic Cummings? He added that officials should be encouraged to stay in their roles for longer so that they are able to build up expertise in particular policy areas. ""Shuffling some people who are expected to be general managers is a natural thing but it is clear Whitehall does this too much,"" he said. ""There are not enough people with deep expertise in specific fields."" Responding to the blog, the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said Mr Cummings had not clarified how new recruits would be selected or what their role within government would be. Dave Penman, the union's general secretary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The civil service is recruited on merit, it's a really fundamental principle. ""You are employed in the civil service because of what you can do, not what you believe."" ""If you surround yourself with people who are recruited simply because they believe the same as you believe, and whose employment is at your behest, is that the best way for the civil service or advisers to speak truth unto power? ""I don't think it is, and I think some of those approaches are quite dangerous as well."" In a statement, he added: ""It would be ironic if, in an attempt to bring in radical new thinking, Cummings was to surround himself with like-minded individuals - recruited for what they believe, not what they can do - and less able to provide the robust advice a minister may need, rather than simply the advice they want."" Mr Penman also said senior officials moved between different jobs in an effort to boost their pay after a ""decade of pay restraint"" within the civil service. Mr Cummings's desire to recruit experts might prove difficult because of pay rates, he added, which he said were ""typically half of those paid elsewhere"". ""All senior civil service roles are already open to external competition, yet time and again, government's failure to pay a market rate restricts the pool,"" he added. ""There's no word on this in his blog, or on addressing the longer term pay restraint that has created these issues."" It comes after Rachel Wolf, who co-wrote the Conservatives' election manifesto, said ""seismic"" changes to the civil service were being planned by No 10. Writingin the Daily Telegraph,external, Ms Wolf said Mr Cummings believed changing how government works was a ""prerequisite"" to delivering on promises made to the voters by the Conservatives during last month's election campaign. She said officials should get more training in science-related skills, and ""reorient"" policy decisions towards the public rather than ""special interests"". She also added that regularly moving civil servants between different departments ""kills institutional memory and expertise"". Dominic Cummings: How does he now earn a living?

TV star Ricki Lake has unveiled her new buzz cut after revealing she has been struggling with the ""quiet hell"" of hair loss for almost 30 years. The US talk show host, 51, who recently competed on X Factor: Celebrity in the UK, said the ordeal had made her feel suicidal on a few occasions. She wrote,external: ""It has been debilitating, embarrassing, painful, scary, depressing, lonely, all the things."" Posting new photos, she added: ""For 2020 and beyond, I want to be real."" Lake was praised on social media, including by many women who have experienced their own problems with hair loss. Ricki Lake backstage at The X Factor: Celebrity in mid-November Lake had been ""suffering mostly in silence"", she said, and ""almost no-one in my life knew the level of deep pain and trauma I was experiencing"". The TV personality traced her own issues back to playing Tracy Turnblad in the hit 1988 film Hairspray. ""They triple-processed and teased my then healthy virgin hair every 2 weeks"", she explained. Other factors included ""yo-yo dieting, hormonal birth control, radical weight fluctuations over the years, my pregnancies, genetics, stress, and hair dyes and extensions"". Hair treatments before appearing on TV shows, from her own talk show to Dancing With the Stars, also took their toll, she added. She has seen numerous doctors, had steroid shots in her head and taken ""all the supplements and then some"" in an attempt to stem the problem, she wrote. ""My hair would recover and then shed again. It was maddening."" Her hair started shedding again ""big time"" after her latest ""extreme diet"", when she lost 1st 6lb (9kg) in six weeks, which coincided with two months working in London, she said. ""This time, I say no more. I have to be set free."" by Health reporter Philippa Roxby Some types of hair loss in women can be temporary and caused by stress, cancer treatment, weight loss or a lack of iron. In these cases, the hair will usually start to grow back if the cause is addressed, or it may be part and parcel of growing older. Other types of hair loss are more permanent and caused by a medical condition. Alopecia is the general medical term for hair loss, and there are many different types. Female pattern hair loss is the most common type in women, affecting around half aged over 65 - although it can affect younger women too. There are treatments women can try, but they don't work for everyone and aren't normally available on the NHS. These include steroid injections, creams and hair transplants. Some women also wear wigs. You should see your GP about hair loss if you develop bald patches, lose hair in clumps or your head itches and burns. Women often feel distressed by losing their hair and joining a support group can help.

Blind sex offender cannot take guide dog to prison,"Neil Nellies was convicted of five sex offences following a trial A man who sexually abused a 10-year-old girl has been jailed for seven years. Neil Nellies, 42, who is registered blind, assaulted his young victim, who has since tried to take her own life, and ""stole her childhood"", Liverpool Crown Court heard. The crimes took place several years ago in Wilmslow, Cheshire, jurors heard. Nellies, who arrived at court with his guide dog Digby, was told prison rules meant he would not be able to have the dog in jail with him. Instead, the labrador will be retrained to help another blind person. ""I have the greatest concern that a man who for five years has had the benefit of a guide dog, giving him his freedom and mobility, will be taken into an environment which is wholly unfamiliar,"" said Nellies' barrister Rachel Shenton. She added she did not wish to downplay the effect of Nellies' behaviour on the victim, but ""prison for him will have a devastating impact"". She urged Judge Simon Berkson to suspend any jail term, arguing Nellies was already imprisoned by a degenerative eye disease. Nellies can currently make out large shapes but this will deteriorate in time, she said. But Judge Berkson refused due to the serious nature of the offences. He said the victim ""told her mother's friend that she was not 'her mother's little girl any more'"". ""You stole that girl's childhood,"" he told Nellies, of Lumley Road, Macclesfield. James Coutts, prosecuting, said the victim had suffered serious psychological harm. Nellies, who denied any wrongdoing, was convicted of five serious sexual offences after a trial. The court heard how Nellies had previously also suffered a stroke and had mental health issues, an emotionally unstable personality disorder and possible autism. Judge Berkson ordered Nellies to be placed on the sex offenders register for life and imposed an indefinite sexual harm prevention order and an extra year on licence.

Interpol issues notice for Carlos Ghosn arrest,"Carlos Ghosn, pictured making a media statement in April 2019, landed in Lebanon on New Year's Eve Lebanon has received a ""red notice"" from Interpol for the arrest of fugitive ex-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn. The request was received by Lebanon's internal security forces on Thursday and is yet to be referred to the judiciary, Reuters news agency reports. Mr Ghosn, who was facing trial in Japan for alleged financial misconduct, arrived in Beirut on New Year's Eve. The private jet on which he escaped reportedly landed in Istanbul first, prompting an investigation by Turkey. According to Turkish media, seven arrests have been made in connection with the case - four pilots, a cargo company manager and two airport workers. The car industry's driven 'cost killer' Carlos Ghosn and Japan's 'hostage justice' system Four charts on the scandal An Interpol ""red notice"" is a request to police across the world to provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender or other similar legal action. However, Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan. Ghosn was released on bail last April and reportedly spent months planning his escape The businessman holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, and has made extensive investments in banking and real estate in Lebanon. France has said it will not extradite him if he arrives in the country. Mr Ghosn had posted 1bn yen (Â£6.8m; $8.9m) in bail in Japan last April, ahead of his trial. He said on his arrival in Lebanon he had ""escaped injustice and political persecution"". On Thursday Mr Ghosn said media speculation that his wife had played a role in his escape was ""inaccurate and false"", adding: ""I alone arranged for my departure."" Meanwhile, two Lebanese lawyers lodged a criminal complaint against Mr Ghosn for visiting Israel in January 2008, the National News Agency reported. They argued he had defied a ban on nationals entering Israel, with which Lebanon is still technically at war. It is now up to Lebanon's public prosecutor's office to decide whether to uphold the complaint. According to Turkish media, Mr Ghosn's private jet landed at Istanbul's Ataturk airport at 05:30 (02:30 GMT) on Monday, having flown from Japan's Kansai airport in Osaka. The Hurriyet news website quoted interior ministry officials as saying that Turkish border police had not been told Mr Ghosn was on the plane and he had not been registered as entering or leaving the country. However, there has been no official comment on the case. French Finance Minister AgnÃ¨s Pannier-Runacher said Mr Ghosn ""should not have absconded from the Japanese justice system"", but added: ""France never extradites its nationals."" Mr Ghosn, who was also boss of French car-maker Renault, has been under investigation in France but no charges have been laid. Mr Ghosn had three passports - Brazilian, French and Lebanese - which had been surrendered to his legal team in Japan. The team maintains it was still in possession of them when he left. Media reports now say he may have legally been in possession of a fourth passport to show his identity on some internal trips within Japan, but it would have been in a locked box or case, and his lawyers would have had the code. There is no record of him using a passport to leave Japan, so investigators there believe he used illegal means. Reuters on Thursday quoted sources close to Mr Ghosn as saying he decided to flee after finding out his trial had been delayed until April 2021. This video can not be played Mr Ghosn's wife Carole told the BBC in June that Japanese officials were trying to humiliate her husband They said he was also ""distressed"" at being prevented from communicating with his wife, Carole, who is in Lebanon. There are reports that Mr Ghosn left Japan by hiding in a large musical instrument case, although his wifedescribed the reports as ""fiction"".,external Once considered a hero in Japan for turning around Nissan,Mr Ghosn spent 108 days in custodyafter his arrest in Tokyo in November 2018. Nissansacked him three days after his arrest. Prosecutors allege that he made a multi-million-dollar payment to a Nissan distributor in Oman. Nissan, meanwhile, has filed its own criminal complaint against Mr Ghosn, accusing him of diverting money from the company for his own personal enrichment. He is also accused of underreporting his own salary. Mr Ghosn denies all the charges.

Commuters hit by 2.7% rail fare rise,"Millions of commuters will have to pay an average of 2.7% more for train tickets from today. The rise,announced by industry body the Rail Delivery Group in November, is lower than the 3.1% increase at the start of last year. Train companies say it is the third year in a row that average fares have been held below RPI - the inflation measure on which rises are based. But many commuters face an increase of more than Â£100 for annual passes. In Wales, fares have bucked the trend of rising pricesin England and Scotland, with an average fall of 1% this year. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government was committed to ""putting passengers first"", by funding trials for flexible fares, for example. He said he planned to tackle the ""fragmented"" system and had begun the process toend the franchise for the rail service Northern, whose performance was ""completely unacceptable"". A final decision on the Northern franchise is expected in a ""matter of weeks"", according to BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge, aspassengers said they would be ""very happy"" to see it end. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast that the fare increases enabled investment in the railways that would yield improvements. ""You can judge me on this at the end of the year,"" he said. ""These changes are going to take time but I think people will see things moving in the right direction."" But Labour's shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the rise showed passengers were ""once again paying more for less under the Tories"". Independent watchdog Transport Focus says fewer than half of train journeys (47%) are rated as satisfactory value for money by passengers. Rail fares to go up across Scotland Welsh rail fares buck UK trend by falling Train company apologises for rise in delay claims More violent crime reported on British railways The watchdog's director, David Sidebottom, said: ""After a year of pretty poor performance in some areas, passengers just want a consistent day-to-day service they can rely on and a better chance of getting a seat."" He encouraged passengers to claim compensation for eligible delays in order to ""offset"" the cost of fare rises. Some annual passes go up by more than Â£100 Â£132Reading to London. Total  Â£4,736 Â£118Gloucester to Birmingham. Total Â£4,356 Â£116Glasgow to Edinburgh. Total Â£4,200 However, Robert Nisbet, director of nations and regions for Rail Delivery Group, said rail companies were investing in improving journeys while holding fare increases below inflation. He said 2020 will see 1,000 extra weekly services and 1,000 more carriages added to Britain's rail fleet. ""There is a record level of investment going into the railway at the moment,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""For people who do suffer from poor punctuality in areas of the country, that could be for a variety of different reasons, we apologise. We are looking at trying to make punctuality much better across the board,"" he said. Official statistics show that just over one in three trains failed to arrive on time in July, August and September 2019, although that figure was an improvement on the previous year. About 40% of annual rail price rises are regulated by governments in England, Scotland and Wales. They are pegged to the Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation measure for the previous July. Other fare rises are decided by train companies. RPI inflation was 2.8% last year. But RPI inflation is generally higher than the most widely watched measure of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). Are UK train fares the highest in Europe? Where does your train fare go? Passenger groups have repeatedly called for the system to be changed since RPI inflation was abandoned by the UK Statistics Authority as a national statistic in 2013. Emily Yates, a freelance writer from Brighton who co-founded the Association of British Commuters, said the annual rises feel like ""Groundhog Day"" and a ""complete charade"". ""Every year, we ask for a fares freeze, the government says no, and the rail industry defends the decision,"" she said. Protests will be held against the fare increase on Thursday, including a demonstration outside London King's Cross station. The rallies come as the Trades Union Congress (TUC) releases research suggesting fares have risen by twice as much as wages in the last 10 years. The TUC said someone earning an average salary in the UK would have to spend 16% of their wages for a season ticket from Chelmsford to London (Â£511 a month), but similar commutes would cost 2% of the average salary in France, and 4% in Germany and Belgium.

Sacked vegan brings landmark discrimination case,"This video can not be played Jordi Casamitjana campaigns to encourage others to become vegans A vegan man is bringing a landmark legal action later, in which a tribunal will decide for the first time whether veganism should be protected in law. Jordi Casamitjana says he was sacked by the League Against Cruel Sports after disclosing it invested pension funds in firms involved in animal testing. He claims he was unfairly disciplined and the decision to sack him was because of his veganism. The League Against Cruel Sports says he was dismissed for gross misconduct. However, it does not contest that veganism should be protected. On Thursday, the employment tribunal will consider whether veganism is a ""philosophical belief"" akin to a religion. Mr Casamitjana describes himself as an ""ethical"" vegan and campaigns to get his message to others. His beliefs affect much of his everyday life. He will, for instance, walk rather than take a bus to avoid accidental crashes with insects or birds. He worked for the animal welfare charity the League Against Cruel Sports, and says that when he drew his bosses' attention to the pension fund investments, they did nothing so he informed colleagues and was sacked as a result. Mr Casamitjana claims he was discriminated against on the basis of his ethical veganism belief. Mr Casamitjana supports a range of ethical and animal rights causes Dietary vegans and ethical vegans both eat a plant-based diet. However, ethical vegans try to exclude all forms of animal exploitation, for instance avoiding wearing or buying clothing made from wool or leather, or toiletries from companies that carry out animal testing. They may refer to ""companion animals"" rather than ""pets"", and will avoid zoos or other environments where they consider animals are exploited. Why are more people going vegan? The landmark employment tribunal, in Norwich, will consider whether veganism is a ""philosophical or religious belief"". ""Religion or belief"" is one of nine ""protected characteristics"" covered by theEquality Act 2010,external. It is unlawful for an employer to discriminate directly, by treating an employee less favourably than others because of their religion or belief. To qualify as a philosophical belief, veganism must: be genuinely held be a belief as to a weighty and substantial aspect of human life and behaviour attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance be worthy of respect in a democratic society, not be incompatible with human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of others be a belief, not an opinion or viewpoint based on the present state of information available. If successful, the case could provide vegans with protection against discrimination in employment, education and the provision of goods and services. Those holding other beliefs could then seek similar legal protection. Mr Casamitjana's solicitor Peter Daly, of Slater and Gordon, said: ""Ethical veganism is a philosophical belief held by a significant and growing portion of the population in the UK and around the world. ""This case, if successful, will establish that the belief entitles ethical vegans protection from discrimination. ""The case we have prepared sets out how the belief in principle, and how Jordi's particular interpretations of it, comprehensively meet the required legal test."" A spokeswoman for the league said: ""The League Against Cruel Sports is an inclusive employer, and as this is a hearing to decide whether veganism should be a protected status, something which the league does not contest, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.""

Australian state declares bushfire emergency,"This video can not be played Evacuations cause gridlock in Batemans Bay, New South Wales The leader of Australia's eastern New South Wales state has declared a week-long state of emergency in response to the escalating bushfire threat. High temperatures and strong winds are forecast for the weekend, leading to ""widespread extreme fire danger"". Troops are also preparing to evacuate some of the 4,000 people trapped by fires in neighbouring Victoria state. Since September, bushfires have killed 18 people and destroyed more than 1,200 homes across NSW and Victoria. At least 17 people remain missing after fires this week alone. A visual guide to Australia's bushfire crisis Australia zookeepers save animals from bushfire The beach town where fires turned day to night Thousands of people are already fleeing a vast ""tourist leave zone"" in NSW, with supplies running low in some cut-off towns. It's been called ""the largest relocation out of the region ever"". In Victoria, a naval vessel has arrived off the coastal town of Mallacoota, near the NSW border. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said the ship would take up to 800 people early on Friday. He said it could do ""multiple trips"". Defence Minister Linda Reynolds tweeted that the HMAS Choules was in position. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, fire officials told holidaymakers to urgently leave a 260km (160-mile) stretch of NSW coast before Saturday. Long lines of cars have clogged highways leading back towards Sydney and Canberra. Local media reported hour-long queues for petrol in the town of Batemans Bay, while fuel was being trucked in to the region as supplies dwindled. Allow Twitter content?

Are you affected by the fires? Let us know by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Under the NSW 1994 State Emergency and Rescue Management Act, the premier can issue a state of emergency when there is considered to be ""a significant and widespread danger to life or property"". A state of emergency cuts the red tape, making it quicker and easier for emergency services to act It puts the premier in direct command of all agencies and the allocation of resources and significantly increases the powers of the Rural Fire Service commissioner Authorities can order people to evacuate from at-risk places or to ""do all such things as are reasonably necessary"" to make them leave, including through reasonable force Emergency workers may be cleared to use force to get inside a property or take possession of it if needed Authorities can open and close roads as needed, shut down utilities and pull down infrastructure Financial assistance can be made available to volunteers Two regions of Western Australia (WA) were also facing catastrophic fire danger on Thursday, and parts of South Australia were expected to see extreme conditions on Friday. The ABC reported that bushfires had forced the closure of a 330km stretch of a highway in WA, causing traffic jams.

Emergency supplies including water and toilet paper were flown in to a remote guesthouse located about 1,000km (620 miles) east of Perth which has been cut off from the city by bushfires. About 120 people were on the Caiguna Roadhouse site, where temperatures were forecast to reach 48 degrees. In Tasmania a fire burning on the outskirts of the state capital Hobart was downgraded from emergency to watch and act status. Bushfire smoke is blanketing Canberra On Thursday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison repeated his calls to people not to panic and to trust emergency workers. ""I understand the fear that is there for many and the frustration, but this is a natural disaster, and natural disasters are best dealt with through the methodical, well-co-ordinated response that we are seeing today,"" he told a press conference. Amid criticism that he had ""gone missing"" during the crisis, Mr Morrison added that cabinet would meet on Monday to consider a long-term bushfire response. Why Australia's PM is facing anger over bushfires Meteorologists say a climate system in the Indian Ocean, known as the dipole, is the main driver behind the extreme heat in Australia.

Climate change hope for hydrogen fuel,"Natural gas can be blended with hydrogen for a greener mix A tiny spark in the UKâs hydrogen revolution has been lit â at a university campus near Stoke-on-Trent. Hydrogen fuel is a relatively green alternative to alternatives that produce greenhouse gases. The natural gas supply at Keele University is being blended with 20% hydrogen in a trial that's of national significance. Adding the hydrogen will reduce the amount of CO2 thatâs being produced through heating and cooking. Critics fear hydrogen will prove too expensive for mass usage, but supporters of the technology have high hopes. Download the BBC Energy Briefing, from October 2019 (10.7MB),external Greenland ice melt 'is accelerating' 'Opportunity lost' as longest climate talks end Using natural gas for heating generates about a third of the UK emissions that are driving global warming. But the only product of burning hydrogen is water. As a fuel, hydrogen functions in much the same way as natural gas. So staff in the university canteen say cooking on the 20% hydrogen blend has made no difference to their cooking regime. The project â known as HyDeploy - is the UKâs first live trial of hydrogen in a modern gas network. Keele was chosen because it has a private gas system. Its hydrogen is produced in an electrolyser - a device that splits water (H2O) into its constituents: hydrogen and oxygen. The machine is located in a glossy green shipping container in the corner of the universityâs sports field. The gas distribution firm Cadent, which is leading the project, says that if a 20% blend were to be rolled out across Britain, it would reduce emissions of CO2 by six million tonnes - equivalent to taking 2.5 million cars off the road. The hydrogen could be generated pollution-free by using surplus wind power at night to split water molecules using electrolysis. The 20% proportion was chosen because itâs an optimal blend that wonât affect gas pipes and appliances. Currently, the UK has only small supplies of hydrogen, but the firm says increasing production would offer a quick way of cutting emissions from heating. Consultant engineer Ed Syson told BBC News: âThe prize is a large one. If we were to roll this system out across the UK it would be on broadly the same scale as offshore wind is today. So itâs a significant technology. âWhatâs more, it makes those carbon savings without having customers change their behaviour in any way.â Some boiler manufacturers are already producing prototype boilers that use 100% hydrogen. Worcester Bosch, for instance, has a âhydrogen-readyâ design. It can run on natural gas, but itâs capable of converting to 100% hydrogen following a one-hour visit by an engineer. The firm wants the government to stipulate that by 2025, all new boilers on sale should be hydrogen-ready. It says this would allow households to switch painlessly to clean boilers when existing boilers reach the end of their lives. The extra cost of the hydrogen-ready boiler would be about Â£50, it says. Hydrogen could be generated using surplus energy from renewables Hydrogen can be produced from water through electrolysis, or from natural gas. Electrolysis from surplus renewable energy is unambiguously beneficial for the environment â but itâs not very efficient. For the foreseeable future it may be cheaper to produce hydrogen from natural gas. However, CO2 is released in the industrial process used to generate hydrogen. The resulting CO2 would need to be captured and stored underground with carbon capture and storage (CCS) - a technology not yet established at scale. About 85% of homes have gas central heating, and some experts believe it will prove more cost-effective to switch boilers to hydrogen, rather than to install heat pumps which would require the UKâs aging housing stock to be highly insulated. A recent study for the government raised the possibility that homes could be warmed by a hybrid systemusing electric heat pumps,external, then topping up with hydrogen on cold days. Major drawbacks to hydrogen are cost and availability. The costs are much higher than for natural gas, although the differential will surely shrink as carbon taxes raise the price of burning gas to combat climate change over coming decades. The environmental think tank E3G said in a statement: âGoing for hydrogen entails massive infrastructure expenditure. In many cases the additional costs make it look unattractive compared with alternatives (like renewables). Richard Black from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) told BBC News: âWe will and should have hydrogen in the mix of energy options, but itâs not a wonder solution to everything, which you sometimes get the impression from the rhetoric. There is hope â but too much hype.â Meanwhile, in the corner of a sports field in Keele, the container of hope has just supplied enough hydrogen to cook 20% of Christmas dinners.

Visual guide to bushfire crisis,"Record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought have fuelled a series of massive bushfires across Australia. Although recent cooler conditions and rain have brought some respite, more than 50 fires are still burning in the states of New South Wales and Victoria. Hot and windy conditions are forecast to return to many parts of New South Wales this weekend and authorities in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) have declared a state of emergency as massive bushfires rage south of Canberra. At least 33 people have been killed - including four firefighters - and more than 11 million hectares (110,000 sq km or 27.2 million acres) of bush, forest and parks across Australia has burned. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map If you can't see the map click here.,external In the worst-hit state, New South Wales (NSW), fire has affected more than five million hectares, destroying more than 2,000 houses and forcing thousands to seek shelter elsewhere. More than 1,600 firefighters are currently working to slow the spread of fires and shore up containment lines, the NSW Rural Fire Service says. What's Australia doing to fight the bushfires? Fires have raged near the Australian capital Canberra for weeks - at one stage shutting the city's airport as flames approached the perimeter. On Friday, the worst blaze was just south of the district of Tuggeranong, a 20-minute drive south of Parliament House. Fears are growing that the rising temperatures and strong winds could make the fire uncontrollable. But the NSW Rural Fire Service says it expects most of the flames to spread south east. The State of Emergency declared in Canberra gives extra power and resources to fire authorities, allowing them to force evacuations if necessary. Victoria, where fires have burned 1.2 million hectares, extended a ""state of disaster"" for the worst-hit areas from 2 to 11 January. Some blazes are still burning in the state and there are emergency warnings are in place. The military has sent troops, ships and aircraft to the region to help relocation and firefighting efforts. Three people - including one firefighter - have died as a result of the fires. What's Australia doing to fight the bushfires? Two people and an estimated 25,000 koalas were killed when flames devastated Kangaroo Island in the state of South Australia on 9 January. The island is renowned for its unique mix of animal species - and there are fears it may never recover. Experts have expressed concerns over the survival of endangered species on the island,externalwhich include the dunnart - a mouse-like marsupial - and the black glossy cockatoo. Tens of thousands of farm animals, mainly sheep, were also killed in the fire on the island.

Elsewhere in South Australia, the Cudlee Creek fire is reported to have destroyed more than 80 homes in the Adelaide Hills region in late December. Fires are also thought to have destroyed up to a third of the vines that provide grapes for the Adelaide Hills wine industry. Canberra has seen some of the worst smoke pollution, with air quality rated the third worst of all major global cities on 3 January, according to Swiss-based group AirVisual. Satellite images from 4 January showed the spread of smoke from fires in Victoria and NSW, which has affected air quality as far away as New Zealand. Although Australia has always had bushfires, this season has been worse than usual. The amount of land affected across the country - more than 10 million hectares - is now comparable to England's land area of 13 million hectares. In pictures: Latest from the Australian bushfires Humans are sometimes to blame for starting the fires, but they are also often sparked by natural causes, such as lightning striking dry vegetation. Once fires have started, other areas are at risk, with embers blown by the wind causing blazes to spread to new areas. Bush fires themselves can also drive thunderstorms, increasing the risk of lightning strikes and further fires. The number of people killed as a result of the fires since September 2019 is higher than in recent years. Australia's deadliest bushfire disaster was ""Black Saturday"" in February 2009, when some 180 people died in Victoria. Clarification 10th May 2021: Australia's biggest fire occurred Dec 1974-Jan 1975 in western New South Wales and across the states and Northern Territory, when 15% of the country was burned. As we were unable to establish a confirmed death toll for these fires, they were not included in this graphic. If there is a serious risk of fire reaching homes or properties, authorities urge people to leave in good time as fire can travel fast - faster than most people can run. Many Australians are asking that very question - but the science is complicated. Scientists have long warned that a hotter, drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more frequent and more intense. Many parts of Australia have been in drought conditions, some for years, which has made it easier for the fires to spread and grow. Data shows that Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than one degree Celsius since 1910, with most of the heating occurring since 1950, the Bureau of Meteorology says. Australia broke its all-time temperature record twice in December. An average maximum of 40.9C was recorded on 17 December, broken a day later by 41.9C, both beating 2013's record of 40.3C. By the end of the month every state had measured temperatures above 40C - including Tasmania, which is usually much cooler than the mainland. The main climate driver behind the heat has been a positiveIndian Ocean Dipole (IOD)- an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east. The difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years. As a result, there has been higher-than-average rainfall and floods in eastern Africa and droughts in south-east Asia and Australia. Andrew Watkins, head of long-range forecasts at the bureau, said the dipole was crucial to understanding the heatwave. ""The key culprit of our current and expected conditions is one of the strongest positive Indian Ocean dipole events on record,"" he says. ""A positive IOD means we have cooler than average water pooling off Indonesia, and this means we see less rain-bearing weather systems, and warmer than average temperatures for large parts of the country."" And meteorologists warn that, for the moment, the intense weather and elevated fire risk in Australia is set to continue. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Dog tied up at church altar with 'I'm sorry' noteCracker's owner left a note saying: ""I couldn't imagine him being outside with me cold and hungry.""","Cracker was described by his previous owner as a ""placid, friendly, loving dog"" A dog was found tied up at a church with a note from his old owner saying ""I love you and I'm so, so, so sorry"". The brindle and white Staffordshire bull terrier-cross, since named Cracker, was abandoned by the altar of Sacred Heart Church, Blackpool. A handwritten note left with him said: ""Life has taken a really bad turn for me and I couldn't imagine him being outside with me cold and hungry"". The RSPCA said Cracker was doing well and ""getting lots of TLC"". The dog was found by staff at the church - which is left unlocked 24 hours a day - when they arrived for work on the morning of 18 December. The note found alongside him urged whoever found the dog to ""please believe me when I say I haven't done this easily"". It continued: ""My dog means the world to me and I don't know what else to do."" The note said he was a ""placid, friendly, loving dog"" who would turn seven on 22 March 2020. It added: ""He has got quite tender front paws, I've been treating them for about a month now but they are still sore. ""My heart is broken and I will truly miss him more than words can say. I hope he can be found a new home he deserves. I love you and I am so, so, so sorry.xxxx"" RSPCA inspector Will Lamping, who collected Cracker from the church, said it was clear from the note how much his previous owner loved him. He added: ""Unfortunately sometimes life can throw some pretty tough things at people and circumstances can drastically change but it's heartbreaking to think that someone out there is missing Cracker and wondering how he is doing."" Mr Lamping said that if no-one came forward to claim Cracker, who has been checked over by a vet, he would be sent to an RSCPA rehoming centre to look for new owners. He added: ""If anyone does come forward then I'd like to let them know that they won't be in any trouble and we'd like to chat to them and see how we might be able to help them, and Cracker."" He urged any pet owners struggling financially to contact their vet, a local rescue centre or a charity like the RSPCA.

Austria conservatives agree coalition with Greens,"Sebastian Kurz, left, announced the coalition with Green Party leader Werner Kogler late on Wednesday Austria's right-wing leader Sebastian Kurz has put forward a coalition plan with his new Green partners, including more ambitious measures to decarbonise the economy. They aim to put Austria on a path to becoming climate-neutral by 2040 - ten years earlier than the EU's goal. Climate neutrality means balancing greenhouse gas emissions with measures that absorb or eliminate carbon. The conservatives won a snap September election, and the Greens made gains. Mr Kurz said the joint programme also included many of his People's Party (ÃVP) priorities, like lower income taxes and stricter controls on migration. The ÃVP had been in coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÃ) until a scandal toppled the government in May. The FPÃ got entangled in a video sting scandal, dubbed ""Ibiza-gate"", involving cash for favours. The Green Party is entering national government for the first time. The new coalition line-up still has to be formally approved by both parties. Under the plan, the ÃVP will have 11 ministerial posts and the Greens four. ""We succeeded in uniting the best of both worlds,"" Mr Kurz said. ""It is possible to protect the climate and borders."" The programme includes: Banning the wearing of Islamic headscarves by girls in school aged up to 14; a current ban applies to girls aged 10 and below (Austria has banned full-face veils since 2017) Lowering the three income tax bands: from 25% to 20%; from 35% to 30% and from 42% to 40% Cutting the corporate tax rate to 21% from 25% Producing 100% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030 A new flat-rate air passenger tax of â¬12 (Â£10; $13) - an increase overall on the current air taxes A â¬3 day ticket, to make public transport cheaper Greens leader Werner Kogler said Austria should now become a European leader on climate change issues. The Kurz-Kogler coalition is an unprecedented political experiment for Austria Mr Kurz is poised to return as Austria's chancellor, with Mr Kogler as vice-chancellor. Among the prospective Green ministers is 35-year-old Alma Zadic, a lawyer born in Bosnia, who is set to run the justice ministry. She is likely to push for a more open immigration policy. After elections in 2017,the FPÃ joined a coalition with Mr Kurz's People's Party (ÃVP). But the government fell apart in May over the ""Ibiza-gate"" scandal. Journalists revealed secret recordings of FPÃ leader Heinz-Christian Strache, promising government contracts to a woman posing as the niece of a Russian oligarch at a villa on the Spanish island. This video can not be played The video, from, 2017, was recorded in a villa in Ibiza Snap elections followed in September. The ÃVP came out unscathed, winning in eight of Austria's nine federal states and increasing its share of the national vote to 37%. The FPÃ, in contrast, only won 16%, a sharp fall from its 2017 performance. Mr Kurz's party however did not gain a majority and began coalition talks with smaller parties - including the Greens, who had won 14% of the vote. Green leader Mr Kogler said straight after the September election that the next government would need to see ""radical change"" from the right-wing policies pursued by the previous coalition. A Green party congress must still endorse the coalition with the People's Party. Its roughly 280 delegates are however expected to approve the agreement.

Race to flee 'leave zone' as bushfire threat looms,"This video can not be played Evacuations cause gridlock in Batemans Bay, New South Wales The leader of Australia's eastern New South Wales state has declared a week-long state of emergency in response to the escalating bushfire threat. High temperatures and strong winds are forecast for the weekend, leading to ""widespread extreme fire danger"". Troops are also preparing to evacuate some of the 4,000 people trapped by fires in neighbouring Victoria state. Since September, bushfires have killed 18 people and destroyed more than 1,200 homes across NSW and Victoria. At least 17 people remain missing after fires this week alone. A visual guide to Australia's bushfire crisis Australia zookeepers save animals from bushfire The beach town where fires turned day to night Thousands of people are already fleeing a vast ""tourist leave zone"" in NSW, with supplies running low in some cut-off towns. It's been called ""the largest relocation out of the region ever"". In Victoria, a naval vessel has arrived off the coastal town of Mallacoota, near the NSW border. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said the ship would take up to 800 people early on Friday. He said it could do ""multiple trips"".

Many roads remained closed due to continuing fires and other dangers, such as unstable or fallen trees. Workers were clearing roads, restoring power, and conducting ""backburning"" operations to thin out bushland near fire fronts. NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance urged people to drive slowly amid thick smoke. This week's fires have destroyed at least 381 homes in NSW and 43 in Victoria, but officials say that number will grow.

""Very sad day for us to (start) the year but we're a bloody tight family and we will never forget our mate and my beautiful Uncle Mick,"" his niece Leah Parson said on Facebook. Mr Andrews said there were ""significant fears"" for 17 people unaccounted for in his state. Police brought water, food and medical supplies into Mallacoota by boat Fire services in Victoria and NSW warned they had been unable to reach some people in remote areas. In the capital Canberra - an administrative region surrounded by NSW - bushfire smoke meant air quality there was rated worse than any major global city on Thursday, according to Swiss-based group AirVisual. An elderly woman died after being exposed to the smoke as she exited a plane at Canberra airport, local reports say. Australia Post has suspended deliveries in the city ""until further notice"". Are you affected by the fires? Let us know by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Under the NSW 1994 State Emergency and Rescue Management Act, the premier can issue a state of emergency when there is considered to be ""a significant and widespread danger to life or property"". A state of emergency cuts the red tape, making it quicker and easier for emergency services to act It puts the premier in direct command of all agencies and the allocation of resources and significantly increases the powers of the Rural Fire Service commissioner Authorities can order people to evacuate from at-risk places or to ""do all such things as are reasonably necessary"" to make them leave, including through reasonable force Emergency workers may be cleared to use force to get inside a property or take possession of it if needed Authorities can open and close roads as needed, shut down utilities and pull down infrastructure Financial assistance can be made available to volunteers Two regions of Western Australia (WA) were also facing catastrophic fire danger on Thursday, and parts of South Australia were expected to see extreme conditions on Friday. The ABC reported that bushfires had forced the closure of a 330km stretch of a highway in WA, causing traffic jams. Australia fires create 'eerie' New Zealand skies How is Australia tackling climate change? Emergency supplies including water and toilet paper were flown in to a remote guesthouse located about 1,000km (620 miles) east of Perth which has been cut off from the city by bushfires. About 120 people were on the Caiguna Roadhouse site, where temperatures were forecast to reach 48 degrees. In Tasmania a fire burning on the outskirts of the state capital Hobart was downgraded from emergency to watch and act status. Bushfire smoke is blanketing Canberra On Thursday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison repeated his calls to people not to panic and to trust emergency workers. ""I understand the fear that is there for many and the frustration, but this is a natural disaster, and natural disasters are best dealt with through the methodical, well-co-ordinated response that we are seeing today,"" he told a press conference. Amid criticism that he had ""gone missing"" during the crisis, Mr Morrison added that cabinet would meet on Monday to consider a long-term bushfire response. Why Australia's PM is facing anger over bushfires Meteorologists say a climate system in the Indian Ocean, known as the dipole, is the main driver behind the extreme heat in Australia.

"Dog tied up at church altar with 'I'm sorry' noteCracker's owner left a note saying: ""I couldn't imagine him being outside with me cold and hungry.""Lancashire","Cracker was described by his previous owner as a ""placid, friendly, loving dog"" A dog was found tied up at a church with a note from his old owner saying ""I love you and I'm so, so, so sorry"". The brindle and white Staffordshire bull terrier-cross, since named Cracker, was abandoned by the altar of Sacred Heart Church, Blackpool. A handwritten note left with him said: ""Life has taken a really bad turn for me and I couldn't imagine him being outside with me cold and hungry"". The RSPCA said Cracker was doing well and ""getting lots of TLC"". The dog was found by staff at the church - which is left unlocked 24 hours a day - when they arrived for work on the morning of 18 December. The note found alongside him urged whoever found the dog to ""please believe me when I say I haven't done this easily"". It continued: ""My dog means the world to me and I don't know what else to do."" The note said he was a ""placid, friendly, loving dog"" who would turn seven on 22 March 2020. It added: ""He has got quite tender front paws, I've been treating them for about a month now but they are still sore. ""My heart is broken and I will truly miss him more than words can say. I hope he can be found a new home he deserves. I love you and I am so, so, so sorry.xxxx"" RSPCA inspector Will Lamping, who collected Cracker from the church, said it was clear from the note how much his previous owner loved him. He added: ""Unfortunately sometimes life can throw some pretty tough things at people and circumstances can drastically change but it's heartbreaking to think that someone out there is missing Cracker and wondering how he is doing."" Mr Lamping said that if no-one came forward to claim Cracker, who has been checked over by a vet, he would be sent to an RSCPA rehoming centre to look for new owners. He added: ""If anyone does come forward then I'd like to let them know that they won't be in any trouble and we'd like to chat to them and see how we might be able to help them, and Cracker."" He urged any pet owners struggling financially to contact their vet, a local rescue centre or a charity like the RSPCA.
