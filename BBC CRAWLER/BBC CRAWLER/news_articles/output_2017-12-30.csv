How do the Honours work?,"Actor Stephen Fry, former England football manager Gareth Southgate and London Mayor Sadiq Khan are among those knighted in the New Year Honours list. Honours typically celebrate the contribution of well-known personalities, government employees and ordinary people who have served their community. Most honours are awarded at new year and on the monarch's official birthday, in June. The2025 New Year Honours listalso included an MBE for Olympic 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson, and CBEs for services to drama for actresses Sarah Lancashire and Carey Mulligan. There was a damehood forsenior Labour MP Emily Thornberry, and OBEs for services to justice forfour former sub-postmasterswho took the Post Office to court over the Horizon IT scandal. Gareth Southgate (left) and Stephen Fry (right) are made knights while Keely Hodgkinson (centre) becomes an MBE TheKing's Birthday Honours list in 2024included a knighthood for Alan Bates, the former sub-postmaster who campaigned to highlight the Post Office Horizon scandal. There were damehoods for actress Imelda Staunton, designer Anya Hindmarch and artist Tracey Emin. The King's first civilian gallantry list in May sawnine people receive bravery awards,external. Dissolution honours are typically given to politicians when Parliament ends before a general election. In July 2024,outgoing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced knighthoods for several of his allies, as well as peerages for his predecessor Theresa May and former Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. Resignation honours can be issued by prime ministers who leave office without a general election. Boris Johnson and Liz Truss both left office in 2022. Boris Johnson's resignation honours recognised close allies, including former Home Secretary Priti Patel Mr Johnson'scontroversial list,released in June 2023, initially contained eight names rejected by theHouse of Lords Appointments Commission,external. Ms Trusswas widely criticised for submitting an honours listafter only 49 days in the job. After the death of a senior member of the Royal Family, Royal Victorian Order honours are awarded to people who have served the family. The New Year and birthday honours are awarded by the King following recommendations by the prime minister or senior government ministers. Members of the publiccan also recommend people for an award.,externalThese nominations typically make up about a quarter of all recommendations. Honours' lists include awards for people who: have made significant achievements in public life committed themselves to serving and helping Britain Resignation or dissolution honours are decided by the prime minister and do not go through the same process. The Foreign Office has responsibility for the Diplomatic Service and Overseas List. Honorary awards for foreign nationals are recommended by the foreign secretary. Honours are traditionally kept confidential until the official announcement, with lists provided to media outlets under embargo. Honours are typically awarded by the King, Prince of Wales or Princess Royal, at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle or the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Recipients can select their investiture's date and location but not which member of the Royal Family will preside over the ceremony. The King awarded a damehood to writer Jilly Cooper, at Windsor Castle, in May 2024 British Empire Medals are presented locally by lord-lieutenants, who represent the King. Recipients are also invited to attend a royal garden party. What does the King do? People in line for an honour arechecked by the Honours and Appointments Secretariat,,externalwhich is part of the Cabinet Office government department. The Cabinet Office has agreements with other government departments to let it access confidential information about nominees. For example,HMRC provides a low, medium or high-risk rating,externalon a nominee's tax affairs. Peerages are vetted by theHouse of Lords Appointments Commission.,external A Parliamentary and Political Services Committee considers honours for politicians and for political service. What is the House of Lords and how do people become members? When somebody is approved for an honour, they are sent a letter asking if they will accept it. A list of 277 people who turned down honours between 1951 and 1999 - and subsequently died -was made public following a BBC Freedom of Information request.,external It included authors Roald Dahl, JG Ballard and Aldous Huxley, and painters Francis Bacon, Lucien Freud and LS Lowry. Poet Benjamin Zephaniah said it would be ""hypocritical"" to accept an honour including the world ""Empire"" The late Benjamin Zephaniahrejected an OBE in 2003 because of the association with the British Empire and its history of slavery. No Sir! Who's turned down an honour? Some people have had their honours withdrawn by the Honours Forfeiture Committee. They include disgraced former entertainerRolf Harris,who went to prison for 12 indecent assaults on four girls, and Anthony Blunt, the former art adviser to the Queen who was revealed to be a Soviet spy. PM Rishi Sunak said he would support calls for the Honours Forfeiture Committee to consider withdrawing Ms Vennells' CBE In January 2024, former Post Office bossPaula Vennells said she would hand back her CBEafter facing mounting pressure overthe Horizon IT scandal. Twelve months earlier, actor and TV presenter Alan Cummingreturned his OBE over what he called the ""toxicity"" of the British Empire. Knights and Dames The honour of knighthood comes from the days of medieval chivalry, as does the method used to confer the knighthood - the accolade, or the touch of a sword, by the sovereign. A knight is styled ""Sir"" and their wife ""Lady"". Women receiving the honour are styled ""Dame"" but do not receive the accolade. The honour is given for a pre-eminent contribution in any field of activity. The rank of Knight Commander (KBE) or Dame Commander (DBE), Order of the British Empire, appears on the Diplomatic Service and Overseas list. The Order of the Bath The Order of the Bath is an order of chivalry and was founded in 1725 for service of the highest calibre. It has a civil and military division and is awarded in the following ranks: Knight Grand Cross (GCB), Knight Commander (KCB) and Companion (CB). The Order takes its name from the symbolic bathing which, in former times, was often part of the preparation of a candidate for knighthood. Order of St Michael and St George This Order was founded by King George III in 1818 and is awarded to British subjects who have rendered extraordinary and important services abroad or in the Commonwealth. Ranks in the Order are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCMG), Knight or Dame Commander (KCMG or DCMG) and Companion (CMG). Order of the Companions of Honour This is awarded for service of conspicuous national importance and is limited to 65 people. Recipients are entitled to put the initials CH after their name. Orders of the British Empire King George V created these honours during World War One to reward services to the war effort by civilians at home and service personnel in support positions. The ranks are Commander (CBE), Officer (OBE), and Member (MBE). They are now awarded for prominent national or regional roles, and to those making distinguished or notable contributions in their own specific areas of activity. British Empire Medal (BEM) The medal was founded in 1917 and was awarded for ""meritorious"" actions by civilians or military personnel, although the recipients did not attend a royal investiture. Scrapped in 1993 by Conservative Prime Minister John Major, the BEM was revived in 2012. Royal Victorian Order By 1896, prime ministers and governments had increased their influence over the distribution of awards and had gained almost total control of the system. In response, Queen Victoria instituted The Royal Victorian Order as a personal award for services performed on behalf of the Royal Family. The ranks are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCVO), Knight or Dame Commander (KCVO or DCVO), Commander (CVO), Lieutenant (LVO) and Member (MVO). Royal Victorian Medal Associated with the Royal Victorian Order is the Royal Victorian Medal which has three grades: gold, silver and bronze. The circular medal is attached to the ribbon of the Order. Royal Red Cross Founded in 1883 by Queen Victoria, the award is confined to the nursing services. Those awarded the First Class are designated ""Members"" (RRC): those awarded the Second Class are designated ""Associates"" (ARRC). King's Police Medal Awarded for distinguished service in the police force. King's Fire Service Medal Given to firefighters who have displayed conspicuous devotion to duty. King's Ambulance Service Medal Awarded for distinguished service in the ambulance service. King's Gallantry Medal Awarded to civilians, for acts of exemplary bravery. King's Commendation for Bravery Awarded to civilians and all ranks of the British armed forces, for actions not in the presence of an enemy. King's Commendation for Bravery in the Air Awarded to civilians and all ranks of the British armed forces, for acts of bravery in the air not in the presence of an enemy.

Polling expert Curtice 'didn't see knighthood coming'MBE for woman who fostered 100 childrenVideoVideoJilly Cooper 'did not expect CBE',"This video can not be played Sir John Curtice: ""This will take quite a while to get used to."" Polling expert and political scientist John Curtice has been given a knighthood inthe Queen's New Year honours list. The veteran psephologist has been honoured for his high-profile work in political analysis. His 2017 election exit poll correctly predicted the Conservatives would lose their majority. The 64-year-old, famous for political predictions, said the honour was ""not something I saw coming"". Cult of Curtice: Love for polling guru Your questions: John Curtice His polling work has been lauded for its accuracy, often departing from the general consensus to correctly predict shock election results. The 2017 prediction led many to say that he was the true winner of the election. It followed accurate predictions in the 2005, 2010, and 2015 general elections. After Sir John's 2015 poll predicted a David Cameron win, former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown promised to eat his hat if it was correct. He was later given a hat-shaped cake on Question Time. In a tweet on Saturday, Lord Ashdown offered his congratulations and jokingly referred to the hat incident, although he misspelled the polling expert's name. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Regular appearances on BBC election coverage have given him a cult following, with memes and even a dedicatedTwitter account,externalto let people know when he is on TV. The election pollster said he was surprised to get the nod. ""The ironic thing is, back in June of this year, the exit poll that I led caused something of a surprise for the country and the result was very much unanticipated,"" he said. ""Well, I have to admit this was not something I saw coming. I am surprised as well as being honoured that I have been granted this knighthood."" Sir John said he was happy that so many people found his work useful. He said: ""The gratifying part of the citation for me is that it is not just for services to social sciences, but to politics. ""It is probably relatively rare for someone who avoids all partisan politics and all partisan comment to actually be cited as giving services to the political life of the nation. ""What seems to be true is that, for good or ill, people find that when I stand in front of a camera and try to explain to people what's going on politically using the academic work that I have done, people say that they find this useful, illustrating and informative."" Polling expert John Curtice has received a knighthood He admitted that he hopes 2018 will be a quieter year for politics. ""I guess like many other people in the political world, I am on tenterhooks as to what 2018 will bring"", he said. ""Many people will be hoping that, in contrast to the last four years, there will not be a major election or referendum, but I guess we've learnt not to presume that will happen. ""If the government doesn't survive for the next 12 months it may be that I'm going to have to chance my reputation yet again with yet another exit poll but, in truth, I'm hoping not and that 2018 will be a relatively quiet year."" Born in Cornwall, he became interested in politics and voting patterns as a child. ""My earliest memories go back to the resignation of Harold Macmillan and the death of Hugh Gaitskell in the early 1960s,"" he said in a2013 BBC interview. ""That's going back to the age of nine or 10, I was following those stories. ""I remember begging my parents to allow me to stay up during the 1964 general election count, and remember that very close result, and that only the following day did we knew that Harold Wilson had got an overall majority. ""Very odd pre-occupations for a nine or 10-year-old I utterly admit,"" He studied at Oxford, and in the late 1980s was approached by Strathclyde University to take over ""number crunching"" in their politics department, and has remained in the country throughout the intervening years. His time at Strathclyde has overseen the birth of devolution in Scotland, and the independence referendum in 2014. As well as his post at Strathclyde University, he is a senior research fellow at NatCen Social Research - Britain's largest independent social research agency - and president of the British Polling Council. He received a lifetime achievement award earlier this year at the Times Higher Education Awards in London. Sir John's official knighthood citation is for services to social sciences and politics.

MBE for woman who fostered 100 childrenVideoVideoJilly Cooper 'did not expect CBE',"Stella and Bill Tomkinson (pictured bottom centre) with some of the children they looked after, who are now grown up A great-grandmother who looked after more than 100 children in 50 years has been appointed an MBE for services to foster care. Stella Tomkinson, 79, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, said she had been told about the honour in November. She said although fostering had its ups and downs, ""it is really rewarding"". Mrs Tomkinson said she had been ""really lucky,"" adding: ""I can honestly say that if I lived my life again, I would do exactly the same thing."" She and her husband Bill, a butcher, decided to become foster carers in the 1960s after discovering they could not have children. ""I had six miscarriages; it was heartbreaking,"" she said. They adopted a five-week-old baby girl in 1962 and then put their names down to adopt further children - only to be asked to foster a little girl with health problems instead. That prompted the couple to foster more children, including several with disabilities. ""The most we had living with us at any one time was seven,"" said Mrs Tomkinson. ""At the start, we just lived in a normal three-bedroom terrace in Nuneaton. We always had room for everyone though."" Mrs Tomkinson found her emotional attachment to her charges challenging at times. ""I always feel upset when they leave,"" she said. Some children stayed for a few months; others remained until adulthood. Mrs Tomkinson stopped fostering two years ago, after her husband's death in 2009. However, she has set up a weekly support group for parents of children with disabilities through Nuneaton and Bedworth's Mencap Society. She now has six adopted children, 16 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. ""I'm proud of all the children I've looked after,"" she said. ""Many people find Christmas a lonely time and if I hadn't had all these children, I would probably have been lonely too. ""I have been really lucky watching all these children grow up."" Other recipients of honours from Coventry and Warwickshire include: Ian Harrabin, who chairs the Historic Coventry Trust andhelped rescue the city's medieval Charterhouse, is appointed MBE for services to heritage and regeneration in Coventry Former Warwickshire coroner Michael Coker is made an MBE for services to the community Prof Richard Lilford, from the University of Warwick, is appointed a CBE for services to health research Who's on the 2018 honours list?

Iran sees third day of angry protests,"Protesters clashed with police at Tehran University Anti-government protests have continued in Iran for a third day, with reports of demonstrations in many cities despite warnings from authorities. At Tehran University, protesters called for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down and there were clashes with police. Demonstrators ignored the interior minister's warning that citizens should avoid ""illegal gatherings"". Meanwhile, thousands of pro-government demonstrators turned out for rallies. These official rallies were organised in advance of the anti-government protests, to mark the eighth anniversary of the suppression of major street protests in 2009. The current protests began in the north-east on Thursday over living standards and by Friday had spread to several major cities. This video can not be played Iranian state TV showed crowds of government supporters in the capital, Tehran Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli urged people not to take part ""as they will create problems for themselves and other citizens"", but videos posted online suggest that protests were held on Saturday in at least nine cities across the country. The Iranian authorities are blaming anti-revolutionaries and agents of foreign powers for the outbreak of protests. The communications minister has also urged Telegram, a popular  mobile messaging app in Iran, to stop ""promoting violence"". In the US, the Trump administration warned Iran overnight that the world was watching its response. Iran's foreign ministry called the comments ""opportunistic and deceitful"". By BBC Persian correspondent Kasra Naji Although small, the anti-government protests on Saturday took on a much greater importance than the government-sponsored rallies. It's not every day that there are thousands of people voicing opposition to the government. As night fell, reports were still coming of protests in many cities. There have been clashes with the police in some places. The common factor in all of them has been protesters' demand for an end to clerical rule in Iran. Widespread discontent is not limited to complaints about rising prices or widespread unemployment. It has been an eye-opening three days for the government, which has been careful not to provoke the protesters too much. The protests started in the north-eastern city of Mashhad- the country's second most-populous - on Thursday. People there took to the streets to express anger at the government over high prices, and vented their fury against President Hassan Rouhani. Fifty-two people were arrested. This video can not be played Protesters take to streets venting anger against authorities The protests spread to at least half a dozen cities on Friday. In some cities police in riot gear and on motorbikes clashed with demonstrators. It is the biggest display of public dissent since huge pro-reform rallies in 2009. Overall, the numbers said to be taking part range from less than 100 in some places to thousands in others - but demonstrations do not appear to be taking place on a massive scale. Information about them has mostly emerged through social media. A video that spread among Persian-language Twitter users earlier on Saturday showed students at Tehran University calling for Mr Khamenei to step down. Allow Twitter content?

President Hassan Rouhani is blamed by many for the poor state of the economy ""The Iranian government should respect their people's rights, including their right to express themselves.

Millennials to secure 'inheritance boom',"Millennials will benefit from the biggest ""inheritance boom"" of any post-war generation, but it will be too late to solve housing struggles and wealth inequality, a report says. Those who have parents and grandparents in the ""baby boomer"" generation will be left record sums of wealth, the Resolution Foundation said. But they will have to wait - until, on average, the age of 61, it suggests. The think tank defines millennials as those currently aged 17 to 35. The Resolution Foundation said that inheritances were set to more than double over the next 20 years, and this will peak in 2035, as the generally high-wealth baby boomers progress through old age. Millennials 'lose wages race with Gen X' Where do 70% of millennials own a home? MPs given guide to millennials Have baby boomers stolen the family silver? Almost two-thirds of young adults have parents who own property, which they may get a share of in the future, the report said. By comparison, only 38% of adults born in the 1930s received an inheritance. The report also noted millennials were only half as likely to own their home at 30 as baby boomers were. Laura Gardiner, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Older generations have benefitted hugely from the big increases in household wealth in Britain over recent decades. ""While the millennials have done far less well in accumulating their own assets, they are likely to benefit from an inheritance boom in the decades ahead. ""This is likely to be very welcome news for those millennials, including some from poorer backgrounds who in the past would have been unlikely to receive bequests. ""They have the good fortune to benefit from the luck of the baby boomer generation."" But she said inheritance was ""not the silver bullet"" that will get the generation on the housing ladder or address growing wealth gaps in society, as it was unlikely to come when they are trying to buy a family home. 25-year-old Rachel Hosie, a lifestyle writer for the Independent, says the proposed inheritance boom is not much comfort to her generation. ""We have student debts, we don't have guaranteed pensions, and we've had tricky financial times to have been entering the world of work. ""We were really told for a lot of my generation that if we were ambitious and worked hard then we'd get a good job after studying hard, then we'd earn money and be able to buy a house and settle down - and we'd have this life that we saw a lot of our parents have, and now we're struggling,"" she said. However, Cari Rosen - who's the editor ofGransnet, an online community for the over-50s,external- says the report misses out an important factor. ""Half of women and a third of men are going to have to pay for care at some point. And actually one in four people who pays for care runs out of money,"" she said. ""So we have said to our own millennial there might well be nothing left for you,"" she added. She said: ""Of course we want to give our children an inheritance, the thought that what we've worked really hard for doesn't go to our children to help them through their lives is a really terrible one - but we don't know and there is no way of preparing for that or insuring for that.""

"The government silenced me, says Adonis","This video can not be played Lord Adonis has quit his role as chairman of the government's Infrastructure Commission Lord Adonis has said he was forced to resign as an independent advisor after the government ""tried to silence"" him. The former Labour minister quit his role as chairman of the government's Infrastructure Commission with an attack on Theresa May's government. He said it had become ""hyper sensitive to any criticism"" as Brexit was ""infecting"" the whole conduct of government - including infrastructure. Conservative MP Chris Philp called his comments ""complete nonsense"". Mr Philp told BBC Breakfast Lord Adonis should ""temper his remarks"" which are ""ill judged and inflammatory"". A government source has said the peer quit before he was pushed - which Lord Adonis has denied. ""He's been moving closer towards the exit door with each new onslaught he makes against Brexit,"" the source said. Lord Adonis - who is a campaigner against Brexit - said Mrs May was ""pursuing a course fraught with danger"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But as well as Brexit, he also called the decision to end the East Coast rail franchise three years early a mistake. ""I think if we'd had proper conduct of government, as happened before Brexit, no way would Whitehall have allowed a hard-right minister to have agreed the bailout of private rail companies,"" he said. The government deny it was a bailout. Lord Adonis quits government role in stinging letter Lord Adonis said it was the government attempts to silence him after his criticism of this decision, that pushed him to resign. ""Even if they are independent advisors, they get attacked,"" he added. ""It's time for people like me to speak completely frankly, openly and honestly with the British people about the challenges we face and I'll be doing that day after day in the new year."" In March, former Conservative Deputy Prime MinisterLord Heseltine was sackedas an adviser from Lord Adonis's commission after rebelling over Brexit in the House of Lords. Lord Adonis, who was transport secretary under Gordon Brown between 2009 and 2010, has chaired the National Infrastructure Commission since 2015. The commission produces a report in every Parliament advising the government on spending in areas such as transport connections and energy. In his resignation letter, he accused the prime minister of ""allying with UKIP and the Tory hard right to wrench Britain out of the key economic and political institutions of modern Europe"", saying the UK was ""hurtling towards the EU's emergency exit with no credible plan for the future of British trade and European co-operation"". Former Conservative leader and pro-Leave MP Iain Duncan Smith said the departure of Lord Adonis was ""long overdue"". But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable called Lord Adonis one of the ""most thoughtful politicians around"" and said his departure showed Brexit was being ""badly mishandled"".

Man killed in Call of Duty 'swatting' hoax,"This video can not be played Andrew Finch was shot at his front door on 28 December in Wichita, Kansas A man has been arrested after an alleged ""swatting"" prank call led to police shooting dead a 28-year-old man. Andrew Finch was shot at his front door on 28 December in Wichita, Kansas. Police surrounded the home after receivinga hoax emergency callfrom a man claiming to have shot dead his father and taken his family hostage. The call stemmed from a row between two gamers playing Call of Duty online, US media say, although the address raided was apparently unconnected to either. Police have said they believe the report was an act of ""swatting"" where a person makes a false report to send police to another person or fake address. Audio of the emergency call has been made public. A man can be heard telling authorities that he had shot his father in the head, and claimed to have taken his mother and siblings hostage. The caller also said he had a handgun and had poured fuel over the house and wanted to set the property on fire. A 25-year-old from California, Tyler Barriss, has been arrested Police say they surrounded the address the caller had given, and were preparing to make contact with the suspect reportedly inside when Mr Finch came to the door. They said one round was released by officers after the 28-year-old failed to comply with verbal orders to keep his hands up, and appeared to move his hands toward his waist multiple times. Police say Mr Finch was later found to be unarmed, and was pronounced dead at a local hospital. A search found four of his family members inside, none of them dead, injured or taken hostage. His family told local media that he was not involved in online gaming. How many die in US police shootings? The statistics behind US gun violence The false reporting of emergencies, in order to try and get a Swat (Special weapons and tactics) team response to a location It has been linked to disputes in the online gaming community Perpetrators often disguise their number or call non-emergency local numbers to avoid being identified ""The irresponsible actions of the prankster put people and lives at risk,"" said Wichita Police Department Deputy Chief Troy Livingston. ""The incident was a nightmare for everyone involved, including the family and our police department. The professor, his wife and the photo everyone is talking about Millennials to secure 'inheritance boom' Thai fraudster sentenced to 13,275 years in prison ""Due to the actions of a prankster, we have an innocent victim. Had the false police call not been made, we would not have been there. ""We don't see it as a joke, it's not a prank. It heightened the awareness of the officers, and we think it led to this deadly encounter."" Wichita Police authorities confirmed the call was being treated as an alleged ""swatting"" US media reports that a dispute over a game led to one gamer threatening another with a ""swatting"", who then gave the first gamer a fake address. That address was then reportedly given to a third person, a known online ""swatter"", who allegedly made the emergency calls. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

MBE for woman who fostered 100 children,"Stella and Bill Tomkinson (pictured bottom centre) with some of the children they looked after, who are now grown up A great-grandmother who looked after more than 100 children in 50 years has been appointed an MBE for services to foster care. Stella Tomkinson, 79, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, said she had been told about the honour in November. She said although fostering had its ups and downs, ""it is really rewarding"". Mrs Tomkinson said she had been ""really lucky,"" adding: ""I can honestly say that if I lived my life again, I would do exactly the same thing."" She and her husband Bill, a butcher, decided to become foster carers in the 1960s after discovering they could not have children. ""I had six miscarriages; it was heartbreaking,"" she said. They adopted a five-week-old baby girl in 1962 and then put their names down to adopt further children - only to be asked to foster a little girl with health problems instead. That prompted the couple to foster more children, including several with disabilities. ""The most we had living with us at any one time was seven,"" said Mrs Tomkinson. ""At the start, we just lived in a normal three-bedroom terrace in Nuneaton. We always had room for everyone though."" Mrs Tomkinson found her emotional attachment to her charges challenging at times. ""I always feel upset when they leave,"" she said. Some children stayed for a few months; others remained until adulthood. Mrs Tomkinson stopped fostering two years ago, after her husband's death in 2009. However, she has set up a weekly support group for parents of children with disabilities through Nuneaton and Bedworth's Mencap Society. She now has six adopted children, 16 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. ""I'm proud of all the children I've looked after,"" she said. ""Many people find Christmas a lonely time and if I hadn't had all these children, I would probably have been lonely too. ""I have been really lucky watching all these children grow up."" Other recipients of honours from Coventry and Warwickshire include: Ian Harrabin, who chairs the Historic Coventry Trust andhelped rescue the city's medieval Charterhouse, is appointed MBE for services to heritage and regeneration in Coventry Former Warwickshire coroner Michael Coker is made an MBE for services to the community Prof Richard Lilford, from the University of Warwick, is appointed a CBE for services to health research Who's on the 2018 honours list?

Polling expert Curtice 'didn't see knighthood coming',"This video can not be played Sir John Curtice: ""This will take quite a while to get used to."" Polling expert and political scientist John Curtice has been given a knighthood inthe Queen's New Year honours list. The veteran psephologist has been honoured for his high-profile work in political analysis. His 2017 election exit poll correctly predicted the Conservatives would lose their majority. The 64-year-old, famous for political predictions, said the honour was ""not something I saw coming"". Cult of Curtice: Love for polling guru Your questions: John Curtice His polling work has been lauded for its accuracy, often departing from the general consensus to correctly predict shock election results. The 2017 prediction led many to say that he was the true winner of the election. It followed accurate predictions in the 2005, 2010, and 2015 general elections. After Sir John's 2015 poll predicted a David Cameron win, former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown promised to eat his hat if it was correct. He was later given a hat-shaped cake on Question Time. In a tweet on Saturday, Lord Ashdown offered his congratulations and jokingly referred to the hat incident, although he misspelled the polling expert's name. Allow Twitter content?

Regular appearances on BBC election coverage have given him a cult following, with memes and even a dedicatedTwitter account,externalto let people know when he is on TV. The election pollster said he was surprised to get the nod. ""The ironic thing is, back in June of this year, the exit poll that I led caused something of a surprise for the country and the result was very much unanticipated,"" he said. ""Well, I have to admit this was not something I saw coming. I am surprised as well as being honoured that I have been granted this knighthood."" Sir John said he was happy that so many people found his work useful. He said: ""The gratifying part of the citation for me is that it is not just for services to social sciences, but to politics. ""It is probably relatively rare for someone who avoids all partisan politics and all partisan comment to actually be cited as giving services to the political life of the nation. ""What seems to be true is that, for good or ill, people find that when I stand in front of a camera and try to explain to people what's going on politically using the academic work that I have done, people say that they find this useful, illustrating and informative."" Polling expert John Curtice has received a knighthood He admitted that he hopes 2018 will be a quieter year for politics. ""I guess like many other people in the political world, I am on tenterhooks as to what 2018 will bring"", he said. ""Many people will be hoping that, in contrast to the last four years, there will not be a major election or referendum, but I guess we've learnt not to presume that will happen. ""If the government doesn't survive for the next 12 months it may be that I'm going to have to chance my reputation yet again with yet another exit poll but, in truth, I'm hoping not and that 2018 will be a relatively quiet year."" Born in Cornwall, he became interested in politics and voting patterns as a child. ""My earliest memories go back to the resignation of Harold Macmillan and the death of Hugh Gaitskell in the early 1960s,"" he said in a2013 BBC interview. ""That's going back to the age of nine or 10, I was following those stories. ""I remember begging my parents to allow me to stay up during the 1964 general election count, and remember that very close result, and that only the following day did we knew that Harold Wilson had got an overall majority. ""Very odd pre-occupations for a nine or 10-year-old I utterly admit,"" He studied at Oxford, and in the late 1980s was approached by Strathclyde University to take over ""number crunching"" in their politics department, and has remained in the country throughout the intervening years. His time at Strathclyde has overseen the birth of devolution in Scotland, and the independence referendum in 2014. As well as his post at Strathclyde University, he is a senior research fellow at NatCen Social Research - Britain's largest independent social research agency - and president of the British Polling Council. He received a lifetime achievement award earlier this year at the Times Higher Education Awards in London. Sir John's official knighthood citation is for services to social sciences and politics.

Brussels homeless get cardboard tents,"Many people are uncomfortable with current levels of homelessness in Western cities A project in Brussels, Belgium is pioneering portable cardboard tents for homeless people to sleep in. The cardboard tents, known as the ORIG-AMI project, can be transported by users on their backs as they seek shelter. In Brussels, normal tents are forbidden, meaning that homeless people are often moved on by police. Those behind the project hope that their tents will allow the homeless somewhere safe to sleep. The tents will be tolerated by police, they said. The cardboard tents were created by users of a provincial job rehabilitation centre, local news website BX1 reported,external. The cardboard was donated by a cardboard factory and the finished product was assembled by a workshop at the Lantin prison, the website added. Warning over UK's 'hidden' homeless Railway station hosts homeless banquet Many shelters in the Belgian capital are already fully occupied by winter time and some homeless people do not want to go into shelters where they may be separated from their pets. Xavier Van der Stappen, president of an NGO involved with the project, told the French language broadcaster RTBF thatthe fact that ""2,600 people live on the streets in Brussels, in one of the most comfortable countries in the world is hard to accept"",external. This video can not be played Hugo Sugg: 'I've been homeless more than once' The tents were presented on Thursday at the Gare du Nord station.

Â£60m fund to make more British kids' TVThe cash will help commercial broadcasters make more home-grown children's programmes.4h4 hours agoEntertainment & Arts,"ITV has made a new version of Thunderbirds titled Thunderbirds Are Go The government is giving broadcasters including Channel 4 and ITV an extra Â£60m to help them make more home-grown children's programmes. The money will be targeted at commercial channels to help them compete with BBC children's shows. Teletubbies creator Anne Wood welcomed the funding, saying programme-makers ""desperately need more support"".

Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said it would give the children's TV sector ""the boost it needs to create innovative content for a wider audience that would otherwise not be made"". The money will be available for programmes shown by commercial public service broadcasters - including ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 - as well as other ""free and widely available"" channels and streaming services, and potentially other online platforms. Anne Wood, who leads the Save Kids' Content UK campaign, said she was ""deeply grateful"" for the move. ""It shows the government's awareness of the issue and the importance of children's television culture to children in this country,"" she told BBC News. ""We in the children's production sector have never had such difficult times raising finance. We desperately need more support."" The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said the fund could be used to pay for up to 50% of the production and distribution costs of original TV shows.

Knighthood for Clegg in New Year Honours,"Former Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has been knighted in the New Year Honours list. Sir Nick, who led his party into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010, is recognised for political and public service. He said he was ""grateful"" for the knighthood which ""belongs as much to my team in government as it does to me"". Tory MP Graham Brady and Labour's Lindsay Hoyle were also knighted. And Prof John Curtice - whose exit poll correctly predicted the hung Parliament in June's general election - is knighted for services to social sciences and politics. Political honours are considered by a special committee set up in 2012, which includes independent members and party representatives. Pollster John Curtice gets knighthood Barry Gibb, Ringo Starr and Darcey Bussell head honours list Sir Nick, who lost his Sheffield Hallam seat in the election, follows several of his Liberal Democrat colleagues in being knighted. He faced heavy criticism from some wings of his party when he agreed to join the Conservatives in a coalition government after the 2010 general election produced a hung Parliament. Despite some predictions - and an outcry when tuition fees were increased despite a Lib Dem manifesto pledge - the arrangement lasted for the duration of the Parliament, although the party then suffered heavily in the 2015 general election, after which Mr Clegg resigned as leader. Since leaving Parliament, he has continued to campaign against the UK's departure from the EU - recently publishing a book called How to Stop Brexit (and Make Britain Great Again). Seeking to avoid any confusion, hewrote on Twitter,external: ""The knighthood does not mean I will serve in the House of Lords. My aversion to unelected Legislatures remains."" Commons Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle has been knighted As chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs, Sir Graham is a powerful figure within the Parliamentary Conservative Party. The committee's treasurer Geoffrey Clifton-Brown is also knighted, and its vice-chairwoman Cheryl Gillan made a Dame. Another Conservative MP, veteran former minister Christopher Chope, is knighted. On the Labour side, Mr Hoyle, who represents Chorley, is joined by fellow Lancashire MP Mark Hendrick (Preston) in receiving a knighthood. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said she was ""delighted"" to become a CBE. The former Tory children's minister Edward Timpson, who lost his Crewe and Nantwich seat at the election, has also been made a CBE. David Johnston, chief executive of the Social Mobility Foundation charity, is appointed OBE for services to social mobility and education. He recently quit along with the rest of the board of the government's Social Mobility Commission. Political awards are often the most controversial parts of the honours list. In the Tories' 2017 general election manifesto, Theresa May promised to ""review the honours system to make sure it commands public confidence, rewards genuine public service and that recipients uphold the integrity of the honours bestowed"". SNP Cabinet Office spokesman Tommy Sheppard said many of this year's honours list could be ""rightly proud of the recognition their honour gives to their works"". But he added: ""However, they should not be doled out political favours. Sadly, successive Westminster governments have risked demeaning the system by making obvious political appointments.""

"BEM for organ donation campaigner, 18","This video can not be played Lucia Mee's organ donor campaigning saw her named on the New Year Honours list Lucia Mee has been awarded a British Empire Medal for her work raising awareness of organ donation. The 18-year-old, from Ballycastle in Northern Ireland, who has had three liver transplants - the first aged eight - is the youngest person on the New Year Honours list. She campaigns for organ donation to be taught in schools and for everyone to sign the organ donation register. She previously told the BBC that each new organ was ""a gift"". Miss Mee was diagnosed with auto immune hepatitis when she was young and told she needed a new liver. However, two transplant surgeries in 2007 and 2009 ended in her body rejecting the new organs and she received her third new liver when she was 16. ""For me, it has always been a special thing to know that the decision has not been made for someone but has been a gift from each person or their family,"" she said. ""Whatever system we have in place it is more important in my view that it operates alongside education and conversation."" She also said the family should always have the final say. And she said recently: ""There is not enough evidence that the opt-out system results in more organ donations if it is done without education."" Barry Gibb, Ringo Starr and Darcey Bussell head honours list The life-saving gift of organ donation Does an opt-out system increase transplants? Miss Mee said she had written to two of her organ donors but had not heard anything back from them. She is now finishing up her studies at school in Country Antrim after her most recent liver transplant. Government ministers in Northern Ireland and England are thinking of moving to a system of 'presumed consent', in which people would have to opt out of organ donation rather than opting in by signing a donor register. A consultation on the new systemhas already started. Wales has already adopted the 'presumed consent' approach and Scotland plans to introduce a similar scheme. Around 6,500 people in the UK are currently waiting for an organ transplant. One in 10 recipients of this year's honours were from the health sector. They include a damehoods for Cathy Warwick, former chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives and Clare Marx, outgoing president of the Royal College of Surgeons, and a CBE for Dr Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Institute, for services to genetics and stem cell research.

Grenfell council apology over payment errorTen households made homeless by the fire did not receive promised Christmas relief payments.7h7 hours agoLondon,"The council responsible for Grenfell Tower has apologised after 10 of the  households left homeless by the disaster did not receive promised Christmas relief payments. Kensington and Chelsea Council's deputy leader Kim Taylor-Smith said it was the authority's error and steps had been taken to correct it. The 10 were said to be from Grenfell Tower and other nearby evacuated homes. The council said it paid out more than 440 additional Christmas food payments. Many of the families evacuated after the fire that killed 71 people in the west London tower block in June are still living in temporary accommodation - either hotels or serviced flats, some without cooking facilities. Why no-one heard the Grenfell blogger's warnings Grenfell Tower: The 21st floor Following concerns that they may face higher costs at Christmas, the council offered an extra payment of Â£140 per person for food. Mr Taylor-Smith said of the non-payments, which had also affected eight other households in the wider estate: ""This was our error and we are sorry for this and have taken steps to deal with the households we are aware of."" He said households can get the money on a pre-paid credit card immediately, but if they wanted the money paid directly into a bank account, it will take a few days to process. He said residents could contact the Care for Grenfell team if they needed help.

Millennials to enjoy 'inheritance boom',"Millennials will benefit from the biggest ""inheritance boom"" of any post-war generation, but it will be too late to solve housing struggles and wealth inequality, a report says. Those who have parents and grandparents in the ""baby boomer"" generation will be left record sums of wealth, the Resolution Foundation said. But they will have to wait - until, on average, the age of 61, it suggests. The think tank defines millennials as those currently aged 17 to 35. The Resolution Foundation said that inheritances were set to more than double over the next 20 years, and this will peak in 2035, as the generally high-wealth baby boomers progress through old age. Millennials 'lose wages race with Gen X' Where do 70% of millennials own a home? MPs given guide to millennials Have baby boomers stolen the family silver? Almost two-thirds of young adults have parents who own property, which they may get a share of in the future, the report said. By comparison, only 38% of adults born in the 1930s received an inheritance. The report also noted millennials were only half as likely to own their home at 30 as baby boomers were. Laura Gardiner, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Older generations have benefitted hugely from the big increases in household wealth in Britain over recent decades. ""While the millennials have done far less well in accumulating their own assets, they are likely to benefit from an inheritance boom in the decades ahead. ""This is likely to be very welcome news for those millennials, including some from poorer backgrounds who in the past would have been unlikely to receive bequests. ""They have the good fortune to benefit from the luck of the baby boomer generation."" But she said inheritance was ""not the silver bullet"" that will get the generation on the housing ladder or address growing wealth gaps in society, as it was unlikely to come when they are trying to buy a family home. 25-year-old Rachel Hosie, a lifestyle writer for the Independent, says the proposed inheritance boom is not much comfort to her generation. ""We have student debts, we don't have guaranteed pensions, and we've had tricky financial times to have been entering the world of work. ""We were really told for a lot of my generation that if we were ambitious and worked hard then we'd get a good job after studying hard, then we'd earn money and be able to buy a house and settle down - and we'd have this life that we saw a lot of our parents have, and now we're struggling,"" she said. However, Cari Rosen - who's the editor ofGransnet, an online community for the over-50s,external- says the report misses out an important factor. ""Half of women and a third of men are going to have to pay for care at some point. And actually one in four people who pays for care runs out of money,"" she said. ""So we have said to our own millennial there might well be nothing left for you,"" she added. She said: ""Of course we want to give our children an inheritance, the thought that what we've worked really hard for doesn't go to our children to help them through their lives is a really terrible one - but we don't know and there is no way of preparing for that or insuring for that.""

New Year's Eve travel disruption looms,"A 24-hour strike is expected to cause disruption on some of the UK's main railway lines on New Year's Eve. A walkout by Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) members will bring delays and cancellations on South Western Railway (SWR) and CrossCountry networks. The union says it is striking over concerns about rosters, Sunday working and guards on trains. The government has accused the union of causing ""misery"" for passengers. Sunday's strike will disrupt services to and from London Waterloo, the country's busiest station. Managing director of South Western, Andy Mellors, said: ""We will do everything we can to keep our passengers moving during this unnecessary strike but passengers are warned to check before travelling and be prepared for queues if travelling back from the New Year's Eve fireworks."" CrossCountry is planning to run a reduced service between Newcastle and Edinburgh. There will not be a service between Glasgow and Aberdeen. All other CrossCountry lines are expected to be affected. Staying in this New Year? Youâre not alone Which New Year resolutions have you kept? The RMT union is planning more strikes in January on South Western, Southern, Merseyrail, Greater Anglia and Arriva Rail North. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""It's the continuing failure of the train companies and their political puppet masters in government to make any attempt whatsoever to resolve the range of separate disputes over rail safety that has led us to call this further action."" He added: ""The responsibility for the disruption that will be caused lays fairly and squarely at their door."" Rail minister Paul Maynard said: ""It is disgraceful that the RMT is seeking to cause misery to paying customers trying to get home to family and friends for the new year. ""Rail companies are working hard to keep passengers moving, and plan to run the majority of services, but we call on the RMT to show some decency and call off these strikes."" Over the Christmas period,snow and ice caused severe disruption to road, rail and air travel. The Met Office has issued an amber warning covering Northern Ireland and parts of southern and western Scotland, as Storm Dylan arrives to bring a wet and windy end to 2017. Forecasters warned there was the potential for ""injuries and danger to life from flying debris"", as winds are expected to reach 80mph. Some disruption across the road, rail and ferry network is also likely. However,organisers of Edinburgh's Hogmanay say they expect the event to go ahead, as any severe weather is due to happen before Sunday night's celebrations begin.

Although ITV no longer has the daily offering of children's TV shows that many children of the 1970s and 1980s will remember, it does screen a range of children's programmes on its channels, often to be seen on ITV early on weekend mornings. Itrecently announced a new show, Spy School,external- described as an entertainment game show challenging child contestants to solve puzzles and crack codes - that will be on air from 7 January. Its other popular shows include the animated adventures of Mr Bean, a new version of Thunderbirds titled Thunderbirds Are Go, the Saturday morning show Scrambled! and the comedy Bottom Knocker Street. The announcement of the extra funding comes after media watchdog Ofcom was given new powers to set quotas for children's shows on public service broadcasters.

Holiday promotions 'can be misleading',"Holiday firms which advertise time-limited offers may be misleading consumers, according to the consumer group, Which? Many tour operators promote money-off deals, providing travellers book by a certain date. But when Which? studied such offers, it found that half the holidays advertised were the same price  -or even cheaper - after the offer expired. The firms involved have all denied misleading their customers. However two operators - Kuoni and Inghams - told Which? they had reviewed the way they  promote their holidays as a result of the findings. Which? looked at 30 examples over a three-week period in July and August 2017. In 16 of those cases, it found prices were lower, or the same, after the deal was over. Which? claimed that in some cases the promotions could be in breach of consumer law. In one example, Virgin Holidays advertised seven nights in a Florida hotel for Â£792 per person, if it was booked by 17 August. But according to Which? the day after the sale the price dropped to Â£677 per person - a saving of Â£230 for two people sharing. Many holiday firms advertise time-limited offers In October the Caribbean resort Sandals advertised an all-inclusive break to Jamaica from Â£1,465 per person. Yet the day after the ""mega sale"" ended, the price dropped by Â£50 a person. Virgin Holidays told Which? that it would never intentionally advertise anything misleading. It added: ""We're always looking to secure the best possible value for our customers - and should we be able to obtain better offers from our suppliers, these savings will be passed on to benefit the customer."" Unique Caribbean Holidays - which represents Sandals in the UK - said the company does not intentionally ""pressure sell"", or create false ""book by"" dates. It said all its packages were fairly promoted to the consumer. However Which? is advising holidaymakers to take their time before deciding to make a booking. ""Our investigation shows that most of the time-limited deals we looked at are nothing of the sort,"" said Rory Boland, Which? travel editor. ""The tight deadlines, emotive language and countdown clocks are all designed to rush us into making a decision, but it might not be the right one."" ""Don't be fooled - compare prices with other holiday companies and travel agents to check savings are genuine."" The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) said that most of its members follow its code of conduct, which stipulates that promotions should not be misleading. ""The Which? findings relate to a small number of instances, and we do not believe they are reflective of wider travel industry practice,"" an ABTA spokesperson said. ""The number of complaints we receive each year about holiday pricing is very low - indicating that the majority of price advertising is trustworthy.""

Grenfell council apology over payment error,"The council responsible for Grenfell Tower has apologised after 10 of the  households left homeless by the disaster did not receive promised Christmas relief payments. Kensington and Chelsea Council's deputy leader Kim Taylor-Smith said it was the authority's error and steps had been taken to correct it. The 10 were said to be from Grenfell Tower and other nearby evacuated homes. The council said it paid out more than 440 additional Christmas food payments. Many of the families evacuated after the fire that killed 71 people in the west London tower block in June are still living in temporary accommodation - either hotels or serviced flats, some without cooking facilities. Why no-one heard the Grenfell blogger's warnings Grenfell Tower: The 21st floor Following concerns that they may face higher costs at Christmas, the council offered an extra payment of Â£140 per person for food. Mr Taylor-Smith said of the non-payments, which had also affected eight other households in the wider estate: ""This was our error and we are sorry for this and have taken steps to deal with the households we are aware of."" He said households can get the money on a pre-paid credit card immediately, but if they wanted the money paid directly into a bank account, it will take a few days to process. He said residents could contact the Care for Grenfell team if they needed help.

Family want answers over murdered gran,"Valerie Graves' murder has been a mystery for four years The family of a grandmother who was bludgeoned to death say they want answers, not revenge. Valerie Graves was found murdered while she was house sitting for friends in Bosham exactly four years ago. Sussex Police has renewed an appeal for information to mark the anniversary. The 55-year-old artist's ex-partner Roy Wood, father to her children Tim Wood and Jemima Harrison, said: ""We are just waiting and hoping that one day we will know what happened."" Valerie Graves and her family were house-sitting for friends over Christmas The 69-year-old, of Portslade, East Sussex, added: ""None of us feel a thirst for revenge. We would want the killer to be caught so they cannot do it again to someone else. ""We all live in this era of watching something on television where it gets solved in six episodes. We have that expectation. It doesn't happen like that in real life."" There were no signs of a struggle but a post-mortem examination found she had severe head injuries after being hit with a claw hammer, which was found 600 metres from the house in Hoe Lane. Valerie Graves was killed with this hammer, but no DNA match has been found A partial DNA profile indicated the wielder was a man. Nearly 3,000 men who lived, worked or visited the village provided a DNA sample and thumbprint to eliminate themselves from the inquiry, in one of the biggest investigations in Sussex Police's history, A match for the killer's DNA has not been found and the murder remains unsolved. An inquest in 2015ruled her death was an unlawful killingand police are offering a Â£10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.

US warns Iran: The world is watching,"This video can not be played Protesters take to streets venting anger against authorities The US says ""the world is watching"" how Iranian authorities respond to anti-government protests that have broken out in several cities. Thousands of people have joined the protests, with scores arrested. A White House statement said Iranians were fed up with ""the regime's corruption and its squandering of the nation's wealth to fund terrorism"". Meanwhile, authorities urged supporters to turn out for nationwide demonstrations on Saturday. The rallies are commemorating the 2009 demonstrations held in support of the then conservative government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Those demonstrations were in response to protests by reformists over a disputed election which returned him to power. The BBC's Persian Service says thousands of people were likely to have been bussed into a rally in the capital Tehran. ""The Iranian government should respect their people's rights, including their right to express themselves. The world is watching,""White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Twitter,external. The tweet later appeared on President Donald Trump's Twitter account. The US State Department urged all nations ""to publicly support the Iranian people and their demands for basic rights and an end to corruption"". Allow Twitter content?

First Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri has suggested that government opponents are behind the protests, according to comments reported by state broadcaster IRIB. He said: ""Some incidents in the country these days are on the pretext of economic problems, but it seems there is something else behind them. They think by doing this they harm the government, but it will be others who ride the wave."" Footage posted on social media showed street protests in Kermanshah Earlier, Fars news agency reported that protesters in Kermanshah had destroyed some public property and were dispersed. The governor-general of Tehran said that any such gatherings would be firmly dealt with by the police, who are out in force on the main roads. Hassan Rouhani, the president who moved left Iranians urge Rouhani not to disappoint Officials in Mashhad said the protest was organised by ""counter-revolutionary elements"", and video online showed police using water cannon. The protests started in the north-eastern city of Mashhad- the country's second most-populous - on Thursday. People there took to the streets to express anger at the government over high prices, and vented their fury against President Hassan Rouhani. Fifty-two people were arrested for chanting ""harsh slogans"". The protests spread to other cities on Friday, with thousands turning out in Kermanshah, Rasht, Isfahan and Qom. In Tehran, social media footage showed a heavy police presence. President Hassan Rouhani is blamed by many for the poor state of the economy Some developed into broader demonstrations against the authorities, calling for the release of political prisoners and an end to police beatings. It was the biggest display of public dissent since huge pro-reform rallies in 2009. The protests were initially against economic conditions and corruption but appear to have turned political. Slogans have been chanted against not just Mr Rouhani but Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and clerical rule in general. Demonstrators were reportedly heard yelling slogans like ""The people are begging, the clerics act like God"". Protests have even been held in Qom, a holy city home to powerful clerics. There is also anger at Iran's interventions abroad. In Mashhad, some chanted ""not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran"", a reference to what protesters say is the administration's focus on foreign rather than domestic issues.

It is also accused of providing arms to Houthi rebels fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which it denies, and is an ally of Lebanon's powerful Shia movement Hezbollah.

Demonstrations of varying sizes are reported to have occurred in at least seven cities.

Show of strength after Iran protests,"Protesters clashed with police at Tehran University Anti-government protests have continued in Iran for a third day, with reports of demonstrations in many cities despite warnings from authorities. At Tehran University, protesters called for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down and there were clashes with police. Demonstrators ignored the interior minister's warning that citizens should avoid ""illegal gatherings"". Meanwhile, thousands of pro-government demonstrators turned out for rallies. These official rallies were organised in advance of the anti-government protests, to mark the eighth anniversary of the suppression of major street protests in 2009. The current protests began in the north-east on Thursday over living standards and by Friday had spread to several major cities. This video can not be played Iranian state TV showed crowds of government supporters in the capital, Tehran Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli urged people not to take part ""as they will create problems for themselves and other citizens"", but videos posted online suggest that protests were held on Saturday in at least nine cities across the country. The Iranian authorities are blaming anti-revolutionaries and agents of foreign powers for the outbreak of protests. The communications minister has also urged Telegram, a popular  mobile messaging app in Iran, to stop ""promoting violence"". In the US, the Trump administration warned Iran overnight that the world was watching its response. Iran's foreign ministry called the comments ""opportunistic and deceitful"". By BBC Persian correspondent Kasra Naji Although small, the anti-government protests on Saturday took on a much greater importance than the government-sponsored rallies. It's not every day that there are thousands of people voicing opposition to the government. As night fell, reports were still coming of protests in many cities. There have been clashes with the police in some places. The common factor in all of them has been protesters' demand for an end to clerical rule in Iran. Widespread discontent is not limited to complaints about rising prices or widespread unemployment. It has been an eye-opening three days for the government, which has been careful not to provoke the protesters too much. The protests started in the north-eastern city of Mashhad- the country's second most-populous - on Thursday. People there took to the streets to express anger at the government over high prices, and vented their fury against President Hassan Rouhani. Fifty-two people were arrested. This video can not be played Protesters take to streets venting anger against authorities The protests spread to at least half a dozen cities on Friday.

Overall, the numbers said to be taking part range from less than 100 in some places to thousands in others - but demonstrations do not appear to be taking place on a massive scale. Information about them has mostly emerged through social media. A video that spread among Persian-language Twitter users earlier on Saturday showed students at Tehran University calling for Mr Khamenei to step down. Allow Twitter content?

"Thai fraudster sentenced to 13,275 yearsPudit Kittithradilok admits duping thousands of victims through a Ponzi-style investment scheme.10h10 hours agoAsia","Some 40,000 people are believed to have been duped by the fraudulent scheme (file picture) A Thai court has sentenced a fraudster to more than 13,000 years in prison. Pudit Kittithradilok, 34, admitted running a Ponzi scheme whereby he promised investors artificially high financial returns. About 40,000 people were persuaded to pour more than $160m (Â£120m) into his companies. The court found he engaged in illicit lending and some 2,653 counts of fraud. Thanks to his confession, it halved his sentence to 6,637 years and six months. He is unlikely to serve more than 20 years, as Thai law sets a maximum 10-year term for each of the two crimes he was convicted of. China hit by financial scam 'epidemic' Prosecutors told the court that Pudit organised seminars where attendees were encouraged to invest in what he said were businesses linked to property development, beauty, used cars and exports, among other things. According to the Bangkok Post, investors were promised generous returns,external, plus incentives to bring new members on board. As with any pyramid scheme, these new cash injections would then be used to pay off the earlier backers. Pudit had been held in Bangkok Remand Prison since his arrest in August, when he was denied bail. The court fined his two companies the equivalent of $20m each. Pudit and the firms were ordered to repay around $17m to the 2,653 identified victims, with 7.5% yearly interest.

Lord Adonis said Prime Minister Theresa May was ""pursuing a course fraught with danger"" over the UK's EU departure. The ex-Labour minister is already a high-profile campaigner against Brexit. A government source said: ""He's been moving closer towards the exit door with each new onslaught he makes against Brexit."" The source added: ""He's now walked through the door before he was pushed."" But Lord Adonis later insisted it had been his decision to leave, as his ""differences with the government had become too great"". Lord Adonis, who was transport secretary under Gordon Brown between 2009 and 2010, has chaired the National Infrastructure Commission since 2015. The commission produces a report in every Parliament advising the government on spending in areas such as transport connections and energy. Lord Adonis sparked anger earlier this year when he compared Brexit to the appeasement of the Nazis in the 1930s, and has repeatedly called for last year's referendum vote to be reversed. In hisresignation letter, he accused Mrs May of ""allying with UKIP and the Tory hard right to wrench Britain out of the key economic and political institutions of modern Europe"", saying the UK was ""hurtling towards the EU's emergency exit with no credible plan for the future of British trade and European co-operation"".

""A responsible government would be leading the British people to stay in Europe while also tackling, with massive vigour, the social and economic problems within Britain which contributed to the Brexit vote."" Lord Adonis said he planned to oppose ""relentlessly"" the government's EU (Withdrawal) Bill in the House of Lords. As well as Brexit, he said the recent decision to end the East Coast rail franchise three years early, would also have forced him to quit, describing it as a bailout costing hundreds of millions of pounds. MP Iain Duncan Smith said the departure of Lord Adonis was ""long overdue"".

"Brexit infecting government, says Adonis","This video can not be played Lord Adonis has quit his role as chairman of the government's Infrastructure Commission Lord Adonis has said he was forced to resign as an independent advisor after the government ""tried to silence"" him. The former Labour minister quit his role as chairman of the government's Infrastructure Commission with an attack on Theresa May's government. He said it had become ""hyper sensitive to any criticism"" as Brexit was ""infecting"" the whole conduct of government - including infrastructure. Conservative MP Chris Philp called his comments ""complete nonsense"". Mr Philp told BBC Breakfast Lord Adonis should ""temper his remarks"" which are ""ill judged and inflammatory"". A government source has said the peer quit before he was pushed - which Lord Adonis has denied.

But as well as Brexit, he also called the decision to end the East Coast rail franchise three years early a mistake. ""I think if we'd had proper conduct of government, as happened before Brexit, no way would Whitehall have allowed a hard-right minister to have agreed the bailout of private rail companies,"" he said. The government deny it was a bailout. Lord Adonis quits government role in stinging letter Lord Adonis said it was the government attempts to silence him after his criticism of this decision, that pushed him to resign. ""Even if they are independent advisors, they get attacked,"" he added. ""It's time for people like me to speak completely frankly, openly and honestly with the British people about the challenges we face and I'll be doing that day after day in the new year.""

The story behind a massacreMy life as a hostage of al-QaedaDavid Hurn and his extraordinary archiveThe president who lived in a cave," It was a good day to spend in the garden - hot and sunny.Trevor Wainwright, Hungerford’s usual bobby on the beat, was on a day off. He was making his way to a part-time gardening job in the nearby village of Inkpen. As he drove the three-and-a-half miles a news report came on the radio about a suspected armed robbery at a petrol station in Froxfield. Someone had shot at the cashier, Kakoub Dean. Luckily she hadn't been injured. The young policeman wondered whether he should see if he could do anything to help. After all, he was in the area and knew Mrs Dean. But, he reasoned, it was his day off. Later that day, his parents were driving up from their home in Kent to visit him. And strictly speaking, it was not his responsibility; Froxfield, though just outside Hungerford, was in Wiltshire rather than Berkshire and beyond the jurisdiction of Thames Valley Police. So he continued to Inkpen and Mrs Roland-Clarke's garden. I could smell cordite in the air."" About half an hour later, Mrs Roland-Clarke called him to the telephone. It was Jane, PC Wainwright's then-wife. She told him someone was shooting across the back gardens of their road. ""I put two and two together and assumed that the armed robbers from Froxfield had been cornered in Hungerford,"" he said. ""I rushed back to check on Jane and on the way I saw smoke coming up from South View [a nearby street]. People were sheltering in doorways and I pulled up and asked what was going on. ""'Some bloke’s gone mad with a gun', they said. I hurried home and got out of the car. I could smell cordite in the air. Sharp, acrid and smoky."" He told his wife to stay indoors with the little girl she was babysitting and headed off to Hungerford town centre, first to a newsagent to buy some maps and then to the police station. ""The station was locked, so I let myself in with a key. It was absolute panic stations. ""I effectively put myself on duty and thought because of my local knowledge I could show the armed response team the back routes around the town. Ambulances lined the main street. ""Members of the public were in the station with the police. I saw Robert Clements – he’d been walking the dog with his dad, Ken, and just witnessed him shot dead in South View. I knew I had to help."" When PC Wainwright, wearing his off-duty clothes of shorts and a Fred Perry polo shirt, was called into his superior's office, he thought he was going to be told to put his uniform on. Instead, Sgt Ryan said: ""I don’t know how to tell you this. Your dad's been shot. He's dead."" Trevor Wainwright still lives in Hungerford The elder Mr and Mrs Wainwright had been about 300 yards from their son's house when Douglas Wainwright was shot in the head and Kathleen Wainwright in the chest and the hand. Mrs Wainwright had the presence of mind to get out of the car and cower behind it. She knew her husband was dead. The gunman was reloading his weapon and Mrs Wainwright thought he would shoot at her again. This time, close-up. There was no way he would miss. Maybe he was distracted; maybe he enjoyed the power of sparing Mrs Wainwright's life. Either way, he turned away. Two more vehicles driving along the road were shot at. One man was injured. Another, Eric Vardy, was killed. Back at the police station, PC Wainwright was told his mother had been taken to hospital in Swindon. He headed straight there and was greeted by a nurse who said Kathleen was fine and Douglas was in the operating theatre. Over the moon at the news of his father's survival, PC Wainwright telephoned his brothers and sister. Then the nurse came back. ""She asked me what my dad looked like,"" he says. ""I told her he had tattoos, was about 6ft 1in and had grey hair. And she said ‘I'm really sorry. That's not him’. ""He was dead after all. That was possibly even worse than hearing it the first time."" By now, the name of the gunman was circulating. When PC Wainwright heard it was Michael Ryan from South View, he couldn't put a face to the name. ""In fact, I first thought it was another lad who lived there. A right little sod. Michael Ryan was just so, so insignificant. ""And then I remembered the name. I had been the one to carry out the checks for Ryan’s firearms licence."" The primary school where Marjorie Jackson was a caretaker had broken up for the summer holidays. She had been to check on the building, which was just the other side of the street from her South View home, and was returning to her house for lunch when a springer spaniel ran past. It was being chased up the road by Michael Ryan. The dog and its pursuer rounded a bend before disappearing from view. Mrs Jackson had known Ryan all of his life. They lived a few doors from each other and their families were friends. He was as good as gold."" Dorothy Ryan, Michael’s mother, was a lunchtime supervisor at the primary school where Mrs Jackson worked. Michael used to play at Mrs Jackson's home with one of her sons. She remembers Michael as quiet and polite. ""He was as good as gold. Wouldn't hurt a fly."" Having chased the spaniel away, Ryan returned. Mrs Jackson noticed he was holding a gun in each hand. He looked at her. His face, she says, was expressionless. ""I just started to run. I've never run so fast. He was shooting at me. The dust was flying up from the ground around my feet as the bullets hit. ""I was desperate to get into the house. He chased me all the way. ""I got into the house and slammed the door. I thought I was safe."" I didn't want to worry anyone."" But she wasn't. Ryan looked in through the kitchen window and pointed his gun at her. ""I turned to move away and he shot me. He got me in my lower back. ""I knew I’d been hit. There was a terrible burning pain. I couldn't walk. I couldn’t move my legs. I was on the floor. All I could think of was the dogs. I thought he'd come in and kill them."" Mrs Jackson, a bullet lodged in the base of her spine, crawled through the blood and glass on her linoleum and managed to lock Katie and Raffles, a Pekingese and a Tibetan spaniel, into a kitchen cupboard. Then she phoned the building firm where her husband Ivor was a bricklayer, and asked for a message to be passed on. ""I said I needed a bit of help at home but I didn't say what had happened. I should have said but I didn’t want to worry anyone. ""I didn’t know the Masons at No. 6 were already dead."" Their friend George White, who worked with Ivor, said he'd drive him home. ""I didn’t know by doing that, by asking him to come home, I was just leading them both into danger."" While Ryan roamed Hungerford, murdering and maiming people he'd known for years, a woman lay dead in Savernake Forest. The beauty spot near Marlborough is a popular place with dog walkers, picnickers and ramblers. It was one of the young Ryan's favourite places, where he enjoyed tracking wildlife through the undergrowth and practising survival skills. He also had a more sinister motivation for visiting the woodland. A former school friend remembers a teenage Ryan boasting of spying on and stalking people there. ""He used to say he could follow anyone and they wouldn’t notice,"" said the friend. ""I think he used to do it quite often, but then with him… he used to say lots of things. But this did actually ring true. ""He used to wear camouflage gear, that sort of thing. He took it seriously."" Prof Craig Jackson, a psychologist who specialises in spree killers, thinks there was also a sexual motive. He believes Ryan would get an illicit sexual thrill during his woodland trips and obtain pleasure and a sense of accomplishment from following and watching people unseen. It's not known whether Ryan spent a long time watching Sue Godfrey, a 35-year-old nurse who had stopped with her two young children for a picnic lunch. It is known that he made her put her son and daughter, aged two and four, in her car. He then shot her in the back with a Beretta pistol. Susan Godfrey was shot dead in Savernake Forest Pathologists determined she was killed by the first three bullets. Ryan hadn’t stopped there, though. He carried on, shooting Mrs Godfrey 13 times until he ran out of ammunition. Her children, who were 85 yards away from where her body was found, were later reunited with their father. The investigation into Mrs Godfrey's death found she had not been raped. However, Prof Jackson said it was likely Ryan had intended to do so. A groundsheet was found nearby, which could have been laid by Ryan in order to contain DNA evidence. ""I think she either refused to [have sex] or resisted,"" he said. ""Perhaps he killed her in panic when she attempted to run away."" Prof Jackson's colleague at Birmingham City University, Dr Elizabeth Yardley, has a different theory. Prof Craig Jackson believes Ryan had a sexual motive She thinks he saw Mrs Godfrey and her children having a picnic and enjoying themselves. ""It was a happy occasion and I think he felt resentful and victimised and wanted to seize control. ""If he did have a sexual crime in mind, then that would have been about control too."" What happened in the woods is the clue to why the shootings happened, Prof Jackson believes. ""I don't think he fully intended to commit a killing spree that day. I believe Ryan had probably been fantasising about it on a low level, but the events that day - and his personality type - led to it. ""He certainly had no 'manifesto' or message to the world."" Prof Jackson also considers Ryan was heavily influenced by a mass shooting occurring 10 days earlier in Melbourne, Australia, that was reported on television in the UK. Julian Knight killed seven people in Melbourne The Hoddle Street massacre was committed by a former soldier who wore combat fatigues. Having murdered Mrs Godfrey, Ryan headed back to Hungerford in his Vauxhall Astra GTE, stopping at Froxfield filling station. He put some petrol in his car and some in a canister. Then he shot at Mrs Dean and sped back to South View where he set fire to his home and shot dead his dog, Blackie. ""I think he fully intended to fake his own death at home and disappear at that point,"" says Prof Jackson. ""He was going to set fire to his mother's house and drive away, leaving the police to believe he'd died in the fire."" If this was his plan, it fell to pieces when his car would not restart. Prof Jackson says it was at this point Ryan changed his plans. ""He was trapped and didn't have a viable way out of his situation."" He left his shotguns in his broken-down car, grabbed a pistol and two automatic rifles and almost immediately shot dead Roland and Sheila Mason, who were in their garden at the back of 6 South View. What had led Ryan to this point? He had what appeared to be a normal upbringing, although he was perhaps overindulged by his mother. Ryan was a shy child with a keen interest in the military An investigation after the shootings found both Dorothy and Michael Ryan had been overdrawn on their bank accounts - in Dorothy's case largely because she bought her only child a new car every two years. Not academically gifted nor particularly driven, Ryan was unremarkable at school. Classmates remember he was quiet, seemed shy, ""kept himself to himself"" and was keen on the military. Leaving school he embarked on a series of casual labouring jobs and was often unemployed. His real passions were cars and guns. Semi-automatic rifles Ryan used during his rampage When he was 13 his mother bought him an air rifle. The boy enjoyed pointing his weapon at cows, birds and even other children, says Dr Yardley. He became a skilled shooter and member of two gun clubs. He legally owned several semi-automatic weapons and told people he had been in the SAS - just one strand of a fantasy life woven by him and apparently perpetuated by his mother. Mrs Jackson can remember Mrs Ryan telling her about a mysterious ""friend"" Michael had made. He claimed he had been taken under the wing of a retired colonel who was going to buy him a house and a Ferrari. There was also a made-up girlfriend - a delusion which went far enough for Mrs Ryan to invite people to the wedding. She'd just say she'd fallen over."" Whether Mrs Ryan truly believed her son's imaginings is impossible to tell. But it appears she never contradicted him in public. Alfred Ryan, Michael's father, had become a parent in his mid-50s and was about 20 years older than Dorothy. The Jacksons remember him as being a model-railway enthusiast and ""a lovely man who would help you with anything"". Although many neighbours described Mr Ryan as a pleasant man, there were rumours he was especially strict with his son. Ryan’s school friend remembers his mother would buy the boy whatever he wanted, but his father ""couldn’t be played"" and ""wore the trousers"" in the house. It was following Alfred's death in 1985 that Mrs Ryan began appearing at work with visible bruises, Mrs Jackson says. ""She'd just say she'd fallen over or something. It just seemed to happen quite a lot."" Dr Liz Yardley says Ryan felt victimised Dr Yardley says Ryan would have learned how to treat women from how his father treated his mother. ""[Mr Ryan] was quite the bully. Ryan's mother consistently pandered to her husband and son so Michael saw her as someone who was there to do things for him and essentially serve him - so he felt a sense of entitlement to treat her however he wanted."" Prof Jackson says violence towards his mother would fit in with Ryan's psychological profile as a narcissist who could not cope with being disobeyed, disagreed with or challenged. He adds that an overindulgent mother could also have led to Ryan never taking responsibility for his actions - a personality trait common to many spree killers. Despite his elaborate fantasies, however, Ryan was not mentally ill. Medical reports show he had no history of mental illness - in fact, his doctor had countersigned Ryan's gun applications. Ryan was a member of two gun clubs On 19 August 1987, the 27-year-old loner was in licensed possession of two shotguns, three pistols and two semi-automatic rifles. Dr Yardley and Prof Jackson both believe that Ryan did not ""snap"" and carry out the killings. Dr Yardley thinks he planned them well in advance. The speed with which he carried out his agenda indicates an element of forethought. Mrs Godfrey was killed at about 12:30 BST and Mrs Dean was shot at just five minutes later at the petrol station. Ryan was well-known for driving ""like a bat out of hell"" - the only time he had been in trouble with the police was for breaking the speed limit. He arrived back in South View in time to set fire to his home, shoot his dog, chase another dog, and take three guns from his car before killing Mr and Mrs Mason at 12:47. The final shooting took place at about 13:45. ""It's difficult to ascertain exactly how much he planned it, but I think it was well in advance and right down to minor details,"" says Dr Yardley. ""If it had happened today, there would probably be some sort of trail on a computer as perpetrators tend to do a lot of research."" Because Ryan burned down his home, any evidence of planning was destroyed. Dr Yardley believes Ryan was attempting to wrest some sort of control from society. A single man, unemployed and living with his mother, with no evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship in his life, he perhaps had precious little to be happy about. ""What he did was the ultimate taking back of control. He also knew the day would end in the loss of his own life, so in effect he was choosing when to die."" George White was driving Ivor Jackson back from work. It was about 10 minutes since Mrs Jackson had asked her husband to return home and the two men had no idea of the danger into which they were heading. Ryan was on the loose in South View. Armed with three guns, he had already murdered six people and seriously injured seven more. As Mr White turned his Toyota Crown into South View, he was shot in the head and died instantly. Next to him, in the passenger seat, Ivor Jackson was also shot in his arm, chest and head. Their car smashed into the back of another car. It was a police vehicle which had its blue lights flashing. Mr Jackson decided to play dead. Oh no Ivor, not you."" With blood running down his face, he could only watch through half-closed eyes as Dorothy Ryan, Michael’s mother, arrived home from the Wednesday market. ""Dorothy came past me, and she looked into the car and I remember it as clear as day. She said: 'Oh no Ivor, not you.'"" Ryan was holding one of his most prized possessions - a Chinese copy of a Kalashnikov semi-automatic rifle. Could she talk some sense into her son? Dorothy Ryan tried to reason with her son ""She tried to tell Michael to stop and he shot her at close range,"" Mr Jackson adds. ""She was dead on the ground, on her front just by the drive of our house. ""Then he shot her again, twice, in the back, from about four inches away."" As smoke filled the air from Ryan’s burning house, more people were hiding inside their homes. A few doors down, a 14-year-old girl was staring at her legs. She had started the day wearing yellow trousers, borrowed from her sister. They were turning red with blood. Lisa Mildenhall had been in the garden with her sister and two children from another house. The other three ducked down on the floor but Ryan fired at Lisa. She was hit in the legs and the hips. One of the boys she was with went to fetch his mother, Sylvia Pascoe, a qualified first-aider who lived at No 14. Sylvia Pascoe still lives in South View ""I assumed it had been some sort of accident with glass and that Lisa had been cut,"" she says. ""I went to help and she said Michael Ryan had shot her. ""I just thought she was delirious from blood loss."" Her training with St John Ambulance had led her to believe she could not have been shot, as bullets typically leave a large exit wound. ""There were no big wounds at the back of Lisa's legs. I later realised that was because the bullets were still in her. I could see her hip bone."" The teenager was still standing up when Mrs Pascoe arrived to help her. She seemed more concerned about her trousers than her wounds. Mrs Pascoe stemmed the bleeding and stayed with the girl until an ambulance arrived. Ambulance driver Hazel Haslett arrived minutes later. Ryan shot at her, making a hole in the side window. Hazel Haslett escaped with minor injuries Ms Haslett reversed rapidly and she and her partner escaped with only minor injuries. Still shooting, Ryan then walked to the end of the road, went along a footpath and made his way across some playing fields. He wasn't finished yet. 1 - Roland Mason2 - Sheila Mason3 - Kenneth Clements4 - PC Roger Brereton5 - Abdul Khan6 - George White7 - Dorothy Ryan8 - Francis Butler9 -  Marcus Barnard10 - Douglas Wainwright11 - Eric Vardy12 - Sandra Hill13 - Victor Gibbs14 - Myrtle Gibbs15 - Ian Playle ● Susan Godfrey was shot and killed in Savernake Forest Shortly after Ms Haslett escaped South View, her colleague Derek Whiting arrived in a second ambulance, completely unaware that a gunman was at large. He noticed the blue flashing light on the police car and decided to stroll up to ask the officer what was going on. Moving closer, he noticed the rear window of the police car had been shot out. Inside, PC Roger Brereton, a traffic officer who had volunteered to investigate, was slumped against the steering wheel, clearly dead. Mr Whiting did not understand. He was still labouring under the impression that there might have been a shooting accident. Gunshots were often heard from Hungerford Common, at one end of South View. Both recreational and agricultural shooting were normal occurrences in the area. Then he realised the policeman’s wounds had not been caused by a shotgun but by a semi-automatic rifle. Shell cases were littering the ground. He saw Mrs Ryan lying dead on the road. He saw the Masons, dead in their garden. He saw Mr White and Mr Jackson in the car and Mr Clements - who had been walking his dog with his family - lying dead on the footpath. George White and PC Roger Brereton were in their cars when they were shot Rather than getting away from the carnage in South View, he started to check the houses to find and help the injured. ""When you work for the ambulance service, you do your best to help people,"" Mr Whiting says. Because the road was blocked by PC Brereton and Mr White's car, he and his partner could not drive their ambulance up, so he went on foot. He pulled the wheeled stretcher with him and managed to load both Mr and Mrs Jackson and Lisa Mildenhall into the ambulance. But what he did not realise was he was personally affected by the shootings. As his wife, Mary, says: ""So many of our family were shot that day."" Several of Derek and Mary Whiting's relatives were shot She had been at work in Hungerford when the news about the shootings came on the radio. ""We were all told to lie down and not move. Then the radio announced the names of some of the people who’d been shot, but didn't say if they were dead or alive. ""My brother and sister-in-law were on the list."" Alan Lepetit, Mrs Whiting's brother, was a neighbour of Ryan's, living in South View. The week before the shootings he had helped Ryan bring a heavy cabinet down the stairs. It was his gun cupboard. Mr Lepetit said: ""I gave him a hand one week, and the next he shot me and set fire to my house."" Linda Chapman and her teenage daughter Alison - Mr Whiting's sister and niece - were hit. They survived, although Alison still has a bullet inside her. Then Ryan had shot and killed Abdul Khan, a hard-of-hearing 84-year-old who was gardening. It is thought he might not have heard the commotion. Ryan headed across the playing fields, still shooting. As he approached a playground near Bulpit Lane he shot and killed dog walker Francis Butler. The Whitings' son Matthew, who was 11 at the time, was with his childminder in the playground and saw Mr Butler being shot. Mrs Whiting remembers: ""He was very upset for weeks afterwards. He would insist on lying down on the back seat of the car if we ever went out, so he couldn't be seen. ""I always encouraged him to talk about what happened, and one day he whispered to me and asked if he could use a rude word. ""I said he could, and he said: 'When that man shot that man, all of the birds flew out of the trees and shat themselves'. ""You know, it's funny. Everyone remembers the silence. The birds didn't sing again for five days."" Helicopters were hovering over Hungerford. Ryan had murdered 16 people and seriously injured 15 more, but his whereabouts were unknown. The phone lines were inundated with people trying to call police - journalists were taking up many of the lines - and the police radio system, which only had three channels, was similarly overloaded. Typically, by the time people got through to the 999 system, Ryan had gone elsewhere. Some reports were inaccurate, giving the wrong location. The result was police were often up to 40 minutes behind his movements. Marcus Barnard, a local taxi driver, had been a father for just five weeks when he was shot dead. Sandra Hill, who'd moved away from the town, was visiting former school friends. With her window open and radio on in her Renault 5, she became Ryan’s 13th murder victim, dying from a single shot. Ryan had been targeting people he happened across in streets and gardens. Now, he added a new dimension. As he went along Priory Road, Ryan stopped at the home of Myrtle and Victor Gibbs, whose door was, as usual, locked. He used his semi-automatic rifle to strafe the front door and open it. Ryan broke into the Gibbs' house on Priory Road Mr Gibbs tried to protect his wife, who was a wheelchair user. He died instantly from chest wounds. Mrs Gibbs died several days later, in hospital. ""Breaking in or shooting into a house and killing the inhabitants and then holding the position for a while before moving on, would have appealed to his military ideals and fantasies,"" says Prof Jackson. Ian Playle, the last victim to be fatally shot, had in fact been warned of the danger in South View by police. Knowing his way around the streets, he had tried to drive home by another route. But Ryan had moved. As Mr Playle rounded a bend in Priory Street, Ryan fired a single shot. Two days later, Mr Playle died from his injuries. Mr Playle's blue Ford Sierra crashed after he was shot by Ryan His wife and children had been in the car but were unhurt. Police were still hunting for the gunman in their midst. Eventually, shots were heard coming from John O'Gaunt School. Ryan had holed himself up in a second-floor classroom and was shooting through the window at both police and press helicopters. Ryan fired at helicopters from this window At about 16:45, police entered the playground. Ryan was finally cornered and an armed officer trained his sights on him. At 17:25, Ryan threw a semi-automatic rifle from the classroom window. A police negotiator managed to engage him in conversation. Ryan intimated he might be prepared to give himself up. He expressed sorrow over shooting his mother and his dog, and then said: ""Hungerford must be a bit of a mess. ""It's funny, I've killed all those people but I don't have the guts to blow my own brains out."" Seven minutes after saying this, at 18:52, he shot himself in the head. For Michael Ryan, it was over. Later that night, the clear-up began. Fifteen vehicles were taken away for forensic examination. Seventy-eight bullet holes were found. Mrs Pascoe, safe with her neighbours in a community centre, was playing cards with the children to distract them from the horror outside. At about 02:00 she looked out of the window and saw the bodies from South View being collected and driven away. Later, police told her they believed her life had been saved by the fact she'd kept her curtains drawn as she pottered about, doing her housework in her nightgown. She was still wearing it, soaked now with Lisa Mildenhall's blood, when she was finally allowed back home. Four houses, including Ryan's home at the far right, were later demolished In the ambulance on the way to hospital in Swindon, Ivor Jackson's heart had twice stopped beating. He had lost lots of blood, had bullets in his head and chest, his lung had been shot through and his arm was barely attached to his body. He needed numerous operations and still suffers, both physically and mentally. His wife, who had a bullet in her spine, was not expected to walk again. It's testament to her own strength of mind that she did. Marjorie Jackson recuperating in hospital in 1987 ""I just thought to myself, I'm a mother. I need to get better and I will walk again. I knew I had to be the strong one of the family, I knew Ivor wouldn't cope."" Even now Mr Jackson has not been back to South View. He cannot even pass the end of the road. He can barely speak about his friend, George White. ""He was a good man. We were good friends,"" he says. ""I’ll never forget what I saw that day, what happened to him, but I can't tell you. ""Nothing's been right since."" South View became a popular haunt for tourists The Jacksons had loved their home on South View, with its large garden, and were in the process of buying it. But, although the house was cleaned and modernised and made available for them, they could not bear to return. The couple and their two grown-up sons now live in a two-bedroom council house a few streets away. ""After what happened, lots of people split up,"" says Ivor Jackson. ""They couldn’t cope. But we've stuck by each other."" The couple have been married for 60 years and celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary in January. ""We got a letter from the Queen,"" Mr Jackson adds. ""My daughter arranged it."" PC Roger Brereton's funeral was held near Newbury The letter, complete with golden tassel, is still in its recorded delivery envelope and is kept in a basket in the Jacksons' kitchen. They keep meaning to frame it and put it up on the wall. Their younger son Trevor, who had been 18 in 1987, is being treated for PTSD while his older brother Peter, who was in the same year as Ryan at school, refuses to talk about that day. If it comes up, he leaves the room or goes to sit in the greenhouse. Large crowds attended the funerals of Ryan's victims Trevor Jackson had first heard of the shootings when a colleague asked: ""What's happened to your parents?"" He returned to South View to find bodies on the ground and was asked by police to identify them. Then he and his brother Peter went into their home, released the dogs from the cupboard, and started to clean the blood and glass from their kitchen. As the brothers were cleaning up, a reporter burst in. There was a police guard on the front door so he had sneaked through the garden and into the house through the back door. Another reporter followed their sister home from the hospital. I just broke down in tears."" Press intrusion is something the Jacksons continue to feel very strongly about. They usually hang up if a journalist approaches them and refuse to have their photograph taken in connection with the shooting. Similarly the Whitings, for years, simply drew their curtains and refused to answer the door. When, in March 1996 Thomas Hamilton shot dead 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Stirling town of Dunblane, Trevor Wainwright decided to write to the Scottish police. Thomas Hamilton murdered 17 people in Dunblane in 1996 He explained who he was and his experience, and offered sympathy. Then he tore his heartfelt letter up. ""I just thought: 'They don’t want outsiders. They'll do what we did. The help will come from within the community'. ""Writing the letter did me good, but I don't think it would have helped the people of Dunblane."" A few days after the murders, Mr Wainwright - who had carried out the routine checks for Ryan's firearms licence - was astonished to see the Today newspaper’s front page splash. ""PC Signs Own Father’s Death Warrant"". Trevor Wainwright says he is ""haunted"" by his father's death ""I just broke down in tears,"" Mr Wainwright says. ""It hit at the heart of my professionalism, of everything I'd ever done for the town. I probably did three or four of these checks a week. ""It was just routine. Hungerford is a big shooting area, farmers and gun clubs and that sort of thing. I mean, there's no legitimate reason anyone would need to have a Kalashnikov - but it was legal. ""There was a picture of my dad, dead in a car with a blanket over him. ""And I kept thinking, if it was true that I'd signed my dad's death warrant, it meant I'd also signed all those other people's too. At the time,  the idea crucified me. ""At the hospital, where my mum was, everyone who'd been shot had been put into the same ward. I was due to go and visit her, but I thought I couldn't. ""I thought: 'How the hell can I go and see her if they're all blaming me?' ""She told me to get my arse straight down there. No-one blamed me."" Kathleen Wainwright later moved to Hungerford to be near her son He says he was helped by a discovery made at the post-mortem examination - that his father had developed lung cancer. ""If he had the choice - to die from a horrible disease like that, or be shot, I know he'd choose the bullet. Every single time."" He is still haunted, he says, by the photograph of his father dead in his car. If there is a shooting elsewhere in the world, he braces himself for his phone to ring. ""As soon as there's been a shooting, some journalist will call. ""And I hear the arguments of the gun lobby, who want to preserve the right to bear arms, and I think: 'You should come here and see what guns did to Hungerford.'"" Chief Inspector Laurie Fray and PC Colin Lilley hold Ryan's murder weapons The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 was passed in the wake of the massacre. It banned the ownership of semi-automatic firearms and pump-action weapons and made registration mandatory for shotgun owners. A Thames Valley Police report to the Home Office found that - given the limitations imposed by the remote location and the difficulties in radio and telephone communication - the force's response ""went well"". The local police station had only two working phone lines that day and the police helicopter was being repaired, delaying its deployment. Further delays were caused by the firearms squad being in training about 40 miles away. The report also said the operation was hampered by press helicopters making so much noise it was difficult for police on the ground to hear or relay instructions. Hungerford is a pretty canalside town famous for its antiques shops and upmarket boutiques. Its inhabitants refer to the shooting as ""The Tragedy"", almost as if it were a natural disaster. The names of the 16 people who were killed are listed on a stone set into the wall of the town's war memorial garden, with no mention of how they died. The town had long been a tourist destination. After the murders, though, visitors were less satisfied by remaining in the attractive main street. ""The tourist buses would just park where they usually did and then people used to come up here on foot,"" Trevor Jackson says. ""They were looking for bullet holes and spent shell cases to collect. Whenever they asked me where it all happened I'd say it was down the A4. Sent them away."" The description of the shootings as a ""tragedy"" doesn’t sit well with Mrs Jackson. ""It was a massacre,"" she says. ""There’s no two ways about it. ""We cope by taking every day as it comes. It's difficult. Healthwise, we're struggling. ""Ivor has very limited mobility, and his lungs are damaged from the bullet. I still get dreadful pain in my back. Trevor can't move out to his own place. ""It hasn't got any easier. We’re just waiting until life gets back to normal. ""It hasn't happened yet."" Built with Shorthand"
My life as a hostage of al-QaedaDavid Hurn and his extraordinary archiveThe president who lived in a cave," It is a clear cold night in the Sahara desert and Stephen McGown lies on his back gazing up at the stars. Pulling his blanket under his chin he traces out the constellations he learned as a boy in South Africa. “What a holiday of a lifetime this would be,” he thinks, “if I wasn't a hostage of al-Qaeda.” It is early 2017 and the London banker’s fifth year in captivity. He is the only one in the camp who prefers to sleep outside even in winter. But despite living in a vast open space, his life has become “very small and routine”. (Credit: Al Jazeera) Each day Stephen rises before the sun for the Islamic dawn prayer, which he performs kneeling in the sand alongside a fellow hostage, Johan, and their jihadist kidnappers. A breakfast of bread and powdered milk follows, after which the hostages either go back to sleep or exercise. “We were free to move around an area the size of Twickenham Stadium,” Stephen recalls. But if you went too far you'd be reprimanded and the friendly faces would become very stern.” Lunch is spaghetti or rice, stored in giant camouflaged bins and served with meat - goat, sheep or camel. The hostages often cook this for themselves on wood fires as the jihadists prefer their food “swimming in cooking oil”. “The mujahideen would also kill and eat anything that wandered past our camp,” Stephen says. “Once a tortoise came by and they asked me if I would slaughter it. But you had to poke it with sticks to make its head come out. I found it too cruel and let it crawl away.” The hostages spend the hottest part of the day inside their huts resting, and learning and reciting the Koran. “I would often recite in my hut because if I recited around the jihadists they would laugh, as I couldn't get the Arabic sounds quite right,"" Stephen says. “When visitors came they would ask how you were, and then they would always ask, ‘How is the memorising going?’” Later on Stephen gets to work improving hisaabuugi- a hut he has built from broken tree branches. With little else to concentrate on, he is obsessive about the smallest details. “I'd test whether it was better to have higher or lower ventilation, with or without grass in the doorway and try different ways of reducing the glare off the sand,” he says. In the evening everyone unwinds and Stephen makes an effort to socialise with his captors. “They would make tea and watch al-Qaeda videos or sometimes listen to French radio. There were times when I needed my space though. I got tired of them horsing around and joking about death and beheadings.” He goes to bed after the final ritual prayer of the day. “I'd think about my family - whether they were still waiting for me and if they were alive.” Five years earlier, Stephen and his wife Catherine had been packing up their flat in Putney for their move back to Johannesburg. The couple had met in 2006 after moving in to the same shared house in London. Stephen was doing contract work in the City while Catherine was a children’s speech therapist working for the National Health Service. At Catherine's insistence, Stephen moved out while they were dating. They married a year later. Stephen and Catherine loved their time in the UK. “We had a big group of friends,"" Stephen says. “We’d head in to the countryside at weekends and cycle across the South Downs, stopping at a pub midway."" Stephen would also hop on his prized motorbike, taking a fly rod to go fishing in Surrey. But in 2011 the couple decided to head back to South Africa, where they had both grown up. Now in their early thirties, they were ready to settle down and start a family. Stephen also wanted to set up a business exporting jojoba oil from his father’s farm. But while Catherine planned to fly home, Stephen would ride his motorbike through Europe and Africa on a “last big adventure”. Stephen with his mother, Beverley, in London The idea had come to him after watching Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman’s travel documentary, Long Way Down, on the BBC. Cath said I could take six months - but no longer - for my trip.” He left the UK on 11 October 2011 and travelled through France and Spain to Gibraltar where he crossed to Morocco. He then pushed down to Mauritania before heading east into Mali on 9 November. For much of the route he rode with a Dutch motorcyclist called Fokke, although they would separate occasionally if Stephen stopped off to do some birdwatching. After picking up visas in the capital Bamako, the pair planned to continue south to Burkina Faso but decided at the last minute to take a detour and join some tourists heading to Timbuktu. “It was a little off my route but I figured I could go up, get a photo of it and carry on,” Stephen says. Stephen in Mali He arrived in the ancient trading city a day ahead of Fokke, whose bike had broken down en route. Stephen then checked into a cheap traveller’s hotel with Sjaak and Tilly Rijke, a Dutch couple he had met in Morocco. They were joined by a Swedish tourist called Johan Gustafsson and a German traveller called Martin. On 25 November the tourists got up early and went for a walk around Timbuktu. The sun was out and they enjoyed visiting the market and having lunch before returning to the hotel. Stephen was relaxing out on the patio when a group of men rushed through the gate. One guy was waving a pistol and another stayed at the entrance with a Kalashnikov. I thought it might be police.” In the confusion Stephen heard Tilly shout for everyone to get on the floor and under the table. He found himself being dragged out towards a car behind Sjaak and Johan and forced to lie underneath a net. “The German gentleman was putting up a bit of a fight. Then I heard gunshots from the back of the car,” Stephen says. “I told the other guys, ‘I think they’ve killed Martin.’” Malcolm McGown was relaxing at home in Johannesburg when the phone rang. He was half expecting to hear his son's voice. “He had Skyped us a few days earlier from Mali,” Malcolm says. Malcolm McGown “I remember him saying, ‘Dad, I’m not looking to be a hero. If anything looks too dangerous I’ll be on the next flight home.’” But instead it was a Dutch woman calling from the Netherlands, Fokke's mother. “She asked me if I was Stephen’s father. Then she told me he had been taken by al-Qaeda,” Malcolm says. “I was in shock. I wasn’t sure what to do."" After breaking the news to his wife, Beverley, Malcolm rang a few government departments he found in the phone book. ""I got no response. In the end I rang a radio station and asked them for a government phone number,"" he says. Malcolm then rang his daughter who was staying in London with Stephen's wife, Catherine. “I didn’t sleep much in the first few days,” Catherine says. “It was frantic but I was very hopeful. I thought it would be only a few weeks before I saw Steve again. My mind couldn’t get around the concept he would be apart from me for longer than a few months.” A still from the first hostage video released by al-Qaeda Back in Mali, Stephen was bumping along a rough desert road. “Our car had met up with some others and headed north for maybe 15 hours,” Stephen says. The three hostages had been forced to lie down in the car. Stephen got a bloody eye from bouncing against the wheel arch while Sjaak bruised his ribs. Sjaak’s wife Tilly wasn’t with them. She had managed to escape detection by hiding in a tent on top of a van at the hostel. “The journey didn’t feel real,” Stephen says. “I’ve got dual nationality and when I realised I had my British passport in my pocket my blood ran cold. I knew what had happened to other British hostages in the past.” Stephen, Sjaak and Johan were let out somewhere in the Sahara desert in northern Mali. They were told they had been kidnapped by the Islamic militant organisation, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Members of al-Qaeda in northern Mali (Photo: Al Jazeera) The group had grown out of Islamic groups fighting the Algerian government in the 1990s. It had taken to kidnapping Western citizens in northern Africa and exchanging them for Islamist prisoners or money. “We were told in very bad English that they wouldn’t kill us. But maybe they were telling us that because then we wouldn’t make problems and do what they wanted. We were petrified but also slightly numb,” Stephen says. That first evening they slaughtered an animal in front of us and I remember thinking, ‘Yep that’s going to be me.’” When the kidnappers came across Stephen’s British passport they began praying and bowing down in the sand. “They were very pleased and excited. I explained I was South African and had been born and educated there, but they kept referring to me as British, which scared me.” The three hostages were guarded by about 17 jihadists who carried weapons including Kalashnikovs and hand grenades. A member of the al-Qaeda group holding the hostages (Photo: Al Jazeera) They had to ask to go to the toilet and were chained up in the evenings. Every two weeks, when they were moved between camps, they were blindfolded. In the early weeks they discussed whether they thought they would live or die, where they might be, and the potential for escape. “Sometimes one of us would say, ‘I’m going to escape.’ But then we’d talk about how it would put the others in danger, how we didn’t speak the language or know where to find water,” Stephen says. While Johan thought negotiations might take years, Stephen and Sjaak were both more optimistic. So was Stephen’s father, Malcolm, who had met the South African police colonel with responsibility for hostages. “It is possible to get hostages out quickly and we were looking at Stephen coming out in February or March 2012,” Malcolm says. “Then there was a coup in Mali and all bets were off.” In March 2012 the elected government of Mali was overthrown. Simultaneously, ethnic Tuaregs took control of northern towns and cities. Power was then wrested from them by jihadist groups including al-Qaeda. The chaos meant the link with the kidnappers was lost and Stephen’s family could only wait as months passed with no word about the hostages. Then in July a video showing Stephen and Johan was posted on YouTube. They had long beards and each was holding an A4 manila envelope. Behind them stood four masked, heavily-armed men. “Today I received this letter from my country. I am healthy and they are treating me well,” Stephen says in the video. The letter had been written by his family but he never got to read it. It was whisked away as soon as the cameras were turned off. ""I felt I had lied on camera,"" he says. The hostages would go on to make at least 15 videos, although only a handful reached the outside world. “A guy would arrive and tell us how negotiations were doing. Then he’d tell us to ask certain people to help and thank other people,” Stephen says. Stephen (centre) in a hostage video Stephen made a conscious decision to build a relationship with his captors. “Although they would come and go, some would die and some would be recruited, I would see many of them over and over again,” he says. I decided I didn’t want to go into the Sahara as a fairly balanced person and come out as a wreck who was angry and hated people.” This was one reason why he decided to convert to Islam six months into his captivity. “I was also Christian and a lot of the stories in Islam are the same. Religion gave me stability in the desert,” he says. Sjaak and Johan also converted and they all noticed an immediate improvement in their treatment. They would pray and eat alongside their captors, who also taught them some classical Arabic to help them understand the Koran. “I would mostly learn it by pointing at things and memorising words and there would also be hand signals and drawing in the sand,” he says. They were never taught the Hassaniya dialect, which the kidnappers spoke to each other. The next time a letter arrived from home Stephen was allowed to read it. “It was really feel good stuff. My mum wrote how someone had come around to fix my bike and that everyone sent their love,"" he says. ""My wife told me she had gone to a wedding of some friends of ours and joined a running club. She said they were doing all they could to get us released.” Armed Islamists in Gao in September 2012 In January 2013 French troops entered Mali in response to an appeal from the Malian president. They rapidly recaptured Gao and Timbuktu. This was Stephen’s “darkest hour”, a time when he believed he would never be released. He thought few governments would consider negotiating with al-Qaeda while they were fighting Western forces in Mali. No-one was going to pay money for me as that meant more money for the mujahideen.” The hostages were now being moved weekly by al-Qaeda and Johan decided to try and escape. “I thought he was crazy. He didn’t seem to understand Africa and the distances involved. They brought him back the next day,” Stephen says. Johan in a hostage video Stephen and Sjaak were accused of conspiring with Johan. Despite their denials, all three had their few personal items, including a French dictionary, letters from home and medication taken away. “I was furious as Johan was the only one of us three who later got his stuff back."" A year later Sjaak was separated from Stephen and Johan with no explanation. “A guy came into a hut we were sitting in and told Sjaak to pack his bags,” Stephen says. The guards wouldn’t reveal where he was taken but they understood he was still in the country. Stephen kept going by refusing to believe the frequent claims by his captors that he would soon be released. “You get excited. Then you realise something has gone wrong and you hit rock bottom,” he says. “At the start I’d think, ‘Well I have to be out for my mum’s birthday.’ This changed to thinking, ‘In five years’ time I’ll be sitting at home.’ I couldn’t take things day by day or month by month.” Stephen and Catherine on holiday Stephen worried that his family would forget about him and his wife would move on. ""I wanted the best for Catherine. We were at the age where we wanted children, and there’s a window,"" he says. “I didn’t want to limit her life and decided if she met another guy I’d have to accept it. I almost expected it to happen.” Now living in Johannesburg, Catherine was doing her best to keep going. “I was starting a speech therapy practice from scratch and this helped me focus on something. It kept me very busy and I got to meet lovely families through my work,” she says. She limited the time she allowed herself to think about her past with Stephen and avoided looking at holiday photos. Catherine in Johannesburg She also took up running to cope with the stress and relied on support from her mother and sister and Stephen’s parents. “I was able to cling on to a thin thread of hope even though the situation appeared dismal,” she says. Meanwhile Stephen’s father was trying to drive forward the negotiations about his son’s release. “The government were involved but it was cloak and dagger stuff,” Malcolm says. Stephen's bike was shipped back to South Africa after his kidnap He decided that they needed an independent negotiator but made some “bad turns” trying to find one. “We paid out money to men who claimed to be influential and have good access when they didn’t,” he says. “One even claimed he knew someone in the Red Crescent who had spoken to our son but they needed more money. I said I would pay if they could give me the name of my son’s dog. That tripped them up.” Then Malcolm came across a charity called Gift of the Givers, which had successfully negotiated with al-Qaeda in Yemen for the release of the South African, Yolande Korkie. He approached the charity’s founder, Dr Imtiaz Sooliman, on behalf of his son. Sooliman agreed to help. His first attempt to negotiate via the charity’s office in Mauritania was unsuccessful, but he was heartened when al-Qaeda released another proof-of-life video of Stephen in June 2015. Dr Imtiaz Sooliman, the founder of Gift of the Givers “The video was telling me the captors wanted to talk,” Sooliman says. He made a radio appeal in South Africa for a Malian who could act as a negotiator on the ground. A man called Mohamed Ehie Dicko responded and a month later he was sent to Mali. “I told him to make his presence and purpose known all over Mali,” Sooliman says. Within a week Dicko was contacted by someone who said he’d “come to the right door”. Stephen (right) and Johan pictured in a hostage video released in 2015 “It’s a long process that takes time. Messages are passed from person to person along a chain, not via phone or email,” Sooliman says. In November 2015 a new video was released in which Stephen thanked the charity for working for his release. “To my wife and my family, I am well and I hope you are all well back home. I understand I may be seeing you soon. I believe there is a South African organisation brokering the release,” he said in the video. Stephen was actually far from well. He had lost 15kg (2st 4lb) and says his muscles had atrophied making him look like an 80-year-old man. “I was getting joint problems and my legs had weakened. One day my knee just fell out of place and I had to push it back in,” he says. After receiving the new video, Sooliman launched a charm offensive aimed at people living near the al-Qaeda camps in northern Mali. The charity started buying cattle for the communities as well as providing food and digging wells. Eventually the community leaders agreed to speak to al-Qaeda about releasing the hostages. Then negotiations stalled again. “The elders were convinced but the youngsters in al-Qaeda said it couldn’t be allowed because it would set a precedent,” Sooliman says. Malcolm continued to fight for Stephen’s release. At the same time he was caring for his wife, who had a serious lung disease. She was now on oxygen around the clock. “It was tough but I looked after her the best I could,” Malcolm says. He delivered a letter to the South African President, Jacob Zuma, outlining their case and his wife’s ill health and pleading for his assistance. “I think he read it and realised they had to do something to get him out,” Malcolm says. In December 2016 Stephen received a letter in the desert from the South African government. “The mujahideen were very excited about this letter arriving and wanted to know what it said,” Stephen says. The letter informed Stephen his mother was very ill and the government was asking al-Qaeda to release him on compassionate grounds. The captors seemed disappointed by the news. Then in June 2017 Stephen was told, after a day of fasting, that Johan was no longer in the camp. He had been freed. Johan speaks to the press after his release in June 2017 “I was happy as it showed negotiation could take place and people could be released,” Stephen says. A year earlier he and Johan had heard a rumour that Sjaak had been freed by French soldiers. This meant Stephen was the last in captivity. Sjaak with a Malian minister after he was freed by French forces Then in July he was told he too would be freed. “I didn’t believe it. I asked them what the chances were and they said 60%. I thought, ‘Well I’ve heard 90% and that’s failed,’” Stephen says. But a few days later he was taken on a two-and-a-half-day car journey across the Sahara. Eventually the car came to a halt on a tarmac road just short of Gao. “My driver turned to me and said, ‘You are free, you can go,’” Stephen later told a press conference. Stephen assumed the driver was joking. “He said, ‘Well if you don’t believe me you can walk, you can go.’ And I thought, ‘Maybe he’s not just pulling my leg.’” Another car arrived and Stephen moved from one to the other. It was at this point he realised he was free. “It was quite a moment. It was difficult to comprehend as there had been so many ups and downs over the past five-and-a-half years.” Stephen returned to Johannesburg on 29 July 2017 following a medical check-up and a debriefing. He wasn’t allowed to speak to his family on his journey home and started to worry about what he would find there. “I asked the guys with me, ‘Am I going home to a train wreck?’ and the response was ‘Wow, wasn’t the dessert lovely,” he says. When he was 10 minutes from home he was told his mother had died just two months earlier, an experience he describes as “surreal”. It didn’t make sense to me. I remember thinking, ‘What should I be feeling now? Should I be in tears?’” Although he had been free for a few days, his father and wife were only told about his release an hour before he arrived home. “I saw my dad first from the car. My eyes filled up with tears and I just cried. It was just amazing, I couldn’t believe it,” Stephen says. Stephen and Malcolm on the day he arrived home ""It was just wonderful. I put my arms around him and he felt rock solid,” Malcolm says. Stephen then went into the house where Catherine had been packing a bag of clothes to take to him at the airport. “She came running in not realising I was already there, speaking a million miles per hour about how she had my bag,"" Stephen says. And then she covered her face with her hands and curled over and cried.” “She was looking so beautiful and it took me by surprise. It was so good to see her.” “He looked very different, but he had the same big smile,” Catherine says. “His hair was long and curly which was not what I had imagined, and he was wearing desert gear, which threw me a bit.” Stephen with his father (centre) and Dr Sooliman (right) Catherine rang Sooliman to let him know Stephen was home.“I was ecstatic as I saw the suffering the family had gone through over the past years,” he says. Stephen isn’t sure why he was freed but is aware the New York Times reported there was a $4.2m (£3m) payout from the South African government. South African officials strongly deny the claim. Whatever happened, Stephen says he is incredibly grateful to everyone who worked for his release. He says his challenge now is to work out how to return to his former life. “I see my dad, my wife and my sis and it’s like we saw each other yesterday, but there’s a big black hole of six years,” he says. I feel uncertain and it’s hard to understand what my place is now.” He has faced practical difficulties, from unlocking old bank accounts to getting medical treatment for his back and sun-damaged eyes. But it’s the psychological fallout that has taken him by surprise. His initial euphoria at being released has been replaced by a “whirlpool of thoughts and emotions,” which he hopes will settle down in time. Stephen speaks to the media after his release Stephen believes he is now in “coping mode” and describes experiencing “a grey mush” rather than typical highs and lows. He is struggling with “information overload” after his years in the desert, and finds it tricky to connect to other people. “It’s difficult to shoot the breeze. For my friends small talk is, ‘Isn’t that great coffee?’ For me it would be, ‘That was one hell of a sandstorm last night,’” he says. His English is also a little rusty. “It’s hard to find the right words,” he says. Despite his worries, his wife says he is in essence the same person. “He still makes me laugh, which I love,” she says. Catherine and Stephen on a recent visit to the South African coast Stephen says he appreciates everyday things more, such as going inside during a thunderstorm, or taking refuge in the shade of trees when it’s hot. He is keen to make up for missed time and has already met a niece and nephew born while he was in Mali. When they sleep they are so peaceful and untarnished. It’s a beauty I haven’t seen in so long.” He plans to go on cycling trips with his father. “I want to get him up and riding as it will be good for his health,” Stephen says. “He’s had to juggle his business, my mother’s illness and my kidnapping yet he’s the most positive guy. He is an unbelievable role model.” When he was in the desert Stephen was determined not to become a “shell” of a person, a goal he has carried back to South Africa. “I don’t want to get thick-skinned,"" he says. “I’m more understanding and compassionate now if people have problems. ""I hope I don't stomp my way through life and not see what’s around me.” Built with Shorthand"
David Hurn and his extraordinary archiveThe president who lived in a cave," The Swapper is a story about the internationally-acclaimed British documentary photographer David Hurn; it is a story of a dyslexic, Welsh schoolboy written off as being ""a bit thick"" and an extraordinary ""succession of bizarre coincidences"" which would propel him into the ranks of photography's elite. A fixture of Sixties London and the Hollywood inner sanctum, his images of Jane Fonda as Barbarella, Sean Connery as James Bond, and the Beatles on the set of A Hard Day's Night, became icons of the 20th Century. But they are mere window dressing on a body of work so influential that recognition by him is now regarded as something of an anointing of careers. David Hurn is a luminary of Magnum Photos. Magnum is the stuff of legends. Being invited to join its hallowed ranks - there are only 62 working members in the world - is notoriously difficult; think of it as a kind of SAS, Harvard, an Olympics gold medal of photography. It is one of the most revered and exclusive organisations in the world which has documented life on virtually every corner of the planet over the past 70 years. That one famous photograph that sticks in your mind? Chances are it is a Magnum shot. Its photographers have informed generations with some of the most indelible, mind-blowing, thought-provoking, disturbing, entertaining and curious images of our time. Once nominated by existing members, you run a rigorous four year, three-stage gauntlet of continually proving your worth. Only the chosen few survive to be voted in as fully-fledged members. ""One of the first emails any new nominee will receive, on being accepted by Magnum, is from Hurn, inviting them to exchange,"" says Martin Parr, out-going president of Magnum Photos. ""Everyone always willingly agrees; they select their favourite Hurn image and vice versa."" To swap with David Hurn is a flattering entrée into the big time for photographers both inside and outside Magnum, young, old, established and lesser-known. It is continuing a tradition started by Hurn in the late 1950s. Just as then, whenever a photographer's talent catches his eye today, he approaches them to swap a print. His collection - now a 700-strong who's who of photography - is the subject of a major exhibition entitled 'Swaps, Photographs from the David Hurn Collection' in his native Cardiff. It heralds the realisation of a long-held dream of Hurn's - the opening of the first permanent gallery dedicated to photography at Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales, where he has recently donated his entire £3.5m archive. The museum is of deep significance. His mother, perhaps recognising something in her dyslexic son whom teachers had written off, would take him there on weekly visits. The marble-floored halls of Rodin statues and Brangwyn paintings ignited an insatiable curiosity that continues to fuel his work today. The following sets out a selection of swaps from the exhibition which illustrate influences on his life, a selection of his own work along with the story of the ""succession of bizarre coincidences"" that shaped his extraordinary career as a self-taught photographer and educator. And how aged 83, David Hurn has a new quest - to harness the phenomenon of the selfie to inspire photographers of the future. When it comes to spontaneously bawling your eyes out some places are undoubtedly more desirable than others; the officers' mess at Sandhurst isn't one of them. But then epiphanies are renowned for their untimeliness and on Saturday, 12 February 1955, David Hurn had exactly that, an epiphany; the non-religious kind. Hurn is a staunch atheist. ""It's such a ludicrously romantic story, it's almost stupid,"" he says. Hurn, who left school with no qualifications, was doing national service when he was plucked from the ranks and catapulted into the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. The army officer training centre needed to bolster its rugby team and Hurn's skill on the field made him an asset. His dyslexia, long before it was recognised, had meant that childhood ambitions to be a vet or an archaeologist were scoffed at so at school he focussed on the one thing he could do well - sport. ""And so that's how I ended up at Sandhurst,"" he says. ""That's the really puzzling part of my life as it was like going to university which had been totally out of my reach. ""I studied military history which I found fascinating and played sports all the time. My dad was a soldier in the Welsh Guards and so, like him, my life was mapped out very pleasantly indeed right up until the day I retired."" In the officers' mess that Saturday, Hurn was browsing through a copy of Picture Post - then a popular, weekly photojournalism magazine. He stopped dead at a picture taken by the legendary French humanist photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, a founding member of Magnum Photos. Henri Cartier-Bresson in 1992 by Martine Franck Part of a ground-breaking photo essay on the Russians - the first by any Western photographer during the Cold War - it showed a soldier buying his wife a hat at a Leningrad department store, their child standing beside them. ""I suddenly burst into tears,"" he recalls. ""I mean crying quite seriously. ""We had a lot of propaganda at Sandhurst which basically said the equivalent of all Russians eat their children. ""My earliest memory is my dad coming home from the army and taking my mum with me in tow to Howell's department store in Cardiff, where he bought her a hat. ""So my first recollection of mum and dad in love, and demonstrating that love, is her trying on various hats. When I saw this picture it brought all that back to me. State department store Univermag, Leningrad, 1954, Henri Cartier-Bresson ""What I recognised instantly then was the extraordinary ability of photography to evoke memory and boy, how powerfully it could do that. ""And I suddenly disbelieved the propaganda about Russia. I looked at the picture and was totally convinced that Russian people were just normal people like the rest of us. ""It was so significant. I remember saying to myself 'This is what I'd really love to do, go round shooting pictures of army officers buying their wives hats and getting other people to cry'."" He bought a Kodak folding Retina camera and resigned from the army. His father was appalled. He had struggled through the Depression and never really forgave his son from walking away from an opportunity like Sandhurst. ""It was totally illogical,"" he says. ""I had enormous doubts about what I was doing but they were over-powered, and, again, it sounds so romantic, by an intense desire to do this illogical thing - to take photographs."" Hurn found digs in London and sold shirts in Harrods. The Partisan coffee bar in Soho, shot by Hurn, 1957 In the evenings and weekends he would obsessively shoot photos around the lively coffee house scene in Soho. Famous for their impromptu late-night jazz sessions, coffee bars such as the Nucleus, Le Macabre, The Partisan, were hot houses for 1950s liberal-thinking, politicised bohemians - burgeoning artists, film makers, writers and intellectuals - whose ideas helped propagate the countercultural explosion of the following decade. Hurn was at a show of Cartier-Bresson's photographs when leading professional photographer Michael Peto introduced himself. He viewed Hurn's work and offered to help, introducing him to a thrusting photo agency called Reflex. Hurn was taken on as an assistant. Reflex specialised in early telephoto lens photography - ""The idea that the Royal watch by paparazzi is a recent phenomenon is nonsense,"" Hurn says - and it was a fertile training ground but he wanted more. ""The Hungarian revolution was happening and me and a friend thought we'd go and have a look at what was happening,"" he says. Child freedom fighter, Budapest, 1956 ""I bought a second-hand Contax camera with two lenses and a book on how to use it which I read as we hitch-hiked our way to Hungary. I was chancing my arm really. ""We got through the Iron Curtain by getting a lift on some ambulances. We hitch-hiked to Budapest and found out where the press were gathered. Somebody heard I was a freelance. The LIFE magazine photographer hadn't managed to get in so their reporters said ""you're now working for LIFE magazine"". ""My first assignment with a camera I was still unsure how to use was with LIFE magazine. ""But then I've always said it's much better to start at the top than the bottom. At least you can cling on up there and that's what I did, I clung on."" Woman shopping during a lull in fighting, Budapest, 1956 One of the two photos published in LIFE - which sold 13.5m copies a week at its peak - remains particularly pertinent to him. It is of a child freedom fighter. ""A photograph allows you to record a single moment in time,"" he says. ""It's always there. And I keep that one to remind me that the boy might well have died the next day."" As well as LIFE magazine his pictures of the anti-Soviet Hungary uprising appeared in Picture Post and the Observer. Hurn says only one per cent of what he shot was any good and that was down to fluke. Fluke or not, on his return he was offered the unimaginable - a staff job at LIFE magazine. What was even more unimaginable, he turned it down. ""It's very strange,"" Hurn says. ""I'm not entirely sure why. I didn't want to be working for a magazine and tied in that way. US troops assault Omaha Beach, D-Day landings, Normandy, 6 June 1944, Robert Capa ""I presume I was fearful of being told what to do; maybe insecurity that I wouldn't be able to deliver, I don't know; I just felt much safer working on my own which after Hungary, I knew was possible."" Whatever the reason, Hurn's unswerving single-mindedness was curiously in sync with the vision that had given rise to Magnum 10 years earlier. The agency was conceived in the aftermath of, and in reaction to, the totalitarianism horrors of World War II. It was the quixotic vision of Robert Capa, reputed to be the greatest combat and adventure photographer in history. Robert Capa shortly before he died in a land mine explosion in Vietnam, then part of Indochina, on assignment for LIFE magazine A friend and colleague of Steinbeck and Hemingway, his intrepid coverage of conflicts earned him the Croix de Guerre and the Medal of Freedom from President Eisenhower in 1947. That same year Capa approached four fellow war photographers, veterans of the Spanish Civil war and World War II - Frenchman Henri Cartier-Bresson, Briton George Rodger and Americans David Seymour and William Vandivert - and explained his idea about combining their talent into a cooperative. The intention was two-fold: to protect the copyright of their images and ensure their artistic integrity and freedom. By controlling copyright, Capa realised he could publish in not just one, but maybe 15 magazines, which meant he could spend three times as long on a story and still be financially ahead. It was a revolutionary business model whereby they would choose stories and not rely on direction from newspaper editors, a halcyon concept of ""a brotherhood… beyond the pale of editorial sanction and censorship who could interpret the world as it was and who worshipped only things as they were"". The paperwork was drawn up in New York followed by a champagne celebration which is said to have given rise to the name, Magnum. Actor Peter O'Toole shot by Hurn in London, 1962 Little wonder given its pedigree that being accepted as a member is ""considered one of the finest accolades of a photographer's career"". And it was an accolade that was about to move onto Hurn's radar. Hurn, who shared flats with fledgling actor Peter O'Toole and was close friends with aspiring film-maker Ken Russell, obsessively analysed photography and its history with new-found friends such as Don McCullin, Ian Berry and Philip Jones Griffiths, all of whom later joined Magnum and achieved international acclaim covering conflicts around the world. Don McCullin, knighted in 2017 for services to photography, at Hurn's flat in Bayswater, 1972 ""We had gravitated together,"" he says. ""We were do-ers not talkers and I've always find do-ers want to be in the company of other do-ers. ""I've never drank nor smoked so I've never been a pub person. We'd socialise in the coffee bars, analysing the work of great photographers, how to make a picture better. There was a friendly rivalry which has continued ever since and I suspect had a lot to do with the fact that all of us have done pretty well. Philip Jones Griffiths, renowned for his coverage of the Vietnam War, shot by Hurn at the Mayfair flat of Magnum's Eve Arnold ""In London at the time a few of the big photojournalism magazines had closed and it was all about newspapers. That was great in that they used photographs well; the Daily Express would sometimes run a double page photograph and the Daily Mail back then had something like 32 foreign correspondents. The problem with that was it was all linked to current affairs and news. ""I made a decent job of it but I wasn't terribly interested. The people around me were all really interested and almost by definition, were better than me. ""McCullin was interested in anything that made his adrenaline go. Philip Jones Griffiths was a very astute political animal, he really understood what politics were about, Ian was basically a traveller… and there was no way I was going to compete. ""I was aware that I was floating around in a pretty high class second division and I was never going to be in the first division while I was in that world. ""Then in 1958 I had a stroke of luck."" Hurn was photographing tourists enjoying the pigeons in Trafalgar Square. Trafalgar Square, part of a photo essay on London shot by Larrain in 1958-59 ""Suddenly this guy came up to me,"" he says. ""He was also photographing the pigeons and he said 'I think you are probably a very good photographer'. I thought it was a bit odd at first. ""He told me that you can tell by the sheer concentration of some people when they are shooting pictures, most people don't concentrate, they just shoot lots of pictures. Chilean photographer Sergio Larrain in Paris 1959 ""We went and had coffee. His name was Sergio Larrain, a photographer from Chile who was part of something called Magnum agency. I'd never even heard of Magnum. Sergio is in my top three of favourite photographers ever, so it was an extraordinary coincidence to meet him like that. Sergio Larrain: Fishermen's daughters in the village of Los Horcones, Chile, 1956 ""We became very good friends. He showed me his pictures and they were exactly the sort of thing I loved. They had a poetic quality; they were seemingly about nothing yet were incredibly significant and poignant. He was totally a man after my own heart."" Larrain was the first photographer Hurn received a print from. It was only later, as he grew in stature as a photographer that he would ask to swap. ""I remember saying 'Oh I really like that' and he gave me a copy and I asked him to sign it. Prints weren't 'a thing' back then as there were no photo galleries as such. They would emerge later and galleries would sell signed prints as art in order to meet business overheads. ""This was long before that but it had sparked in me the realisation that to collect other people's pictures was a nice thing to do, a bit like someone's autograph. And that's how the swaps started."" Magnum photographer Elliott Erwitt (let) with John Hillelson, shot by Rene Burri Larrain looked at Hurn's pictures and steered him away from news and current affairs urging him to focus on his other work, similar in tone to his own, pictures of everyday people, the beauty of the mundane. ""That was great for me,"" Hurn says. ""It was as if someone had released me and given me permission to do what I loved. ""Sergio was a huge influence on my life. He introduced me to the London agent who represented many agencies around the world including Magnum, a man called John Hillelson. ""I'm sure he took me on only because Sergio had recommended me. But it was another enormous break. I've had extraordinary breaks throughout my life. George Rodger in the Algerian Sahara, 1957 ""I've never worked out if everyone has these chances but maybe they don't grab them. I've been incredibly lucky but I genuinely think luck is simply realising something's significance and taking advantage of it."" There was no doubt the introduction to John Hillelson - whose Fleet Street agency contributed much to 20th Century photo-reportage - was pivotal. By the early 1960s Hurn had found his niche and had little competition. At John Hillelson's behest he offered up a steady stream of photo essay ideas to the emerging Sunday supplements. Meanwhile, Hillelson also steered him towards foreign magazine markets in France, Italy and Brazil. More crucially perhaps, he provided direct access to the world of Magnum photographers. From Bruce Davidson's photo essay entitled Brooklyn Gang, New York, 1959 Whenever Hurn heard of a noted photographer's impending arrival from overseas he would make himself available as a guide, driver or general assistant. ""I believe there are two ways to learn to do things well, in the arts particularly,"" Hurn says. ""Teach yourself, learn by experience and examine work by people who do what you want to do and continually ask ""Why are they better than me?"". ""The other method is to learn directly from someone you admire and who does what they do terribly well. ""George Rodger, a founding member of Magnum, lived in England. I met him and we got on very well. My instinct was to talk to the great photographers. And so I went out of my way to meet great photographers like Bill Brandt, I found out where he lived and simply knocked on his door. Major Green confesses to murdering a woman in an apartment block where he worked, New York, 1937, Weegee ""With each great photographer I met, my collection of prints would build. But I was always careful to discuss with them particular pictures of theirs that I liked. I think that made them happy that somebody wasn't just saying ""oh I'd like a picture of yours""."" One of the first photographers Hurn offered to assist was Bruce Davidson, a young, hot-shot American and Magnum rookie who had wowed with gritty photo essays inside the hostile, disenfranchised New York ghettos and the US civil rights movement. Bruce Davidson around the time he first met Hurn in London,1960 ""Bruce was about the same age as me and I remember thinking 'Hang on, this guy is one of the greatest photographers in the world and I'm still floundering around trying to get something in the local newspaper',"" Hurn says. ""So that was an incredible spur. I really picked his brains a lot. ""Through watching him work I identified, without understanding it before that point, the idea of authorship which is what interests me most about photography. 'The dead man's wife arrived...and then she collapsed', New York, 1941, Weegee ""How can I describe authorship without it being elitist? Well, it is elitist to an extent, it's about distinctiveness. I'm interested in Monet as a painter because I can instantly see a particular painting is by Monet. And I find that interesting. ""It's the same with anything. Why do we move towards a certain singer? Barb Jungr is a singer I like very much whom most people won't have heard of. Why is it when I hear a song of hers I know instantly it's her singing? ""I find it more interesting in photography because there's no logic to it. All you've got is a box with a hole at the front. That's what we've all got and that's all we've ever had since photography was invented. ""All that happens is the image of life out there goes whizzing through that lens and goes bang onto some material or other and you get a trace of that life on the back of the box. And you've got once chance at it, unlike painting or writing you can't go back and edit, in photography the moment's gone and will never happen again. Anthony Esposito, held for murdering a businessman and police officer in the 'Battle of Fifth Avenue', 1941, Weegee ""So, all we have is this box with a hole in the front. So how come if there was a sheep dog trial for instance and Cartier-Bresson, McCullin and Bruce Davidson were there, they are all photographing exactly the same thing but if you showed me 10 pictures from that event I would be able to tell you who had taken what picture? ""It's the signature of someone which can't be contrived; it's the purest thing to their real personality, the world seen through their eyes. The pictures are stamped with the unique style of the individual who shot them. ""But what is necessary for the authorship to come through is an impeccable command of the technical side. The best photographers might say 'Oh, the technical side is unimportant'. Well, the technical side is staggeringly important but it has got to the point with them that they don't have to think about it. That only comes through hard work and incessant practice. ""I always stress this point... you're not a photographer because you are interested in photography. ""The picture is out there, you don't make the picture, you just have a good visual eye and press the button at the right time. For that you must have an intense curiosity and tenacity, not just a passing visual interest, in the theme of the pictures. This curiosity leads to intense examination, reading, talking, research and many, many failed attempts. ""A good example of authorship is Weejee whom I regard as one of the greatest photographers. He was an out and out news photographer. He worked primarily at night with a very large format camera which is very unwieldy and he worked only in New York."" Arthur Fellig - nicknamed Weejee, the phonetic of Ouija board due to his seemingly supernatural radar for unfolding human drama long before the emergency services got the call - is said to have been the inspiration behind the 2014 movie Nightcrawler starring Jake Gyllenhaal. ""What is extraordinary about him is that news photographers are usually geared only for content and therefore they produce powerful content but they don't usually produce powerful pictures as such,"" Hurn adds. ""Weejee had this extraordinary talent of combining incredibly powerful content with an enormous sense of design in extreme conditions. ""I feel very much the same about McCullin who was in very difficult situations like wars and managed to produce pictures which were much more than 'Gosh, he managed to push the button amidst all that going on; isn't he brave?' He had the ability to look and observe and press the button at just the right time in very stressful circumstances. The pictures are more than simply a record, they are deeply moving. That's authorship. And it's a very attractive thing."" In 1963 Hurn was given the ultimate stamp of cool when a film by Ken Russell about his life work entitled Watch the Birdie was broadcast by the BBC. It illustrates the versatility and diversity of Hurn's repertoire - a photo-journalist scaling a brick wall to escape a guard dog one minute, a meticulously-lit fashion spread for Harper's Bazaar the next. Then it cuts to him dropping in on Little Sisters of the Assumption in Notting Hill Gate to document their work tending to the sick and destitute before roaring off in his custom-built sports car to Joey the Soho stripper who performs 30 times a day, an example of his signature radical and ground-breaking (for the time) black and white photo essays on London's alternative lifestyles or subcultures, drugs, transvestism etc. Nuns nursing the elderly unable to find hospital beds,Notting Hill,1963 Strip club - thought to be the first of its kind - in Old Compton Street, 1963 ""That was thanks to the example of Elliot Erwitt I'd met a few years before and who was another big influence on my work,"" Hurn says. Erwitt, an American advertising and documentary photographer renowned for his quirky and immensely funny take on the absurdity and comedy of everyday life, is described as a master of Cartier-Bresson's so-called 'decisive moment' - that special moment that ""transcends the subject and place and can be looked at for years to come"" - to the layman it's identifying the exact split second to press the shutter. ""Meeting him was wonderful because he put into my head that you can actually do commercial photography as well as do the work you really want to do,"" Hurn adds. ""He worked in advertising but he never muddled that up with the fact that he carried a Leica camera with him at all times and shot his own pictures separately to the commercial work he was doing. Elliott Erwitt ""So thanks to him I never had this hang up about 'selling out' by doing commercial work. It's the practise of doing things to your best ability, regardless of what you're doing."" To supplement his income and free him up to work on his preferred documentary or 'eye witness' photography, Hurn accepted invitations to photograph the film sets of countless films - El Cid, Bond, Alfie - after being introduced to a Hollywood film agent Tom Carlile through his late friend Richard Johnson, the distinguished actor who turned down the role of James Bond. And on the subject of Bond, Hurn, who worked on the set of the first four 007 movies, shot the iconic film poster for From Russia With Love at his flat in Bayswater's Porchester Court, a creative hub and landmark destination for photographers the world over during the 60s. An entourage including Hollywood producer Cubby Broccoli, descended along with Sean Connery. But there was one problem. ""The film's publicist came up to me and said 'I don't know what we're going to do. I've forgotten the gun'. To drive back out to the film studios would have taken hours. It happened that I enjoyed target shooting with an air pistol. It was a Walther and had a beautiful box with Walther written on the outside of it. Bond's pistol was a Walther PPK. Movie publicist Tom Carlile in Hurn's studio on a Bond shoot. He would later hire Hurn for Barbarella ""I said 'Look, although it's an air pistol and has this great, big long barrel and Bond's has a small barrel, nobody here will know. The mere fact it's got Walther on the box they'll think it's the right one'. ""I said all you've got to do is make sure when they come to do the poster that the long barrel is cut off and it will be ok. But when it came to do the poster art they forgot. So if you look at any of those Bond posters, there's Mr Macho brandishing his air pistol."" Soon after Hurn was introduced to the Beatles film director Dick Lester who asked him to follow the group around for the six weeks of filming for their first film A Hard Day's Night. He liked Ringo Starr the best but it was the ""exceedingly shy"" George Harrison that Hurn would have the biggest impact on by introducing him to his future wife. One of George Harrison's first encounters with Pattie Boyd Hurn's friend, fellow photographer Eric Swayne was dating Pattie Boyd at the time. Swayne was keen to meet the Beatles and Hurn somehow persuaded Dick Lester to allow them onto the set and Pattie became a film extra. Harrison, who would later write the love song Something about her, was transfixed. ""I introduced her to them all,"" Hurn says. ""I had no idea that the one had goggled at her more than the others. Of course, I wasn't the greatest friend of dear Eric Swayne from then."" A Hard Day's Night had cemented the Fab Four's place at the forefront of the British Invasion - the storming popularity of British music and culture into the US. Director Dick Lester giving direction Hurn, who became an associate member of Magnum a year later in 1965, had played his part in that but it was two years later in 1967 in an altogether more cosmic invasion that he was to become better known. The New York Times described Jane Fonda as the leading lady in the cult sci-fi movie Barbarella as ""the most iconic sex goddess of the 60s"". But that might never have been the case had it not been for Hurn. The young Fonda, insecure about her looks and who hated being photographed, was giving film producer Dino de Laurentiis  a tough time over the publicity stills and had rejected them out of hand. ""The publicist Tom Carlile phoned me up and explained what was going on,"" Hurn says. ""He said 'Look David, come over to Italy and see if you can sort it out for me and try and calm her down'. ""The moment we met we got on extremely well. She said she felt her face was lop-sided 'like a squirrel with one cheek full of nuts'. I managed to make her laugh and somehow won her confidence. ""We became very good friends and I ended up spending nine months with her and her then husband Roger Vadim on the set and at their home. She's still a friend. We met up in LA a few months ago."" The Barbarella images graced the covers of 126 magazines around the world. Newsweek reportedly achieved both its greatest news-stand sales and its highest number of subscriber cancellations when it published pictures of a naked Fonda on its cover under the headlines Anything Goes, The Permissive Society. By this stage Hurn's hero and inspiration Henri Cartier-Bresson had actually visited his famous flat to personally examine his contact sheets shortly before he was voted in as a full member of Magnum in 1968. ""It was like seeing God,"" he says. Hurn's then wife, model and actress Alita Naughton with their daughter Sian Hurn led a rarefied life; an internationally-successful career, a beautiful wife, accomplished and celebrated friends, and an Aston Martin parked outside the front door. The dyslexic schoolboy from Cardiff had done pretty well for himself. But just over a year after Barbarella hit the screens, Hurn had left London, his marriage had broken down and he was living in a VW camper van on the banks of the river Severn near Newport, south Wales. The lure of Hollywood celebrity and expensive London life-style had begun to fade some four years before. Two surviving children survey the rescue operation in Aberfan, October 1966, Hurn One of the first photographers on the scene of the 1966 Aberfan disaster when 116 children and 28 adults died after a coal waste tip collapsed and crashed down a mountain burying the village school, Hurn was deeply affected by the experience. ""I hadn't lived in Wales since 1941,"" Hurn says. ""My dad was in the army so we had moved around the UK. But my entire family was still in Cardiff. ""Aberfan had a profound effect on me because of how obscene it was. But it also vividly brought home to me the idea of Wales. Why did I still think of it as home? That fascinated me. One of Hurn's earliest photo - dreaming of being a mum, 1958 ""The reality came in 1970 that I really didn't want to continue doing the stuff I'd be doing anymore; I guess I wanted a simpler life,"" Hurn says. With characteristic curiosity, he drove to Wales to explore the concept of culture and home for a new book. It was the beginning of an extensive, life-long body of work, books and exhibitions on his homeland, documenting its people, landscape and the massive upheaval of a nation as the pillars of industry which had shored up its economy for so long continued to crumble. Pit pony handlers' rest room, Neath Valley, 1993, Hurn As he traversed the country documenting every day Welsh life, once again, a chance meeting was to change his fate. Wandering around the countryside with his dogs and camera, Hurn met and struck up a conversation with a local college administrator. Chatting about photography Hurn was asked if photography was something which could be taught. Hurn's Rollerblading, Venice Beach, 1980 Hurn's curiosity kicked in - what did all the most successful photographers have in common? Hurn teaching at Newport in 1975 ""I saw a pattern in how all the most respected photographers approached their work,"" Hurn said, ""and I believed that these basic principles could be passed onto aspiring youngsters."" Hurn's interest was encouraged and he set up the School of Documentary Photography at the Newport College of Art. It would become one of the most sought after courses in the UK and beyond. Jnr Wales ballroom dance championships, Bargoed 1973, Hurn The course was run with Hurn's characteristic pragmatic approach. There was to be no philosophical navel-gazing about 'truth' or the 'theory of light', it was about being on time, wearing good shoes - ""If you're walking around for hours taking pictures, you need them"" - analysing the contact sheets of successful photographers - ""It's the best way to see how they think"" - and, most importantly of all, getting a job. ""It was unbelievable,"" Hurn says. ""We used to have about 700 applicants for 15 to 20 places. Round-up of the last wild horses in Arizona desert, 1980, Hurn Photography students wearing David Hurn masks at a college party But after 17 years of running the course which had built up a world-class reputation, Hurn walked out the door the day he was told the course was going to become a degree. ""The driving force for me was to bring in people who I thought could get a job and we deliberately kept the qualification at a lower level, a college diploma,"" he says. ""The second it became a degree course, there were all these rules about how much academic theory there had to be and this, that and the other. Absolutely fine; I'm not against people doing that, I simply said it had nothing to do with what I wanted, which was to get people jobs."" First, second and third in Miss Rosebud of Rhyl, 1972, Hurn Now, after 30 years of a ""frugal, very simple lifestyle"" plying his trade, Hurn, credited by some as one of the most influential figures in photography education, is returning to that theme once again. And curiously his renewed interest has been sparked by the phenomenon of the selfie. ""What's happening now is suddenly for the first time ever you have something which virtually everyone in the world loves - photography,"" Hurn says. ""Nearly everyone's got the equivalent of an iPhone and they all take pictures. Tenby, 1974 - feeding the seagulls, Hurn ""The only slight problem about this is the instinct of most people seems to be to take pictures of themselves or their friends and nothing outside of that. By far the most interesting aspect of the selfie is that everyone does it. ""The point of the selfie is immediate and only of interest for seconds so most of the interest seems to me as someone who doesn't do it, to be the fun act of doing it, usually with friends. Hurn's first selfie taken earlier this week at his home in Tintern, Monmouthshire ""I was listening to a radio programme which talked about the top 20 words that we use. Towards the end it said what's interesting is that two words - 'I' and 'myself' - had come into the list for the first time. I thought boy, that's interesting because it really fits in with today's culture. Sheep sheltering from the rain on the military artillery range,  Mynydd Epynt,1973 ""But I find that puzzling because rarely in the things that I think have been worthwhile in my life have the people involved been particularly interested in themselves. ""I find myself having to be very careful that I don't sound like my dad and therefore I retreat and simply say I don't find it interesting, I'm not condemning it in any way. It could be incredibly positive but I don't understand it as I find it very repetitious. ""But I would argue that with the selfie you have a captive audience in that they're interested in photography. Toys retrieved from Penparc refuse site 1990, Hurn ""I'm really interested in getting people to expand from just taking pictures of themselves; to see if they find photography interesting if for no other reason than there are jobs out there. There aren't jobs in taking pictures of yourself and your friends but there are jobs in taking pictures of other things. ""There are jobs in science and health. Anyone who's had a major operation, their life has been saved by a camera going down their throat or up their backside. The most important picture taken during his life, says Hurn. The colon cancer he made a full recovery from in 2001 ""I'd like to say to teenagers as I strongly suspect they're not told this in school, 'Do you realise that being a wedding photographer is a good profession', radiographers are needed, estate agent photographers and so on. These are honourable jobs which are probably more fun than stacking shelves in Tesco. Pub sing-song in Sennybridge, near Brecon, 1971 ""The idea that there's no future in taking pictures is nonsensical. If you go to Smiths in Paddington station there's 3,000 magazines for sale and they've all got pictures in them, they're on websites. ""Everybody's floundering a little bit as to how to make any money from it but those sorts of problems will be solved, clever people will find ways. Pictures are going to be needed there and the skills are still going to be the same."" Hurn is now passionate about the possibility of inspiring young minds with photography beyond their social media profiles. Mother kisses daughter in incubator, Arizona, 1980, Hurn. And so, coming back full circle to where his life began as a child visiting the museum in Cardiff, Hurn is drawing up workshops to engage some of the 34,000 school pupils who annually pass through its doors. His premise is simple: arrange competitions whereby children/teenagers select their favourite shot from a collection of six by well-known photographers and use smartphones to see how they might replicate that photographic style while taking pictures of their everyday lives. After all Henri Cartier-Bresson, the man whose work so moved Hurn all those years ago, once said: ""In photography the smallest thing can be a great subject. The little human detail can become a leitmotif."" Retired gentleman at MG Car owners ball, Edinburgh, 1967, Hurn His seemingly prosaic shot of a Russian soldier buying his wife a hat undoubtedly became the leitmotif, an object, an idea which has repeatedly reoccurred, throughout Hurn's life. It is a measure of the force of the medium of photography that a picture that probably took a 60th of a second to shoot continues to fuel the life of another man 62 years on. In the years to come maybe that same force will hit some young, floundering mind which happens upon an image of David Hurn's and, just like that moment in Sandhurst in 1955, an unexpectedly powerful response to a simple black and white record of a moment in time in a stranger's life will have altered their own in an instant.

"Thai fraudster sentenced to 13,275 years","Some 40,000 people are believed to have been duped by the fraudulent scheme (file picture) A Thai court has sentenced a fraudster to more than 13,000 years in prison. Pudit Kittithradilok, 34, admitted running a Ponzi scheme whereby he promised investors artificially high financial returns. About 40,000 people were persuaded to pour more than $160m (Â£120m) into his companies. The court found he engaged in illicit lending and some 2,653 counts of fraud. Thanks to his confession, it halved his sentence to 6,637 years and six months. He is unlikely to serve more than 20 years, as Thai law sets a maximum 10-year term for each of the two crimes he was convicted of. China hit by financial scam 'epidemic' Prosecutors told the court that Pudit organised seminars where attendees were encouraged to invest in what he said were businesses linked to property development, beauty, used cars and exports, among other things. According to the Bangkok Post, investors were promised generous returns,external, plus incentives to bring new members on board. As with any pyramid scheme, these new cash injections would then be used to pay off the earlier backers. Pudit had been held in Bangkok Remand Prison since his arrest in August, when he was denied bail. The court fined his two companies the equivalent of $20m each. Pudit and the firms were ordered to repay around $17m to the 2,653 identified victims, with 7.5% yearly interest.

Wave of protests hits Iranian cities,"This video can not be played Protesters take to streets venting anger against authorities Anti-government demonstrations that began in Iran on Thursday have now spread to several major cities. Large numbers reportedly turned out in Rasht, in the north, and Kermanshah, in the west, with smaller protests in Isfahan, Hamadan and elsewhere. The protests began against rising prices but have spiralled into a general outcry against clerical rule and government policies. A small number of people have been arrested in Tehran, the capital. They were among a group of 50 people who gathered in a city square, Tehran's deputy governor-general for security affairs told the Iranian Labour News Agency. The US State Department condemned the arrests and urged ""all nations to publicly support the Iranian people and their demands for basic rights and an end to corruption"". The demonstrations began in the north-eastern city of Mashhad- the country's second most-populous - on Thursday. People there took to the streets to express anger at the government over high prices, and vented their fury against President Hassan Rouhani. Fifty-two people were arrested for chanting ""harsh slogans"". The protests spread to other cities in the north-east, and and some developed into broader anti-government demonstrations, calling for the release of political prisoners and an end to police beatings. Hassan Rouhani, the president who moved left Iranians urge Rouhani not to disappoint On Friday, despite warnings from authorities, the demonstrations spread further to some of the biggest cities in the country. They represent the most serious and widespread expression of public discontent in Iran since mass protests in 2009 that followed a disputed election, correspondents say. What began as a protest against economic conditions and corruption has turned political. Slogans have been chanted against not just Mr Rouhani but Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and clerical rule in general. Demonstrators were reportedly heard yelling slogans like ""The people are begging, the clerics act like God"". Protests have even been held in Qom, a holy city home to powerful clerics. There is also anger at Iran's interventions abroad. In Mashhad, some chanted ""not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran"", a reference to what protesters say is the administration's focus on foreign rather than domestic issues. Iran 'building permanent military base' in Syria Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals Other demonstrators chanted ""leave Syria, think about us"" in videos posted online. Iran is a key provider of military support to the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. It is also accused of providing arms to Houthi rebels fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which it denies, and is an ally of Lebanon's powerful Shia movement Hezbollah. President Hassan Rouhani continues to be dogged by economic problems Iran's Fars news agency, which is close to the elite and powerful Revolutionary Guards security force, reported that many protesters who turned out over economic grievances decided to leave rallies after others yelled political slogans. President Rouhani promisedthe 2015 nuclear deal that Iran signed with world powerswould boost the economy. However despite the lifting of international sanctions, the unemployment rate is 12.4%. There have been calls on social media for protests up and down the country, despite warnings from the government against illegal gatherings. Demonstrations of varying sizes are reported to have occurred in at least seven cities. Overall, the numbers said to be taking part range from a less than 100 in some places to thousands in others - but demonstrations do not appear to be taking place on a massive scale. Videos posted on social media appear to show clashes between security forces and some demonstrators in Kermanshah. Fars news agency reported that protesters there destroyed some public property and were dispersed. The governor-general of Tehran said that any such gatherings would be firmly dealt with by the police, who are out in force on main intersections. Officials in Mashhad said the protest was organised by ""counter-revolutionary elements"", and video online showed police using water cannon. Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian The demonstrations have taken the Iranian authorities by surprise. Impromptu anti-government demonstrations are rare in a country where the Revolutionary Guard and numerous intelligence agencies have a strong grip on the population. Predictably they are blaming anti-revolutionary elements and foreign agents. But the protests clearly stem from seething discontent in Iran, mainly because of the worsening economic conditions faced by ordinary Iranians. A BBC Persian investigation has found that Iranians, on average, have become 15% poorer in the past 10 years alone. Many believe that money that should be used to improve their lives is being spent by Iran's leaders on conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Billions are also being spent on spreading religious propaganda and Shia Islam around the world. But it seems that the hardliners opposed to President Rouhani may have triggered the unrest by holding a demonstration that quickly grew out of control and spread to cities and towns across the country.

UK stock markets close at a record highLondon's FTSE indexes reached new heights after confounding downbeat expectations for the year.10h10 hours agoBusiness,"UK stock markets climbed to new highs on the final day of trading for 2017. Both the FTSE 100 index of leading blue chip companies and the FTSE 250 reached new records at the close of trading. US stock markets have also hit new peaks over the year, helped in part by Donald Trump's sweeping tax reforms. Stephen Eckett, author of the annual Harriman Stock Market Almanac, said: ""All the dangers that were anticipated with a Trump administration haven't materialised."" The FTSE 100 finished up 7.6% at 7,687.77 compared with the last day of trading in 2016. Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 ended 14.7% ahead at 20,726.26 compared with the end of last year. Mr Eckett said: ""It has been a little bit of a surprise to many people that markets were are strong as they were this year."" George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the FTSE 100 had been lifted by natural resource giants such as Shell and BP which have benefitted from a rise in oil prices. Brent crude fell as low as $45 per barrel in June but is now trading at $66.34. The fall in sterling since Brexit has also boosted earnings since many of the FTSE 100 companies have large operations abroad, said Linda Yueh, a professor of economics at London Business School. "" A lot of the rise in the FTSE 100 is because of the weak pound,"" she said. By Joe Lynam, Business Correspondent If ever we needed a reminder about the disconnect between our largest listed companies and Britain's 'real' economy , we got it today.  UK GDP growth is well below the G7 average and real wages continue to fall. Despite that, Britain's PLCs are doing very well thank you. That's because most of them earn the vast majority of their profits overseas and the global economy is enjoying is best period of sustained growth in a decade. The better the world does, the more stuff UK quoted firms can sell. It helps, of course, that the pound has remained relatively weak since the referendum last year - meaning British based exporters can repatriate higher profits earned in stronger currencies. However, John Botham, global equities product director at City firm, Invesco Perpetual, said that, while the UK's leading index is at a record high, ""the FTSE 100 has performed far less well than the US stock market and indeed many stock markets around the world"". In the US, the tech-focused Nasdaq has rose more than 1,740 points or about 28% since the start of the year to close at 24,719.22 on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained about 25% over the year, adding more than 4,830 points to close at 24,719. The S&P 500 rose 19% since January, adding more than 400 points to close at 2673.6. Oil prices recovered towards the end of 2017 Analysts attribute the rise to strong corporate earnings at global companies, with technology firms contributing heavily to the gains. Commenting on the year ahead, Mr Botham said: ""We are looking at a situation where global growth seems reasonably well synchronised and we are likely to continue to see earnings growth from companies around the world."" Housebuilders were among the best performing companies on the FTSE 100 in 2017. Berkeley Group, which mainly builds luxury homes in London, rejoined the blue chip index in September and has seen its share price rise by more than 50% this year. Berkeley had fallen out of the FTSE 100 last August and into the FTSE 250 after its share price tumbled on fears that the UK's vote to leave the European Union would adversely impact on the housing market. Fellow property group Persimmon saw its share price rise by 57%. However, Mr Salmon said: ""Not all of the referendum effects have blown over."" Businesses such as advertising giant WPP and broadcaster ITV were among the worst performers as companies reduced investment in marketing. ""Advertising spending does fall into discretionary spending,"" said Mr Salmon. NMC Healthcare, which is one of the largest private healthcare providers in the UAE, saw its share price jump by 84% after expanding its operations in the Middle East. Shares in British Gas-owner Centrica endured a bumpy year, falling 41% after being buffeted byPrime Minister Theresa May's revived planto put a price cap on energy bills.

"Holiday promotions 'can be misleading'In half the cases it looked at, Which? found holidays were no more expensive after the promotion period ended.1h30 minutes agoBusiness","Holiday firms which advertise time-limited offers may be misleading consumers, according to the consumer group, Which? Many tour operators promote money-off deals, providing travellers book by a certain date. But when Which? studied such offers, it found that half the holidays advertised were the same price  -or even cheaper - after the offer expired. The firms involved have all denied misleading their customers. However two operators - Kuoni and Inghams - told Which? they had reviewed the way they  promote their holidays as a result of the findings. Which? looked at 30 examples over a three-week period in July and August 2017. In 16 of those cases, it found prices were lower, or the same, after the deal was over. Which? claimed that in some cases the promotions could be in breach of consumer law. In one example, Virgin Holidays advertised seven nights in a Florida hotel for Â£792 per person, if it was booked by 17 August. But according to Which? the day after the sale the price dropped to Â£677 per person - a saving of Â£230 for two people sharing. Many holiday firms advertise time-limited offers In October the Caribbean resort Sandals advertised an all-inclusive break to Jamaica from Â£1,465 per person. Yet the day after the ""mega sale"" ended, the price dropped by Â£50 a person. Virgin Holidays told Which? that it would never intentionally advertise anything misleading. It added: ""We're always looking to secure the best possible value for our customers - and should we be able to obtain better offers from our suppliers, these savings will be passed on to benefit the customer."" Unique Caribbean Holidays - which represents Sandals in the UK - said the company does not intentionally ""pressure sell"", or create false ""book by"" dates. It said all its packages were fairly promoted to the consumer. However Which? is advising holidaymakers to take their time before deciding to make a booking. ""Our investigation shows that most of the time-limited deals we looked at are nothing of the sort,"" said Rory Boland, Which? travel editor. ""The tight deadlines, emotive language and countdown clocks are all designed to rush us into making a decision, but it might not be the right one."" ""Don't be fooled - compare prices with other holiday companies and travel agents to check savings are genuine."" The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) said that most of its members follow its code of conduct, which stipulates that promotions should not be misleading. ""The Which? findings relate to a small number of instances, and we do not believe they are reflective of wider travel industry practice,"" an ABTA spokesperson said. ""The number of complaints we receive each year about holiday pricing is very low - indicating that the majority of price advertising is trustworthy.""

"Three steps before seeing GP, public urgedPatients are being urged to consider other options before making an appointment with their family doctor.12h12 hours agoHealthComments","People should take three steps to try to solve a health problem before seeing their GP, a doctors' leader has urged. Patients should see if they can sort it themselves, see a pharmacist or use a reputable online source of information, the Royal College of GPs says. GPs ""really feel the pinch"" over winter because of demand, said chairwoman Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard. If just 5% of people did not visit their GP, it would ""save 50,000 appointments,"" she told the BBC. GP leaders say there are not enough family doctors working in England and that practices are closing at an ""alarming rate"". According to Professor Stokes-Lampard, ""up to a quarter of appointments could be avoidable or sorted out by other means"". She urged patients to adopt the ""three before GP"" mantra. ""We're just asking people to stop and think, when you reach for the phone to book a GP appointment think: 'Can I do this myself? Do I need some online help? Could a pharmacist help me?' ""Even if 5% of people paused before reaching for the phone... that would save 50,000 appointments, perhaps freeing up a bit of space for those who need them,"" she told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. A reputable online source would include NHS Choices, she said, praising the site for its ""helpful, sensible advice that's up-to-date, written by doctors and nurses for patients. ""There's nothing more trustworthy than the NHS. The NHS spends a lot of money on that website for very good reason."" But she added: ""We're not suggesting for a moment that people shouldn't be seeing their GPs if they need to - that's what we're there for."" ""Today over a million people will be seeing a GP around the UK."" Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard is a practising GP working in the Midlands The practising GP said people had been visiting her surgery with indigestion over the festive period. She says: ""People eat a bit too much, drink a bit too much, gain a bit of weight and develop indigestion and heartburn. ""That's the sort of thing where a pharmacist could easily signpost them to a range of medications."" She said: ""We don't have enough GPs. ""The workload has gone up inexorably because of an ageing population with multiple long-term conditions."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Neal Patel of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said pharmacists were the experts on medicines and could help people with questions about winter bugs as well as concerns about side-effects of prescription medicines. ""Even if it is a cough or a cold, don't wait until it gets more serious. Seek advice from your pharmacist,"" he said. He added: ""Crucially, pharmacists can help you decide when that worrying symptom is something you can manage yourself or when you should seek help."" An NHS England spokesman said: ""We do need more GPs."" Newly-qualified doctors were choosing GP training at near-record levels, he said, but this was being partly offset by early retirements so the NHS was also stepping up international recruitment. The Home Office said it was keeping all immigration routes under review, but said the last time the independent migration advisory committee reviewed whether GPs should be added to the shortage occupation list, they did not recommend including them.

UK stock markets close at a record highLondon's FTSE indexes reached new heights after confounding downbeat expectations for the year.,"UK stock markets climbed to new highs on the final day of trading for 2017. Both the FTSE 100 index of leading blue chip companies and the FTSE 250 reached new records at the close of trading. US stock markets have also hit new peaks over the year, helped in part by Donald Trump's sweeping tax reforms. Stephen Eckett, author of the annual Harriman Stock Market Almanac, said: ""All the dangers that were anticipated with a Trump administration haven't materialised."" The FTSE 100 finished up 7.6% at 7,687.77 compared with the last day of trading in 2016. Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 ended 14.7% ahead at 20,726.26 compared with the end of last year. Mr Eckett said: ""It has been a little bit of a surprise to many people that markets were are strong as they were this year."" George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the FTSE 100 had been lifted by natural resource giants such as Shell and BP which have benefitted from a rise in oil prices. Brent crude fell as low as $45 per barrel in June but is now trading at $66.34. The fall in sterling since Brexit has also boosted earnings since many of the FTSE 100 companies have large operations abroad, said Linda Yueh, a professor of economics at London Business School. "" A lot of the rise in the FTSE 100 is because of the weak pound,"" she said. By Joe Lynam, Business Correspondent If ever we needed a reminder about the disconnect between our largest listed companies and Britain's 'real' economy , we got it today.  UK GDP growth is well below the G7 average and real wages continue to fall. Despite that, Britain's PLCs are doing very well thank you. That's because most of them earn the vast majority of their profits overseas and the global economy is enjoying is best period of sustained growth in a decade. The better the world does, the more stuff UK quoted firms can sell. It helps, of course, that the pound has remained relatively weak since the referendum last year - meaning British based exporters can repatriate higher profits earned in stronger currencies. However, John Botham, global equities product director at City firm, Invesco Perpetual, said that, while the UK's leading index is at a record high, ""the FTSE 100 has performed far less well than the US stock market and indeed many stock markets around the world"". In the US, the tech-focused Nasdaq has rose more than 1,740 points or about 28% since the start of the year to close at 24,719.22 on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained about 25% over the year, adding more than 4,830 points to close at 24,719. The S&P 500 rose 19% since January, adding more than 400 points to close at 2673.6. Oil prices recovered towards the end of 2017 Analysts attribute the rise to strong corporate earnings at global companies, with technology firms contributing heavily to the gains. Commenting on the year ahead, Mr Botham said: ""We are looking at a situation where global growth seems reasonably well synchronised and we are likely to continue to see earnings growth from companies around the world."" Housebuilders were among the best performing companies on the FTSE 100 in 2017. Berkeley Group, which mainly builds luxury homes in London, rejoined the blue chip index in September and has seen its share price rise by more than 50% this year. Berkeley had fallen out of the FTSE 100 last August and into the FTSE 250 after its share price tumbled on fears that the UK's vote to leave the European Union would adversely impact on the housing market. Fellow property group Persimmon saw its share price rise by 57%. However, Mr Salmon said: ""Not all of the referendum effects have blown over."" Businesses such as advertising giant WPP and broadcaster ITV were among the worst performers as companies reduced investment in marketing. ""Advertising spending does fall into discretionary spending,"" said Mr Salmon. NMC Healthcare, which is one of the largest private healthcare providers in the UAE, saw its share price jump by 84% after expanding its operations in the Middle East. Shares in British Gas-owner Centrica endured a bumpy year, falling 41% after being buffeted byPrime Minister Theresa May's revived planto put a price cap on energy bills.

Berlin New Year party to have women's zoneThe safety measure reflects concern about large-scale sexual assaults at public events in Germany.13h13 hours agoEurope,"The shadow of the New Year's Eve sex attacks in Cologne still looms large in Germany Organisers of Berlin's New Year's Eve celebrations are to set up a ""safe zone"" for women for the first time. The new security measures planned for the Brandenburg Gate party come amid concerns about sexual assaults. A large number of assaults and robberies targeting women at Cologne's New Year's Eve celebrations two years ago horrified Germany. Hundreds of women reported being attacked by gangs of men with migrant backgrounds. The events in Cologne heightened tensions in the country over the large influx of refugees and migrants - 1.1m people arrived in Germany in 2015, some, but by no means all, fleeing violence in Syria and Iraq. Cologne police 'right to target North Africans' at new year Women describe 'terrible' assaults Should Germany pay its migrants to leave? Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend the New Year's Eve party in Berlin on Sunday and security will be strict. Large bags, such as rucksacks, and alcoholic drinks will be banned at the Brandenburg Gate. Women who have been assaulted or feel harassed will be able to get support at a special ""safety zone"", staffed by the German Red Cross, on Ebertstrasse. Preparations are under way for the New Year Eve's party at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin The city's police have also issued advice to women,external, encouraging them to seek help if they feel threatened and to carry a small bag with no valuables. The 'right amount' of panic for women in public Undercover in London, catching harassers on the Tube Cologne officials set up a ""security point"", staffed by social workers and psychologists, at the city's 2016 carnival following the New Year's Eve attacks. But the idea of a special safe zone for women at large public events has not been welcomed by everyone. Critics say it does not tackle the perpetrators of sexual violence, while some others complain it is discriminatory.

"Thai fraudster sentenced to 13,275 yearsPudit Kittithradilok admits duping thousands of victims through a Ponzi-style investment scheme.","Some 40,000 people are believed to have been duped by the fraudulent scheme (file picture) A Thai court has sentenced a fraudster to more than 13,000 years in prison. Pudit Kittithradilok, 34, admitted running a Ponzi scheme whereby he promised investors artificially high financial returns. About 40,000 people were persuaded to pour more than $160m (Â£120m) into his companies. The court found he engaged in illicit lending and some 2,653 counts of fraud. Thanks to his confession, it halved his sentence to 6,637 years and six months. He is unlikely to serve more than 20 years, as Thai law sets a maximum 10-year term for each of the two crimes he was convicted of. China hit by financial scam 'epidemic' Prosecutors told the court that Pudit organised seminars where attendees were encouraged to invest in what he said were businesses linked to property development, beauty, used cars and exports, among other things. According to the Bangkok Post, investors were promised generous returns,external, plus incentives to bring new members on board. As with any pyramid scheme, these new cash injections would then be used to pay off the earlier backers. Pudit had been held in Bangkok Remand Prison since his arrest in August, when he was denied bail. The court fined his two companies the equivalent of $20m each. Pudit and the firms were ordered to repay around $17m to the 2,653 identified victims, with 7.5% yearly interest.

"BEM for organ donation campaigner, 18How do the Honours work?","This video can not be played Lucia Mee's organ donor campaigning saw her named on the New Year Honours list Lucia Mee has been awarded a British Empire Medal for her work raising awareness of organ donation. The 18-year-old, from Ballycastle in Northern Ireland, who has had three liver transplants - the first aged eight - is the youngest person on the New Year Honours list. She campaigns for organ donation to be taught in schools and for everyone to sign the organ donation register. She previously told the BBC that each new organ was ""a gift"". Miss Mee was diagnosed with auto immune hepatitis when she was young and told she needed a new liver. However, two transplant surgeries in 2007 and 2009 ended in her body rejecting the new organs and she received her third new liver when she was 16. ""For me, it has always been a special thing to know that the decision has not been made for someone but has been a gift from each person or their family,"" she said. ""Whatever system we have in place it is more important in my view that it operates alongside education and conversation."" She also said the family should always have the final say. And she said recently: ""There is not enough evidence that the opt-out system results in more organ donations if it is done without education."" Barry Gibb, Ringo Starr and Darcey Bussell head honours list The life-saving gift of organ donation Does an opt-out system increase transplants? Miss Mee said she had written to two of her organ donors but had not heard anything back from them. She is now finishing up her studies at school in Country Antrim after her most recent liver transplant. Government ministers in Northern Ireland and England are thinking of moving to a system of 'presumed consent', in which people would have to opt out of organ donation rather than opting in by signing a donor register. A consultation on the new systemhas already started. Wales has already adopted the 'presumed consent' approach and Scotland plans to introduce a similar scheme. Around 6,500 people in the UK are currently waiting for an organ transplant. One in 10 recipients of this year's honours were from the health sector. They include a damehoods for Cathy Warwick, former chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives and Clare Marx, outgoing president of the Royal College of Surgeons, and a CBE for Dr Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Institute, for services to genetics and stem cell research.

"Knighthood for Clegg in New Year HonoursThe former deputy prime minister is knighted, alongside several current MPs.1h39 minutes agoUK Politics","Former Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has been knighted in the New Year Honours list. Sir Nick, who led his party into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010, is recognised for political and public service. He said he was ""grateful"" for the knighthood which ""belongs as much to my team in government as it does to me"". Tory MP Graham Brady and Labour's Lindsay Hoyle were also knighted. And Prof John Curtice - whose exit poll correctly predicted the hung Parliament in June's general election - is knighted for services to social sciences and politics. Political honours are considered by a special committee set up in 2012, which includes independent members and party representatives. Pollster John Curtice gets knighthood Barry Gibb, Ringo Starr and Darcey Bussell head honours list Sir Nick, who lost his Sheffield Hallam seat in the election, follows several of his Liberal Democrat colleagues in being knighted. He faced heavy criticism from some wings of his party when he agreed to join the Conservatives in a coalition government after the 2010 general election produced a hung Parliament. Despite some predictions - and an outcry when tuition fees were increased despite a Lib Dem manifesto pledge - the arrangement lasted for the duration of the Parliament, although the party then suffered heavily in the 2015 general election, after which Mr Clegg resigned as leader. Since leaving Parliament, he has continued to campaign against the UK's departure from the EU - recently publishing a book called How to Stop Brexit (and Make Britain Great Again). Seeking to avoid any confusion, hewrote on Twitter,external: ""The knighthood does not mean I will serve in the House of Lords. My aversion to unelected Legislatures remains."" Commons Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle has been knighted As chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs, Sir Graham is a powerful figure within the Parliamentary Conservative Party. The committee's treasurer Geoffrey Clifton-Brown is also knighted, and its vice-chairwoman Cheryl Gillan made a Dame. Another Conservative MP, veteran former minister Christopher Chope, is knighted. On the Labour side, Mr Hoyle, who represents Chorley, is joined by fellow Lancashire MP Mark Hendrick (Preston) in receiving a knighthood. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said she was ""delighted"" to become a CBE. The former Tory children's minister Edward Timpson, who lost his Crewe and Nantwich seat at the election, has also been made a CBE. David Johnston, chief executive of the Social Mobility Foundation charity, is appointed OBE for services to social mobility and education. He recently quit along with the rest of the board of the government's Social Mobility Commission. Political awards are often the most controversial parts of the honours list. In the Tories' 2017 general election manifesto, Theresa May promised to ""review the honours system to make sure it commands public confidence, rewards genuine public service and that recipients uphold the integrity of the honours bestowed"". SNP Cabinet Office spokesman Tommy Sheppard said many of this year's honours list could be ""rightly proud of the recognition their honour gives to their works"".

Ship seized amid row over North Korea oilSouth Korea's revelations come after China denied US claims of allowing oil shipments to the North.6h6 hours agoAsia,"The Lighthouse Winmore filled up with oil to take to Taiwan but never went there, it is alleged South Korea has revealed it seized a Hong Kong-registered ship last month suspected of supplying oil to the North in breach of international sanctions. Officials said the Lighthouse Winmore had secretly transferred 600 tonnes of refined oil to a North Korean ship. A UN Security Council resolution bans ship-to-ship transfers of any goods destined for Pyongyang. The revelations came as China denied claims by President Donald Trump it had allowed oil shipments to the North. North Korea crisis in 300 words How North Korea does business under sanctions Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? The ship entered Yeosu port in South Korea on 11 October,externalto load up with refined oil and left for Taiwan four days later, Yonhap news agency reported. But instead of going to Taiwan it transferred the oil to a North Korean ship and three other vessels in international waters on 19 October, South Korean officials were quoted as saying. This defies a UN Security Council resolution imposed on 11 September. The New York Timessaid the transfer was captured in US satellite photos,external, released by the US Treasury in November, although the Lighthouse Winmore was not named by the Treasury. The Lighthouse Winmore was seized when it returned to Yeosu in November and remains in South Korea, South Korean officials said. There is no evidence for this, as although the Lighthouse Winmore is Hong Kong-flagged, it was leased by a Taiwanese company, Billions Bunker Group Corp. Taiwan's Presidential Office said the company that chartered the ship was not incorporated in Taiwan, but did not say whether the firm's owner or officials are Taiwanese. The Chinese government said the accusations against it were ""not consistent with the facts"". North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has refused to bow to international pressure ""China has never allowed Chinese enterprises nor individuals to violate UN Security Council resolutions imposed on the DPRK,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said. China handles about 90% of the North's foreign trade. There has been increasing suspicion in Washington that Chinese ships have been secretly transferring petroleum to North Korean vessels at sea.

Last weekBeijing supported a US-drafted UN resolutionthat included measures to slash the North's petrol imports by up to 90%. The 22 December sanctions also refer specifically to attempts by the North to procure prohibited goods,external. The measures address the ""illicit imports of petroleum through deceptive maritime practices by requiring Member States to seize, inspect and freeze any vessel in their ports and territorial waters for involvement in prohibited activities"". On Thursday, the UN Security Council also denied international port access to four more North Korean ships suspected of carrying banned goods, AFP reported. It would bring the total number of ships blocked by the UN to eight. North Korea is already subject to a raft of sanctions from the US, the UN and the EU. The latest round was sparked by the 29 November launch of a ballistic missile, which flew higher than any other the North has tested. In a typically bellicose response,North Korea described the new sanctions as an ""act of war"". Mr Trump has previously threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if it launches a nuclear attack.
