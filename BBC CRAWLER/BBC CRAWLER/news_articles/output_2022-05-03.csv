Missing US guard and inmate had 'relationship',"Inmate Casey White (L) and corrections officer Vicky White An escaped inmate and a guard suspected of helping him had a ""special relationship"", say investigators. The announcement from the Alabama sheriff's office said the discovery was confirmed by fellow inmates of missing prisoner Casey White, a murder suspect. A manhunt is under way for the 38-year-old escapee and corrections officer Vicky White, 56 (no relation). The pair vanished as she was transporting him to a bogus mental evaluation. Police have not revealed whether the relationship was romantic. Friday - the day the pair went missing - was supposed to be her final day at work. She had recently sold her home and told colleagues she planned to spend more time at the beach. This video can not be played WATCH: CCTV footage of guard and inmate escaping Police now believe Ms White helped orchestrate the escape after breaking jail protocol to escort Casey White alone. ""Investigators received information from inmates at the Lauderdale County Detention Center over the weekend that there was a special relationship between Director White and inmate Casey White,"" Sheriff Rick Singleton said in a statement on Tuesday. ""That relationship has now been confirmed through our investigation by independent sources and means."" On Tuesday, the US Marshals Service said the two were last seen on Friday driving a copper-coloured Ford Edge with an Alabama registration plate. The same bulletin gave two aliases for Ms White - April Davis and Renee Marie Maxwell. Authorities say Casey White should be considered ""armed and extremely dangerous"". Officials say they may now have access to an AR-15 rifle and a shotgun. On Monday, Sheriff Singleton described the 6ft 9in Casey White as ""extremely dangerous"" and advised law enforcement not to ""take any chances"" with him. ""He has nothing to lose,"" he said. He added that Ms White is thought to be using cash, and has switched off her mobile phone. The US Secret Service is helping to track her financial records, he said. ""I would have trusted Vicky with my life. I really mean it,"" Lauderdale County District Attorney Chris Connolly told reporters. ""If we needed something from the jail, she was our go-to person, solid employee. That's why it's so shocking."" The Marshals Service called Ms White a ""wanted fugitive"". Casey White was charged in September 2020 with murder over the stabbing of 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway. He was already serving 75 years for a series of violent crimes in 2015, including burglary, vehicle theft and a police chase. He allegedly confessed to the murder, but later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and was awaiting trial at the Lauderdale County Jail when he disappeared, authorities added. He faces execution if convicted. Meanwhile, a woman who White tried to kill during a burglary said she is ""freaking out"" after discovering he is on the loose. The unnamed womantold local ABC affiliate WAAY 31,externalthat she and her family are in hiding, fearful that White will track them down. She also said she has a message for Ms White:Â ""If she is still alive, get the hell out. Run. Run as far as you can, and turn yourself in, and contact somebody. ""Like, do the right thing before you lose your life or somebody else does.""

Formula 1 pioneer Tony Brooks dies aged 90,"Brooks and Moss share the victory at the end of the 1957 British Grand Prix Tony Brooks, one of the defining Formula 1 drivers of the 1950s, has died aged 90, his daughter Giulia announced on Tuesday. The Briton won six grands prix and narrowly missed out on the world championship in 1959. After Juan Manuel Fangio, Alberto Ascari and Stirling Moss, Brooks was the most successful driver of his era. Brooks is regarded alongside Moss as the best British driver never to win the F1 title. Moss, who died two years ago, also aged 90, said of his former team-mate and friend: ""Brooks was a tremendous driver, the greatest - if he'll forgive me saying this - 'unknown' racing driver there's ever been. He was far better than several people who won the world championship."" F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali paid tribute to Brooks in a statement, saying: ""I was saddened to hear the news that Tony Brooks has died. ""He was part of a special group of drivers who were pioneers and pushed the boundaries at a time of great risk. ""He will be missed and our thoughts are with his family at this time."" Brooks, who had been the last surviving F1 race winner of the 1950s, left a considerable mark on the sport - between 1956 and 1959, he won 46% of the races he finished, in an era when mechanical reliability was a significant feature in motorsport. Brooks famously won his first ever F1 race, the Syracuse Grand Prix of 1955, in which he competed as a last-minute entry for the Connaught team while studying for his dentistry finals at Manchester University. Receiving a call from the team while revising, Brooks went to Italy, missed the first practice day, learned the circuit on a Vespa, and then caused a sensation by leading home the Maseratis of world championship regulars Luigi Musso and Luigi Villoresi, to achieve the first international grand prix win for a British car since 1924. His success put his career as a dentist on the backburner, as he decided to focus full-time on motor racing. He entered F1 in 1956 with BRM, but he raced only twice in a car that was not a success - and Brooks was lucky to escape without serious injury from a crash when its throttle stuck open during the 1956 British Grand Prix. The following year marked his breakthrough. Joining the Vanwall team alongside Moss, Brooks finished second in Monaco to Fangio, who was on course for the last of his five world titles, and then won the British Grand Prix, sharing with Moss. Brooks was suffering from injuries sustained in a heavy crash at Le Mans the month before, but still qualified third. And after Moss retired from the race while leading, a fatigued Brooks handed over his car and Moss went on to a famous win. Brooks - as befitted his talent - always shone brightest on the most demanding circuits, and in 1958 underlined his skills with impressive victories on the daunting Spa-Francorchamps and Nurburgring Nordschleife circuits in the Belgian and German Grands Prix. Having moved to Ferrari in 1959, he should have won the world title. Wins in France and Germany, along with second in Monaco, meant he went into the final race at Sebring in Florida still in with a chance of the championship despite problems at the other races. This video can not be played Archive: Meet F1's racing dentist Brooks was a devout Catholic, and did not believe in taking unnecessary risks with his life, despite his profession. The Silverstone and Le Mans crashes earlier in his career had changed his view as to how to approach his sport. Both had come as a result of trying to compensate with his talent for deficiencies in the car, and he resolved after Le Mans never to do that again. ""I always felt it was morally wrong to take unnecessary risks with one's life,"" he told the veteran F1 journalist Nigel Roebuck in the 1980s, ""because I believe that life is a gift from God and that suicide is morally unacceptable. ""I suppose there are those who would say that driving racing cars at all is an unnecessary risk but I wouldn't agree with that.  However, driving one which may be unsound or damaged, while not exactly suicide, is verging towards it."" The philosophy probably cost him the world title. On the first lap of the 1959 US Grand Prix, Brooks' Ferrari was hit by team-mate Wolfgang Von Trips' car. ""My natural inclination was to carry on,"" he said. ""Believe me, that would have been the easiest thing to do, but I made myself come in to have the car checked over. ""I lost half a lap doing that, and still finished third. Stirling retired, and Jack [Brabham, the eventual champion] ran out of petrol near the end! Still, in my own mind, I think I did the right thing."" Brooks left Ferrari after that and although he continued in F1 in 1960 and '61, he was already thinking of moving on. And after an unsatisfactory year back with BRM, he retired, with little fanfare. To those who know motor racing, Brooks was and always will be one of the greatest drivers, and a charming and self-effacing man, too. Brooks retired from F1 in 1961. He is pictured here (third from left) in July of that year alongside fellow F1 drivers Bruce McLaren, Stirling Moss, Graham Hill, Jo Bonnier and Wolfgang von Trips.

Brewdog boss plans to give staff 20% of his stake,"CEO James Watt said shared ownership would help with recruitment, retention and team engagement Brewdog boss James Watt has set out plans to give away nearly a fifth of his equity stake to the firm's staff. Mr Watt owns a quarter of the fast-growing Aberdeenshire-based beer maker. Brewery and pub workers have criticised him over his behaviour and pressure on them to grow the firm rapidly. At least partly in response, Mr Watt has set out an incentive plan which also means half of its pub profits will go to those who work on hourly rates in its 111 bars worldwide. Based on last year's figures, that could mean an annual bonus of between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000 each, in cash payouts made twice a year. Brewdog chief accused of inappropriate behaviour Brewdog flouted US laws over beer imports Brewdog boss sorry for staff 'pain' as vows review The chief executive claimed the giveaway of shares could be worth Â£120,000 for each Brewdog salaried staffer, comprising four annual tranches starting this June. However, the shares are not yet tradeable, and plans to float shares on the stock exchange have been delayed. A funding round in 2017 brought in an investment fund, TSG, with a Â£213m injection of capital, but on terms that financial analysts said stood to undermine the value of other shareholders. James Watt currently holds 24.2% of the company, and the plan unveiled on Monday - to mark 15 years since it started brewing - is for him to give away 5% to an Employee Benefit Trust, reducing his stake to 19.2%. That trust will distribute equally across salaried staff, at around 1.25% of the company each year. Anyone who leaves the company ahead of shares being floated on the stock exchange will have to give up the option to buy shares, which will then revert to the trust. At current rates of turnover, the 5% stake will take up to eight years for the trust to distribute. Between staff and the 'Equity Punks' who took part in several successful rounds of crowdfunding, a quarter of the company should be owned by small-scale shareholders once this process is complete. The rewards package, unusually, extends to former members of staff, including some who were particularly outspoken about Mr Watt's behaviour and the pressures they were under. Ex-employees will get discounts on Brewdog products and in its bars, and will be able to join an alumni club. Management was accused by former workers last summer of having a ""culture of fear"" within the business, with ""toxic attitudes"" towards junior staff. Brewdog has expanded from a small operation in Fraserburgh to an international business with breweries around the world A group of 60 employees published an open letter alleging the business was built upon a ""cult of personality"" around its founders, James Watt and Martin Dickie, with ""growth at all costs"" the overarching focus of the company. Further revelations came to light in aninvestigation by BBC Scotland journalists. Mr Watt said the group had already made changes after the open letter was published, stressing the employee reward scheme was not about mending relationships with employees, but ""building the best company we possibly can"". ""Everything we're doing today is about looking forward with a fantastic team,"" he said. He said Brewdog wanted to be a ""new type of business"", and that shared ownership would help with recruitment, retention and team engagement. ""We want our team members to act as business owners and incentivise them as if they are business owners,"" he added. Mr Watt said the group was unlikely to float in the next 12 months given the market uncertainty, but said a listing was ""very much part"" part of the plan in the medium term. Brewdog was founded in Fraserburgh by James Watt and his friend and fellow beer-lover Martin Dickie, as a challenger to conventional beer. It expanded rapidly with a move to a new brewery in Ellon, where it is currently expanding its capacity. Other Brewdog breweries have been built in Ohio, Brisbane and Berlin. It operates 111 bars around the world, with three hotels, and in Ellon it is expanding into spirits distillation.

Hard to criticise Brits in Ukraine - UK ambassador,"This video can not be played Watch: Melinda Simmons, the UK's ambassador to Ukraine reacts to returning to the war-torn country It is hard to be critical of Britons who have travelled to fight in Ukraine, the UK's ambassador has said. Speaking to the BBC after returning to Kyiv, Melinda Simmons said she understood that Ukraine's defence is based on values that many Brits share. The Foreign Office advises against all travel to Ukraine because of the lethal danger posed by the Russian invasion. Since it began, one British national has been killed and four captured while fighting or providing aid there. ""Our travel advice is very clear,"" the British ambassador said to BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""Ukraine is not a safe place to be. It advises against all travel."" Asked why she is not more critical of people who make the choice to fight in Ukraine, Ms Simmons said: ""I think it quite hard to be critical of people who make choices to do this."" She described Ukraine's defence against Russia as an ""existential fight"" based upon shared principles that many in the UK hold dear. ""Some people interpret that as wanting to come and fight or come to a dangerous area to help deliver humanitarian aid,"" she said, ""I'd rather they didn't because it is not a safe country"". The British nationals captured by Russian forcesinclude two aid workers who were detained at gun point in southern Ukraine last week. One of those workers, Paul Urey, has since appeared on Russian television to explain his decision to come to Ukraine while wearing handcuffs. It is not clear whether he was speaking under duress. After watching the video his mother Linda Urey said she didn't believe what he was saying: ""I know my son like every mother, and this is not him being natural."" UK aid workers captured in Ukraine named British man killed fighting in Ukraine Captured Britons being looked after, says Russia A further two British men, Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, are being held by Russian forces after being captured while defending Mariupol. And last week the Foreign Office announced that a UK national had been killed in the conflict. It says the Russian invasion of Ukraine poses a ""real risk to life"" and advises against all travel there for any reason. Those wanting to help should instead consider donating or taking in a Ukrainian refugee, the Foreign Office guidance suggests. KYIV:Ukrainian villages haunted by the vanished ENERGY:EU divided over how to step away from Russian energy WATCH:The southern villages holding back the Russians READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external After leaving the Ukrainian capital in late February, the British ambassador Melinda Simmons said her return to her home on Friday was ""incredibly emotional."" Driving back into the capital Ms Simmons passed by ""bombed out playgrounds, bombed out schools, hospitals, burned out trees, twisted metal in farmland,"" she told broadcasters. It showed that the Russian military was deliberately targeting civilian sites, she said. ""Right from the beginning this was about hitting the Ukrainian nation. It wasn't just about taking out the military capability."" The British ambassador to Ukraine, speaking to the BBC's Ben Brown after her return to Kyiv on Friday Ms Simmons has urged other foreign ambassadors to also come back to the capital. ""It's massively important for the work,"" she says, as well as being a psychological boost for the Ukrainians she works with. The French, Italian, and Spanish ambassadors are among those also to have already returned to the capital, and yesterday the United States said it hoped its embassy in Kyiv would resume operations by the end of May. The Ukrainian capital is still vulnerable to Russian air strikes, and last week Moscow made threats against Western diplomats returning to the city. Russian forces were primed to carry out strikes against ""decision-making centres in Kyiv,"" Moscow officials said, adding that the presence of foreign advisers in those sites ""will not necessarily be a problem to Russia deciding to take retaliatory action"". When asked by if Ukraine can ultimately win this war, Ms Simmons said the country had been underestimated. ""They have all the determination that is needed and all the focus that is needed to do this,"" she said. ""The challenge for them is to see this through.""

University course complaints hit record high,"Complaints from students in England and Wales about their university courses reached a record high last year. More than a third of the 2,763 complaints to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) were related to the impact of pandemic. The amount of compensation given to students exceeded Â£1.3m, it said. A report suggested that staffing issues, industrial action, and delays in submitting complaints from 2020 were behind the high figures. As a result of the Covid pandemic ""some students found that they weren't getting the learning experiences that they reasonably expected"" said the OIA. It said this explained in part why the total number of complaints submitted in 2021 was 6% higher than the year before. By far the largest category were complaints about how courses were delivered. College drop-out rate rises during pandemic University graduations are back after lockdown Why half a million people watch me study on TikTok Some students complained about being unable to access in-person facilities like laboratories, while others were unable to pursue their studies abroad. Many complained about staffing issues, including poorly prepared substitute teachers and key experts in their field leaving the university. The increased dependence on remote learning was also an issue, with many highlighting technical failures affecting their learning. ""Some students struggled with digital literacy, especially in online timed exams,"" the report added. ""For others their limited typing skills affected their performance."" The National Union of Students (NUS) said ""digital poverty"" was a big issue for some students and many others were struggling financially - with some using food banks andbuy-now-pay-later loansfor support. An NUS official said the high number of complaints was ""no surprise"" and students were ""at breaking point"". Complaints in the report that were considered ""justified"", at least in part, include: A group of masters students who were refunded half their tuition fees after they complained about their practical arts programme and how it had been advertised A student who was seriously injured while at university and not given information about the Disabled Students' Allowance Medical students who were studying at an overseas campus where the facilities were not properly finished in time for their arrival One case that resulted in just over Â£68,000 worth of compensation, the highest figure that was awarded, the report said. But other students found the move to remote education had made learning easier, with disabled students benefiting in particular. ""Students told us that they valued having more control over how and when they could access their learning experience,"" the OIA said. In addition to the high number of total complaints, the OIA said the compensation awarded was ""significantly higher"" than previous years. It suggested this may have been because the pandemic sometimes made it challenging to find practical solutions to complaints. PhD and postgraduate students were overrepresented in the complaint logs, submitting just under half of them despite accounting for 27% of the English and Welsh student population. Responding to the report, Universities UK said the high number of complaints was concerning but stressed it represented only ""a small fraction of the total student population"". The organisation, which represents universities, said its members had responded well to the highly disruptive impact of Covid. ""The overwhelming majority of students continue to receive a world-class education,"" it said.

University course complaints hit record highMore than a third of issues examined by the independent adjudicator were related to the pandemic.Family & Education,"Complaints from students in England and Wales about their university courses reached a record high last year. More than a third of the 2,763 complaints to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) were related to the impact of pandemic. The amount of compensation given to students exceeded Â£1.3m, it said. A report suggested that staffing issues, industrial action, and delays in submitting complaints from 2020 were behind the high figures. As a result of the Covid pandemic ""some students found that they weren't getting the learning experiences that they reasonably expected"" said the OIA. It said this explained in part why the total number of complaints submitted in 2021 was 6% higher than the year before. By far the largest category were complaints about how courses were delivered. College drop-out rate rises during pandemic University graduations are back after lockdown Why half a million people watch me study on TikTok Some students complained about being unable to access in-person facilities like laboratories, while others were unable to pursue their studies abroad. Many complained about staffing issues, including poorly prepared substitute teachers and key experts in their field leaving the university. The increased dependence on remote learning was also an issue, with many highlighting technical failures affecting their learning. ""Some students struggled with digital literacy, especially in online timed exams,"" the report added. ""For others their limited typing skills affected their performance."" The National Union of Students (NUS) said ""digital poverty"" was a big issue for some students and many others were struggling financially - with some using food banks andbuy-now-pay-later loansfor support. An NUS official said the high number of complaints was ""no surprise"" and students were ""at breaking point"". Complaints in the report that were considered ""justified"", at least in part, include: A group of masters students who were refunded half their tuition fees after they complained about their practical arts programme and how it had been advertised A student who was seriously injured while at university and not given information about the Disabled Students' Allowance Medical students who were studying at an overseas campus where the facilities were not properly finished in time for their arrival One case that resulted in just over Â£68,000 worth of compensation, the highest figure that was awarded, the report said. But other students found the move to remote education had made learning easier, with disabled students benefiting in particular. ""Students told us that they valued having more control over how and when they could access their learning experience,"" the OIA said. In addition to the high number of total complaints, the OIA said the compensation awarded was ""significantly higher"" than previous years. It suggested this may have been because the pandemic sometimes made it challenging to find practical solutions to complaints. PhD and postgraduate students were overrepresented in the complaint logs, submitting just under half of them despite accounting for 27% of the English and Welsh student population. Responding to the report, Universities UK said the high number of complaints was concerning but stressed it represented only ""a small fraction of the total student population"". The organisation, which represents universities, said its members had responded well to the highly disruptive impact of Covid. ""The overwhelming majority of students continue to receive a world-class education,"" it said.

Should we worry about gas supplies?,"Russian energy giant Gazprom says it has halted gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles - but how worried should we be? Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with Gazprom, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of today's news should be containable. Gas prices in the UK are well down on their record peaks of Â£5 per therm last month, at about Â£1.70. UK terminals have been flooded with liquefied natural gas (LNG) - over 100 tanker-loads so far this year - with the largest amount coming from the US. But it can't be stored here, and much is being re-exported to the European Union (EU). Indeed, market contacts suggest that the export pipeline of gas from the UK to continental Europe is currently at the limits of its capacity. These UK prices are still consistent with further rises in gas bills in October - perhaps of a few hundred pounds a year. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Germany rules out immediate ban on Russian oil All that would change, of course, if these moves today are the first skirmishes in an escalating European energy crisis that could see Germany cut off from Russian gas in the next few months. That would send prices spiralling across Europe and lead to a crisis of supply. There is some helpful ambiguity in what is termed ""forcing buyers to pay for Russian gas in roubles"". ""Various governments and companies stating 'we will not pay in roubles' therefore are not providing any clarity as to whether they will use the new payment process or not, which in turn means there is ambiguity over upcoming supply to other, larger, markets,"" says Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at market information provider ICIS. German firms are paying in euros that are then exchanged into roubles at a specific Russian bank. This arrangement allows all to continue the mutual gas trade dependence, but it is a precarious balance. German ministers say that they are not afraid of paying the economic price to eliminate the ""strategic mistake"" of energy dependence on the Kremlin, but that they just cannot do it any time soon. So the actions of the Kremlin through Gazprom need to be put in perspective. It has cut off some supplies as a result of refusal to change the terms of payment, but notably this was to two countries which had already said their contracts with Gazprom would be allowed to expire this year. As the conflict continues, and Germany ups the ante in terms of supplies of weapons to Ukraine, the real question is about the flow of gas from Russia to Germany, which continued uninterrupted even during the height of the Cold War. This move is designed as a Kremlin shot across the bows of Europe's biggest economies. While Germany, for example, has said it is willing to phase out Russian coal in the summer, and hinted Russian oil could follow over the next year, gas is another matter. Last week, Germany's finance minister told me it would be physically impossible to immediately phase out the 45% dependence of Germany on Russia for its gas. Russia gas supply cuts 'blackmail', says EU Russia halts gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?

"Mum who drowned son, 2, given hospital order","Reid Steele died at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff in August A mother drowned her two-year-old son in the bath because she believed her family were possessed by demons. Natalie Steele, 32, of Broadlands, Bridgend, admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility. Reid Steele died at University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, on 12 August last year, a day after he was found injured in his bathroom. Steele was detained under the Mental Health Act at Cardiff Crown Court and given an indefinite hospital order. The court heard the ""devoted"" mother drowned Reid while suffering paranoid delusions about her family. Steele told police she needed to protect him by sending him to heaven. Tribute to boy, as woman arrested for murder Mum denies murdering her son, two Sentencing, Judge Michael Fitton QC said: ""It is a profound human tragedy that it was you, who loved him so dearly, that caused that loss of life. ""I accept that you did so when you were suffering from a severe and serious mental illness."" He told her the evidence heard showed she was suffering from a ""period of depression so severe and so intense that it led you to a delusional and psychotic state"". ""You were suffering from visual and auditory hallucinations and you were operating on the terrible mistake that your own family, who loved him as much as you, were out to harm him."" Natalie Steele was described as a ""devoted"" mother in court The judge thanked her family who were in court and told them nothing he had heard suggested anyone was at fault or could have foreseen what would happen. ""Not one of you present in the house could have carried any blame,"" he said. ""And if, in the small hours, you wake thinking about that, please remember you are in no way to blame."" Prosecutor Michael Jones QC previously said Steele's family described her as a ""devoted mother"" who was inseparable from her son ""from day one"" but they had been concerned when she reported hearing and seeing things. She had told her mother, Amanda Prescott, she had been ""seeing lights"" and told her ""demons are dark and real"". The night before Reid's death, the defendant had been on a camping trip with her church in New Quay, Ceredigion, but friends became concerned when she demanded to be immediately baptised. Her friend, Heidi Acland, who was not on the trip, drove to New Quay early on the morning of 11 August to speak to Steele and persuade her to come home with her. Ms Acland described Steele as ""speaking gibberish"" and telling her that she had to be a sacrifice. On the journey home, Ms Acland noticed that Steele was compulsively checking on her son in his car seat in the back, saying ""I love you Reid"" and also kept taking her own seatbelt off. Reid was found unresponsive on the bathroom floor of his home Later that evening, after dropping Steele at the home she shared with her mother, step-father and brother, she received a text from her saying: ""I've done something terrible, I had to protect Reid from my family."" When she arrived at the property, she found the emergency services were already there. Ms Prescott told police her daughter had taken her grandson for his bath but had come downstairs at about 19:30 saying: ""I think I done."" Her mother said Steele was not speaking in full sentences, just words like: ""I done it."" She rushed upstairs to find Reid unconscious and wrapped in a towel on the bathroom floor. An inquest into Reid's death was told he died from cardiac arrest. Emergency services took him to hospital, where a CT scan was carried out, but he died the next day. His cause of death was described at the inquest hearing in Pontypridd as ""1a hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy 1b cardiac arrest"". Flowers were left near Reid's Bridgend home after his death in August Steele later told police officers she had been playing ""cups of tea"" with Reid in the bath and had breast fed him before holding him under water. The defendant said she was ""really worried"" about her family, saying they had ""creepy eyes"" and adding that she had ""problems with spirits"" and ""spirits had been touching her"". A forensic psychiatrist's report later found Steele had been suffering from ""an unrecognised, undiagnosed and untreated mental illness"". It continued: ""[Steele] was so deluded that she drowned her son to protect him from demons and send him to heaven."" The report said that her culpability for the killing was low. The prosecution accepted Steele's plea following reports from two psychiatrists into her mental health. Following the sentencing, Reid's family said in a statement: ""The pain we feel at Reid's loss can never be properly expressed with words. ""As a family, we unanimously agree that the judge's decision today was the right one. Natalie will continue to receive the treatment she needs, to hopefully, in time, get better. ""Mental health conditions can sometimes be frightening, complicated and most importantly, not always visible until it is too late. ""But there is help out there. Please don't be afraid to reach out.""

PM promises compassion in tackling cost of living,"This video can not be played PM: The government does not have âan unlimited number of shots to playâ when dealing with the cost of living. Boris Johnson has warned he does not have an ""unlimited number of shots to play"" when it comes to tackling record rises in the cost of living. And he said there would not be ""a magic solution"" for every family overnight. In an interview with the BBC, the prime minister promised the government would ""use all the ingenuity and the compassion"" to support people with price hikes ""in the short-term"". Labour has accused him of offering ""no answers"" to a ""cost of living crisis"". Political parties are arguing over living costs ahead of local elections in England, Wales and Scotland, and for Northern Ireland's government. Inflation is at a 30-year high of 7%, driven upwards by surging food and energy prices, and is expected to rise further later this year. Why are prices rising so quickly? BP profits soar as calls for windfall tax grow Cost of living dominates in key election battleground The government has announced acouncil tax rebateandrepayable discounton energy bills, but is facing calls to go further now to help with costs. It has also come under criticism over the 3.1% rise in the state pension and other benefits that arenot keeping pace with inflation. Ministers are looking at other measures to lower living expenses, includingless frequent MOT tests and relaxing nursery staffing rulesin a bid to reduce the cost of childcare. Mr Johnson said he accepted the country was ""going to have a tough period for a while"". But while he promised the government would ""continue to look at all the options"" to support households, he said there were limits. Talking to the BBC's regional news programmes, the PM said: ""We will use all the ingenuity and the compassion that we had during Covid to try to help people in the short-term. ""That doesn't mean we have an unlimited number of shots to play. ""We've got to be clear - this is taxpayers' money, you're taking it to cut prices, there are limits to what you can do."" He added: ""I am not going to pretend that every family is going to have a magic solution from the government overnightâ¦ but we can be as ingenious and compassionate as possible."" Mr Johnson's comments came after he faced criticism from an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday. Asked about rising prices, the PM initially said the government was ""doing everything we can"" to help households. But pressed on whether the response went far enough, he later said the taxpayer-funded response ""isn't going to be enough immediately to help cover everybody's costs"". ""Of course that isn't going to work enough in the short-term,"" he added. Asked whether there should be a more generous uplift to benefits, he warned this brought the risk of triggering an ""inflationary spiral"". POSTCODE SEARCH:Is there an election in my area? WHAT'S HAPPENING WHERE:Really simple guide ENGLAND:Simple guide GUIDE:How to vote in local elections NOTIFICATIONS:Sign up for Northern Ireland election alerts Opposition parties have suggested hiking taxes on oil and gas companies to pay for bigger support payments to help households with energy bills. They have renewed their calls on Tuesday, after BP announced its profits for the first three months of this yearhave more than doubled. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the news made the government's unwillingness to impose a windfall tax on energy firms ""impossible to justify"". And the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said the government should tax firms making ""excessive profits"", adding: ""Those proceeds should be invested back into making sure those who are suffering from the cost-of-living crisis get some help."" But Mr Johnson rejected a windfall tax on energy firms, saying the likes of BP ""already pay shedloads of tax as businesses"". He told the BBC the question for government was ""if you whack a biz with a tax how does it respond?"", claiming it would ""deter them"" from investing in the UK. Speaking to BBC local radio, Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Greens in England and Wales, said his party's plan for an ""ongoing carbon tax"", as well as on oil and gas windfall tax, would help fund better home insulation to cut bills. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said BP's profits announcement ""reinforces the case"" for a windfall tax. Asked whether it might deter investment, Sir Keir said his party's proposal was for a year-long tax increase on ""profit they didn't expect to make"". He criticised the government's response, saying: ""Overall, the cost of this government is that families will be Â£2,000 worse off and the government's got no answer to that for so many families. ""The National Insurance rise is going to hit working people in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis."" Mr Johnson also faced criticism from Labour for his response to a question from GMB about the situation of a 77-year-old widow. Presenter Susanna Reid said Elsie, a GMB viewer, had resorted to using her London Freedom Pass to ride on buses ""all day to avoid using energy at home"". In his reply, the PM claimed credit for introducing the pass - which gives pensioners and others discounted travel - when he was mayor of the capital. Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said his reply showed ""just how out of touch this narcissistic prime minister is"". Boris Johnson was asked on ITV about an elderly woman who uses her London Freedom bus pass to stay on buses all day and avoid using energy that she can't afford at home. The prime minister said ""the 24 hour Freedom bus pass was something that I actually introduced"". Several people pointed out on social media that the passes for older people had existed for many years before he became Mayor of London. That's right but theFreedom Pass in London could not be used before 9:30am until Mr Johnson extended it to 24 hours a day, from January 2009,external. However in June 2020, as part of afunding agreement between TfL and the government, Older Person's Freedom Passes and 60+ cards were no longer valid between 4:30am and 9am on weekdays,external.

"Don't judge me, says girl, 12, with Tourette's","This video can not be played The tics Lucy-Marie started to develop when she was eight were, at first, a mystery to her ""Don't judge me, I can't make it stop,"" is the message Lucy-Marie has for everyone with assumptions about Tourette's syndrome. The tics the 12-year-old started to develop when she was eight were, at first, a mystery to her and her mother Toniann. But the involuntary movements, swearing and ""funny"" call-outs got more frequent. So she decided to write I Can't Make It Stop to help herself and others. Especially after she ""became a shell"" of her once-confident and diva-like self. Meeting the Queen when you've got Tourette's How a teen author became a Netflix star Call for more diverse heroes in children's stories ""Some people are rude about it and they'll tell me to shut up,"" Lucy-Marie said. ""It makes me feel very upset and feel like I don't want to go out of the house and stay locked up all the time."" But she has not let those feelings get in the way of her aim of educating people about the condition. The pieces of homework she got on documenting her experiences in her room have now been crafted into her first published book. ""I wanted to raise more awareness to the world and my class members about Tourette's. I give loads of credit to them because they were really supportive and helpful to me and my mum helped me with what to put where."" Interestingly, Lucy-Marie can only whistle when she has a tic Lucy-Marie said her drama teacher made her dream come true after ""cheekily"" asking her to publish her book. Toniann said Lucy-Marie ""gets all coy"" when talking about Clare Thomas, who ""worked really hard"" to illustrate and publish her book. ""Now it's published I'm very happy because most of my friends are very proud of me - it makes me feel happy."" In November 2019, Toniann thought Lucy-Marie hadcroup,externaluntil ""this cough noise"" disappeared. It was not until ""one day she woke up with a noise that never went away"" that Toniann realised she needed help. Lucy-Marie's mother said she felt ""helpless"" seeing her daughter change out of her ""calm and confident"" self when her tics started to get worse during lockdown. Lucy-Marie says she was anxious when her tics started to develop ""This noise came thick and fast to the point that she was choking when she was eating so she refused to eat and drink - from then onwards it escalated,"" she said. ""Now looking at Lucy you can see the difference in the tic as her persona changes, her voice changes, the tempo of her voice, she tends to screw herself up, twist herself around. ""When her Tourette's started she changed, it was like a completely different child. She became a shell of herself. ""She didn't want to go out of her room, talk to her friends - she panicked. We had no answers and no-one knew what to do because there is no clear pathway."" A condition characterised by involuntary sounds and movements, or tics Usually appears during childhood - six years old is the average age It is estimated that one school child in every 100 has it The cause is unknown but it can sometimes be diagnosed alongsideADHD,external, obsessive compulsive disorder or learning difficulties It is rarely harmful to someone's overall health but physical tics can be painful There is no cure but it can be managed with medicine and behavioural therapies Source:NHS,external Toniann says she still gets emotional even though she's read her daughter's book ""100 times"" Speaking onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Toniann said she was proud of her daughter: ""I've read the book a hundred times and every time I read it I choke up a little but more. ""It's hard to have it on paper to see exactly what she's gone through for the last two years and how much it's affected her. ""It's affected her negatively but also positively, it's given her the power to stand up for herself, the book is a step forward to help her do that."" Trying to find Lucy-Marie support was not easy. ""My GP was fantastic but there was no clear pathway of who to refer Lucy to,"" said Toniann. ""One GP may refer to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services), another may refer to a neurologist, but when you do get to those people there's still no clear guidance of how to treat Tourette's. ""There are lots of resources available in other countries but not in Wales - it's pot luck."" She is part of 10,000 others who have signed aSenedd petition,externalcalling for a ""proper, clear, clinical pathway and access to specialist provision and medical care for people with Tourette's Syndrome in Wales"". That petition, which closed in February, will now be considered for a debate. Toniann said she was ""immensely proud"" and wants her daughter to know this: ""We want you to live your life to the max - you are wonderful and you deserve to do wonderful things."" Lucy-Marie says she does not mean what she says when her tics cause her to have an outburst Dr Jeremy Stern, director ofTourettes Action,external, said the lack of medical services was a ""national problem"". ""Children's mental health services are extremely overstretched in what they can cope with,"" he added. ""They will often reject referrals to assess patients with ticks and sometimes patients are referred out of an area or region over long distances to even get a diagnosis."" He said: ""It's a condition really that isn't that rare, so it should be available where people live."" The Welsh government said: ""We are committed to ensuring people with neurodevelopmental conditions have access to the services and care they need. ""We are engaging with families of children with Tourette's which, along with the findings of a demand and capacity of neurodevelopmental services review will inform the development of a neurodevelopmental conditions strategic action plan to be published for consultation this summer.""

Energy firms ordered to explain direct debit hikes,"Some energy suppliers have been given a three-week deadline to explain accusations they have increased customers' direct debit payments by ""more than is necessary"". Jonathan Brearley, boss of the energy regulator Ofgem,recently saidthere were ""troubling signs"" of the tactic. He also expressed concern over customers being directed to inappropriate deals. Official reviews have now been launched. Mr Brearley had said in April that reviews were imminent, but the development emerged from an update published on Twitter by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Kwarteng said that some energy companies had been increasing direct debits beyond what was required. ""I can confirm Ofgem has today issued compliance reviews,"" Mr Kwarteng's tweet went on. ""The regulator will not hesitate to swiftly enforce compliance, including issuing substantial fines."" However, by reviewing the issue, Ofgem has yet to draw a firm conclusion on whether any rules have been broken. An Ofgem spokesperson said: ""Our top priority is to protect consumers and we recently wrote to suppliers to alert them that we are commissioning a series of market compliance reviews to ensure, amongst other things, that they are handling direct debits fairly, and that overall, they are held to higher standards for performance on customer service and protecting vulnerable customers."" A spokesman for Energy UK, which represents energy companies, said: ""Suppliers are required to set [direct debits] at a fair and reasonable level based on the customer's individual circumstances, taking into account factors like previous energy use or record with previous payments.

Sturgeon accused of 'lie' over ferry contract,"This video can not be played Jim McColl's claims are the latest in a war of words over the troubled ferries contract The former Ferguson shipyard owner has accused Nicola Sturgeon of lying when she said it would have shut without the contract to build two CalMac ferries. Jim McColl also disputed the first minister's claim that the contract had saved 400 jobs - because the yard had only employed 150 people at the time. Mr McColl has previously claimed the contract to build Glen Sannox and Hull 802 was awarded for political reasons. The ferries are now five years behind schedule and massively over budget. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr McColl was asked about comments made by the first minister on Monday when she said the yard would have closed and 400 people would not currently be employed at the yard if it had not been given the contract in 2015. Shipyard boss says ferry costs should not increase The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift The problem with CalMac's ageing ferries He said: ""That is a lie. At the time there were 150 employees, not 400. ""I think she was a bit rattled in the interview and she mixed it up with the statement that they made about saving the yard."" When it was suggested to Mr McColl that calling the first minister's statement a lie was ""very strong words"", he said: ""Well, it's not true"". He added: ""The yard had outstanding work. It was still working on the ferry Catriona which wasn't launched until 2016 and was delivered early and on budget. ""It also had additional construction work, fabrication work, so there was no danger of the yard going under at that time."" Jim McColl and Tom Docherty from CMAL both signed the ferry building contract Mr McColl also admitted he had made a mistake in a previous interview when he had claimed he had not signed the contract for the ferries. Documents bearing his signature were subsequently produced which showed this was not the case. Ms Sturgeon had told the same programme on Monday that the yard would ""almost certainly have closed and the 400 people who are currently employed there, earning a wage, supporting their families, would not be in that employment"". The first minister also said that the government had sought to protect jobs and shipbuilding on the Clyde ""at every point"", but admitted that delays to the ferries and increased costs were ""deeply regrettable"". She added: ""Commercial shipbuilding exists on the Clyde because of the decisions the government has taken"". Nicola Sturgeon joined Jim McColl at the yard when she announced it was the preferred bidder for the CalMac ferries in August 2015 Responding to Mr McColl's comments, a spokesman for the first minister said she had been ""clearly referring to the 400 people currently employed at the yard"". He added: ""Those 400 jobs would not currently exist if the Scottish government had not taken the action we did to save the yard - that is a fact."" Ferguson's - the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde - went into administration in August 2014 but was saved when then-First Minister Alex Salmond personally intervened. He persuaded Mr McColl - a billionaire businessman who was one of his economic advisers - to take over the yard just days before the Scottish independence referendum. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""Commercial shipbuilding exists on the Clyde because of the decisions the government has taken."" Ferguson's was announced as preferred bidder to build the two new ferries for state-owned ferry network CalMac a year later - despite being the most expensive of the six yards that bid for the contract. The signing of the Â£97m fixed-price contract was announced in October 2015 to applause on the opening day of the SNP conference in Aberdeen, with the first steel being cut a month later. But it only took a few weeks for the timetable for building the ferries to slip as costs soared - and the yard was eventually taken over by the government after again going into administration in 2019. The new boss of the yard, David Tydeman, said last week that the target was for both ferries to enter service next year - five years later than originally planned. He also said it was his intention to deliver both ships at a total cost of Â£206m - more than double the original Â£97m price tag. That figure is on top of a Â£45m loan previously given to the shipyard by the government. Three questions have dominated the most recent chapter of the ferries saga. And just when you think you're getting answers, more keep coming. The first was which minister was responsible for overriding the advice of the ferry procuring agency, CMAL? We sort of know the answer to that. The documentation can't be found or never existed, but responsibility falls somewhere between former minister Derek Mackay, Keith Brown who is now justice secretary, and Nicola Sturgeon, with responsibility for all Scottish government decisions. Second question: why was there no refund guarantee?  Such contracts normally have one, called a Builders Refund Guarantee (BRG). This is a promise of refund or compensation up to the value of the contract. It's usually a financial instrument, sometimes provided by a bank. And according to Mr McColl, it is often provided in other countries by a state investment bank. It is effectively a state subsidy to manufacturers. So if a shipyard or another manufacturer fails to deliver the goods, there's money back and/or compensation to the buyer - in this case, the Scottish government, or its agency. So here's what we now know, from Audit Scotland, the Scottish government and Jim McColl. Having taken over Ferguson shipyard in 2014, the following August, the company was given preferred bidder status for the building of two large ferries. The tender had made clear that a BRG, as normal, be required from the successful bidder. On 26 August 2015, as preferred bidder, Ferguson shipyard's management told CMAL it could not provide that funding. It is not so clear why this was not made clear at the bidding stage. Audit Scotland tells us that CMAL then advised that the procurement process should be re-started. Ministers disagreed, but which minister and why? That's where the paper trail runs cold. The next day, the shipyard was informed it was being confirmed as successful bidder, and four days later, Nicola Sturgeon went to the shipyard to announce it. We're told by the Scottish government that ""other mitigations"" were put in place, allowing for the guarantee to be avoided. One of these was a Â£25m bond with a finance company. Another was, according to Mr McColl on Radio Scotland, ""a parent company guarantee"". The parent company of Ferguson Marine, from 2014 to 2019, was Clyde Blowers Capital (CBC), the company owned and controlled by Mr McColl. According to Audit Scotland: ""CMAL believed that Clyde Blowers Capital would have met the guarantee requirements on Ferguson Marine's (the shipyard's) behalf. CBC reported however that it did not consider any involvement in providing a guarantee for FMEL."" So here are new questions: when compensation was due for a contract which had gone badly wrong, where was ""the parent company guarantee"" mentioned by the chairman of the parent company? And if it was worth anything, why was it not called upon? From Mr McColl's interview comes another tangent to this tale: could Ferguson shipyard have survived without this CMAL contract? The First Minister says 'no': the industrialist says she's ""lying"", and the contract was not necessary. That's strong language. Where they can probably agree is that we'll never know who is right. The third dominant question of recent weeks, since Audit Scotland reported on the ferries fiasco, is a more contemporary one, with lots of sub-questions: when are these ships going to be finished, for how much, and will they meet the specification for CMAL and for Cal-Mac ferries? Travellers to and from Arran, Skye, Uist and Harris are particularly eager to find out. Businessman McColl disputes shipyard closure claim.

Energy firms ordered to explain direct debit hikesSome companies have three weeks to respond to accusations they have set direct debits too high.BusinessComments,"Some energy suppliers have been given a three-week deadline to explain accusations they have increased customers' direct debit payments by ""more than is necessary"". Jonathan Brearley, boss of the energy regulator Ofgem,recently saidthere were ""troubling signs"" of the tactic. He also expressed concern over customers being directed to inappropriate deals. Official reviews have now been launched. Mr Brearley had said in April that reviews were imminent, but the development emerged from an update published on Twitter by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Kwarteng said that some energy companies had been increasing direct debits beyond what was required. ""I can confirm Ofgem has today issued compliance reviews,"" Mr Kwarteng's tweet went on. ""The regulator will not hesitate to swiftly enforce compliance, including issuing substantial fines."" However, by reviewing the issue, Ofgem has yet to draw a firm conclusion on whether any rules have been broken. An Ofgem spokesperson said: ""Our top priority is to protect consumers and we recently wrote to suppliers to alert them that we are commissioning a series of market compliance reviews to ensure, amongst other things, that they are handling direct debits fairly, and that overall, they are held to higher standards for performance on customer service and protecting vulnerable customers."" A spokesman for Energy UK, which represents energy companies, said: ""Suppliers are required to set [direct debits] at a fair and reasonable level based on the customer's individual circumstances, taking into account factors like previous energy use or record with previous payments. ""It is right that the regulator is looking to ensure that suppliers are complying with those requirements. Customers who do have concerns with the level of their direct debit payments should contact their supplier."" Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhad earlier acknowledged""there is more that we can do"" to help families struggling with rising fuel and energy bills.

22 of the hottest looks from the 2022 Met Gala,"Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson were among the A-listers in attendance at the Met Gala Kim Kardashian grabbed the headlines at Monday's Met Gala as she stepped into a dress which was last worn by Marilyn Monroe six decades ago. The reality star sported the crystal-embellished gown as she walked the red carpet with boyfriend Pete Davidson on what has become fashion's biggest night. The first Monday in May is one of the most important dates of the year for celebrities, designers, jewellery makers and tanning salons, and this year's Met Gala was no different. The event saw attendees take inspiration from the gilded age - a period of rapid US economic growth in the late 19th Century - as they dressed for this year's theme, In America: An Anthology of Fashion. Here are 22 of the best looks from the 2022 Met Gala red carpet. The entrepreneur and reality star wore a ruffled ivory ball gown from Off-White's fall/winter 2022 couture collection, the last from the late designer Virgil Abloh. But the icing on the four-tier cake was a white baseball cap, worn backwards, on top of a netted white veil - a look we hope to see a lot more of during this summer's wedding season. Alicia Keys is used to singing about her home city in songs like Empire State of Mind and Streets of New York, so it's only right that she starts dressing to match. Her shimmering black-and-silver Ralph Lauren gown saw a silhouette of the entire NY city skyline displayed on its black cape. Keys walked the red carpet with music producer husband Swizz Beatz. Before she arrived at the Met Gala, Nicki Minaj was sadly involved in an explosion at an ink factory, which analysts fear could prompt a worldwide shortage of ballpoint pens. In actual fact, the rapper's black feathered ballgown was designed by Burberry's Ricardo Tisci and topped off with a black baseball cap while her entire face and body were covered in circular jewels. The Power of the Dog star made his Met Gala debut, telling reporters the event ""is a place where people can go with zero boundaries and judgements on how they want to express themselves through fashion"". He wore a modern Bottega Veneta ensemble which utilised the colours of the American flag - with red opera gloves, blue jeans and a white pinstripe shirt. Billie Eilish has become one of the most reliably best-dressed celebrities you can find on a red carpet - quite a change from the (equally awesome) baggy hoodies which formed her staple look when she started out as a singer. At this year's gala, the Oscar-winning musician opted for a pale green and cream Gucci corset gown, which harked back to some of the fashions that were popular in the gilded age of the late 1800s. While most people who watched House of Gucci were trying to figure out what accent Jared Leto was aiming for, attendees at the Met Gala were simply trying to figure out which one was Jared Leto. The actor (right) walked the red carpet with his close friend Alessandro Michele, the creative director of Gucci. Asked how to define their look, they answered simply: ""Double trouble."" The pair wore cream-coloured tuxedos embellished with floral embroidery and red satin bow ties. The duo previously matched their outfits at the 2018 Met Gala, wearing coordinating suits. The following year, Leto didn't even need a companion to match with - he walked the red carpet carrying a wax replica of his own head. Normally, our favourite train is the 11:30 London Kings Cross to Edinburgh (thanks to those stunning east coast views), but at the Met Gala, we'd have to opt for model Taylor Marie Hill. The train on her gorgeous royal blue dress came complete with intricate floral embroidery. And just like that, Sarah Jessica Parker had her picture taken with her headpiece beautifully framed in the centre of the archway behind her (thank you to this photographer). Parker worked with Christopher John Rogers on a striking, thoughtful ensemble. The gown paid homage to Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley, who made history as the first black female fashion designer to work in the White House (becoming the official dressmaker to first lady Mary Todd Lincoln). Rogers used a particular design that Keckley had made in the 1860s as inspiration for Parker's black and white gingham-plaid gown. ""She was a smaller designer, and someone that people don't really talk about,"" he explained. ""The idea was to highlight the dichotomy between the extravagant, over-the-top proportions of the time period, and the disparity that was happening in America at the time."" If you haven't heard of Austin Butler, you almost certainly will in the next two months. He plays Elvis Presley in the forthcoming big-screen biopic, which also stars Tom Hanks as the legendary singer's manager Colonel Tom Parker. We love a couple debut at the Met Gala, and they don't come much more glamorous than Butler and his girlfriend Kaia Gerber. It's been rumoured the actor and model have been dating since 2021. Gerber wore an Alexander McQueen gown, Butler wore Prada. They walked the red carpet separately, but then united at the top of the stairs and shared a kiss, sending social media into overdrive. ...because only then can the Tick Tick... Boom! star's sheer black gown be fully appreciated. Hudgens was hosting Vogue's coverage of the Met Gala, but her see-through Moschino ball gown designed by Jeremy Scott meant she was as well dressed as any of the guests she was interviewing. The dress had a long train which was made of lace, along with embroidery on the bodice, puff sleeves and a high neckline. Game of Thrones star Turner proudly showed off her baby bump on the red carpet while wearing a black maxi dress with diamond-shaped embellishments. Her husband, singer Joe Jonas, wore a sharp white morning coat. Both outfits were designed by Louis Vuitton. The couple are expecting their second child, two years after they welcomed daughter Willa. We always award extra points to male celebrities who turn up to events wearing anything other than boring black, grey or navy suits. So actor Sebastian Stan, who recently starred as Tommy Lee in the Disney+ series Pam and Tommy, is now firmly in our good books. He rightly disregarded the dress code by wearing neon pink from head to toe, with an overcoat designed by Valentino. Rapper Kid Cudi, meanwhile, wore a stunning Kenzo suit designed by his friend Nigo, the company's newly-appointed creative director. Stefani, who married singer Blake Shelton last year, sported neon nails to match her dress The singer was possibly taking inspiration from Beyonce, who recently performed at the Oscars on a tennis court, with a swarm of dancers all dressed in neon yellow (for the tennis-themed film King Richard). ""Vera [Wang, the designer] called me to see if I wanted to come and be her date and of course I wanted to,""Stefani explained.,external""The thing is, she did my wedding dress, I got married this year so I just felt like it was appropriate that I come to the ball and celebrate that... and all of the sudden we're in neon!"" While we're here - shout out to the man in this picture, and indeed the many dress fluffers and train carriers at the Met Gala - whose job is to keep the dresses looking on point as the celebs walk into the event. People often say celebrities can't fit their own egos through the door, but in SZA's case the much bigger problem is her huge solid black hat. The Grammy-winning singer was styled by Kollin Carter and also wore a bright pink dress with a pair of elbow-length gloves and a pendant necklace. The TikTok star showed hers in a custom cream and white Louis Vuitton outfit. The 20-year-old, who also has her own coffee company with products such as the ""sleepy sloth decaf blend"", is a newly-appointed ambassador for Cartier - which explains the impressive jewels she accessorised with. While most attendees dressed flamboyantly, Riz Ahmed kept things characteristically political by arriving as a chic labourer. Exposing the class disparity that existed during the era, the actor said: ""This is an homage to the immigrant workers who kept the Gilded Age golden."" Actress Carey Mulligan, who walked the red carpet with husband Marcus Mumford, wore a black and gold column gown bedecked with 79,000 gold sequins and 38,000 crystals. The dress reportedly took nearly 5,000 hours to make and was designed by Schiaparelli's creative director, Daniel Roseberry, who said seeing the embroidery in the flesh after months of work ""felt like Christmas morning"". It's perhaps no coincidence that the gorgeous dresses worn by singer Teyana Taylor and model Winnie Harlow were both designed by Iris van Herpen, as the two outfits were each topped off with eye-catching headpieces. Harlow told Vogue on the red carpet the designer ""creates masterpieces when it comes to all of her looks down to the headpiece, everything, the detail"". Sadly, we weren't invited to Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz's wedding last month - but luckily Hello! magazine were, which helped make it one of the most talked-about events of the year so far. For their first public appearance since the wedding, the couple both wore Valentino - Brooklyn in a smart white suit, Nicola in a vivid pink dress. NFL star Odell Beckham Jr (no relation to Booklyn), was among the men accessorising their outfits with some stunning jewellery. His neck chains and rings complemented a beautiful green gown. Meanwhile, actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen's black satin tuxedo by Thom Browne was topped off with gold-and-black floral embellishments on the jacket. Stormzy was representing the UK at his first ever Met Gala, telling reporters he was ""nervous"" about his red carpet debut. The rapper wore an all-white Burberry three-piece wool suit with satin lapels and a matching white cape, designed by Riccardo Tisci - a departure from his usual look. ""Usually I wear all black a lot of the timeâ¦ so it's nice to shine today,""he said.,external Lizzo's coat took 22,000 hours to make, while the rare gold flute she brought as an accessory costs $55,000 to buy, the singertold Variety.,external Her hand-embroidered gold and black coat and black gown were designed by Thom Browne, which she accessorised with said flute and a gold choker necklace by Lorraine West. We can surely all agree that there isn't enough flute in pop music these days - something the singer put right with several spontaneous performances on the red carpet. Kim might have had Marilyn Monroe's dress, but next year we're going to need her to bring a clarinet.

harder for me to help her access the healthcare she deserves. I feel despair,
anger, desperation, and the motivation to fight harder than ever.""  Read more about Maleeha, and the battle over abortion in the US Supreme Court police officers setting up barricades on Tuesday Police in Washington DC have reportedly activated a number of ""civil disturbance units"" ahead of protests that may take place in the city following the of the draft Supreme Court decision. A police memoshared online by local media,externalreported that on-duty or off-duty members of these units are being called to assist ""due to the potential for First Amendment activity"" in the city, referring to the constitutionally-enshrined right to free speech and peaceful assembly. The specialised units have been activated until Sunday, 8 May, with officers compensated for working overtime or outside of their regular hours. Shortly after the story of the leak broke, officers from the US Supreme Court Police set up barricades near the Supreme Court building. Will GrantReporting from Mexico City While the
emphasis in the US is increasingly on restricting access to abortions, in the
neighbour to the south, Mexico, all the legal traffic is in the opposite
direction.  At the end of last year, the Mexican Supreme Court struck down an
abortion law in the northern state of Coahuila, which in essence decriminalised
it across the country.  It still faces
legal challenges - not least from powerful Catholic and evangelical groups
with backing in parliament. However, pro-choice advocates are cautiously optimistic about the future.  Shortly after the
decision in Mexico, women's reproductive health campaigners in
Coahuila told me it was just a matter of time before they expected to see
American women travelling south for legal abortions they could no longer
receive at home.  They would offer their assistance to anyone, whether from
Mexico or the US, they added.  However,
the irony was not lost on them: the last time American women came south in significant
numbers to seek an abortion was in
the days beforeRoe Vs Wade.  One key hope
among those calling for the decriminalisation of abortions in
Mexico is that legislation will also tackle dangerous backstreet
abortions and unscrupulous, unlicensed pharmacies giving out abortion
pills of dubious origin.  So that anyone who seeks an abortion in the country - wherever they have come from - can be sure it is legal and safe. Nomia IqbalReporting from Miami, Florida Alex
Franzblau, 19 and Kaya Ells, 28 are at a pro-choice protest in Miami.  They say the Supreme Court ruling has
terrified them - but they also feel frustrated with how President Biden and his
party are handling it.  Alex says: ""This is occurring
during a Democratic president, a Democratic Congress, and some of the partyâs
politicians seem a bit stagnant or incapable on the face of this oncoming,
very active,
very militant right wing threat.""  Kaya says: ""Democrats arenât
going to codify this for a long time, like voting rights. I have very low expectations of
them.""  When I put this to Nikki Fried - who is running for the governership here, and is speaking to protesters - she says Democrats need to get tough.  âYes! Thereâs so many things
falling into the cracks in Washington DC, not just womenâs rights. And if this
isnât a wake up call to the Democrats in Congress and the Senate I donât know
what is."" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said ""the right to choose is a woman's right and a woman's right alone"". In a tweet following the leak of a US Supreme Court draft opinion, Trudeau said that ""every woman in Canada has a right to a safe and legal abortion"". ""We'll never back down from protecting and promoting women's rights in Canada and around the world,"" he added. Polling released,externalin 2020 found that 71% of Canadians believe women should have access to abortions, regardless of the reason, and compared to 26% who believe that abortion should only be legal in certain circumstances. Only 4% of Canadians believe that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances. A morerecent poll,externalof Americans released in May 2021 found that 59% of Americans believe that abortions should be legal in most or all cases, compared with 39% who think they should be mostly illegal.

Sarah SmithNorth America Editor, reporting from the Supreme Court in Washington DC A small knot of anti-abortion campaigners outside the
Supreme Court this afternoon are vastly outnumbered by pro-choice activists.  Banners declaring âMy Body My Choiceâ and âabortion
is a human right"" are being waved in support of a parade of speakers
who are discussing how they can work to maintain abortion rights in the
US.  Itâs time to codify abortion in federal law, they are demanding. And they are cheering on those promising financial support for women who have to
travel out of their home states for an abortion - insisting this
issue will galavanise liberal voters across the country.  For all the chants and cheers, almost everyone says
they felt devastated when they read online the leaked opinion from the Supreme
Court.  There is real passion and anger, which spilled over into a few scuffles
last night.  There are no confrontations today, with only a few people holding
âprotection at conception bannersâ and âdonât kill humans"" signs.  They are
giving numerous interviews to TV crews from around the world, explaining why they believe women's rights donât extend to terminating
pregnancies - while calling for increased support for women with unplanned pregnancies so
they can keep their children. Nomia IqbalReporting from Miami, Florida Florida is imposing a new anti-abortion law, similar to the Mississippi law that the US Supreme Court is looking at.  From 1 July, it will not be
possible to get the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy - the stateâs very
conservative Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill in April.  Dozens of people have come to protest
outside Freedom Tower in Miami to protest against the Supreme Court leaked draft ruling - but a lone protester
stands amongst the pro-choice activists.  Amanda Garret, 27, is from Miami
and says she rushed here.  âThis [the pro-choice protest] is not the view of
Floridians - we want to ban abortion. I believe itâs murder and there should be
no exceptions. Babies' lives matter.  âI donât necessarily feel I am
alone in general - however the support to come out here is low because a lot of
people donât want to deal with the backlash.â If Roe v Wade is overturned, a range of anti-abortion legislation is expected in large swathes of the country. Without Roe, abortion access is expected to be cut off in up to 26 states - home to roughly 36 million women of reproductive age. But some states are moving in the opposite direction, working to become abortion ""sanctuaries"" and offer reproductive health services banned elsewhere. Last year, California clinics and their allies in the state legislature unveiled a plan to help those seeking reproductive care, including possibly paying for travel, accommodation and procedures for people from other states. But while, in theory, American women will be able to travel to abortion-friendly states, logistically it may prove impossible. Women seeking abortions are disproportionately lower-income, young and already have children. Millions may not be in a position to take a cross-country trip to seek care. On Monday, Amazon said it was offeringup to $4,000 in expensesfor staff who needed out-of-town care - including abortion. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Stacy Shaw, 39, a lawyer in Kansas City, tells the BBC that she supports the right of women to choose. âPersonally, I donât believe in abortion, but I think people should have a right to choose. Women should have autonomy over their own bodies, and I thought that legislating abortion was relegated to the past,"" she says. ""People want to regulate abortion, but they want to de-fund schools. Here in Missouri, our schools are failing. If you want to be pro-life, then you need to look at life after a child is born.â HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra on 27 April US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra says laws restricting access to abortion services are ""dangerous"". In a statement posted to the HHS website, Becerra said that ""patients make their own decisions about their bodies"". ""That's their right,"" he added. ""I strongly believe in protecting and promoting access to health care - that includes sexual and reproductive health care, and that includes safe and legal abortion care."" Additionally, Becerra said that ""laws we have seen coming out of states that deny care are dangerous"". Good afternoon from Washington DC. It's been a huge day in the United States, following the leak of a draft ruling from the Supreme Court. So if you're just joining us, or need a quick refresher, here's a look back the latest:  Laura TrevelyanReporting from the Supreme Court ""We are the majority,"" came the anguished cry from a woman speaking
to pro-choice supporters outside the US Supreme Court this afternoon. And itâs true that opinion polling suggests a
majority of Americans support a womanâs right to an abortion. But now the
leaked draft opinion by Justice Alito suggests six conservative justices could be on
the brink of overturning Roe v Wade, all because the balance of the court
tipped during Donald Trump's presidency. Alexandra, a pro-choice college student from
American University who rushed here this morning to make her voice heard,
remembers the confirmation hearings of Justice Kavanaugh as a pivotal moment. Despite the ""Me Too"" movement, despite the
allegations of sexual assault against him, he was confirmed, recalls Alexandra
- and now ""it feels like my generation of women are about to lose the right to
control their own bodies"". Kim, a retired academic who taught womenâs
history, also came to the Supreme Court to express her dismay at the potential
ruling. ""There
is going to be a right to birth when thereâs no right to healthcare or childcare?"" Kim asked in disbelief. ""Iâm not surprised this court is going to do
this, but what did it mean in those confirmation hearings when those
justices said they respected precedent?"" Angelica CasasReporting from San Antonio, Texas Catherine Nix, of the San Antonio Coalition for Life, has lost count of the number of times she has prayed outside a Texas clinic that offers abortions. It's probably in the thousands. Rain or shine, alone or with company, she makes almost daily visits to the local Planned Parenthood, one of the largest abortion services providers in the country. She stands on the sidewalk trying to get the attention of patients arriving, to offer them other pregnancy options. Today is no different. Even if the Supreme Court does overturn Roe v Wade, Nix says nothing changes for the work she and other anti-abortion advocates are doing. âThere will still be people with unexpected pregnancies,â Nix said. âWhether abortion is legal or illegal, it will still be considered by those people.â In Texas, where abortion restrictions have intensified in the last year, many have been forced to travel out of the state for care. Nix says others in states with complete abortion bans will only do the same. As she stood on the sidewalk today, she was confronted by an employee of the clinic who walked away with one of her signs and said he would call the police. Nix fears that if and when the Supreme Court decision is finally made, the confrontations will be worse. Still, âwe are always going to be hereâ. âOur job is to protect all innocent human life. Weâre very hopeful, but weâre not rejoicing yet.â Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in 2021 More than 16 years after his confirmation hearing, US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito now stands at the centre of the debate regarding the future of Roe v Wade, the case that legalised abortion in the US in 1973. In a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion, Alito, 72, wrote that ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start"" and ""must be overruled"". Prior to being named to the highest US court, Alito - once considered among the most conservative justices - was a federal appeals court judge. He had been appointed to that position in 1990 by President George HW Bush. A New Jersey native and graduate of Princeton University, he'd also been the US Attorney for District of New Jersey and served eight years as a signals officer in the US Army Reserve. In 2005, Alito was nominated to the Supreme Court by George W Bush, who referred to him as ""scholarly, fair-minded and principled"". During his 2006 confirmation hearing, Alito said that he believed that previous legal challenges to Roe v Wade had ""strengthened"" the 1973 landmark case's value as precedent. He also said that when a ""decision is challenged and it is reaffirmed, that strengthens its value as 'stare decisis'"" - a legal principle that obligates courts to take into account past cases. However, Alito said that, at the time, the abortion issue was involved in litigation at ""all levels"" and that the Supreme Court ""should be insulated from public opinion"". ""They should do what the law requires in all instances,"" he said. ""That's why members of the judiciary are not elected."" Find out more about all nine justices, and the incoming Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson here.  Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Kim Kriebel and her dog, Duke Kim Kriebel, 47, a social worker, pictured here in Montgomery
County, Pennsylvania, told the BBC that pregnant women need more than a change
in laws. âI do believe that life begins at conception,"" she said. ""But itâs not enough
to make a law or a rule because that doesnât change anything. Sometimes, when
someone gets pregnant, thereâs like a panic, like: âhow am I going to deal with
this?â"" ""My aunt runs a
pregnancy-resource centre, and they collect cribs and bassinets and other
things that mom might need if they donât have any money. ""When thereâs support
like that, women who are pregnant can work things out.â Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Never in US history has a draft Supreme Court opinion been leaked to the
public. The court traditionally operates like Mt Olympus, with opinions handed
down from high and the inner workings â the judicial horse-trading, debating
and cajoling necessary to reach a majority â all taking place in cloistered
chambers. It is a practice that speaks to the courtâs unrivaled power to interpret,
uphold or strike down any law Congress passes and establish or dismantle
individual rights at the stroke of a pen. It is a power that was assumed by the
court itself in the early 1800s â and one that is inherently undemocratic. The
power has survived, and been respected, for as long as it has in part because
protections and procedures that courtâs champions have meticulously crafted
over the centuries . Only the nine judges and their handful of clerks â law school graduates
selected for their achievements and intellect â are privy to the machinations
of the Supreme Courtâs judicial process. Initial views are expressed in a
non-binding vote shortly after a case is presented to the court, draft majority
and dissenting opinions are circulated and changes are made. There are reports
and accounts â from former justices and those familiar with the process â of
how draft opinions can sometimes bear little resemblance to the final ruling of
the court. The leak of Mr Alitoâs draft majority opinion - tearing up Roe v Wade - short-circuits that process and could gravely wound
the Supreme Court as an institution, sowing distrust among the justices and
their clerks and fully exposing the judiciary to the sometimes harsh influence
of American politics. Accusations and conspiracy theories are already flying â that the leaker
was a liberal making a last-ditch effort to prevent Roeâs repeal, a
conservative concerned that the sweeping Alito opinion was in danger of being
discarded, or a moderate who wants to make a final opinion
paring back abortion protections seem less extreme. Chief Justice John Roberts called the leak a âbetrayal
of the confidence of the courtâ and a âsingular and egregious breachâ of trust. He ordered an investigation into the origins of the leak â but the damage has
been done. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Here's a quick look back at the day:  Want to know more?  Our writers today were Holly Honderich, Bernd Debusmann, and Jessica Murphy. The editor was Owen Amos. The governors of 17 US states and territories including Wisconsin, New York, California and New Jersey have penned a letter urging Congress to codify abortion rights and ensure  Americans ""have meaningful access"" to reproductive healthcare services. In the letter, the governors say that reproductive healthcare decisions should be made by patients and healthcare providers, and ""not by politicians"". The governors are calling on the Senate to pass the Women's Health Protection Act, a piece of legislation passed by the House of Representatives in September 2021. The letter added that the consequences of overturning Roe v. Wade ""cannot be overstated"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Now, Maleeha Aziz, a community organiser for the pro-choice Texas Equal Access Fund, tells the BBC of her ""shock and horror"" over the leaked decision.  ""Last
night as I was reading through the very extreme and radical leaked draft, I

worst-case scenario for a while now.  ""It hits you differently when you read
through the language in the draft, though. As someone who has had two abortions

will be forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term due to a lack of funds,
resources, and access.  ""As a mother of a daughter, I feel sick and scared that

selected for their achievements and intellect â are privy to the machinations
of the Supreme Courtâs judicial process. Initial views are expressed in a
non-binding vote shortly after a case is presented to the court, draft majority
and dissenting opinions are circulated and changes are made. There are reports
and accounts â from former justices and those familiar with the process â of
how draft opinions can sometimes bear little resemblance to the final ruling of
the court. The leak of Mr Alitoâs draft majority opinion - tearing up Roe v Wade - short-circuits that process and could gravely wound
the Supreme Court as an institution, sowing distrust among the justices and
their clerks and fully exposing the judiciary to the sometimes harsh influence
of American politics. Accusations and conspiracy theories are already flying â that the leaker
was a liberal making a last-ditch effort to prevent Roeâs repeal, a
conservative concerned that the sweeping Alito opinion was in danger of being
discarded, or a moderate who wants to make a final opinion
paring back abortion protections seem less extreme. Chief Justice John Roberts called the leak a âbetrayal
of the confidence of the courtâ and a âsingular and egregious breachâ of trust. He ordered an investigation into the origins of the leak â but the damage has
been done. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Tories are mud-slinging over Covid event - Starmer,"Sir Keir Starmer has accused the Conservatives of ""mud-slinging"" after some of the party's MPs suggested he may have broken Covid rules. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said she would ""encourage"" Durham police to investigate an event at which the Labour leader was seen drinking a beer. Sir Keir said police had investigated and concluded ""no rules were broken"". He said Conservatives should focus on helping people with their energy bills. Rayner was at lockdown event with Starmer How many fines have there been over Partygate? The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held Earlier this year, Durham police cleared Sir Keir of breaking lockdown laws when he attended an event on 30 April 2021 at the office of a Durham MP. Labour has previously said the rules were not broken, because there was an exemption for events held for ""work purposes"". Last month, Conservative MP Richard Holden wrote to the police asking them to review their decision, after the Met Police fined Prime Minister Boris Johnson for breaking lockdown laws by attending a party in No 10 in June 2020. He argued the rules ""should apply equally"" to both men. Questioned on the Today programme, the Labour leader repeatedly avoided saying whether he had been contacted by Durham police, since Mr Holden's letter However, the party later confirmed the police had not been in touch. Setting out his participation in the event, Sir Keir said: ""We were working, we stopped for food, no party, no rules were broken; I don't know what I can add to that. ""This is simply being whipped up as mud-slinging by the Tories."" Minister Ms Trevelyan said she backed a further police investigation telling Sky News: ""I understand that there is some work ongoing and I would absolutely encourage them to look at it."" Last month, Mr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined by the police for attending a birthday gathering for the PM in Downing Street. The fines were part of the Met Police's investigation into 12 gatherings across government buildings during the coronavirus lockdowns. The police have previously said at least 50 fines have been issued in relation to the investigation - but that they would not be announcing further fines in the run-up to the local election. Speaking to Good Morning Britain on ITV, Mr Johnson said he had not received another fine but had ""no idea"" if more would come.

Food apps and online gaming driving obesity - WHO,"Meal delivery apps are changing the way we buy and eat food, the report says How children use meal-delivery apps and the rising popularity of online gaming could be driving obesity across Europe, the World Health Organization has said. No European country is on track to stop obesity rising by 2025, the WHO says. Nearly 60% of adults and a third of children are overweight or obese - and the Covid pandemic has made that worse. It suggests restricting the marketing of unhealthy foods to children, cutting the cost of healthy food and encouraging all ages to exercise more. The WHO European Regional Obesity Report 2022,externalsays rates of overweight and obesity have reached ""epidemic proportions"", with only the Americas having a higher level of obese adults than Europe. It estimates the problem is causing 1.2 million deaths every year in Europe - 13% of all deaths - and at least 200,000 new cases of cancer annually. Carrying too much body fat increases the risk of many diseases, including 13 types of cancer, type-2 diabetes, heart problems and lung conditions. It is also the main cause of disability, the report says. Obesity is ""a complex disease"" and much more than the combination of an unhealthy diet and a lack of physical activity, it points out. ""Obesity knows no borders,"" said Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe. ""The countries in our region are incredibly diverse but every one is challenged to some degree."" But ""we can change the trajectory of obesity in the region"" by developing strong health systems, he said. Europe's highly digitalised food environments affect what, when and how people eat and should be monitored more closely, the report says. Meal-delivery apps, for example, play a significant role in increasing consumption of high-fat and high-sugar food and drinks. UK research suggests eating a takeaway meal means consuming 200 more calories per day, on average, than food prepared at home. Over the course of a week, this could mean a child eating the equivalent of an extra day's worth of calories. Keep your waistline to less than half your height Pandemic sees big rise in obese children Living with obesity: Hard-wired to store fat But the report, presented at the European Congress on Obesity, also suggests online food and meal delivery systems can be used in a positive way to improve diets, access to healthy food and wellbeing. Online gaming, which is hugely popular among children, has also been linked to poorer diet, unhealthy behaviour and more time sitting rather than being active. But again, the WHO says this technology could be harnessed to improve the physical and mental health of young people. In the European region, the UK: has the third highest proportion of obese adults, behind Malta and Turkey has the fourth highest proportion of overweight or obese adults, behind Israel, Malta and Turkey Across Europe, being overweight or obese affects: 8% of under-fives 29% of five-nine-year-olds 25% of 10-19-year-olds In the UK, some policies have been introduced to tackle obesity. They includelarge restaurants and cafes being required by law to show calorie information, with a similar system being considered for Scotland. In the autumn in England, 'buy one, get one free' (BOGOF) promotions will start to be phased out after research showed they encouraged people to buy 20% more food than they needed. There is alsoa plan to ban TV adverts for food high in sugar, salt and fat before 9pmacross the UK. Calories now appear on menus in large restaurants Keep your waistline to less than half your height Pandemic sees big rise in obese children Living with obesity: Hard-wired to store fat The WHO European Regional Obesity Report 2022 Death toll rises as governor confirms hydrants issue 'impaired' LA wildfires fight 'I have nothing to go back to' - reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Reeves pledges to 'make UK better off' on China visit LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"22 of the hottest looks from the 2022 Met GalaGwen Stefani, Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj and many more walked the red carpet at the New York event.","Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson were among the A-listers in attendance at the Met Gala Kim Kardashian grabbed the headlines at Monday's Met Gala as she stepped into a dress which was last worn by Marilyn Monroe six decades ago. The reality star sported the crystal-embellished gown as she walked the red carpet with boyfriend Pete Davidson on what has become fashion's biggest night. The first Monday in May is one of the most important dates of the year for celebrities, designers, jewellery makers and tanning salons, and this year's Met Gala was no different. The event saw attendees take inspiration from the gilded age - a period of rapid US economic growth in the late 19th Century - as they dressed for this year's theme, In America: An Anthology of Fashion. Here are 22 of the best looks from the 2022 Met Gala red carpet. The entrepreneur and reality star wore a ruffled ivory ball gown from Off-White's fall/winter 2022 couture collection, the last from the late designer Virgil Abloh. But the icing on the four-tier cake was a white baseball cap, worn backwards, on top of a netted white veil - a look we hope to see a lot more of during this summer's wedding season. Alicia Keys is used to singing about her home city in songs like Empire State of Mind and Streets of New York, so it's only right that she starts dressing to match. Her shimmering black-and-silver Ralph Lauren gown saw a silhouette of the entire NY city skyline displayed on its black cape. Keys walked the red carpet with music producer husband Swizz Beatz. Before she arrived at the Met Gala, Nicki Minaj was sadly involved in an explosion at an ink factory, which analysts fear could prompt a worldwide shortage of ballpoint pens. In actual fact, the rapper's black feathered ballgown was designed by Burberry's Ricardo Tisci and topped off with a black baseball cap while her entire face and body were covered in circular jewels. The Power of the Dog star made his Met Gala debut, telling reporters the event ""is a place where people can go with zero boundaries and judgements on how they want to express themselves through fashion"". He wore a modern Bottega Veneta ensemble which utilised the colours of the American flag - with red opera gloves, blue jeans and a white pinstripe shirt. Billie Eilish has become one of the most reliably best-dressed celebrities you can find on a red carpet - quite a change from the (equally awesome) baggy hoodies which formed her staple look when she started out as a singer. At this year's gala, the Oscar-winning musician opted for a pale green and cream Gucci corset gown, which harked back to some of the fashions that were popular in the gilded age of the late 1800s. While most people who watched House of Gucci were trying to figure out what accent Jared Leto was aiming for, attendees at the Met Gala were simply trying to figure out which one was Jared Leto. The actor (right) walked the red carpet with his close friend Alessandro Michele, the creative director of Gucci. Asked how to define their look, they answered simply: ""Double trouble."" The pair wore cream-coloured tuxedos embellished with floral embroidery and red satin bow ties. The duo previously matched their outfits at the 2018 Met Gala, wearing coordinating suits. The following year, Leto didn't even need a companion to match with - he walked the red carpet carrying a wax replica of his own head. Normally, our favourite train is the 11:30 London Kings Cross to Edinburgh (thanks to those stunning east coast views), but at the Met Gala, we'd have to opt for model Taylor Marie Hill. The train on her gorgeous royal blue dress came complete with intricate floral embroidery. And just like that, Sarah Jessica Parker had her picture taken with her headpiece beautifully framed in the centre of the archway behind her (thank you to this photographer). Parker worked with Christopher John Rogers on a striking, thoughtful ensemble. The gown paid homage to Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley, who made history as the first black female fashion designer to work in the White House (becoming the official dressmaker to first lady Mary Todd Lincoln). Rogers used a particular design that Keckley had made in the 1860s as inspiration for Parker's black and white gingham-plaid gown. ""She was a smaller designer, and someone that people don't really talk about,"" he explained. ""The idea was to highlight the dichotomy between the extravagant, over-the-top proportions of the time period, and the disparity that was happening in America at the time."" If you haven't heard of Austin Butler, you almost certainly will in the next two months. He plays Elvis Presley in the forthcoming big-screen biopic, which also stars Tom Hanks as the legendary singer's manager Colonel Tom Parker. We love a couple debut at the Met Gala, and they don't come much more glamorous than Butler and his girlfriend Kaia Gerber. It's been rumoured the actor and model have been dating since 2021. Gerber wore an Alexander McQueen gown, Butler wore Prada. They walked the red carpet separately, but then united at the top of the stairs and shared a kiss, sending social media into overdrive. ...because only then can the Tick Tick... Boom! star's sheer black gown be fully appreciated. Hudgens was hosting Vogue's coverage of the Met Gala, but her see-through Moschino ball gown designed by Jeremy Scott meant she was as well dressed as any of the guests she was interviewing. The dress had a long train which was made of lace, along with embroidery on the bodice, puff sleeves and a high neckline. Game of Thrones star Turner proudly showed off her baby bump on the red carpet while wearing a black maxi dress with diamond-shaped embellishments. Her husband, singer Joe Jonas, wore a sharp white morning coat. Both outfits were designed by Louis Vuitton. The couple are expecting their second child, two years after they welcomed daughter Willa. We always award extra points to male celebrities who turn up to events wearing anything other than boring black, grey or navy suits. So actor Sebastian Stan, who recently starred as Tommy Lee in the Disney+ series Pam and Tommy, is now firmly in our good books. He rightly disregarded the dress code by wearing neon pink from head to toe, with an overcoat designed by Valentino. Rapper Kid Cudi, meanwhile, wore a stunning Kenzo suit designed by his friend Nigo, the company's newly-appointed creative director. Stefani, who married singer Blake Shelton last year, sported neon nails to match her dress The singer was possibly taking inspiration from Beyonce, who recently performed at the Oscars on a tennis court, with a swarm of dancers all dressed in neon yellow (for the tennis-themed film King Richard). ""Vera [Wang, the designer] called me to see if I wanted to come and be her date and of course I wanted to,""Stefani explained.,external""The thing is, she did my wedding dress, I got married this year so I just felt like it was appropriate that I come to the ball and celebrate that... and all of the sudden we're in neon!"" While we're here - shout out to the man in this picture, and indeed the many dress fluffers and train carriers at the Met Gala - whose job is to keep the dresses looking on point as the celebs walk into the event. People often say celebrities can't fit their own egos through the door, but in SZA's case the much bigger problem is her huge solid black hat. The Grammy-winning singer was styled by Kollin Carter and also wore a bright pink dress with a pair of elbow-length gloves and a pendant necklace. The TikTok star showed hers in a custom cream and white Louis Vuitton outfit. The 20-year-old, who also has her own coffee company with products such as the ""sleepy sloth decaf blend"", is a newly-appointed ambassador for Cartier - which explains the impressive jewels she accessorised with. While most attendees dressed flamboyantly, Riz Ahmed kept things characteristically political by arriving as a chic labourer. Exposing the class disparity that existed during the era, the actor said: ""This is an homage to the immigrant workers who kept the Gilded Age golden."" Actress Carey Mulligan, who walked the red carpet with husband Marcus Mumford, wore a black and gold column gown bedecked with 79,000 gold sequins and 38,000 crystals. The dress reportedly took nearly 5,000 hours to make and was designed by Schiaparelli's creative director, Daniel Roseberry, who said seeing the embroidery in the flesh after months of work ""felt like Christmas morning"". It's perhaps no coincidence that the gorgeous dresses worn by singer Teyana Taylor and model Winnie Harlow were both designed by Iris van Herpen, as the two outfits were each topped off with eye-catching headpieces. Harlow told Vogue on the red carpet the designer ""creates masterpieces when it comes to all of her looks down to the headpiece, everything, the detail"". Sadly, we weren't invited to Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz's wedding last month - but luckily Hello! magazine were, which helped make it one of the most talked-about events of the year so far. For their first public appearance since the wedding, the couple both wore Valentino - Brooklyn in a smart white suit, Nicola in a vivid pink dress. NFL star Odell Beckham Jr (no relation to Booklyn), was among the men accessorising their outfits with some stunning jewellery. His neck chains and rings complemented a beautiful green gown. Meanwhile, actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen's black satin tuxedo by Thom Browne was topped off with gold-and-black floral embellishments on the jacket. Stormzy was representing the UK at his first ever Met Gala, telling reporters he was ""nervous"" about his red carpet debut. The rapper wore an all-white Burberry three-piece wool suit with satin lapels and a matching white cape, designed by Riccardo Tisci - a departure from his usual look. ""Usually I wear all black a lot of the timeâ¦ so it's nice to shine today,""he said.,external Lizzo's coat took 22,000 hours to make, while the rare gold flute she brought as an accessory costs $55,000 to buy, the singertold Variety.,external Her hand-embroidered gold and black coat and black gown were designed by Thom Browne, which she accessorised with said flute and a gold choker necklace by Lorraine West. We can surely all agree that there isn't enough flute in pop music these days - something the singer put right with several spontaneous performances on the red carpet. Kim might have had Marilyn Monroe's dress, but next year we're going to need her to bring a clarinet.

"We are truly heartbroken over deaths, says family","This video can not be played A ""truly heartbroken"" family has paid tribute to four relatives who were found dead. A ""truly heartbroken"" family has paid tribute to four relatives who were found dead in a south-east London home. Samantha Drummonds, 27, her mother Tanysha Drummonds, 45, grandmother Dolet Hill, 64, and Ms Hill's husband Denton Burke, 68, were found with stab wounds by police on 25 April.

P&O brings back passengers on cross-Channel route,"P&O Ferries is restarting Dover-Calais passenger crossings for the first time since it controversially sacked hundreds of employees with no notice. The ferry operator says it is operating a reduced timetable on Tuesday, with a normal timetable resuming on Wednesday. The Spirit of Britain is the only ferry in service on the route so tickets are limited. It comes after P&O sacked almost 800 seafarers in March to replace them with cheaper agency workers. Tuesday marks the first time that drive-on passengers and tourists will have been able to use the service in almost six weeks. The Spirit of Britain will leave Dover for Calais at 16:05. It has been crossing the English channel for just under a week, carrying freight-only traffic. It is the only ship the company can currently use for its cross-Channel operations and was cleared to sail on 22 April after being detained 11 days earlier, when 23 failures were found by Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) inspectors. Dover to Calais P&O ferry cleared to sail P&O Ferries hits back at new staff pay cut claim The MCA has confirmed that the Pride of Kent, which also operates on the Dover-Calais route, has failed its reinspection. After reinspection, the MCA said not all of the previously identified issues around safety and crew documentation had been put right, so it will remain under detention. It will reinspect the vessel when next requested to do so by P&O Ferries. The company used to have four ferries in operation on this route, so it is still below its normal operating capacity. The other two ferries, the Pride of Canterbury and the Spirit of France, are still out of action. P&O Ferries was widely condemned by politicians, trade unions and the public after replacing nearly 800 crew members with cheaper agency staff on 17 March. This video can not be played P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite faced MPs over the sackings It suspended most of its operations following the decision, with delays andincreased traffic seen around the Port of Doveras a result around the Easter holidays. When P&O Ferries sacked its staff, the company said the move was to ensure the future of the business. Passenger services have already resumed on its three other UK routes, which are between Liverpool and Dublin, Ireland; between Cairnryan, Scotland and Larne, Northern Ireland; and between Hull and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Last week,another P&O Ferries ship spent hours adrift without powerin the Irish Sea. P&O said the incident was caused by a ""temporary mechanical issue"" that had been resolved.

"More to do to help with cost of living, says PM","This video can not be played PM: The government does not have âan unlimited number of shots to playâ when dealing with the cost of living. Boris Johnson has warned he does not have an ""unlimited number of shots to play"" when it comes to tackling record rises in the cost of living. And he said there would not be ""a magic solution"" for every family overnight. In an interview with the BBC, the prime minister promised the government would ""use all the ingenuity and the compassion"" to support people with price hikes ""in the short-term"". Labour has accused him of offering ""no answers"" to a ""cost of living crisis"". Political parties are arguing over living costs ahead of local elections in England, Wales and Scotland, and for Northern Ireland's government. Inflation is at a 30-year high of 7%, driven upwards by surging food and energy prices, and is expected to rise further later this year. Why are prices rising so quickly? BP profits soar as calls for windfall tax grow Cost of living dominates in key election battleground The government has announced acouncil tax rebateandrepayable discounton energy bills, but is facing calls to go further now to help with costs. It has also come under criticism over the 3.1% rise in the state pension and other benefits that arenot keeping pace with inflation. Ministers are looking at other measures to lower living expenses, includingless frequent MOT tests and relaxing nursery staffing rulesin a bid to reduce the cost of childcare. Mr Johnson said he accepted the country was ""going to have a tough period for a while"". But while he promised the government would ""continue to look at all the options"" to support households, he said there were limits. Talking to the BBC's regional news programmes, the PM said: ""We will use all the ingenuity and the compassion that we had during Covid to try to help people in the short-term. ""That doesn't mean we have an unlimited number of shots to play. ""We've got to be clear - this is taxpayers' money, you're taking it to cut prices, there are limits to what you can do."" He added: ""I am not going to pretend that every family is going to have a magic solution from the government overnightâ¦ but we can be as ingenious and compassionate as possible."" Mr Johnson's comments came after he faced criticism from an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday. Asked about rising prices, the PM initially said the government was ""doing everything we can"" to help households. But pressed on whether the response went far enough, he later said the taxpayer-funded response ""isn't going to be enough immediately to help cover everybody's costs"". ""Of course that isn't going to work enough in the short-term,"" he added. Asked whether there should be a more generous uplift to benefits, he warned this brought the risk of triggering an ""inflationary spiral"". POSTCODE SEARCH:Is there an election in my area? WHAT'S HAPPENING WHERE:Really simple guide ENGLAND:Simple guide GUIDE:How to vote in local elections NOTIFICATIONS:Sign up for Northern Ireland election alerts Opposition parties have suggested hiking taxes on oil and gas companies to pay for bigger support payments to help households with energy bills. They have renewed their calls on Tuesday, after BP announced its profits for the first three months of this yearhave more than doubled. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the news made the government's unwillingness to impose a windfall tax on energy firms ""impossible to justify"". And the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said the government should tax firms making ""excessive profits"", adding: ""Those proceeds should be invested back into making sure those who are suffering from the cost-of-living crisis get some help."" But Mr Johnson rejected a windfall tax on energy firms, saying the likes of BP ""already pay shedloads of tax as businesses"". He told the BBC the question for government was ""if you whack a biz with a tax how does it respond?"", claiming it would ""deter them"" from investing in the UK. Speaking to BBC local radio, Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Greens in England and Wales, said his party's plan for an ""ongoing carbon tax"", as well as on oil and gas windfall tax, would help fund better home insulation to cut bills. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said BP's profits announcement ""reinforces the case"" for a windfall tax. Asked whether it might deter investment, Sir Keir said his party's proposal was for a year-long tax increase on ""profit they didn't expect to make"". He criticised the government's response, saying: ""Overall, the cost of this government is that families will be Â£2,000 worse off and the government's got no answer to that for so many families. ""The National Insurance rise is going to hit working people in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis."" Mr Johnson also faced criticism from Labour for his response to a question from GMB about the situation of a 77-year-old widow. Presenter Susanna Reid said Elsie, a GMB viewer, had resorted to using her London Freedom Pass to ride on buses ""all day to avoid using energy at home"". In his reply, the PM claimed credit for introducing the pass - which gives pensioners and others discounted travel - when he was mayor of the capital. Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said his reply showed ""just how out of touch this narcissistic prime minister is"". Boris Johnson was asked on ITV about an elderly woman who uses her London Freedom bus pass to stay on buses all day and avoid using energy that she can't afford at home. The prime minister said ""the 24 hour Freedom bus pass was something that I actually introduced"". Several people pointed out on social media that the passes for older people had existed for many years before he became Mayor of London. That's right but theFreedom Pass in London could not be used before 9:30am until Mr Johnson extended it to 24 hours a day, from January 2009,external. However in June 2020, as part of afunding agreement between TfL and the government, Older Person's Freedom Passes and 60+ cards were no longer valid between 4:30am and 9am on weekdays,external.

LiveLiveFury and joy as leak suggests US abortion law change7 minutes ago,"A leak from the US Supreme Court suggests the national right to abortion could be overturned The court is due to make a final decision in June or early July - but a draft has emerged If the right to abortion is overturned, US states would be free to set their own rules It's expected that around half would then ban abortions in their states President Biden says ""a woman's right to choose is fundamental"" He says that if the court overturns the ruling, lawmakers should protect abortion rights But anti-abortion groups welcomed the news, saying a ruling would protect unborn children The Supreme Court says the leak was authentic - and promises an investigation Edited by Owen Amos Protests continue outside the US Supreme Court Thank you for joining us for our live coverage of the Supreme Court leak, and the tumultuous day that followed. Here's a quick look back at the day:  Want to know more?  Our writers today were Holly Honderich, Bernd Debusmann, and Jessica Murphy. The editor was Owen Amos. The governors of 17 US states and territories including Wisconsin, New York, California and New Jersey have penned a letter urging Congress to codify abortion rights and ensure  Americans ""have meaningful access"" to reproductive healthcare services. In the letter, the governors say that reproductive healthcare decisions should be made by patients and healthcare providers, and ""not by politicians"". The governors are calling on the Senate to pass the Women's Health Protection Act, a piece of legislation passed by the House of Representatives in September 2021. The letter added that the consequences of overturning Roe v. Wade ""cannot be overstated"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Read more about who has abortions in the US, and who might be affected by a Supreme Court ruling,here. Earlier, we reported on ananti-abortion campaigner's reactionto the draft ruling in Texas.  Now, Maleeha Aziz, a community organiser for the pro-choice Texas Equal Access Fund, tells the BBC of her ""shock and horror"" over the leaked decision.  ""Last
night as I was reading through the very extreme and radical leaked draft, I
felt shocked and horrified. We in the movement have been planning for the
worst-case scenario for a while now.  ""It hits you differently when you read
through the language in the draft, though. As someone who has had two abortions
and has had to travel out of state for one of them, I feel angry for folks who
will be forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term due to a lack of funds,
resources, and access.  ""As a mother of a daughter, I feel sick and scared that
if my daughter were to find herself in a similar situation, it would be so much
harder for me to help her access the healthcare she deserves. I feel despair,
anger, desperation, and the motivation to fight harder than ever.""  Read more about Maleeha, and the battle over abortion in the US Supreme Court police officers setting up barricades on Tuesday Police in Washington DC have reportedly activated a number of ""civil disturbance units"" ahead of protests that may take place in the city following the of the draft Supreme Court decision. A police memoshared online by local media,externalreported that on-duty or off-duty members of these units are being called to assist ""due to the potential for First Amendment activity"" in the city, referring to the constitutionally-enshrined right to free speech and peaceful assembly. The specialised units have been activated until Sunday, 8 May, with officers compensated for working overtime or outside of their regular hours. Shortly after the story of the leak broke, officers from the US Supreme Court Police set up barricades near the Supreme Court building. Will GrantReporting from Mexico City While the
emphasis in the US is increasingly on restricting access to abortions, in the
neighbour to the south, Mexico, all the legal traffic is in the opposite
direction.  At the end of last year, the Mexican Supreme Court struck down an
abortion law in the northern state of Coahuila, which in essence decriminalised
it across the country.  It still faces
legal challenges - not least from powerful Catholic and evangelical groups
with backing in parliament. However, pro-choice advocates are cautiously optimistic about the future.  Shortly after the
decision in Mexico, women's reproductive health campaigners in
Coahuila told me it was just a matter of time before they expected to see
American women travelling south for legal abortions they could no longer
receive at home.  They would offer their assistance to anyone, whether from
Mexico or the US, they added.  However,
the irony was not lost on them: the last time American women came south in significant
numbers to seek an abortion was in
the days beforeRoe Vs Wade.  One key hope
among those calling for the decriminalisation of abortions in
Mexico is that legislation will also tackle dangerous backstreet
abortions and unscrupulous, unlicensed pharmacies giving out abortion
pills of dubious origin.  So that anyone who seeks an abortion in the country - wherever they have come from - can be sure it is legal and safe. Nomia IqbalReporting from Miami, Florida Alex
Franzblau, 19 and Kaya Ells, 28 are at a pro-choice protest in Miami.  They say the Supreme Court ruling has
terrified them - but they also feel frustrated with how President Biden and his
party are handling it.  Alex says: ""This is occurring
during a Democratic president, a Democratic Congress, and some of the partyâs
politicians seem a bit stagnant or incapable on the face of this oncoming,
very active,
very militant right wing threat.""  Kaya says: ""Democrats arenât
going to codify this for a long time, like voting rights. I have very low expectations of
them.""  When I put this to Nikki Fried - who is running for the governership here, and is speaking to protesters - she says Democrats need to get tough.  âYes! Thereâs so many things
falling into the cracks in Washington DC, not just womenâs rights. And if this
isnât a wake up call to the Democrats in Congress and the Senate I donât know
what is."" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said ""the right to choose is a woman's right and a woman's right alone"". In a tweet following the leak of a US Supreme Court draft opinion, Trudeau said that ""every woman in Canada has a right to a safe and legal abortion"". ""We'll never back down from protecting and promoting women's rights in Canada and around the world,"" he added. Polling released,externalin 2020 found that 71% of Canadians believe women should have access to abortions, regardless of the reason, and compared to 26% who believe that abortion should only be legal in certain circumstances. Only 4% of Canadians believe that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances. A morerecent poll,externalof Americans released in May 2021 found that 59% of Americans believe that abortions should be legal in most or all cases, compared with 39% who think they should be mostly illegal. Read more about who could be affected by removing the national right to abortion in the UShere. Sarah SmithNorth America Editor, reporting from the Supreme Court in Washington DC A small knot of anti-abortion campaigners outside the
Supreme Court this afternoon are vastly outnumbered by pro-choice activists.  Banners declaring âMy Body My Choiceâ and âabortion
is a human right"" are being waved in support of a parade of speakers
who are discussing how they can work to maintain abortion rights in the
US.  Itâs time to codify abortion in federal law, they are demanding. And they are cheering on those promising financial support for women who have to
travel out of their home states for an abortion - insisting this
issue will galavanise liberal voters across the country.  For all the chants and cheers, almost everyone says
they felt devastated when they read online the leaked opinion from the Supreme
Court.  There is real passion and anger, which spilled over into a few scuffles
last night.  There are no confrontations today, with only a few people holding
âprotection at conception bannersâ and âdonât kill humans"" signs.  They are
giving numerous interviews to TV crews from around the world, explaining why they believe women's rights donât extend to terminating
pregnancies - while calling for increased support for women with unplanned pregnancies so
they can keep their children. Nomia IqbalReporting from Miami, Florida Florida is imposing a new anti-abortion law, similar to the Mississippi law that the US Supreme Court is looking at.  From 1 July, it will not be
possible to get the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy - the stateâs very
conservative Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill in April.  Dozens of people have come to protest
outside Freedom Tower in Miami to protest against the Supreme Court leaked draft ruling - but a lone protester
stands amongst the pro-choice activists.  Amanda Garret, 27, is from Miami
and says she rushed here.  âThis [the pro-choice protest] is not the view of
Floridians - we want to ban abortion. I believe itâs murder and there should be
no exceptions. Babies' lives matter.  âI donât necessarily feel I am
alone in general - however the support to come out here is low because a lot of
people donât want to deal with the backlash.â If Roe v Wade is overturned, a range of anti-abortion legislation is expected in large swathes of the country. Without Roe, abortion access is expected to be cut off in up to 26 states - home to roughly 36 million women of reproductive age. But some states are moving in the opposite direction, working to become abortion ""sanctuaries"" and offer reproductive health services banned elsewhere. Last year, California clinics and their allies in the state legislature unveiled a plan to help those seeking reproductive care, including possibly paying for travel, accommodation and procedures for people from other states. But while, in theory, American women will be able to travel to abortion-friendly states, logistically it may prove impossible. Women seeking abortions are disproportionately lower-income, young and already have children. Millions may not be in a position to take a cross-country trip to seek care. On Monday, Amazon said it was offeringup to $4,000 in expensesfor staff who needed out-of-town care - including abortion. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Stacy Shaw, 39, a lawyer in Kansas City, tells the BBC that she supports the right of women to choose. âPersonally, I donât believe in abortion, but I think people should have a right to choose. Women should have autonomy over their own bodies, and I thought that legislating abortion was relegated to the past,"" she says. ""People want to regulate abortion, but they want to de-fund schools. Here in Missouri, our schools are failing. If you want to be pro-life, then you need to look at life after a child is born.â HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra on 27 April US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra says laws restricting access to abortion services are ""dangerous"". In a statement posted to the HHS website, Becerra said that ""patients make their own decisions about their bodies"". ""That's their right,"" he added. ""I strongly believe in protecting and promoting access to health care - that includes sexual and reproductive health care, and that includes safe and legal abortion care."" Additionally, Becerra said that ""laws we have seen coming out of states that deny care are dangerous"". Good afternoon from Washington DC. It's been a huge day in the United States, following the leak of a draft ruling from the Supreme Court. So if you're just joining us, or need a quick refresher, here's a look back the latest:  Laura TrevelyanReporting from the Supreme Court ""We are the majority,"" came the anguished cry from a woman speaking
to pro-choice supporters outside the US Supreme Court this afternoon. And itâs true that opinion polling suggests a
majority of Americans support a womanâs right to an abortion. But now the
leaked draft opinion by Justice Alito suggests six conservative justices could be on
the brink of overturning Roe v Wade, all because the balance of the court
tipped during Donald Trump's presidency. Alexandra, a pro-choice college student from
American University who rushed here this morning to make her voice heard,
remembers the confirmation hearings of Justice Kavanaugh as a pivotal moment. Despite the ""Me Too"" movement, despite the
allegations of sexual assault against him, he was confirmed, recalls Alexandra
- and now ""it feels like my generation of women are about to lose the right to
control their own bodies"". Kim, a retired academic who taught womenâs
history, also came to the Supreme Court to express her dismay at the potential
ruling. ""There
is going to be a right to birth when thereâs no right to healthcare or childcare?"" Kim asked in disbelief. ""Iâm not surprised this court is going to do
this, but what did it mean in those confirmation hearings when those
justices said they respected precedent?"" Angelica CasasReporting from San Antonio, Texas Catherine Nix, of the San Antonio Coalition for Life, has lost count of the number of times she has prayed outside a Texas clinic that offers abortions. It's probably in the thousands. Rain or shine, alone or with company, she makes almost daily visits to the local Planned Parenthood, one of the largest abortion services providers in the country. She stands on the sidewalk trying to get the attention of patients arriving, to offer them other pregnancy options. Today is no different. Even if the Supreme Court does overturn Roe v Wade, Nix says nothing changes for the work she and other anti-abortion advocates are doing. âThere will still be people with unexpected pregnancies,â Nix said. âWhether abortion is legal or illegal, it will still be considered by those people.â In Texas, where abortion restrictions have intensified in the last year, many have been forced to travel out of the state for care. Nix says others in states with complete abortion bans will only do the same. As she stood on the sidewalk today, she was confronted by an employee of the clinic who walked away with one of her signs and said he would call the police. Nix fears that if and when the Supreme Court decision is finally made, the confrontations will be worse. Still, âwe are always going to be hereâ. âOur job is to protect all innocent human life. Weâre very hopeful, but weâre not rejoicing yet.â Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in 2021 More than 16 years after his confirmation hearing, US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito now stands at the centre of the debate regarding the future of Roe v Wade, the case that legalised abortion in the US in 1973. In a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion, Alito, 72, wrote that ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start"" and ""must be overruled"". Prior to being named to the highest US court, Alito - once considered among the most conservative justices - was a federal appeals court judge. He had been appointed to that position in 1990 by President George HW Bush. A New Jersey native and graduate of Princeton University, he'd also been the US Attorney for District of New Jersey and served eight years as a signals officer in the US Army Reserve. In 2005, Alito was nominated to the Supreme Court by George W Bush, who referred to him as ""scholarly, fair-minded and principled"". During his 2006 confirmation hearing, Alito said that he believed that previous legal challenges to Roe v Wade had ""strengthened"" the 1973 landmark case's value as precedent. He also said that when a ""decision is challenged and it is reaffirmed, that strengthens its value as 'stare decisis'"" - a legal principle that obligates courts to take into account past cases. However, Alito said that, at the time, the abortion issue was involved in litigation at ""all levels"" and that the Supreme Court ""should be insulated from public opinion"". ""They should do what the law requires in all instances,"" he said. ""That's why members of the judiciary are not elected."" Find out more about all nine justices, and the incoming Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson here.  Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Kim Kriebel and her dog, Duke Kim Kriebel, 47, a social worker, pictured here in Montgomery
County, Pennsylvania, told the BBC that pregnant women need more than a change
in laws. âI do believe that life begins at conception,"" she said. ""But itâs not enough
to make a law or a rule because that doesnât change anything. Sometimes, when
someone gets pregnant, thereâs like a panic, like: âhow am I going to deal with
this?â"" ""My aunt runs a
pregnancy-resource centre, and they collect cribs and bassinets and other
things that mom might need if they donât have any money. ""When thereâs support
like that, women who are pregnant can work things out.â Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Never in US history has a draft Supreme Court opinion been leaked to the
public. The court traditionally operates like Mt Olympus, with opinions handed
down from high and the inner workings â the judicial horse-trading, debating
and cajoling necessary to reach a majority â all taking place in cloistered
chambers. It is a practice that speaks to the courtâs unrivaled power to interpret,
uphold or strike down any law Congress passes and establish or dismantle
individual rights at the stroke of a pen. It is a power that was assumed by the
court itself in the early 1800s â and one that is inherently undemocratic. The
power has survived, and been respected, for as long as it has in part because
protections and procedures that courtâs champions have meticulously crafted
over the centuries . Only the nine judges and their handful of clerks â law school graduates
selected for their achievements and intellect â are privy to the machinations
of the Supreme Courtâs judicial process. Initial views are expressed in a
non-binding vote shortly after a case is presented to the court, draft majority
and dissenting opinions are circulated and changes are made. There are reports
and accounts â from former justices and those familiar with the process â of
how draft opinions can sometimes bear little resemblance to the final ruling of
the court. The leak of Mr Alitoâs draft majority opinion - tearing up Roe v Wade - short-circuits that process and could gravely wound
the Supreme Court as an institution, sowing distrust among the justices and
their clerks and fully exposing the judiciary to the sometimes harsh influence
of American politics. Accusations and conspiracy theories are already flying â that the leaker
was a liberal making a last-ditch effort to prevent Roeâs repeal, a
conservative concerned that the sweeping Alito opinion was in danger of being
discarded, or a moderate who wants to make a final opinion
paring back abortion protections seem less extreme. Chief Justice John Roberts called the leak a âbetrayal
of the confidence of the courtâ and a âsingular and egregious breachâ of trust. He ordered an investigation into the origins of the leak â but the damage has
been done. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
PM defends cost of living help amid calls for more,"This video can not be played PM: The government does not have âan unlimited number of shots to playâ when dealing with the cost of living. Boris Johnson has warned he does not have an ""unlimited number of shots to play"" when it comes to tackling record rises in the cost of living. And he said there would not be ""a magic solution"" for every family overnight. In an interview with the BBC, the prime minister promised the government would ""use all the ingenuity and the compassion"" to support people with price hikes ""in the short-term"". Labour has accused him of offering ""no answers"" to a ""cost of living crisis"". Political parties are arguing over living costs ahead of local elections in England, Wales and Scotland, and for Northern Ireland's government. Inflation is at a 30-year high of 7%, driven upwards by surging food and energy prices, and is expected to rise further later this year. Why are prices rising so quickly? BP profits soar as calls for windfall tax grow Cost of living dominates in key election battleground The government has announced acouncil tax rebateandrepayable discounton energy bills, but is facing calls to go further now to help with costs. It has also come under criticism over the 3.1% rise in the state pension and other benefits that arenot keeping pace with inflation. Ministers are looking at other measures to lower living expenses, includingless frequent MOT tests and relaxing nursery staffing rulesin a bid to reduce the cost of childcare. Mr Johnson said he accepted the country was ""going to have a tough period for a while"". But while he promised the government would ""continue to look at all the options"" to support households, he said there were limits. Talking to the BBC's regional news programmes, the PM said: ""We will use all the ingenuity and the compassion that we had during Covid to try to help people in the short-term. ""That doesn't mean we have an unlimited number of shots to play. ""We've got to be clear - this is taxpayers' money, you're taking it to cut prices, there are limits to what you can do."" He added: ""I am not going to pretend that every family is going to have a magic solution from the government overnightâ¦ but we can be as ingenious and compassionate as possible."" Mr Johnson's comments came after he faced criticism from an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday. Asked about rising prices, the PM initially said the government was ""doing everything we can"" to help households. But pressed on whether the response went far enough, he later said the taxpayer-funded response ""isn't going to be enough immediately to help cover everybody's costs"". ""Of course that isn't going to work enough in the short-term,"" he added. Asked whether there should be a more generous uplift to benefits, he warned this brought the risk of triggering an ""inflationary spiral"". POSTCODE SEARCH:Is there an election in my area? WHAT'S HAPPENING WHERE:Really simple guide ENGLAND:Simple guide GUIDE:How to vote in local elections NOTIFICATIONS:Sign up for Northern Ireland election alerts Opposition parties have suggested hiking taxes on oil and gas companies to pay for bigger support payments to help households with energy bills. They have renewed their calls on Tuesday, after BP announced its profits for the first three months of this yearhave more than doubled. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the news made the government's unwillingness to impose a windfall tax on energy firms ""impossible to justify"". And the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said the government should tax firms making ""excessive profits"", adding: ""Those proceeds should be invested back into making sure those who are suffering from the cost-of-living crisis get some help."" But Mr Johnson rejected a windfall tax on energy firms, saying the likes of BP ""already pay shedloads of tax as businesses"". He told the BBC the question for government was ""if you whack a biz with a tax how does it respond?"", claiming it would ""deter them"" from investing in the UK. Speaking to BBC local radio, Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Greens in England and Wales, said his party's plan for an ""ongoing carbon tax"", as well as on oil and gas windfall tax, would help fund better home insulation to cut bills. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said BP's profits announcement ""reinforces the case"" for a windfall tax. Asked whether it might deter investment, Sir Keir said his party's proposal was for a year-long tax increase on ""profit they didn't expect to make"". He criticised the government's response, saying: ""Overall, the cost of this government is that families will be Â£2,000 worse off and the government's got no answer to that for so many families. ""The National Insurance rise is going to hit working people in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis."" Mr Johnson also faced criticism from Labour for his response to a question from GMB about the situation of a 77-year-old widow. Presenter Susanna Reid said Elsie, a GMB viewer, had resorted to using her London Freedom Pass to ride on buses ""all day to avoid using energy at home"". In his reply, the PM claimed credit for introducing the pass - which gives pensioners and others discounted travel - when he was mayor of the capital. Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said his reply showed ""just how out of touch this narcissistic prime minister is"". Boris Johnson was asked on ITV about an elderly woman who uses her London Freedom bus pass to stay on buses all day and avoid using energy that she can't afford at home. The prime minister said ""the 24 hour Freedom bus pass was something that I actually introduced"". Several people pointed out on social media that the passes for older people had existed for many years before he became Mayor of London. That's right but theFreedom Pass in London could not be used before 9:30am until Mr Johnson extended it to 24 hours a day, from January 2009,external. However in June 2020, as part of afunding agreement between TfL and the government, Older Person's Freedom Passes and 60+ cards were no longer valid between 4:30am and 9am on weekdays,external.

Tories are mud-slinging over Covid event - StarmerThe Labour leader dismisses claims of Covid rule-breaking as minister encourages police to investigate.UK Politics,"Sir Keir Starmer has accused the Conservatives of ""mud-slinging"" after some of the party's MPs suggested he may have broken Covid rules. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said she would ""encourage"" Durham police to investigate an event at which the Labour leader was seen drinking a beer. Sir Keir said police had investigated and concluded ""no rules were broken"". He said Conservatives should focus on helping people with their energy bills. Rayner was at lockdown event with Starmer How many fines have there been over Partygate? The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held Earlier this year, Durham police cleared Sir Keir of breaking lockdown laws when he attended an event on 30 April 2021 at the office of a Durham MP. Labour has previously said the rules were not broken, because there was an exemption for events held for ""work purposes"". Last month, Conservative MP Richard Holden wrote to the police asking them to review their decision, after the Met Police fined Prime Minister Boris Johnson for breaking lockdown laws by attending a party in No 10 in June 2020. He argued the rules ""should apply equally"" to both men. Questioned on the Today programme, the Labour leader repeatedly avoided saying whether he had been contacted by Durham police, since Mr Holden's letter However, the party later confirmed the police had not been in touch. Setting out his participation in the event, Sir Keir said: ""We were working, we stopped for food, no party, no rules were broken; I don't know what I can add to that. ""This is simply being whipped up as mud-slinging by the Tories."" Minister Ms Trevelyan said she backed a further police investigation telling Sky News: ""I understand that there is some work ongoing and I would absolutely encourage them to look at it."" Last month, Mr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined by the police for attending a birthday gathering for the PM in Downing Street. The fines were part of the Met Police's investigation into 12 gatherings across government buildings during the coronavirus lockdowns. The police have previously said at least 50 fines have been issued in relation to the investigation - but that they would not be announcing further fines in the run-up to the local election. Speaking to Good Morning Britain on ITV, Mr Johnson said he had not received another fine but had ""no idea"" if more would come.

'It's just a number' - O'Sullivan on seventh titleRonnie O'Sullivan plays down the achievement of equalling Stephen Hendry's record of seven world titles.,"This video can not be played Ronnie O'Sullivan wins record-equalling seventh World Snooker Championship title Ronnie O'Sullivan has played down his achievement of equalling Stephen Hendry's modern-era record of seven world titles. O'Sullivan beat Judd Trump 18-13as the World Championship final in Sheffield concluded on Monday. ""I think it meant more to him [Hendry] than me to have seven world titles but we will share it,"" O'Sullivan said. ""Hendry is an absolute legend of the game. It is just a number - I do not get too caught up in that."" The world number one, 46, has won four of the five finals he has played at the Crucible since he considered retirement in 2011. It was at that point he began working with psychiatrist Steve Peters to help turn his form around. ""I thought at 35 I was done,"" O'Sullivan added. ""When I went to see Steve Peters in 2011, I was ready to quit. No other snooker player was winning anything by that sort of age. The Hendrys and [Steve] Davises were on the way down by that age and I had accepted that was the trend."" O'Sullivan was watched by his family as he defeated fellow Englishman Trump. He said: ""I wasn't sure if I was going to get to another big final like this again. I wanted them to come if they wanted to. It was fantastic to have them here. It's magic. ""I am not all in with snooker and that was a problem this week. I got emotionally involved and it is hard not to at this tournament. For 11 months, it was sort of holiday time, win or lose, it did not matter. This was a different beast."" This video can not be played 'He's the greatest player in the world' - watch O'Sullivan's best shots from final Hendry remains snooker's youngest-ever world champion, winning in 1990 at the age of 21, and ruled the sport during that decade as he claimed an unprecedented five world titles in a row. However, the Scot, who was also the world number one for nine years, says O'Sullivan has ""taken the game to new levels"". ""The century breaks, cue-ball control, safety game, temperament, the killer instinct, he's got it all,"" Hendry said on BBC Two. ""It's an honour to be at seven world titles with Ronnie. He's an artist. He's a winning machine. He says he's not bothered about records but he will want eight. It's been an astounding performance, the way he's dominated this tournament."" O'Sullivan's triumph will add more fuel to any debate in comparisons with Hendry O'Sullivan's victory makes him the oldest world champion in Crucible history - he is around 10 months older than Ray Reardon was when defeating Perrie Mans in 1978. The Englishman's seventh victory in Sheffield has come 21 years after he defeated John Higgins to win his first title in 2001. Considered the sport's most gifted player, O'Sullivan turned professional in 1992 and his remarkable longevity has also helped him win a record 39 ranking titles. And there appear to be few signs that he is passing his best, with his ability to score heavily as good as ever, underlined by his tally of 15 centuries, a new personal best at the tournament. O'Sullivan has now also won an unsurpassed 21 titles across snooker's prestigious 'Triple Crown' events - the World Championship, the UK Championship and the invitational Masters - three more than Hendry's 18 and six more than Davis achieved.

The Â£500,000 top prize from this year's World Championship equals his biggest-ever payday and takes his Crucible earnings to around Â£3.5m. He has matched Davis' record of 30 appearances at the Crucible this year, which he appears set to break in 2023, having targeted at least two more trips to the World Championship. And that has come in a period in which he believes it has become tougher than ever to stay at the top because the level of competition is so high. ""I felt like there is a lot less margin for error now,"" O'Sullivan added. ""Whereas before, I could get away with playing at 70% and win tournaments, now I have to be at least at 90%. ""In my mind, I have to be a bit more foot to the metal and be as good as I can in all areas to have a chance of winning. So it kind of puts more pressure on you."" O'Sullivan, leading 12-5 overnight after Sunday's play, was under pressure in Monday's afternoon session as Trump, 32, won six frames to cut the lead to 14-11. ""This afternoon is the hardest session since I played John Higgins in the final session here in 2001,"" the champion said. ""I froze and it was a mad experience. But I still keep fighting and trying to find ways to compete with these younger guys."" John Parrott, 1991 world champion I think he's the most talented sportsman in Britain - when you see the way he can play left-handed, as well as with his right hand, his touch, everything about the way he plays the game. This is Tiger Woods level. He has 21 majors, seven in each of the three big ones, and plays to a level a lot of players can never aspire to. He's the best player I've ever seen. He's on another level to anyone who has played this game. He's also got the application and the appetite. Don't listen to him saying he doesn't practise. He is in the club grafting.

BP profits soar as calls for windfall tax grow,"BP's profits for the first three months of this year have more than doubled after oil and gas prices soared. The energy giant reported an underlying profit of $6.2bn (Â£4.9bn) compared to $2.6bn in the same period last year - ahead of expectations. BP said the increase was due in part to ""exceptional oil and gas trading"". Rising profits have prompted calls for a one-off windfall tax on energy companies to help UK households grappling with rising bills. This type of charge targets firms that are lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for -in other words, a windfall. BP's profits have been driven by a sharp rise in oil prices, initially led by increased demand as economies reopened following Covid lockdowns. Last November, BP chief Bernard Looney described the energy market as ""a cash machine"". Oil prices rose further after war broke out in Ukraine and western countries imposed sanctions on Russia following its invasion. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. UK inflation is currently at its highest rate for 30 years, lifted by the rising cost of oil and gas which has inflated fuel prices as well as the cost of household energy. Energy prices: What is a windfall tax and how would it work? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC that BP's profits - which beat analysts' expectations of $4.5bn - ""reinforce the case that we've been making which is that, with so many people struggling to pay their energy bills, we should have a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in the North Sea who have made more profit than they were expecting"". Italy has said it will increase its tax on energy companies' windfall profits from 10% to 25%, but the UK government is not in favour of such a charge. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a windfall tax would hamper investment and keep oil prices higher over the long term. He told ITV: ""If you put a windfall tax on the energy companies, what that means is that you discourage them from making the investments that we want to see that will, in the end, keep energy prices lower for everybody."" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said energy companies should ""pay a little more to help the most vulnerable"". ""The Conservative government's refusal to introduce a windfall tax on the super profits of oil companies is becoming impossible to justify,"" he said. ""BP is raking in eye-watering profits while millions of people struggle to pay the bills."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has previously said he would explore a windfall tax policy if companies did not invest enough in the UK's energy supply. BP chief Bernard Looney expects the energy market to remain volatile On Tuesday, BP announced plans to invest Â£18bn in green and fossil fuel operations in the UK by the end of the decade. But it also said it would buy back another $2.5bn of its shares and keep dividends - payments to shareholders - at 5.46 cents a share. BP says it expects to pay Â£1bn in taxes for its 2022 North Sea profits, on top of around Â£250m that it has paid annually in other taxes in the UK in recent years. Mr Looney said: ""We're backing Britain. It's been our home for over 110 years, and we've been investing in North Sea oil and gas for more than 50 years. ""We're fully committed to the UK's energy transition - providing reliable home-grown energy and, at the same time, focusing on the drive to net zero."" BP's promise to invest Â£18bn in UK over the remainder of this decade and its estimate it will pay about a billion pounds in UK tax this year seems to have headed off the threat of being hit by a windfall tax. While the Â£18bn figure is just totting up investments already planned, it is a larger proportion of their global investment than in previous years. While the final decision on tax is the chancellor's, the investment was welcomed by the business secretary and the prime minister again played down talk of a swoop on oil and gas profits. Opposition parties are not convinced and pointed to BP's target of using 60% of excess profits to buy back shares and the rest to pay down debt. With Shell expected to post even higher profit numbers later this week, the debate is sure to continue. Russ Mould from investment platform AJ Bell said it was ""no surprise"" to hear BP pledging billions of pounds worth of investment in projects to boost domestic energy security. ""Whether this will be enough to stave off a new levy remains to be seen. The political pressure to do so is only likely to escalate as the cost of living continues to surge in the UK,"" he said. Nick Butler, a former vice president at BP, told the BBC's Today programme it was possible the government would impose a greater tax burden on the energy giant. The visiting professor at Kings College London said: ""I think the company can answer that by showing that they are actually contributing to energy security."" BP said it had taken a $24.4bn hit on its decision to exit its shareholding in Russian energy giant Rosneft following the Kremlin's assault on Ukraine. Including thecost of exiting its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft, BP reported a loss of $20.3bn for the first quarter. ""In a quarter dominated by the tragic events in Ukraine and volatility in energy markets, BP's focus has been on supplying the reliable energy our customers need,"" said Mr Looney. He added that the oil market would continue to be volatile and he did not expect ""any let off on prices any time soon"". Rival energy giant Shell is scheduled to report its results for the first quarter of the year on Thursday.

Girl with Tourette's gets book published,"This video can not be played The tics Lucy-Marie started to develop when she was eight were, at first, a mystery to her ""Don't judge me, I can't make it stop,"" is the message Lucy-Marie has for everyone with assumptions about Tourette's syndrome. The tics the 12-year-old started to develop when she was eight were, at first, a mystery to her and her mother Toniann. But the involuntary movements, swearing and ""funny"" call-outs got more frequent. So she decided to write I Can't Make It Stop to help herself and others. Especially after she ""became a shell"" of her once-confident and diva-like self. Meeting the Queen when you've got Tourette's How a teen author became a Netflix star Call for more diverse heroes in children's stories ""Some people are rude about it and they'll tell me to shut up,"" Lucy-Marie said. ""It makes me feel very upset and feel like I don't want to go out of the house and stay locked up all the time."" But she has not let those feelings get in the way of her aim of educating people about the condition. The pieces of homework she got on documenting her experiences in her room have now been crafted into her first published book. ""I wanted to raise more awareness to the world and my class members about Tourette's. I give loads of credit to them because they were really supportive and helpful to me and my mum helped me with what to put where."" Interestingly, Lucy-Marie can only whistle when she has a tic Lucy-Marie said her drama teacher made her dream come true after ""cheekily"" asking her to publish her book. Toniann said Lucy-Marie ""gets all coy"" when talking about Clare Thomas, who ""worked really hard"" to illustrate and publish her book. ""Now it's published I'm very happy because most of my friends are very proud of me - it makes me feel happy."" In November 2019, Toniann thought Lucy-Marie hadcroup,externaluntil ""this cough noise"" disappeared. It was not until ""one day she woke up with a noise that never went away"" that Toniann realised she needed help. Lucy-Marie's mother said she felt ""helpless"" seeing her daughter change out of her ""calm and confident"" self when her tics started to get worse during lockdown. Lucy-Marie says she was anxious when her tics started to develop ""This noise came thick and fast to the point that she was choking when she was eating so she refused to eat and drink - from then onwards it escalated,"" she said. ""Now looking at Lucy you can see the difference in the tic as her persona changes, her voice changes, the tempo of her voice, she tends to screw herself up, twist herself around. ""When her Tourette's started she changed, it was like a completely different child. She became a shell of herself. ""She didn't want to go out of her room, talk to her friends - she panicked. We had no answers and no-one knew what to do because there is no clear pathway."" A condition characterised by involuntary sounds and movements, or tics Usually appears during childhood - six years old is the average age It is estimated that one school child in every 100 has it The cause is unknown but it can sometimes be diagnosed alongsideADHD,external, obsessive compulsive disorder or learning difficulties It is rarely harmful to someone's overall health but physical tics can be painful There is no cure but it can be managed with medicine and behavioural therapies Source:NHS,external Toniann says she still gets emotional even though she's read her daughter's book ""100 times"" Speaking onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Toniann said she was proud of her daughter: ""I've read the book a hundred times and every time I read it I choke up a little but more. ""It's hard to have it on paper to see exactly what she's gone through for the last two years and how much it's affected her. ""It's affected her negatively but also positively, it's given her the power to stand up for herself, the book is a step forward to help her do that."" Trying to find Lucy-Marie support was not easy. ""My GP was fantastic but there was no clear pathway of who to refer Lucy to,"" said Toniann. ""One GP may refer to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services), another may refer to a neurologist, but when you do get to those people there's still no clear guidance of how to treat Tourette's. ""There are lots of resources available in other countries but not in Wales - it's pot luck."" She is part of 10,000 others who have signed aSenedd petition,externalcalling for a ""proper, clear, clinical pathway and access to specialist provision and medical care for people with Tourette's Syndrome in Wales"". That petition, which closed in February, will now be considered for a debate. Toniann said she was ""immensely proud"" and wants her daughter to know this: ""We want you to live your life to the max - you are wonderful and you deserve to do wonderful things."" Lucy-Marie says she does not mean what she says when her tics cause her to have an outburst Dr Jeremy Stern, director ofTourettes Action,external, said the lack of medical services was a ""national problem"". ""Children's mental health services are extremely overstretched in what they can cope with,"" he added. ""They will often reject referrals to assess patients with ticks and sometimes patients are referred out of an area or region over long distances to even get a diagnosis."" He said: ""It's a condition really that isn't that rare, so it should be available where people live."" The Welsh government said: ""We are committed to ensuring people with neurodevelopmental conditions have access to the services and care they need. ""We are engaging with families of children with Tourette's which, along with the findings of a demand and capacity of neurodevelopmental services review will inform the development of a neurodevelopmental conditions strategic action plan to be published for consultation this summer.""

BP profits soar amid calls for a windfall taxThe energy giant said underlying income hit $6.2bn due to 'exceptional oil and gas trading'.Business,"BP's profits for the first three months of this year have more than doubled after oil and gas prices soared. The energy giant reported an underlying profit of $6.2bn (Â£4.9bn) compared to $2.6bn in the same period last year - ahead of expectations. BP said the increase was due in part to ""exceptional oil and gas trading"". Rising profits have prompted calls for a one-off windfall tax on energy companies to help UK households grappling with rising bills. This type of charge targets firms that are lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for -in other words, a windfall. BP's profits have been driven by a sharp rise in oil prices, initially led by increased demand as economies reopened following Covid lockdowns. Last November, BP chief Bernard Looney described the energy market as ""a cash machine"". Oil prices rose further after war broke out in Ukraine and western countries imposed sanctions on Russia following its invasion. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. UK inflation is currently at its highest rate for 30 years, lifted by the rising cost of oil and gas which has inflated fuel prices as well as the cost of household energy. Energy prices: What is a windfall tax and how would it work? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC that BP's profits - which beat analysts' expectations of $4.5bn - ""reinforce the case that we've been making which is that, with so many people struggling to pay their energy bills, we should have a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in the North Sea who have made more profit than they were expecting"". Italy has said it will increase its tax on energy companies' windfall profits from 10% to 25%, but the UK government is not in favour of such a charge. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a windfall tax would hamper investment and keep oil prices higher over the long term. He told ITV: ""If you put a windfall tax on the energy companies, what that means is that you discourage them from making the investments that we want to see that will, in the end, keep energy prices lower for everybody."" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said energy companies should ""pay a little more to help the most vulnerable"". ""The Conservative government's refusal to introduce a windfall tax on the super profits of oil companies is becoming impossible to justify,"" he said. ""BP is raking in eye-watering profits while millions of people struggle to pay the bills."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has previously said he would explore a windfall tax policy if companies did not invest enough in the UK's energy supply. BP chief Bernard Looney expects the energy market to remain volatile On Tuesday, BP announced plans to invest Â£18bn in green and fossil fuel operations in the UK by the end of the decade. But it also said it would buy back another $2.5bn of its shares and keep dividends - payments to shareholders - at 5.46 cents a share. BP says it expects to pay Â£1bn in taxes for its 2022 North Sea profits, on top of around Â£250m that it has paid annually in other taxes in the UK in recent years. Mr Looney said: ""We're backing Britain. It's been our home for over 110 years, and we've been investing in North Sea oil and gas for more than 50 years. ""We're fully committed to the UK's energy transition - providing reliable home-grown energy and, at the same time, focusing on the drive to net zero."" BP's promise to invest Â£18bn in UK over the remainder of this decade and its estimate it will pay about a billion pounds in UK tax this year seems to have headed off the threat of being hit by a windfall tax. While the Â£18bn figure is just totting up investments already planned, it is a larger proportion of their global investment than in previous years. While the final decision on tax is the chancellor's, the investment was welcomed by the business secretary and the prime minister again played down talk of a swoop on oil and gas profits. Opposition parties are not convinced and pointed to BP's target of using 60% of excess profits to buy back shares and the rest to pay down debt. With Shell expected to post even higher profit numbers later this week, the debate is sure to continue. Russ Mould from investment platform AJ Bell said it was ""no surprise"" to hear BP pledging billions of pounds worth of investment in projects to boost domestic energy security. ""Whether this will be enough to stave off a new levy remains to be seen. The political pressure to do so is only likely to escalate as the cost of living continues to surge in the UK,"" he said. Nick Butler, a former vice president at BP, told the BBC's Today programme it was possible the government would impose a greater tax burden on the energy giant. The visiting professor at Kings College London said: ""I think the company can answer that by showing that they are actually contributing to energy security."" BP said it had taken a $24.4bn hit on its decision to exit its shareholding in Russian energy giant Rosneft following the Kremlin's assault on Ukraine. Including thecost of exiting its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft, BP reported a loss of $20.3bn for the first quarter. ""In a quarter dominated by the tragic events in Ukraine and volatility in energy markets, BP's focus has been on supplying the reliable energy our customers need,"" said Mr Looney. He added that the oil market would continue to be volatile and he did not expect ""any let off on prices any time soon"". Rival energy giant Shell is scheduled to report its results for the first quarter of the year on Thursday.

"Trader made error in 'flash crash', Citigroup says","US banking giant Citigroup has said that one of its traders made an error in the so-called stock market ""flash crash"" in Europe on Monday. A flash crash is an extremely fast fall in the price of one or more assets, often caused by a trading mistake. Trading was briefly halted in several markets after major share indexes plunged just before 8am GMT on Monday. Nordic stocks were hit the hardest, while other European indexes also plummeted for a short time. ""This morning one of our traders made an error when inputting a transaction. Within minutes, we identified the error and corrected it,"" the New York-based bank said in a statement late on Monday. The flash crash caused European shares to fall suddenly on a day when trading was particularly thin due to public holidays around the world. Sweden's benchmark Stockholm OMX 30 share index was one of the hardest hit, falling by 8% at one point, before recovering most of those losses to end the day 1.87% lower. Flash crashes can be caused by human error, or so-called ""fat finger"" trades - a reference to someone incorrectly typing the details of a trade. Such trading errors and the flash crashes they can cause are often costly. They have triggered shake ups of stock market rules and have even led to criminal convictions. In August 2012, a computer-trading glitch at US financial services firm Knight Capital caused a major stock market disruption, costing the company around $440m. A flash crash on the Singapore Exchange in October 2013 saw some stocks lose up to 87% of their value and resulted in new regulations being put in place to avoid a repeat of the incident. How the 'Hound of Hounslow' helped trigger a $1tn crash Hounslow trader avoids jail in 'flash crash' case In 2020, UK-based former stock market trader Navinder Sarao was sentenced to a year of home detention for helping trigger a brief $1tn US stock market crash 10 years earlier. Using specially programmed, high-speed software, Sarao placed thousands of orders that he did not intend to fulfil, creating the illusion of market demand. When he cancelled or changed his bids, he was able to profit. The activity - known as ""spoofing"" - contributed to market instability that led to the May 2010 ""flash crash"", when the Dow Jones index fell almost 1,000 points in a matter of minutes. The US made spoofing a crime in 2010 as part of a broader effort to tighten regulations following the 2008 financial crisis.

Our writers today were Alex Therrien, James FitzGerald, James Harness, George Wright, Claire Heald, Jack Burgess, Heather Sharp, Max Maxta and Dulcie Lee. The editors were Chris Giles, Claudia Allen, Emma Owen and Andrew Humphrey. As ever, you can find any major developing stories and in depth coverage on ourhome page. Goodnight.  A church remains standing - but damanged - in the town of Malyn, near Kyiv We'll be pausing our coverage shortly, so here's a recap of what's been happening in Ukraine today. Proposed oil ban The day started with the EU announcinga new plan to penalise Russia financially. It wants a total ban on oil imports from Russia by the end of the year. But several EU countries have voiced objections - most notably Hungary, who said it would veto the plan in its current form, as it would destroy the Hungarian economy. Missile strikes On the ground, several explosions have been reported in various cities across Ukraine. The UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia is trying to stop Ukraine from replenishing its supplies. There has been a suggestion that Russia will use its annual Victory Day celebrations - which it holds every year to mark victory against Nazi Germany in 1945 - to formally declare war on Ukraine.Russia has denied this. It is currently referred to as a special military operation. Mariupol steelworks There appears to be an escalation in fighting at the Azovstal steel plant, where the last of Ukraine's fighters in the city are holding out, along with hundreds of civilians. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have now entered the facility. Russia has said it will open a humanitarian corridor out of the plant tomorrow, but this has not been confirmed by Ukrainian officials. Theatre death toll Also in Mariupol,analysis by Associated Press,externalsuggests twice as many people as previously thought died in a Russian strike on a theatre in the city in March. Previous estimates put the death toll at 300, but the news agency now puts that at 600. Another 344 evacuees from various south-western cities including Mariupol have arrived in Zaporizhzhia, according to Ukraine's deputy prime minister Irina Vereshchuk. In a post on Telegram, she thanked the UN and Red Cross for their help, saying: ""These are women, children and elderly people from Mariupol, Manhush, Berdiansk, Tokmak and Vasylivka. All of them have just arrived in Zaporozhzhia"". The UN's humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, said many came with nothing but the clothes they were wearing. ""We will now support them during this difficult time, including with much- needed psychological support,"" she said. Lubrani added more must be done ""to make sure all civilians caught up in fighting can leave, in the direction they wish"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This video can not be played The significance of Russian celebrations on 9 May's Victory Day is not lost on Ukrainians. MP Alyona Shkrum says she believes there will be an increase in fighting, inspired by the celebrations. Shkrum says Vladimir Putin is a ""delusional dictator"" who will turn the traditionally-celebrated day into a ""big fight right now against Nazis"". One of Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to ""denazify"" the country. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has dismissed speculation that Russia will declare all-out war against Ukraine on 9 May. What it is currently doing in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"". Will VernonReporting from Moscow In Russia, tanks, missile launchers and armoured vehicles thundered through central Moscow this evening as the military held another
dress rehearsal for the big Victory Day parade on 9 May. Muscovites gathered
to watch the weaponry roll past, some taking photos and waving to the troops perched
atop the tanks. The 9 May military parade on Red Square is an annual event to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two,
although it has added significance this year following Russiaâs invasion of
Ukraine. Some analysts suggest President Putin wants to announce some sort of
victory on Victory Day, although it is difficult to see what further progress
Russian troops can make in Ukraine in the space of just a few days. There has
even been speculation here that Mr Putin will announce some sort of
mobilisation â such as a call-up of reservists â although a Kremlin
spokesperson denied today any such plans were in the works, calling the rumours
ârubbish"". Russian forces are supported by militia from separatist-run areas of Luhansk (file pic) Since the war started, we have heard little about life in two areas of Ukraine that were seized by Russian-backed proxies in 2014. But one resident in the city of Luhansk has told the BBC how it's very much like living in a powder keg. It's especially risky for men because of the constant threat of being drafted into the local militia to fight for Russia against the Ukrainian army. ""Total mobilisation is still happening â people call itmogilisationafter the Russian wordmogilawhich means grave,"" she says. ""Men have either stayed hiding in their homes for almost
three months, or they go out and pretend not to care, because they simply have
to get out to work as there are no other sources of income. ""There is an acute shortage of men - craftsmen, repairmen,
salesmen and builders. You keep hearing the phrase 'I'll come when the war is over'. Fear is acute too: wives fear for their husbands, mothers
for their sons. ""There are many dead
and many funerals. At Easter and on May Day, they were going around drafting
men direct from the cemetery."" Men who are drafted into the militia complain of being badly treated and she says theyâre so badly equipped ""they almost have to use their helmets
to dig trenches; theyâre badly fed, there arenât enough uniforms and they arenât allowed to call home"". Read more:Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraine's east This video can not be played Ukraine conflict: Explosions at Azovstal steelworks seen in DNR video We've been reporting on the ongoing attack by Russian forces on the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in Mariupol, the Azovstal steel plant. We posted on this video earlier, that shows multiple explosions at the steelworks and gives an idea of the scale of the complex, and the bombardment it has suffered. Alongside the Ukrainian soldiers, it is thought there are hundreds of civilains, including more than 30 children, sheltering in the underground tunnels at the complex. The footage was shared by MVD DNR, a media outlet for pro-Russian separatists the Donetsk Peopleâs Republic. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the date on which the video was recorded, but it is thought to be after 3 May.  Away from the fighting in Mariupol, Russia is also attempting to hamper Ukrainian resupply efforts with missile strikes across the country, the UK's Ministry of Defence says. Ground operations are still focused on eastern Ukraine, itsays in its latest assessment of the fighting,external, and the targeting of key cities highlights Russia's desire to control access to the Black Sea. It says non-military targets such as schools, hospitals and residential properties continue to be hit, indicating Russia's willingness to target civilian infrastructure in an attempt to weaken Ukrainian resolve.  Ukrainian forces inside Mariupol's
Azovstal steel works have been fighting ""difficult bloody battles""
against Russian troops for a second day, the
commander of the controversial Azov regiment said. In a brief video message posted on Telegram, commander Denis Prokopenko said: ""I am proud of my soldiers who are making superhuman efforts
to contain the pressure of the enemy... the situation is
extremely difficult."" The message comes after a Ukrainian official said Russian forces had entered the territory of the plant - the final stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the shattered city of Mariupol. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has asked the UN secretary general for help to rescue the remaining injured Ukrainians at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. In a phone call on Wednesday, he thanked Antonio Guterres for his efforts to secure evacuations earlier this week. And he asked for further assistance: ""The lives of the people who remain there are in danger. Everyone is important to us. We ask for your help in saving them,"" he said, according tohis press service,external.  Slava (C) and his brother Volodymyr (R) were among those evacuated from Azovstal yesterday Russian forces are reported to have entered the Azovstal steelworks, the last hold-out of Ukrainian forces in the southern port city of Mariupol. Russia has besieged and bombarded the city for weeks. It is key to Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine. But why?  Read more:Why Mariupol is so important to Russia's plan As many as 600 people were killed when Russia bombed a theatre in Mariupol in March,analysis by the Associated Press (AP) news agency suggests,external. At the time of the strike, the word ""children"" had been written in giant letters on the ground outside the building, which was being used as a bomb shelter. The attack is believed to have caused the worst known loss of life in a single strike since the invasion began, and AP's investigation puts the death toll at around doublethe previous estimate of 300. The news agency spoke to 23 survivors, rescuers and those familiar with the theatre's use as a bomb shelter. They also built a 3D model of the building's floor plan and examined photos and videos of the theatre from before, during and after the event. Russia's military says it will open humanitarian corridors out of the besieged Azovstal steel complex for three days from Thursday, Reuters news agency reports. The military said routes out of the Mariupol plant will open from 08:00 to 18:00 Moscow time (GMT+3) on 5, 6, and 7 May. During this time Russian forces will cease military activities and withdraw units to a safe distance, the military said in a post online. We haven't heard anything about potential evacuations yet from Ukrainian officials. Dozens of civilians wereevacuated from the Azovstal plant late last week, with a large group of them travelling to Ukraine-controlled Zaporizhzhia.  Vitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring There are reports of several Ukrainian cities being shelled this evening - Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Cherkasy, but information is patchy at this stage. Russia launched multiple missile strikes against targets across Ukraine yesterday evening, too. BBC Monitoring Dnipro's mayor Borys Filatov has said on Facebook that at least one Russian missile has hit the centre of the city. ""A strike right in the centre of Dnipro. Do not leave the shelters! Wait for official information from the military administration,"" he said. Ukrainian railways CEO Oleksandr Kamyshyn has said Dnipro's railway facilities have been hit. ""Another missile strike on railway infrastructure in Dnipro. No casualties among employees,"" he said on Telegram. Russian forces have entered the territory of the Azovstal steel works complex in Mariupol, a Ukrainian official has told a US broadcaster. The Azovstal plant is the last hold-out of Ukrainian forces in the destroyed port city, with civilians still sheltering underground in the sprawling industrial complex. David Arakhamia, Ukraine's ruling parliamentary faction head, told the broadcaster: ""Attempts to storm the plant continue for the second day. Russian troops are already on the territory of Azovstal."" Information on the ground has been scarce, but speaking to RFE/RL, Arakhamia said Ukraine's government was in contact with fighters at the plant. It comes after Mariupol's mayor earlier said they had lost communications with those inside. We'll bring you more detail on what's going on at the plant as and when we get it. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv Here in Lviv, the air raid sirens have gone off for the first
time today. It comes after a series of strikes on the outskirts of the city
yesterday that took out three power substations. I'm currently in the bunker of a shopping mall. Everyone here is
waiting around for the all clear. I'm sharing the bunker with babies, toddlers and someoneâs
family pet. The mood is quite calm but people are checking their phones for
information.  Now to Finland, where Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked a change of public opinion over Nato membership. The country, along with Sweden, has long held to a policy of military neutrality, but there are expectations that both will launch bids to join the alliance in the near future. Today, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is visiting Helsinki and he's said the UK would aid Finland if it were attacked by Russia, regardless of whether the country were a member of Nato. ""It is inconceivable that Britain would not come to the support of Finland, or Sweden, if it was ever attacked, without any big formal agreement. We are European countries who share the same values, who have deep, long histories,"" he said. Earlier, Finland's prime minister, Sanna Marin, said that in a Nato membership application, the key issue would be to keep the ratification process as short as possible. Read more:What is Nato and how has it responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine? Wallace (left) met his Finnish counterpart Antti Kaikkonen as military exercises were taking place Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""not going to agree to a frozen conflict"" with Russia, he has said during a video address at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit. Frozen conflicts are zones of ongoing instability,which Russia has previously been accused of using to its advantage. Zelensky says previous agreements with Russia such as Minsk-1 and 2, which sought to end the conflict in Ukraine's Donbas region, ""were violated"" by Russia and ""were not serious"". ""Ukraine will definitely not go into such a diplomatic swamp again,"" Zelensky has said. Ukrainian forces have been holding the line in Donbas since 2014, against Russian-backed separatists This video can not be played A video showing multiple explosions at the Mariupol steelworks has been posted on social media. The footage is from MVD DNR, a media outlet for pro-Russian separatists the Donetsk Peopleâs Republic. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the date on which the video was recorded, but it is thought to be sometime after 3 May. More than 100 people have managed to escape from Azovstal over the past few days, but many remain inside the complex which humanitarian rescue groups describe as ""hell"". Â© 2025 BBC.

family pet. The mood is quite calm but people are checking their phones for
information.  Now to Finland, where Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked a change of public opinion over Nato membership. The country, along with Sweden, has long held to a policy of military neutrality, but there are expectations that both will launch bids to join the alliance in the near future. Today, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is visiting Helsinki and he's said the UK would aid Finland if it were attacked by Russia, regardless of whether the country were a member of Nato. ""It is inconceivable that Britain would not come to the support of Finland, or Sweden, if it was ever attacked, without any big formal agreement. We are European countries who share the same values, who have deep, long histories,"" he said. Earlier, Finland's prime minister, Sanna Marin, said that in a Nato membership application, the key issue would be to keep the ratification process as short as possible.

Wallace (left) met his Finnish counterpart Antti Kaikkonen as military exercises were taking place Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""not going to agree to a frozen conflict"" with Russia, he has said during a video address at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit. Frozen conflicts are zones of ongoing instability,which Russia has previously been accused of using to its advantage. Zelensky says previous agreements with Russia such as Minsk-1 and 2, which sought to end the conflict in Ukraine's Donbas region, ""were violated"" by Russia and ""were not serious"". ""Ukraine will definitely not go into such a diplomatic swamp again,"" Zelensky has said. Ukrainian forces have been holding the line in Donbas since 2014, against Russian-backed separatists This video can not be played A video showing multiple explosions at the Mariupol steelworks has been posted on social media. The footage is from MVD DNR, a media outlet for pro-Russian separatists the Donetsk Peopleâs Republic. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the date on which the video was recorded, but it is thought to be sometime after 3 May. More than 100 people have managed to escape from Azovstal over the past few days, but many remain inside the complex which humanitarian rescue groups describe as ""hell"". Â© 2025 BBC.

UK trader made error in 'flash crash' - Citigroup,"US banking giant Citigroup has said that one of its traders made an error in the so-called stock market ""flash crash"" in Europe on Monday. A flash crash is an extremely fast fall in the price of one or more assets, often caused by a trading mistake. Trading was briefly halted in several markets after major share indexes plunged just before 8am GMT on Monday. Nordic stocks were hit the hardest, while other European indexes also plummeted for a short time. ""This morning one of our traders made an error when inputting a transaction. Within minutes, we identified the error and corrected it,"" the New York-based bank said in a statement late on Monday. The flash crash caused European shares to fall suddenly on a day when trading was particularly thin due to public holidays around the world. Sweden's benchmark Stockholm OMX 30 share index was one of the hardest hit, falling by 8% at one point, before recovering most of those losses to end the day 1.87% lower. Flash crashes can be caused by human error, or so-called ""fat finger"" trades - a reference to someone incorrectly typing the details of a trade. Such trading errors and the flash crashes they can cause are often costly. They have triggered shake ups of stock market rules and have even led to criminal convictions. In August 2012, a computer-trading glitch at US financial services firm Knight Capital caused a major stock market disruption, costing the company around $440m. A flash crash on the Singapore Exchange in October 2013 saw some stocks lose up to 87% of their value and resulted in new regulations being put in place to avoid a repeat of the incident. How the 'Hound of Hounslow' helped trigger a $1tn crash Hounslow trader avoids jail in 'flash crash' case In 2020, UK-based former stock market trader Navinder Sarao was sentenced to a year of home detention for helping trigger a brief $1tn US stock market crash 10 years earlier. Using specially programmed, high-speed software, Sarao placed thousands of orders that he did not intend to fulfil, creating the illusion of market demand. When he cancelled or changed his bids, he was able to profit. The activity - known as ""spoofing"" - contributed to market instability that led to the May 2010 ""flash crash"", when the Dow Jones index fell almost 1,000 points in a matter of minutes. The US made spoofing a crime in 2010 as part of a broader effort to tighten regulations following the 2008 financial crisis.
