New York has become the
epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in the US. Governor Andrew Cuomo on
Tuesday pleaded for medical supplies, warning the virus was spreading in his
state faster than ""a bullet train"". New York now has over
25,000 confirmed cases and over 200 deaths, with the number of new cases
doubling every three days. ""The apex is higher
than we thought and the apex is sooner than we thought,"" Mr Cuomo told
reporters. The governor's warning

next month while criticising Mr Cuomo for not having ordered more supplies years
before. Read the full story:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52012048 The Tokyo Olympics 2020 is the latest - and largest - sporting event to be postponed.

Michelle FleuryNorth America Business Correspondent The Dow Jones index rallied more than 11% (or over 2000 points) for its
best day on the US stock market since 1933. Investors are hopeful that Congress will pass a $2 trillion (Â£1.7 trillion) stimulus package to help businesses and households weather the
economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The S&P 500 also rallied more than 9%,
its biggest gain since October 2008. Shares of companies likely to get help
from the government saw some of the biggest gains, including Chevron, American
Express and Boeing whose stock prices all jumped more than 20%.  Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has said it was âextremely
likelyâ that she fell ill with coronavirus but has now recovered. The 17-year-old said she felt âtired, had shivers, a sore
throat and coughedâ after returning from a trip in Europe, so self-isolated for
two weeks. âEveryone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate
themselves. I have therefore not been tested for Covid-19, but itâs extremely
likely that Iâve had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances,""
she wrote on Instagram. She warned
people to stay at home because âour actions can be the difference between life
and deathâ for others. Maris Hellrand, Estonia Saaremaa relies heavily on the tourist industry which has now come to a halt The largest island in Estonia is at the heart of the Baltic stateâs coronavirus outbreak, with 114 of the countryâs 369 cases. The outbreak in Saaremaa is thought to have begun when an Italian volleyball team from Milan played a local club at the beginning of March. The island, which has a population of 33,000, has spent the past 10 days sealed off from the rest of Estonia. âWeâve been living under in a constant state of emergency for the last two weeks and are aware of an imminent danger of an explosion (of cases). The situation could get much more dramatic,â Mayor Madis Kallas told the BBC. The hospital on Saaremaa was the first in Estonia to set up a drive-in testing facility, but it has been struggling with a lack of supplies of protective gear. Patients in a serious condition have been sent to hospitals on the mainland. Nick BryantBBC New York Correspondent Trump, in common with all populists and demagogues, favours simple solutions to complex problems. However, the coronavirus outbreak has required the kind of multi-pronged approach and long-term thinking that seems beyond him. This has always been a presidency of the here and now.

Chris Bockman, Toulouse Tuesday could be the last day of trading for stall holders at this market in Toulouse The Crystal market in the centre of Toulouse is one of the biggest daily outdoor markets in south-west France. When Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced the closure of outdoor food markets with almost immediate effect late on Monday, stall owners feared the worst. Although they were given a reprieve on Tuesday morning, they know this could have been their last day. Mayor Jean-Luc Moudenc has appealed for the markets to stay open, warning that closure could create food shortages and hit the most vulnerable. Toulouse is home to one of the biggest British communities in France.  Many work in the aerospace industry - European plane maker Airbus is based here. For the past eight days PR consultant Trudi Harris and her family have been confined to their home. She says the highlight of her life now is the walk to the corner shop every three days. Aerospace engineer Richard Tookey says working from home has made him into something of a battery hen - working, eating and sleeping. The death toll in France from the coronavirus has jumped by 240 in the last 24 hours to reach 1,100. That's its biggest daily rise yet. There were 2,444 new confirmed cases in the same period,
bringing the total number in the country to at least 22,300, Franceâs health
ministry said. The death toll is likely to be higher, as those confirmed so
far have only been people who died in hospital,French media reports say,external. Like most other European countries, France has implemented Draconian restrictions on life to prevent the virus from spreading. The country was put into lockdown on 17 March, requiring
people to stay indoors stay except for essential trips for an initial 15-day
period. But on Tuesday, Franceâs scientific council advised the
government to extend the lockdown, saying it should last at least six weeks to suppress
the virus more effectively. Health minister Olivier VÃ©ran said the lockdown
will âlast as long as it needs toâ. France has been in lockdown since 17 March Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has donated 1m euros (Â£920,000) to help fight the coronavirus outbreak in Spain. Almost 2,700 people have now died in the country and close to 40,000 are infected. Italy is the only European country to see more cases. Guardiola, who is from Catalonia and currently at home in Barcelona, has been working with his lawyers over the past few days to decide the best way of using the money. Read morehere. Former Spain international Guardiola is an icon at Barcelona after his successes as a player and a manager Naomi Grimley, BBC News Until now, limited testing has meant that experts donât have a
hold on whoâs really had the virus and who has not. Many of us in the UK will know
someone who has been told they probably had it but they werenât allowed a
laboratory test to confirm it. Thatâs where a finger-prick antibody test to
check for immunity would make a big difference. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would be a ""game changer"". In the words of the Chief Medical Officer â Professor Chris
Whitty â it means âwe'll be able to say to somebody, you've had this virus,
youâre not likely to get it again at least in the immediate term, and now we
can be confident you can return to work and you donât
need to be taking some of the precautions youâve been taking to date."" This would be especially useful for healthcare workers whoâve
already had the virus but perhaps displayed few or no symptoms. It would
mean they wouldnât need to spend several days in self-isolation just because a
fellow family member is now sick. The news from Health Secretary Matt Hancock that the UK has now purchased 3.5 million of these
tests is especially welcome as the death toll grows. This week Spain also took
delivery of 640,000 test kits, thought to be of a similar kind, from China and
South Korea. They will be used on healthcare professionals first. Big questions still remain: not least, how reliable are these
new tests? And for how long does immunity to Covid-19 last? Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world that we have been covering over the past few hours: A US man has died and his wife is in critical condition after taking a form of a drug that has been touted by President Donald Trump as a possible treatment for the novel coronavirus. The couple took chloroquine phosphate - a form of chloroquine used to clean fish tanks - in an apparent effort to guard against Covid-19. Chloroquine itself is one of the oldest and best-known anti-malarial drugs, but the US Food and Drugs Administrationhas made it clear it has not been approved for treating those infected with the Covid-19 coronavirus. The
couple - both  in their 60s - fell ill within 30 minutes of taking the substance, said Arizona-based hospital system Banner Health. Read our full story on this casehere. Nigeria also reported cases of chloroquine poisoning that had officials there issuing their own warning: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The most common signs of Covid-19 are a fever and a dry cough, which can lead to breathing difficulties. For most people the symptoms will be mild but the coronavirus can be serious for some, including the elderly or people with certain pre-existing conditions. Some of the early symptoms can easily be confused with other winter bugs including colds and flu. But for now the UK government is advising anyone with a high temperature or a new, continuous cough sto self-isolate at home for at least seven days just in case.

Read more reaction from leading athletes on BBC Sport. British swimmer Adam Peaty won Great Britain's first medal at Rio 2016 with a world record in the men's 100m breaststroke Tom FordyceBBC chief sports writer There is a moment at an Olympic Games, some point after the opening ceremony and around the time where everything around you is drama and smashed records and new heroes, when you look around and think: there is no other square mile or so of the planet that has as many people staring at it as this. That's what the summer Games do. They make you feel like you're at the centre of the world. And it's why it took the International Olympic Committee so long to realise that Tokyo 2020 had to be postponed, and why there could be no other decision. The IOC has the history, the power and the self-regard to pull off something as complicated, expensive and vainglorious as an Olympics. Those same characteristics can also leave it out of touch with wider forces at play around it. It is used to nations wooing it and coming in supplication, not the other way round.

Coronavirus spreading in NY like 'a bullet train',"This video can not be played The New York Governor Andrew Cuomo: The city 'is a test case' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has pleaded for medical supplies, warning Covid-19 is spreading in his state faster than ""a bullet train"". ""The apex is higher than we thought and the apex is sooner than we thought,"" Mr Cuomo told reporters on Tuesday. He said the federal government was not sending anywhere near enough lifesaving equipment to confront the crisis. New York now has over 25,000 confirmed virus cases and at least 210 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday the US has the potential to become the new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic. The warnings come as President Donald Trump said he hoped the US would reopen for business next month. This video can not be played Trump on goal to reopen US by Easter: It's 'a beautiful timeline' ""We need federal help and we need the federal help now,"" Mr Cuomo, a Democrat, said. ""New York is the canary in the coal mine, New York is happening first, what is happening to New York will happen to California and Illinois, it is just a matter of time."" America is humbled - but there is a glimmer of hope The governor blasted the 400 ventilators sent to New York from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency. He said: ""You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators."" New York currently has 7,000 ventilators, but needs 30,000, the governor said. Mr Cuomo continued: ""The [infection] forecaster said to me, 'We were looking at a freight train coming across the country.' ""'We're now looking at a bullet train.'"" The state is also looking into creating more healthcare areas, possibly by turning college dormitories and hotels into makeshift hospitals. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash With 25,665 cases in New York, the state accounts for more than half of all US infections. The number of new cases in the state is doubling every three days, the governor said, and showing no sign of slowing down. Mr Cuomo said the rate of infections could overwhelm the healthcare system. New York may need up to 140,000 hospital beds in a worst-case scenario, he said. The governor also said he would not ""put a dollar amount on human life"", in what was seen as an implicit criticism of Mr Trump's concerns that measures to contain the virus could wreck the US economy. ""My mother is not expendable and your mother is not expendable,"" said Mr Cuomo. A minor New York celebrity who poses for tourist photos as the Naked Cowboy wears a mask in mostly deserted Times Square On Tuesday afternoon, Donald Trump sat in the verdant White House grounds for a Fox News ""virtual town hall"" and said he hoped to get US businesses reopened by Easter, in just over two weeks. ""A great American resurrection,"" the Fox host suggested. A few hours earlier, Governor Cuomo held a much more sombre press conference at the Javits Center in Manhattan. The building, which three years ago hosted Hillary Clinton's ill-fated election-night party, is now a makeshift field hospital. The president and the governor - two New Yorkers with a long history - clashed over the state's shortage of ventilators to treat the most serious cases. Mr Trump blamed Mr Cuomo for not purchasing more in 2015, citing a conspiracy-mongering website. Mr Cuomo said the administration should use its emergency powers to order more machines manufactured. When it comes to easing the recent shelter-in-place orders, governors like Mr Cuomo, not the president, will have the final say. If there's disagreement, however, the American public could be left wondering what to believe. Why Trump wants US open for business despite pandemic On Tuesday, President Trump told Fox News he hoped the country could get back to normal by Easter, which is 19 days away. Mr Trump, a Republican, said: ""We're going to be opening relatively soon... I would love to have the country opened up and just rearing to go by Easter."" He added: ""Easter is a very special day for me... and you'll have packed churches all over our country."" Coronavirus-stricken Broadway legend McNally dies Texas says abortions 'non-essential' amid pandemic US man dies after taking drug he thought stopped virus Mr Trump also warned that otherwise the country could suffer ""a massive recession or depression"". The president said: ""You're going to lose people. You're going to have suicides by the thousands. You're going to have all sorts of things happen. ""You're going to have instability. You can't just come in and say, 'Let's close up the United States of America, the most successful country in the world by far.'"" Speaking at a White House briefing later, Mr Trump said ""our decision will be based on hard facts and data as to the opening [of our country]"".

Dr Deborah Birx, of the White House coronavirus taskforce, said the New York City metro area was the source of 56% of all cases and 60% of all new cases in the country. She advised anyone leaving the region to self-quarantine for two weeks. On Tuesday, Wisconsin, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Mexico, West Virginia and Indiana were introducing stay-at-home orders, bringing the total number of US states under such lockdowns to 17. Rush hour on the New York City subway Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been debating the details of an economic stimulus package that could total over $2 trillion (Â£1.7 trillion).

Global stock markets surge after weeks of losses,"There was further financial turbulence on Tuesday when stock markets around the world climbed sharply higher, as investors grappled with the economic impact of the coronavirus. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.4% - its biggest daily gain since 1933. The S&P 500 and London's FTSE 100 enjoyed their best days since the 2008 financial crisis, rising more than 9%. The increases follow weeks of losses driven by a global economic slowdown. Business activity in the US and eurozone sank to the lowest level on record in March, according to survey data from IHS Markit, as authorities closed schools, shut businesses and limited travel in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Many countries are now working on finance packages to cushion the economic blow, but plans have received mixed responses from investors. In the US, congressional leaders said they were close to a deal on a relief package worth more than $1.8tn, which would include money to bailout industries that have been affected by the crisis. Any action by the US government would follow aggressive efforts by the Federal Reserve, including its pledge to buy as much government debt as needed to soothe markets, while also lending directly to businesses. On US stock markets, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and American Airlines were among the companies posting the biggest gains, rising 42% and 36% respectively. The spike followed comments made by President Donald Trump, who said he wanted to ease measures restricting gatherings by Easter, despite a surge of Covid-19 cases in the US. The share price gains were global, however. Germany's Dax increased almost 11%, while France's CAC 40 rose 8.4%. Earlier, Asian stocks also increased. Japan's Nikkei soared 7%, its biggest daily gain in four years, while South Korea's KOSPI exchange climbed 8.6% after the government doubled a planned economic rescue package.

the virus more effectively. Health minister Olivier VÃ©ran said the lockdown
will âlast as long as it needs toâ. France has been in lockdown since 17 March Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has donated 1m euros (Â£920,000) to help fight the coronavirus outbreak in Spain. Almost 2,700 people have now died in the country and close to 40,000 are infected. Italy is the only European country to see more cases. Guardiola, who is from Catalonia and currently at home in Barcelona, has been working with his lawyers over the past few days to decide the best way of using the money. Read morehere. Former Spain international Guardiola is an icon at Barcelona after his successes as a player and a manager Naomi Grimley, BBC News Until now, limited testing has meant that experts donât have a
hold on whoâs really had the virus and who has not. Many of us in the UK will know
someone who has been told they probably had it but they werenât allowed a
laboratory test to confirm it. Thatâs where a finger-prick antibody test to
check for immunity would make a big difference. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would be a ""game changer"". In the words of the Chief Medical Officer â Professor Chris
Whitty â it means âwe'll be able to say to somebody, you've had this virus,
youâre not likely to get it again at least in the immediate term, and now we
can be confident you can return to work and you donât
need to be taking some of the precautions youâve been taking to date."" This would be especially useful for healthcare workers whoâve
already had the virus but perhaps displayed few or no symptoms. It would
mean they wouldnât need to spend several days in self-isolation just because a
fellow family member is now sick. The news from Health Secretary Matt Hancock that the UK has now purchased 3.5 million of these
tests is especially welcome as the death toll grows. This week Spain also took
delivery of 640,000 test kits, thought to be of a similar kind, from China and
South Korea. They will be used on healthcare professionals first. Big questions still remain: not least, how reliable are these
new tests? And for how long does immunity to Covid-19 last? Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world that we have been covering over the past few hours: A US man has died and his wife is in critical condition after taking a form of a drug that has been touted by President Donald Trump as a possible treatment for the novel coronavirus. The couple took chloroquine phosphate - a form of chloroquine used to clean fish tanks - in an apparent effort to guard against Covid-19. Chloroquine itself is one of the oldest and best-known anti-malarial drugs, but the US Food and Drugs Administrationhas made it clear it has not been approved for treating those infected with the Covid-19 coronavirus. The
couple - both  in their 60s - fell ill within 30 minutes of taking the substance, said Arizona-based hospital system Banner Health. Read our full story on this casehere. Nigeria also reported cases of chloroquine poisoning that had officials there issuing their own warning: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The most common signs of Covid-19 are a fever and a dry cough, which can lead to breathing difficulties. For most people the symptoms will be mild but the coronavirus can be serious for some, including the elderly or people with certain pre-existing conditions. Some of the early symptoms can easily be confused with other winter bugs including colds and flu. But for now the UK government is advising anyone with a high temperature or a new, continuous cough sto self-isolate at home for at least seven days just in case. Under current guidance, most people may not need to get tested. If you are in the UK and worried about having the symptoms, use the NHS 111 advice servicehere,external.

Even though the decisionto postpone the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Gameslooked inevitable, today's announcement has come as a relief for the many athletes who have not been able to train properly because of the restrictions. âWe felt under pressure to train and compete,"" British swimmerAdam Peaty,who won gold at Rio 2016 in the 100m breaststroke, told BBC Sport. âThe decision from the IOC lifts that relief that we donât have to be in shape over summer and we donât have to put unnecessary risk on others.â HeptathleteKatarina Johnson-Thompson,the current world champion who was among the favourites for gold, described the postponement as ""heartbreaking"". But she also joked: ""Waited eight years for this, whatâs another one in the grand scheme of things?"" British golferJustin Rose,who described his gold-medal win four years ago as the ""biggest gift"" of his career, says he would be making the Olympics his ""priority"" in a rejigged 2021 schedule.

Read more reaction from leading athletes on BBC Sport. British swimmer Adam Peaty won Great Britain's first medal at Rio 2016 with a world record in the men's 100m breaststroke Tom FordyceBBC chief sports writer There is a moment at an Olympic Games, some point after the opening ceremony and around the time where everything around you is drama and smashed records and new heroes, when you look around and think: there is no other square mile or so of the planet that has as many people staring at it as this. That's what the summer Games do. They make you feel like you're at the centre of the world. And it's why it took the International Olympic Committee so long to realise that Tokyo 2020 had to be postponed, and why there could be no other decision. The IOC has the history, the power and the self-regard to pull off something as complicated, expensive and vainglorious as an Olympics. Those same characteristics can also leave it out of touch with wider forces at play around it. It is used to nations wooing it and coming in supplication, not the other way round.

"No extra help for airlines, chancellor says","The UK chancellor has told airlines to find other forms of funding and not turn first to the government for help getting through the coronavirus crisis. Demand for tickets has collapsed forcing companies to ground aircraft. Aviation bosses have been lobbying the government for a targeted aid package to stop firms going under as a result of the slump in demand. But in a letter on Tuesday Rishi Sunak said the government would only step in as ""a last resort"". Mr Sunak instead urged airlines to try and raise money from shareholders. He said the state would only enter into negotiations with individual airlines once they had ""exhausted other options"". The government says its emergency business measures, including a Bank of England scheme for firms to raise capital and employee wage subsidies, are available for airlines. But industry group the International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned of an ""apocalypse"" in the aviation sector as it called on governments around the world for help. The group said annual worldwide revenues from ticket sales would fall by $252bn (Â£215bn) if travel bans remain in place for three months, a drop of 44% compared to last year. ""Travel restrictions and evaporating demand mean that, aside from cargo, there is almost no passenger business,"" IATA boss Alexandre de Juniac, said. ""There is a small and shrinking window for governments to provide a lifeline of financial support to prevent a liquidity crisis from shuttering the industry."" Virgin Atlantic, Ryanair and EasyJet have all grounded most of their fleets, while BA-owner IAG has cut capacity by 75% and Norwegian Air has cancelled thousands of flights. This has also affected airports, which have cut hundreds of jobs across the UK since coronavirus arrived in the country. Karen Dee, who runs the Airport Operators Association (AOA), said the aviation industry was ""surprised"" by Mr Sunak's decision and will have to ""fight on its own to protect its workforce and its future"". ""While countries across Europe have recognised the vital role airports play and are stepping into the breach, the UK government's decision to take a case-by-case approach with dozens of UK airports is simply not feasible to provide the support necessary in the coming days,"" she said. ""Not only does the decision today leave airports struggling to provide critical services, it will hamper the UK recovery.""

Tokyo 2020 Olympics postponed until 2021,"The Olympic Games were due to run from 24 July to 9 August The Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games have been postponed until next year because of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. The event, due to begin on 24 July, will now take place ""no later than summer 2021"". ""I proposed to postpone for a year and [IOC] president Thomas Bach responded with 100% agreement,"" said Shinzo Abe, Japan's Prime Minister. The event will still be called Tokyo 2020 despite taking place in 2021. In a joint statement, the organisers of Tokyo 2020 and the IOC said: ""The unprecedented and unpredictable spread of the outbreak has seen the situation in the rest of the world deteriorating. ""On Monday, the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the Covid-19 pandemic is 'accelerating'. ""There are more than 375,000 cases now recorded worldwide and in nearly every country, and their number is growing by the hour. ""In the present circumstances and based on the information provided by the WHO today [Tuesday], the IOC president and the prime minister of Japan have concluded that the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Tokyo must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community."" 'Tokyo Olympics will be a carnival unleashed that no-one will take for granted ever again' 'Heartbreaking' but a 'relief' - how athletes reacted to Olympic delay GB Paralympians praise decision to delay Tokyo Games 'This is about protecting lives' - IOC chief says costs of Tokyo 2020 delay not discussed The Inside Track podcast: Tokyo 2020 is postponed While the Games is the biggest sporting event to be affected by the pandemic, there has been a huge impact on a host of other major tournaments and sports: In rugby union, the end of this year's Six Nations was postponed, with four outstanding fixtures to be rearranged in the men's tournament. In football, Euro 2020 was postponed and will be played in the summer of 2021, while the sport is suspended in the UK until 30 April at the earliest. The first eight grands prix of the Formula 1 season have been delayed, with the Monaco Grand Prix cancelled. County cricket in England and Wales will not be played before 28 May, while England's three-Test series against West Indies, due to start at The Oval on 4 June, is in doubt. All forms of professional tennis have been postponed until 7 June, ruling out the clay-court season, while the French Open - the year's second Grand Slam, has been rescheduled for September. Golf's Masters and PGA Championship have both been postponed, with a decision yet to be made about September's Ryder Cup. The London Marathon has been moved from 26 April to 4 October. The IOC had given itself adeadline of four weeksto consider delaying the Games but there had been mounting pressure from a host of Olympic committees and athletes demanding a quicker decision. Canada became the first major country to withdrawfrom both events on Sunday, while USA Track and Field, athletics' US governing body, had also called for a postponement. The Paralympics were due to start on 25 August but International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons said the postponement was ""the only logical option"". He added: ""The health and wellbeing of human life must always be our number-one priority and staging a sporting event of any kind during this pandemic is simply not possible. ""Sport is not the most important thing right now, preserving human life is. It is essential, therefore, that all steps are taken to try to limit the spread of this disease. ""By taking this decision now, everyone involved in the Paralympic movement, including all Para-athletes, can fully focus on their own health and wellbeing and staying safe during this unprecedented and difficult time."" World Athletics president Lord Coe said: ""The athletes have been under intolerable conditions, many of them are unable to train and many have been going through real emotional turmoil. ""The integrity of competition would have been seriously compromised if we had tried to force the Games into the remaining part of this year."" Coe, who was chairman of the London 2012 organising committee, said World Athletics was looking at moving the 2021 World Championships in Eugene, Oregon, to 2022. The Olympics have never been delayed in their 124-year modern history, though they were cancelled altogether in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during World War One and World War Two. Major Cold War boycotts disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles summer Games in 1980 and 1984. The Tokyo 2020-IOC statement continued: ""The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present. ""Therefore, it was agreed that the Olympic flame will stay in Japan. It was also agreed that the Games will keep the name Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020."" British Olympic Association chief executive Andy Anson said: ""It would have been unthinkable for us to continue to prepare for an Olympic Games at a time the nation and the world no less is enduring great hardship. A postponement is the right decision."" British Paralympics Association chief executive Mike Sharrock said: ""Stemming this global public health crisis and doing everything possible to safeguard the health and wellbeing of people should clearly take priority in these unprecedented times. ""We welcome the clarity this now gives Paralympic athletes throughout the world who have had their training and qualification plans severely disrupted."" On 22 January, Olympic qualifying events in boxing and women's football that were due to be held in Wuhan, China - the centre of the coronavirus outbreak - became the first to be moved or postponed. There have now been almost 400,000 recorded cases of the virus worldwide, with the number of deaths approaching 17,000. How coronavirus has impacted sporting events around the world The latest news on the coronavirus crisis Dan Roan, BBC sports editor This is arguably the biggest decision sport has seen in peacetime. It has looked inevitable for weeks, and many will ask why it has taken until now. With athletes unable to train safely, and the calendar of Olympic and Paralympic qualification events decimated amid travel restrictions and lockdowns, a postponement or cancellation emerged as the only viable options. Faced with the unenviable task of reorganising a sprawling mega-event that has already cost at least Â£10bn in preparations, the IOC and Japan had hoped to buy themselves some time to consider their next step. But with Olympic committees and athletes increasingly frustrated and confused at what some saw as delaying tactics, the decision was effectively taken out of the organisers' hands, and just 48 hours after the IOC said it was giving itself four weeks to mull it over, we now know the Games cannot go on as planned. The ramifications will be significant. It's a huge blow to Japan, and the country will now have to spend yet more money. Commercial contracts will have to be unpicked and the availability of venues revisited. A crowded sporting calendar will have to be flexible. And the IOC, sports federations, broadcasters, sponsors and a myriad of other related businesses will have to wait an additional year for the financial bonanza that the event generates. The Games has had to deal with many challenges over the years, from terrorism and boycotts to war and doping. But nothing quite like this. Olympians Alistair Brownlee, double Olympic triathlon champion: ""Evidently a very tough decision for the IOC and other stakeholders to make but in my opinion the right one. Both, for the message it sends to people around the world battling with the virus and to give clarity to athletes attempting to prepare."" Jazmin Sawyers, long jumper: ""The right choice. For now we have to stay home to protect ourselves and everyone else. Look after each other, sport will be here when this is over, and we will be ready to give you all the greatest show on earth."" Callum Skinner, retired cycling team sprint Olympic champion, who fronts competitor-led movement Global Athlete: ""The right decision has been made. Tokyo 2021 presents an amazing opportunity to host a full Games celebrating the world (hopefully) entering the ""post-pandemic"" phase."" Sophie McKinna, British shot putter: ""The right call in unprecedented circumstances. Welcome to #Tokyo2021 This video can not be played Olympics postponement a 'release' for athletes - Peaty Paralympians Ali Jawad, silver medal-winning powerlifter: ""The right call in unprecedented circumstances. Welcome to #Tokyo2021"" Kadeena Cox, cycling and athletics champion: ""The right choice. Health before everything.

Tokyo 2020 has been my target for the past four years. I've lived, slept and breathed it, giving me focus and drive. But it is also without doubt the right decision to have made. Back to the drawing board we go."" Dan Greaves, discus thrower: ""Absolutely the right decision to postpone both the Olympics & Paralympics by a year. Health comes first.

NY governor says infection rate worse than feared,"This video can not be played The New York Governor Andrew Cuomo: The city 'is a test case' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has pleaded for medical supplies, warning Covid-19 is spreading in his state faster than ""a bullet train"". ""The apex is higher than we thought and the apex is sooner than we thought,"" Mr Cuomo told reporters on Tuesday. He said the federal government was not sending anywhere near enough lifesaving equipment to confront the crisis. New York now has over 25,000 confirmed virus cases and at least 210 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday the US has the potential to become the new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic. The warnings come as President Donald Trump said he hoped the US would reopen for business next month. This video can not be played Trump on goal to reopen US by Easter: It's 'a beautiful timeline' ""We need federal help and we need the federal help now,"" Mr Cuomo, a Democrat, said. ""New York is the canary in the coal mine, New York is happening first, what is happening to New York will happen to California and Illinois, it is just a matter of time."" America is humbled - but there is a glimmer of hope The governor blasted the 400 ventilators sent to New York from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency. He said: ""You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators."" New York currently has 7,000 ventilators, but needs 30,000, the governor said. Mr Cuomo continued: ""The [infection] forecaster said to me, 'We were looking at a freight train coming across the country.' ""'We're now looking at a bullet train.'""

The number of new cases in the state is doubling every three days, the governor said, and showing no sign of slowing down. Mr Cuomo said the rate of infections could overwhelm the healthcare system. New York may need up to 140,000 hospital beds in a worst-case scenario, he said. The governor also said he would not ""put a dollar amount on human life"", in what was seen as an implicit criticism of Mr Trump's concerns that measures to contain the virus could wreck the US economy. ""My mother is not expendable and your mother is not expendable,"" said Mr Cuomo. A minor New York celebrity who poses for tourist photos as the Naked Cowboy wears a mask in mostly deserted Times Square On Tuesday afternoon, Donald Trump sat in the verdant White House grounds for a Fox News ""virtual town hall"" and said he hoped to get US businesses reopened by Easter, in just over two weeks. ""A great American resurrection,"" the Fox host suggested. A few hours earlier, Governor Cuomo held a much more sombre press conference at the Javits Center in Manhattan. The building, which three years ago hosted Hillary Clinton's ill-fated election-night party, is now a makeshift field hospital. The president and the governor - two New Yorkers with a long history - clashed over the state's shortage of ventilators to treat the most serious cases. Mr Trump blamed Mr Cuomo for not purchasing more in 2015, citing a conspiracy-mongering website. Mr Cuomo said the administration should use its emergency powers to order more machines manufactured. When it comes to easing the recent shelter-in-place orders, governors like Mr Cuomo, not the president, will have the final say. If there's disagreement, however, the American public could be left wondering what to believe. Why Trump wants US open for business despite pandemic On Tuesday, President Trump told Fox News he hoped the country could get back to normal by Easter, which is 19 days away. Mr Trump, a Republican, said: ""We're going to be opening relatively soon... I would love to have the country opened up and just rearing to go by Easter."" He added: ""Easter is a very special day for me... and you'll have packed churches all over our country."" Coronavirus-stricken Broadway legend McNally dies Texas says abortions 'non-essential' amid pandemic US man dies after taking drug he thought stopped virus Mr Trump also warned that otherwise the country could suffer ""a massive recession or depression"".

You can't just come in and say, 'Let's close up the United States of America, the most successful country in the world by far.'"" Speaking at a White House briefing later, Mr Trump said ""our decision will be based on hard facts and data as to the opening [of our country]"".

Four things about coronavirus in London,"There have been more than 600 confirmed cases of coronavirus in London Five and a half weeks since the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in London, the number of cases in the capital was approaching 2,500 on Monday and deaths there made up a third of the UK total. The BBC asked epidemiologists to look at data provided by Public Health England. They drew these conclusions. The fact that the number of confirmed cases in the capital has been doubling every two or three days is cause for alarm, the experts say. ""The line for London going up in that exponential way is an indication that the epidemic is out of control,"" says Prof Eric Brunner of University College London. ""On this accelerated part of the curve you need to do everything you can to reduce contact between people that is not absolutely essential,"" says Dr Gary Slutkin, who led the WHO programme on the Aids crisis in the 1990s. Both Prof Brunner and Dr Slutkin back tough measures to enforce social distancing, of the kind Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday evening. But Prof Brunner points out that sanctions are still not being applied to people leaving their homes as strictly as they are in Italy. ""It is still not clear what the reasons are for that,"" he says. ""Perhaps that is so they can avoid a formal state of emergency and so they don't alienate the population. But the behaviour of a population has to change very, very fast to prevent this epidemic becoming a disaster."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson told people to stay home to curb the ""accelerating"" spread of the coronavirus On a more positive note, Dr Slutkin adds: ""It is very, very encouraging that if you do it very well, new cases do stop."" The statistics we have are for confirmed cases, the unconfirmed cases are impossible to count. But could these numbers offer a small glimmer of light? On Monday 16 March, when there were 480 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the capital, this number doubled in two days. It was the same on Tuesday 17 March. But it took four days for the 1,221 cases registered on Thursday 19 March to double, reaching yesterday's total of 2,443. Dr Michael Head of the University of Southampton says it's too early to say whether this was the result of earlier measures to encourage social distancing, or just ""natural variation"". ""We will see bumps in the grass on the way up and the way down,"" he says. ""With any big change it can take a while to filter through to the data. It's very much, 'Watch this space.'"" The reason the curve is steeper in London than elsewhere is that it has ""more people, more interactions"" says Dr Slutkin. The virus may also have arrived in London earlier, he says. In densely populated areas, says Dr Head, there are a larger number of ""clearly defined contacts"" - for example people seated less than 2m apart in restaurants and pubs. All of the 20 most densely populated districts in England are in Greater London. The fact that more people travel into and out of London from abroad or from other parts of the UK will also have contributed to the epidemic in the city, he says. Many markets and stalls across London have had to stop trading because of the coronavirus On the other hand, he doesn't think public transport in the capital is likely to have been a major contributing factor ""due to the relatively short time periods of being in close proximity to an infected person"" while travelling. Prof Brunner thinks other parts of the country appear to be a week or so behind London. And Dr Head draws attention to Wales, where the number of cases has begun to increase more steeply than in other parts of the UK. ""The UK is two weeks behind Italy and it's possible that Wales could be a week behind London. It's something to keep an eye on,"" he says. The first confirmed case in London was recorded on 13 February, when a woman who had recently returned from China went to Lewisham Hospital in the back of an Uber. Five weeks on and London is a totally different city - with life virtually on hold. Seven boroughs now have more than 100 confirmed cases - Southwark (154), Brent (143), Lambeth (134), Westminster (134), Harrow (113), Wandsworth (113), and Ealing (106). Wembley Stadium displayed a message of thanks to the NHS and lit its arch blue Measured by cases per 100,000 inhabitants, the borough with the biggest problem is Kensington and Chelsea with 54.4 cases per 100,000 people followed by Westminster on 52.5 and Southwark on 48.5. Kensington and Chelsea had the highest number of cases early in the outbreak. Prof Brunner says he has heard the rumour that some of these cases, and others across the capital, resulted from people returning from skiing holidays in northern Italy - but he says this is speculation. Dr Head argues against reading too much into the differences between London boroughs at this stage in the epidemic. He says the numbers can be expected to fluctuate as the outbreak continues. One study, which has yet to be endorsed by other experts in the field, suggests the NHS's 4,132 critical care beds for adults and312 for children could be filled by Covid-19 patients in a week,external. Another study, also not yet peer-reviewed, points out that the UK's hospital beds are not evenly distributed across the country and that there are potential ""hospital deserts"" - it mentions the Isle of Wight and Powys in Wales as examples. In London it says a pressure point could be the borough of Harrow, where there is a higher than average number of beds per person - but also a higher number of older people, who are likely to be more seriously affected by Covid-19. Northwick Park Hospital in London declared a 'critical incident' due to a surge in patients with coronavirus The borough of Newham, by contrast, has far fewer hospital beds per person, but the average age is much lower, so its hospitals are considered less likely to become ""overburdened"". The authors say a ""critical incident"" declared at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow on Thursday, when it ran out of intensive care beds, was a realisation of their prediction, but they also point out that in urban areas it is easier to move patients to other hospitals.

Coronavirus deaths: What we don't know,"Each day, news of more deaths is distressing to people across the country - as well as a tragedy for the families involved. Projections of how bad the outbreak could get have prompted ministers to put the country into lockdown. But what are we learning about the impact of the virus and the deaths it is causing? The death figures being reported daily are hospital cases where a person dies with the coronavirus infection in their body - because it is a notifiable disease cases have to be reported. But what the figures do not tell us is to what extent the virus is causing the death. It could be the major cause, a contributory factor or simply present when they are dying of something else. For example, an 18-year-old in Coventry tested positive for coronavirus the day before he died and was reported as its youngest victim at the time. But the hospital subsequently released a statement saying his death had been due to a separate ""significant"" health condition and not connected to the virus. There are, however, other cases, including health workers, where people have died with no known health conditions. The Office for National Statisticshas tried to shed light on this,external. It looked at nearly 4,000 deaths in England and Wales during March. There were two main findings. Firstly, the virus was the cause of the majority of deaths, not other factors. But secondly, nine in 10 did have pre-existing illnesses, such as heart disease and respiratory problems that put them at heightened risk of death anyway. It is clear that the number of people who are dying is increasing. The ONS has started to track this as well on a weekly basis - and unlike the daily government figures, which largely focus on hospital deaths, it is taking into account deaths in the community. Themost recent data,externalgoes up to the start of April. It shows in the week ending 3 April there were 16,000 deaths - 6,000 more than could be expected at this time of the year when the number of deaths normally starts to fall with winter over. This is the highest death number since these figures were first published in 2005, more than the previous peak seen during the bad flu outbreak of 2015. Not all these extra deaths were down to coronavirus, but a significant number were. What we do not know is what will happen to these numbers in the future and whether in a few months time deaths will drop below expected levels. If that happened, it would suggest coronavirus has brought forward deaths that you would expect to happen over the course of the next year. Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. And the frail and elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus. Nearly 10% of people aged over 80 will die in the next year, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter at the University of Cambridge points out, and the risk of them dying if infected with coronavirus is almost exactly the same. That does not mean there will be no extra deaths - but, Sir David says, there will be ""a substantial overlap"". ""Many people who die of Covid [the disease caused by coronavirus] would have died anyway within a short period,"" he says. Knowing exactly how many is impossible to tell at this stage. Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead modeller at Imperial College London, has suggested it could be up to two-thirds. But while deaths without the virus would be spread over the course of a year, those with the virus could come more quickly - that, of course, was the logic for the lockdown to stop the health service being overwhelmed. When it comes to flu, experts track what are called excess deaths. During recent winters, there have been about 17,000 excess deaths a year, Public Health England says. This, of course, can be done in the future only - it is why the ONS says it is too early to understand the true impact coronavirus is having on deaths. Work also needs to be done to calculate the indirect impact of coronavirus and the lockdown. The 6,000 extra weekly deaths identified by the ONS contained 2,500 which were not reported to be because of coronavirus infections. Experts have suggested they could be related to people being deterred from seeking treatment for medical emergencies such as strokes or heart attacks. This is why the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty was stressing on Thursday the ""NHS was open for business"". Prof Robert Dingwall from Nottingham Trent University says there will certainly be ""collateral damage"" from other factors such as: mental health problems and suicides linked to self-isolation heart problems from lack of activity the impact on health from increased unemployment and reduced living standards Others have also pointed to the health cost from steps such as delaying routine operations and cancer screening. Meanwhile, University of Bristol researchers say the benefit of a long-term lockdown in reducing premature deaths could be outweighed by the lost life expectancy from a prolonged economic dip. And the tipping point, they say, is a 6.4% decline in the size of the economy - on a par with what happened following the 2008 financial crash. It would see a loss of three months of life on average across the population because of factors such declining living standards and poorer health care. The problem the government and its advisers face is that they cannot make decisions with the benefit of hindsight - they have to react to emerging evidence. Currently, the lockdown is aimed at suppressing the spread of the virus. Once the peak has passed decisions will have to be made about what to do next. The virus will not simply have gone away, and with a vaccine at least a year away the challenge will be how to manage it. A balance will need to be struck between keeping it at bay and trying to control its spread to avoid a second peak, while at the same time allowing the country to return to normal. Seeing the full picture in terms of lives saved and lives lost will be essential in getting those calls right. LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do?

Supermarkets limit shoppers as rules tighten,"Visits to stores will now be carefully regulated Visit a supermarket today and you're likely to be greeted outside by a member of staff. But they won't be helping you with your shopping. Instead they'll be ensuring you stick to the new strict social-distancing rules that have applied since Monday evening. At Waitrose you'll be met by a marshal, while at M&S they're called greeters. Asda will also station more staff at its shop doors to ""greet"" customers. Their jobs are exactly the same: to ensure only a limited number of shoppers enter stores at any one time. They also check people are queuing responsibly and that shoppers wait patiently and stand two metres away from each other. Shopping is no longer a leisure activity. Instead, visits to a store - which you're only supposed to make to pick up essentials - will be carefully regulated. The rules are as much to protect store workers as shoppers. Indeed, Lidl, Morrisons, Aldi, Iceland and Sainsbury's have all installed protective screens for staff, while Waitrose has ordered screens and visors for its workers. Aldi is one of the supermarkets installing protective glass You'll see staff wearing gloves and plenty of hand-sanitisers near tills and other areas. They also no longer want your cash. Instead, supermarkets are trying to encourage shoppers to pay by contactless card to cut down on potentially virus-covered cash being passed around the population. You'll see posters encouraging you to look after yourself and treat staff well. Wetherspoon boss tells staff to get a job at Tesco Buy responsibly and think of others, shoppers told Supermarket workers facing coronavirus 'abuse' And on the floor, there are markings to show where it is safe to stand and when queuing. At Sainsbury's, there's tape marking out the correct two metre distance to maintain between customers in a queue. Tesco has lines on the floor and around checkouts to help shoppers with social-distancing measures. Tesco has marked the floor to help shoppers keep their distance from one another If you think you can avoid the new tightly-regulated in-store experience by getting a home delivery, you may be in for a disappointment. Some people are having to wait weeks for an available slot as online systems struggle to cope with demand. Visitors to online store Ocado on Tuesday were greeted with the message: ""You are in a virtual queue to log in. Once you have logged in you may need to queue again to shop."" Samantha Ward, who went into self-isolation last week when her husband developed Covid-19 symptoms, is struggling to get any supplies. ""Every day since self-isolating, I've been trying to place an online shopping order with all of the main supermarkets but there have been no available slots for weeks ahead."" ""Friends who have been going on shopping expeditions for me come back with very little,"" she reports. ""Supermarket shelves are stripped bare. But ironically, I'm regularly receiving standardised emails from the bosses of major stores reassuring me that there is plenty of food to go round!"" Some Ocado shoppers had to enter a a virtual queue to log in. There's also the Click+Collect option, where customers can arrange to pick up goods at their local store if they can't get a delivery slot. But that can prove a problem too, as Maidenhead-based shopper Lisa Bull discovered. ""I booked a click-and-collect with Tesco as there were no delivery slots available. Throughout the week, I edited my order as I thought of things I and my self-isolating elderly parents needed. ""When I edited my order on Monday morning, I was then unable to check out and my whole shop was cancelled."" ""It is an extremely busy time for both our stores and our delivery service and availability is challenging across many products,"" A Tesco spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We're doing our best to make sure people can get the food and items they need."" What are the new restrictions? New guidance from the government,externalsays people should now only leave home for the following reasons: Shopping for essentials such as food and medicine, with trips made as infrequently as possible One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk or cycle. This should be done alone or only with people you live with Any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. This includes moving children under the age of 18 between their parents' homes, where applicable. Key workers or those with children identified as vulnerable can still take their children to school Travelling to and from work, but only where it absolutely cannot be done from home Businesses that are allowed to stay open under the strict new guidelines include supermarkets, banks, pharmacies, post offices, corner shops or market stalls selling food and restaurants that offer a takeaway service.

Artists and venues get Â£160m emergency relief,"Theatres, galleries, museums and artists in England who have been hit by the impact of coronavirus will have access to a Â£160m emergency fund. Arts Council England has announced the cash injection to help artists, venues and freelancers in the cultural sector. It comes after venues like theatres and galleries were ordered to shut. Meanwhile, Netflix has added a further boost to the artistic community by donating Â£1m to an industry-backed film and TV emergency relief fund. Most film and TV productions have been put on hold in recent weeks. The impact of the pandemic has left many of those in the UK's arts and culture sectors facing reduced incomes and uncertain futures, and the government has been criticised for a lack of support for the self-employed. Why is it taking so long to help the self-employed? 'How is Â£94 a week going to pay anyoneâs bills?â The Arts Council's support package includes Â£20m for individuals (made up of grants of up to Â£2,500 each),  Â£90m for National Portfolio Organisations - venues and others that get annual funding - and Â£50m for organisations outside that scheme. The money has been found by diverting funds from National Lottery project grants and development funds, and from emergency reserves. The first payments are expected to be made within six weeks. 'Nourish the imagination' Arts Council England chair Sir Nicholas Serota said: ""Covid-19 is having an impact globally, far beyond the cultural sector - but our responsibility is to sustain our sector as best we can, so that artists and organisations can continue to nourish the imagination of people across the country, both during the crisis and in the period of recovery. ""None of us can hope to weather this storm alone, but by working together in partnership, I believe we can emerge the stronger, with ideas shared, new ways of working, and new relationships forged at the local, national and even international level,"" he added. West End shuts down after PM's coronavirus advice Actors use Zoom to save children's birthday parties Also on Tuesday, Netflix announced a Â£1m donation to the BFI and The Film and TV Charity's emergency relief fund, which will similarly support workers in need of short-term help. Alex Pumfrey, chief executive of the Film and TV Charity, said the money comes at a time when ""the film and TV industry is now facing a huge threat"". ""Many freelancers have seen their livelihoods disappear overnight,"" he said. ""We're entering a period of unprecedented isolation and worry for a workforce that we know from our research already suffers from poor mental health. ""Which is why I'm incredibly pleased that Netflix and the BFI are working with us to kick-start this new Covid-19 Film and TV Emergency Relief Fund to support workers across the UK's film and TV industry."" BFI chief executive Ben Roberts added that ""freelance professionals are the backbone of our film and television industries"", and are among the ""hardest hit at this extraordinary time of need"".

Ex-girlfriend of schoolgirls' killer to be charged,"Karen Hadaway (left) and Nicola Fellows were found strangled in Wild Park, Brighton A former girlfriend of schoolgirls killer Russell Bishop is to be charged with perverting the course of justice. Jennifer Johnson, 54, of Brighton, has been summonsed over the failed 1987 prosecution of Bishop who was cleared of killing Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows. He was convicted in 2018. The two nine-year-olds were found sexually assaulted and strangled in woodland in Brighton in October 1986. Ms Johnson faces charges over her police statements and court evidence. Bishop, who attacked another child in 1990, was found guilty in December 2018 of Karen and Nicola's murders. The bodies of the girls were found in a dense wooded area of Wild Park, on the edge of Brighton, half a mile from their homes. A Sussex Police spokesman said: ""We have ensured that the families of Karen and Nicola, and the victim of Russell Bishop in 1990, are fully aware of this significant development in the case and we will continue to keep them informed.""

Wetherspoon boss tells staff to get a job at Tesco,"The boss of the Wetherspoon pub chain has said its staff can take jobs with supermarkets amid the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Tim Martin told 40,000 workers in a video that they should feel free to take jobs at retailers such as Tesco while Wetherspoon pubs remain closed. He said: âIf youâre offered a jobâ¦ if you think itâs a good idea, do it.â The government has said it will pay 80% of salary forworkers at firms such as Wetherspoon affected by Covid-19. In the video, he called the government proposals âgreat, because we currently have no money coming in through the tills. Thatâs not something we had ever planned for.â All of Wetherspoon's 850 UK pubs were closed over the weekend after the government introduced new measures to try to stop the spread of Covid-19. Sports Direct U-turns on opening after backlash Supermarkets go on hiring spree amid virus crisis However, Mr Martin cited concerns that there could be some delay to the payment of any wage subsidy. In the video, he said he would therefore âcompletely understandâ if workers did not want âto wait aroundâ. He added that any former workers for the pub chain would receive first priority on future applications to rejoin the company. Tesco is looking to take on 20,000 temporary workers Mr Martin said that âalmost all of our trade has now gone to supermarketsâ, as demand for food surges as a result of the coronavirus crisis. âWeâve had lots of calls from supermarkets, Tesco alone want to recruit more than 20,000 people - more than half the number of people who work at our pubs,â he added. Mr Martin was previously resistant to government advice to consumers on avoiding pubs before more formal measures on closures were introduced. Last week,he branded a shutdown in the face of coronavirus ""over the top"". Many major supermarkets have been recruiting thousands of staff to cope with the huge surge in demand from shoppers. Tesco, the UKâs biggest supermarket, said it wanted to take on 20,000 temporary workers to âhelp feed the nationâ. Other firms that have launched a recruitment drive in recent weeks include Aldi, which is creating 5,000 new temporary posts, Lidl with 2,500 temporary posts, and Morrisons, which is creating 3,500 new jobs including pickers, drivers and staff for its distribution centres.

UK wakes to strict new measures,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You must stay at home"" Boris Johnson has outlined strict new measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus, including a ban on public gatherings of more than two people. He said people should only leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work ""where this is absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and fulfil any medical or care needs. He also ordered the immediate closure of shops selling non-essential goods. But police said they had received lots of calls asking what was still allowed. In the UK, 340 people have died with the virus. On Monday evening,27 million TV viewers watched Mr Johnsontell the country it was facing a ""moment of national emergency"" and that staying at home was necessary to protect the NHS, save lives and tackle ""the biggest threat this country has faced for decades"". Police and local authorities will have powers to disperse gatherings, including through fines. The restrictions would be under constant review and a relaxation of the rules would be considered in three weeks, he said. ""To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well,"" the prime minister said. For the first time,all the UK's mobile networks are sending out a government messageon Tuesday morning to their customers with details of the new measures. Johnson's coronavirus address in full LIVE:Latest updates A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW GUIDANCE:What must I do? NEW RESTRICTIONS:What are they? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The new measures come after a sunny weekend during which crowds of people were seen at beaches, parks, markets and other public spaces. The new guidance,externalsays people should only leave their homes for: Shopping for basic necessities such as food and medicine. Shopping trips should be as infrequent as possible One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk or cycle. This should be done alone or only with people you live with Any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. This includes moving children under the age of 18 between their parents' homes, where applicable. Key workers or those with children identified as vulnerable can continue to take their children to school Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home Even when following the above guidance, people should minimise the amount of time spent out of their homes and should keep two metres (6ft) away from people they do not live with. The parents of thousands of children are keeping them out of school to try to reduce the spread of the virus. Downing Street said school attendance in England was about 10% on Monday. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said employers should take ""every possible step"" to allow for remote working, but added: ""I want to be absolutely clear, when people absolutely can not work from home they can still go to work - indeed it's important that they do to keep the country running."" The government is also stopping all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies - but funerals attended by immediate family members are allowed. Downing Street said the use of fines, starting at Â£30, would be targeted at dispersing gatherings, and failure to pay could lead to criminal proceedings and a summary conviction. These measures represent some of the most far-reaching curbs on personal freedom ever introduced in the UK in peacetime. But it is unclear how the rules can be made to work. The first hurdle is to get them on to the statute book; although the prime minister said the restrictions on travel and gatherings would come into effect immediately, police don't have the powers to enforce them yet, nor have they had official guidance. The second issue - assuming legal regulations are approved later this week - is the practical difficulty of getting groups to disperse and accurately identifying people who should not be on the streets, without losing public goodwill and sparking disorder. When efforts to persuade those who do not comply have failed, officers will be able to issue fines, with prosecutions likely to be a last resort. But at a time when officer numbers are increasingly depleted through illness and self-isolation, forces will be hoping communities do the right thing without the need for intervention.

Mr Gove said all major construction work should go ahead but jobs carried out at close quarters in someone's home would not be appropriate. As critics, including London Mayor Sadiq Khan, questioned his approach, Crossrail and housebuilder Taylor Wimpey suspended work. However, competitor Redrow said its sites remained open with ""strict precautions"" in place. The mayor has also warned London Underground commuters that if they do not stop packing into trains, more people will die. Mayor: 'Stop Tube travel or more will die' UK construction workers fear for their safety Why is it taking so long to help the self-employed? Premises such as libraries, non-essential shops, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship have been ordered to close. Hotels, hostels, campsites and caravan parks must also close unless key workers need to stay there, or if others staying there cannot get back home. Parks will remain open for exercise but people are not allowed to gather in groups. Golf courses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will shut - and in Scotland, golfers have been asked not to play. Community centres can stay open but only for the purpose of ""hosting essential voluntary or public services"" such as food banks or service for homeless people, the guidance says. Barristers have been told not to attend Crown Court unless they are involved in one of the 34 ongoing trials in England and Wales. On Monday night, the government changed its travel guidance, advisingall British people travelling abroad to return to the UK now.,external Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said this was ""because of the rate of new border restrictions"" and those needing urgent assistance should call the local UK embassy or high commissioner. Soldiers deliver protective equipment to doctors and nurses working at St Thomas' Hospital in London Prisoners in England and Wales will be confined to their cells for 23 hours a day and allowed out only to shower and use pay-phones, with all visits cancelled, the BBC understands. More than 83,000 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus with 6,710 testing positive. However, the true number of cases will be far higher as tests are primarily done on hospital patients with symptoms of the virus. It seems hard to overstate how huge an impact this will have on the country, and what a massive decision this is for the government to have taken - whose effect will last at least for a period of three weeks at the shortest, potentially for very much longer. Remember this though is not quite the kind of total crackdown we have seen in other countries - at least not yet. Not surprisingly, there is already therefore enormous controversy about whether the UK has been acting fast enough. Read more from Laura But there were calls for more information about the guidance. Lincolnshire Police warned of an ""extremely high volume"" of calls and Humberside Chief Constable Lee Freeman said his force had received ""a number of calls"" on the subject, which he said he was unable to answer. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said enforcing the new restrictions would be ""a real, real challenge"", as there was already ""large amounts of sickness"" among officers across London. Later, the National Police Chiefs' Council said officers would not be deployed on patrol specifically to police social distancing rules but would still patrol their communities ""as always"". Home Secretary Priti Patel saidin a tweet,externalthat the next few weeks would be ""testing"" for police but she would make sure officers had ""the resources they need to keep themselves and the public safe"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the measures were ""the right response"" but called for more guidance on workplace closures. Unite union boss Len McCluskey said millions of workers were confused about whether they should be at work, while millions of self-employed and insecure workers were dreading being sent home because it would mean no wages. Asked in the Commons about help for the UK's five million self-employed workers, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was ""determined to find a way"" to support them, and was looking at the matter in ""immense detail and at pace"". The prime minister said he knew the ""damage"" the restrictions were causing to people's lives, businesses and jobs - and said ""many lives will sadly be lost"" despite the measures. But he added there was ""a clear way through"", by strengthening the NHS with former clinicians returning to work, accelerating the search for treatments and a vaccine and buying millions of testing kits.

Trump wants US open for business,"This video can not be played Trump backs away as official mentions fever As a growing number of states issue ""shelter in place"" orders, businesses shutter and Americans everywhere are told to limit outings and practise social distancing, Donald Trump may be having second thoughts. For more than a week, Trump administration officials and state leaders have been talking of the need to ""bend the curve"" of the coronavirus outbreak, limiting the spread of the illness to prevent the American healthcare system from being overwhelmed. The steep economic toll, however, is becoming increasingly apparent. Last week Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin predicted that US unemployment could reach 20%. On Thursday the Treasury Department will release last week's new jobless claims, and the numbers are sure to be in the millions. A Goldman Sachs report estimated thatthe nation's gross domestic product in the second quarter could shrink by 24%,external, dwarfing the previous 10% record decline in 1958. But at Monday's White House coronavirus news conference, the president said: ""America will again and soon be open for business."" In the late hours of Sunday night, Trump had vented his concerns. ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" he tweeted, using the all-caps he reserves for matters of apparent urgency. ""AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!"" The 15-day period the president referenced began on 16 March, when the White House announced new Centers for Disease Control guidelines encouraging all Americans to work from home when possible and limit gatherings of more than 10 people. As is often the case, the president's tweet may have been prompted by watching a segment on Fox News. On Sunday evening, host (and former advisor to then-British PM David Cameron) Steve Hilton warned that an economic collapse would itself result in avoidable deaths and other hardships - that the ""cure"" could be worse than the ""disease"". ""Our ruling class and their TV mouthpieces whipping up fear over this virus, they can afford an indefinite shutdown,"" Hilton said. ""Working Americans can't. They'll be crushed by it.""

Trump's faithful may be inching back to the view they held a few weeks ago, that the virus is being used by the president's political enemies todamage his political standing by damaging the economy. On Monday morning the president continued on this theme, with a flurry of retweets of accounts (some with only a few hundred followers) who were calling for Americans to be allowed to return to work after the 15-day period ended. Former top Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn also joined the chorus, albeit somewhat obliquely. ""Is it time to start discussing the need for a date when the economy can turn back on?"" he asked on Twitter. ""Policymakers have taken bold public health and economic actions to address the coronavirus, but businesses need clarity. Otherwise they will assume the worst and make decisions to survive."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash This conclusion among conservatives is not universal, however. On Sunday Steve Bannon, a former senior Trump campaign and White House staffer who has repeatedly fallen in and out of favour with the president, advocated for a ""hammer"" style imposition of rigorous separation. ""Drop the hammer, don't mitigate the virus, don't spread the curve, shatter the curve,"" he said during a Fox News morning interview. ""Go full hammer on the virus right now with a full shutdown, use the stimulus to bridge the economic crisis."" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who frequently has the president's ear, issued his own warning, garnished with a bit of praise. ""President Trump's best decision was stopping travel from China early on,"" he writes. ""I hope we will not undercut that decision by suggesting we back off aggressive containment policies within the United States."" Allow Twitter content?

Graham somewhat misrepresented the administration's 31 January order that only limited entry by non-US-resident foreign nationals who had been in China in the previous two weeks, but the move has been touted by the president as evidence that he acted early to deal with the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, others in the Trump administration continue to stress the need for rigorous social distancing - which suggests that there could be growing divisions between medical professionals in the administration and those whose focus on the economic impact. US plans to pay Americans as part of $1tn stimulus A visual guide to the economic impact of coronavirus On Monday morning, for instance, Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that the worst was yet to come. ""I want America to understand, this week, it's going to get bad,"" he said in a television interview. ""And right now there are not enough people out there who are taking this seriously."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: Trump blames media for virus spread Any move by the administration to ease guidelines could also set up a clash with state governors, a growing number of whom are moving toward greater, not lesser, restrictions on movement and gatherings. One of the much-touted strengths of the US federalist system of government is it allows states - the so-called ""laboratories of democracy"" - freedom to devise their own policies and solutions to pressing political concerns. That system has never been tested quite like this, however, as some governors warn of the risks of a patchwork response to a national health crisis The president underlined this potential for conflict in a tweet on Sunday afternoon swiping at Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who had earlier criticised the administration's coronavirus response. @JBPritzker, Governor of Illinois, and a very small group of certain other Governors, together with Fake News @CNN & Concast (MSDNC), shouldn't be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings,"" he wrote.

The president, it appears, is being pulled in multiple directions and, as he often does, is airing his internal dialogue on Twitter. At his press conference on Monday, he seemed to be tilting away from his medical advisers. ""If it were up to the doctors, they may say let's keep it shut down - let's shut down the entire world,"" he said. ""You can't do that with a country - especially the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world."" He has described himself as a ""wartime president"" doing battle against the spread of this virus, but he's also spent much of the past year building a November re-election campaign around the claim that he has presided over record economic growth and low unemployment - both of which seem to be evaporating. Trump to deploy National Guard in three states Pandemic throws US primary elections into uncertainty And not only is Trump looking at this as a president whose re-election could hinge on an economic rebound, he is also a businessman watching his life's work - his empire of resorts, hotels and golf courses, some of which were reportedly already in financial trouble - face an existential crisis. ""At a certain point, we have to get open and have to get moving,"" Trump said on Monday, referring to the US economy. ""We don't want to lose these companies, we don't want to lose these workers, we want to take care of our workers, so we'll be doing something I think relatively quickly."" The three-plus years of Trump's administration have already had enough turmoil and drama - much of it self-created - to fill an entire two terms.

Calls for clarity over new curbs on life in UK,"Construction workers are among those calling for action to protect them People can go to work if they cannot do their work at home, the health secretary has said, amid confusion over the new coronavirus restrictions. It comes after calls for clarity, including from construction workers, about Monday's wider shutdown measures. Matt Hancock also said Tube services should be running ""in full"", after being asked aboutpacked trains during Tuesday's morning commute. The number of UK deaths rose to 422 on Tuesday, a rise of 87 in one day. As it continues to ramp up its response to the number of people testing positive for the disease, the governmentis opening a new makeshift hospitalat the ExCel exhibition centre in London. The temporary Nightingale Hospital has been set up with help from the military and will have capacity for 4,000 patients. Mr Hancock also appealed for 250,000 volunteers to help the NHS, and said more than 11,000 former medics had answered the government's call to return to the NHS. More than 24,000 final-year student nurses and medics will also join the health service. Mr Hancock led Tuesday's daily Downing Street briefing - which saw reporters asking questions over video-link - after complaints that part of the government's strict new rules were confusing for workers. Thenew measures, in place for at least three weeks, tell Britons to only leave home to go to work ""where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home"".

Johnson's coronavirus address in full What we don't know about coronavirus deaths In pictures: The quiet streets of the UK On Tuesday, pictures showedworkers in London crowding into Tube carriages- despite warnings that, even when out in public, people should keep two metres (6ft) away from others. Unions and workers in the construction industryhave called for protection, saying their work is not essential and puts people's health at risk. And Piers Morgan highlighted the issue on ITV's Good Morning Britain when he showed images of construction workers working at London's Heathrow Airport and said: ""Ask yourself a moral question: what are you doing? Do the right thing. Do you have to be out there? Can this work wait? You need to get your priorities right."" He then interviewed London's mayor Sadiq Khan who said that, in his view, construction workers should not be going to work and that he had made that point ""quite forcefully"" to Boris Johnson. Asked about the issue at the briefing, Mr Hancock said people whose jobs has not already been shut down by the government measures to date should continue to work but should only be travelling to a workplace ""where that work can't be done at home"". He said construction workers - many of whom work outdoors - could and should continue to go to work as long as they are able to remain two metres apart at all times.

Construction workers are still being told to come to work, according to Andrew Lee Davis, 36, a civil engineer based in Newport, south Wales. ""We can't just go home because we won't be paid,"" he told the BBC. Self-employed workers may have to rely on the benefits system as things stand. However, benefits may not come through on time, or be enough to pay the bills, Mr Davis said. ""Morally, I know I should stay at home, but I'm absolutely tied here. Until the government pay the self-employed, I've got to come into work."" If he were to stay home, Mr Davis, who helps support his wife and three children, would have to rely on his savings. Those would not last for the duration of the crisis, he said. ""There's a lot of worried boys here on site,"" he said. Many of them are on minimum wage, self-employed and without savings, which puts them in a more precarious financial position. Some big contractors are telling subcontractors to continue working, which Mr Davis says could put extra strain on the NHS in a time of crisis. He would like major contractors to shut non-essential sites, even though this could cost him valuable work. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for ""clear and unambiguous advice around which workers can and can't go out"". He said he believed just key workers - those whose jobs are considered essential andincluded on a government list,external- should go to work. Mr Hancock also said Transport for London ""should have the tube running in full so that people travelling on the tube are spaced out and can be further apart"". ""And there is no good reason in the information that I've seen that the current levels of tube provision should be as low as they are,"" he said.

Her family said it was heartbreaking not being able to kiss her goodbye because of how contagious the disease is, adding they did not want her simply to be remembered as a statistic. Brenda Doherty said her mother Ruth was a strong woman Earlier, Mr Hancock told MPs the government was ""ramping up testing as fast as we can"" and it was buying ""millions of tests"" which it would ""make available as quickly as possible"". He also said the government was working to ensure victims of domestic violence who are forced to stay at home would get support. Police chiefs said phone lines were inundated with calls after the prime minister's statement, as people rang to ask what they were still allowed to do. The British Transport Police said it was deploying 500 officers to patrol stations across the country and remind people to follow government advice. The PM's official spokesman said the overwhelming majority of people ""can be expected to follow the rules without any need for enforcement action"". But the punishment in England for not complying would be a fixed penalty notice initially set at Â£30 for people breaking the rule of no public gatherings of three people or more. ""We will keep this under review and can increase it significantly if it is necessary to ensure public compliance,"" the spokesman added.

According to the latest Department of Health figures,,externalthere are now more than 8,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. The latest people to have diedinclude Ruth Burke, 82, in County Antrim. Her family said it was heartbreaking not being able to kiss her goodbye because of how contagious the disease is, adding they did not want her simply to be remembered as a statistic. Brenda Doherty said her mother Ruth was a strong woman Earlier, Mr Hancock told MPs the government was ""ramping up testing as fast as we can"" and it was buying ""millions of tests"" which it would ""make available as quickly as possible"". He also said the government was working to ensure victims of domestic violence who are forced to stay at home would get support. Police chiefs said phone lines were inundated with calls after the prime minister's statement, as people rang to ask what they were still allowed to do. The British Transport Police said it was deploying 500 officers to patrol stations across the country and remind people to follow government advice. The PM's official spokesman said the overwhelming majority of people ""can be expected to follow the rules without any need for enforcement action"". But the punishment in England for not complying would be a fixed penalty notice initially set at Â£30 for people breaking the rule of no public gatherings of three people or more. ""We will keep this under review and can increase it significantly if it is necessary to ensure public compliance,"" the spokesman added. Meanwhile, Police Scotlandwill not hesitate to enforce the new measures,the force's chief constable said. Children can visit separated parents during restrictions Four things stats say about coronavirus in London Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said enforcing the new restrictions would be ""a real, real challenge"", as there was already ""large amounts of sickness"" among officers across London.

'How is Â£94 a week going to pay anyoneâs bills?â Labour's Rachel Reeves said there was ""a worrying gap"" in the government's strategy when it came to self-employed workers. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Sunak said work is going on in Whitehall to come up with a ""deliverable and fair"" support package. ""There are genuine practical and principled reasons why it is incredibly complicated to design an analogous scheme to the one that we have for employed workers,"" he added, but said he was ""determined to find a way to support them"".

Boris Johnson's address in full,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has used a national TV address to set out strict new measures aimed at protecting people from the coronavirus outbreak. This is his statement in full: ""Good evening, The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades - and this country is not alone. All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help. And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won't be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses. More than 6,000 people have been infected with the coronavirus in the UK And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it's vital to slow the spread of the disease. Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS's ability to cope - and save more lives. And that's why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic. The restrictions will ban gatherings of more than two people who are not in the same household And though huge numbers are complying - and I thank you all - the time has now come for us all to do more. From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction -  you must stay at home. Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households. That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible One form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household; Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person; and Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home. That's all - these are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. LATEST:Live updates from around the world A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can. If you don't follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the government's instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: Close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship We will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public - excluding people you live with And we'll stop all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed. No prime minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people's lives, to their businesses and to their jobs. And that's why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business. And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to. There have been more than 335 deaths from coronavirus in the UK - a third of them have been in London But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost and yet it is also true that there is a clear way through. Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with 7,500 former clinicians now coming back to the service. With the time you buy - by simply staying at home - we are increasing our stocks of equipment. We are accelerating our search for treatments. We are pioneering work on a vaccine. And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer. I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus. Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline. But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together. To halt the spread of this disease. To protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives. And I know that as they have in the past so many times, the people of this country will rise to that challenge and we will come through it stronger than ever. We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together and therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.""

New York has become the
epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in the US. Governor Andrew Cuomo on
Tuesday pleaded for medical supplies, warning the virus was spreading in his
state faster than ""a bullet train"". New York now has over
25,000 confirmed cases and over 200 deaths, with the number of new cases
doubling every three days. ""The apex is higher
than we thought and the apex is sooner than we thought,"" Mr Cuomo told
reporters. The governor's warning
comes as President Trump suggested having the US open for business by early
next month while criticising Mr Cuomo for not having ordered more supplies years
before. Read the full story:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52012048 The Tokyo Olympics 2020 is the latest - and largest - sporting event to be postponed. The coronavirus crisis has decimated this year's sporting calendar. Here is just a snapshot of the major international events which have been affected:  For a full timeline of all sporting events affected gohere. Michelle FleuryNorth America Business Correspondent The Dow Jones index rallied more than 11% (or over 2000 points) for its
best day on the US stock market since 1933. Investors are hopeful that Congress will pass a $2 trillion (Â£1.7 trillion) stimulus package to help businesses and households weather the
economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The S&P 500 also rallied more than 9%,
its biggest gain since October 2008. Shares of companies likely to get help
from the government saw some of the biggest gains, including Chevron, American
Express and Boeing whose stock prices all jumped more than 20%.  Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has said it was âextremely
likelyâ that she fell ill with coronavirus but has now recovered. The 17-year-old said she felt âtired, had shivers, a sore
throat and coughedâ after returning from a trip in Europe, so self-isolated for
two weeks. âEveryone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate
themselves. I have therefore not been tested for Covid-19, but itâs extremely
likely that Iâve had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances,""
she wrote on Instagram. She warned
people to stay at home because âour actions can be the difference between life
and deathâ for others. Maris Hellrand, Estonia Saaremaa relies heavily on the tourist industry which has now come to a halt The largest island in Estonia is at the heart of the Baltic stateâs coronavirus outbreak, with 114 of the countryâs 369 cases. The outbreak in Saaremaa is thought to have begun when an Italian volleyball team from Milan played a local club at the beginning of March. The island, which has a population of 33,000, has spent the past 10 days sealed off from the rest of Estonia. âWeâve been living under in a constant state of emergency for the last two weeks and are aware of an imminent danger of an explosion (of cases). The situation could get much more dramatic,â Mayor Madis Kallas told the BBC. The hospital on Saaremaa was the first in Estonia to set up a drive-in testing facility, but it has been struggling with a lack of supplies of protective gear. Patients in a serious condition have been sent to hospitals on the mainland. Nick BryantBBC New York Correspondent Trump, in common with all populists and demagogues, favours simple solutions to complex problems. However, the coronavirus outbreak has required the kind of multi-pronged approach and long-term thinking that seems beyond him. This has always been a presidency of the here and now. It is not well equipped to deal with a public health and economic emergency that will dominate the rest of his presidency, whether he only gets to spend the next 10 months in the White House or another five years. Read more from Nick here. Chris Bockman, Toulouse Tuesday could be the last day of trading for stall holders at this market in Toulouse The Crystal market in the centre of Toulouse is one of the biggest daily outdoor markets in south-west France. When Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced the closure of outdoor food markets with almost immediate effect late on Monday, stall owners feared the worst. Although they were given a reprieve on Tuesday morning, they know this could have been their last day. Mayor Jean-Luc Moudenc has appealed for the markets to stay open, warning that closure could create food shortages and hit the most vulnerable. Toulouse is home to one of the biggest British communities in France.  Many work in the aerospace industry - European plane maker Airbus is based here. For the past eight days PR consultant Trudi Harris and her family have been confined to their home. She says the highlight of her life now is the walk to the corner shop every three days. Aerospace engineer Richard Tookey says working from home has made him into something of a battery hen - working, eating and sleeping. The death toll in France from the coronavirus has jumped by 240 in the last 24 hours to reach 1,100. That's its biggest daily rise yet. There were 2,444 new confirmed cases in the same period,
bringing the total number in the country to at least 22,300, Franceâs health
ministry said. The death toll is likely to be higher, as those confirmed so
far have only been people who died in hospital,French media reports say,external. Like most other European countries, France has implemented Draconian restrictions on life to prevent the virus from spreading. The country was put into lockdown on 17 March, requiring
people to stay indoors stay except for essential trips for an initial 15-day
period. But on Tuesday, Franceâs scientific council advised the
government to extend the lockdown, saying it should last at least six weeks to suppress
the virus more effectively. Health minister Olivier VÃ©ran said the lockdown
will âlast as long as it needs toâ. France has been in lockdown since 17 March Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has donated 1m euros (Â£920,000) to help fight the coronavirus outbreak in Spain. Almost 2,700 people have now died in the country and close to 40,000 are infected. Italy is the only European country to see more cases. Guardiola, who is from Catalonia and currently at home in Barcelona, has been working with his lawyers over the past few days to decide the best way of using the money. Read morehere. Former Spain international Guardiola is an icon at Barcelona after his successes as a player and a manager Naomi Grimley, BBC News Until now, limited testing has meant that experts donât have a
hold on whoâs really had the virus and who has not. Many of us in the UK will know
someone who has been told they probably had it but they werenât allowed a
laboratory test to confirm it. Thatâs where a finger-prick antibody test to
check for immunity would make a big difference. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would be a ""game changer"". In the words of the Chief Medical Officer â Professor Chris
Whitty â it means âwe'll be able to say to somebody, you've had this virus,
youâre not likely to get it again at least in the immediate term, and now we
can be confident you can return to work and you donât
need to be taking some of the precautions youâve been taking to date."" This would be especially useful for healthcare workers whoâve
already had the virus but perhaps displayed few or no symptoms. It would
mean they wouldnât need to spend several days in self-isolation just because a
fellow family member is now sick. The news from Health Secretary Matt Hancock that the UK has now purchased 3.5 million of these
tests is especially welcome as the death toll grows. This week Spain also took
delivery of 640,000 test kits, thought to be of a similar kind, from China and
South Korea. They will be used on healthcare professionals first. Big questions still remain: not least, how reliable are these
new tests? And for how long does immunity to Covid-19 last? Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world that we have been covering over the past few hours: A US man has died and his wife is in critical condition after taking a form of a drug that has been touted by President Donald Trump as a possible treatment for the novel coronavirus. The couple took chloroquine phosphate - a form of chloroquine used to clean fish tanks - in an apparent effort to guard against Covid-19. Chloroquine itself is one of the oldest and best-known anti-malarial drugs, but the US Food and Drugs Administrationhas made it clear it has not been approved for treating those infected with the Covid-19 coronavirus. The
couple - both  in their 60s - fell ill within 30 minutes of taking the substance, said Arizona-based hospital system Banner Health. Read our full story on this casehere. Nigeria also reported cases of chloroquine poisoning that had officials there issuing their own warning: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The most common signs of Covid-19 are a fever and a dry cough, which can lead to breathing difficulties. For most people the symptoms will be mild but the coronavirus can be serious for some, including the elderly or people with certain pre-existing conditions. Some of the early symptoms can easily be confused with other winter bugs including colds and flu. But for now the UK government is advising anyone with a high temperature or a new, continuous cough sto self-isolate at home for at least seven days just in case.

Even though the decisionto postpone the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Gameslooked inevitable, today's announcement has come as a relief for the many athletes who have not been able to train properly because of the restrictions. âWe felt under pressure to train and compete,"" British swimmerAdam Peaty,who won gold at Rio 2016 in the 100m breaststroke, told BBC Sport. âThe decision from the IOC lifts that relief that we donât have to be in shape over summer and we donât have to put unnecessary risk on others.â HeptathleteKatarina Johnson-Thompson,the current world champion who was among the favourites for gold, described the postponement as ""heartbreaking"". But she also joked: ""Waited eight years for this, whatâs another one in the grand scheme of things?"" British golferJustin Rose,who described his gold-medal win four years ago as the ""biggest gift"" of his career, says he would be making the Olympics his ""priority"" in a rejigged 2021 schedule. Paralympic cycling and athletics championKadeena Coxalso backed the decision, saying the Games and its legacy can be enjoyed ""when the time is right"". Read more reaction from leading athletes on BBC Sport. British swimmer Adam Peaty won Great Britain's first medal at Rio 2016 with a world record in the men's 100m breaststroke Tom FordyceBBC chief sports writer There is a moment at an Olympic Games, some point after the opening ceremony and around the time where everything around you is drama and smashed records and new heroes, when you look around and think: there is no other square mile or so of the planet that has as many people staring at it as this. That's what the summer Games do. They make you feel like you're at the centre of the world. And it's why it took the International Olympic Committee so long to realise that Tokyo 2020 had to be postponed, and why there could be no other decision. The IOC has the history, the power and the self-regard to pull off something as complicated, expensive and vainglorious as an Olympics. Those same characteristics can also leave it out of touch with wider forces at play around it. It is used to nations wooing it and coming in supplication, not the other way round.

When Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced the closure of outdoor food markets with almost immediate effect late on Monday, stall owners feared the worst. Although they were given a reprieve on Tuesday morning, they know this could have been their last day. Mayor Jean-Luc Moudenc has appealed for the markets to stay open, warning that closure could create food shortages and hit the most vulnerable. Toulouse is home to one of the biggest British communities in France.  Many work in the aerospace industry - European plane maker Airbus is based here. For the past eight days PR consultant Trudi Harris and her family have been confined to their home. She says the highlight of her life now is the walk to the corner shop every three days. Aerospace engineer Richard Tookey says working from home has made him into something of a battery hen - working, eating and sleeping. The death toll in France from the coronavirus has jumped by 240 in the last 24 hours to reach 1,100. That's its biggest daily rise yet. There were 2,444 new confirmed cases in the same period,
bringing the total number in the country to at least 22,300, Franceâs health
ministry said. The death toll is likely to be higher, as those confirmed so
far have only been people who died in hospital,French media reports say,external. Like most other European countries, France has implemented Draconian restrictions on life to prevent the virus from spreading. The country was put into lockdown on 17 March, requiring
people to stay indoors stay except for essential trips for an initial 15-day
period. But on Tuesday, Franceâs scientific council advised the
government to extend the lockdown, saying it should last at least six weeks to suppress
the virus more effectively. Health minister Olivier VÃ©ran said the lockdown
will âlast as long as it needs toâ. France has been in lockdown since 17 March Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has donated 1m euros (Â£920,000) to help fight the coronavirus outbreak in Spain. Almost 2,700 people have now died in the country and close to 40,000 are infected. Italy is the only European country to see more cases. Guardiola, who is from Catalonia and currently at home in Barcelona, has been working with his lawyers over the past few days to decide the best way of using the money. Read morehere. Former Spain international Guardiola is an icon at Barcelona after his successes as a player and a manager Naomi Grimley, BBC News Until now, limited testing has meant that experts donât have a
hold on whoâs really had the virus and who has not. Many of us in the UK will know
someone who has been told they probably had it but they werenât allowed a
laboratory test to confirm it. Thatâs where a finger-prick antibody test to
check for immunity would make a big difference. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would be a ""game changer"". In the words of the Chief Medical Officer â Professor Chris
Whitty â it means âwe'll be able to say to somebody, you've had this virus,
youâre not likely to get it again at least in the immediate term, and now we
can be confident you can return to work and you donât
need to be taking some of the precautions youâve been taking to date."" This would be especially useful for healthcare workers whoâve
already had the virus but perhaps displayed few or no symptoms. It would
mean they wouldnât need to spend several days in self-isolation just because a
fellow family member is now sick. The news from Health Secretary Matt Hancock that the UK has now purchased 3.5 million of these
tests is especially welcome as the death toll grows. This week Spain also took
delivery of 640,000 test kits, thought to be of a similar kind, from China and
South Korea. They will be used on healthcare professionals first. Big questions still remain: not least, how reliable are these
new tests? And for how long does immunity to Covid-19 last? Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world that we have been covering over the past few hours: A US man has died and his wife is in critical condition after taking a form of a drug that has been touted by President Donald Trump as a possible treatment for the novel coronavirus. The couple took chloroquine phosphate - a form of chloroquine used to clean fish tanks - in an apparent effort to guard against Covid-19. Chloroquine itself is one of the oldest and best-known anti-malarial drugs, but the US Food and Drugs Administrationhas made it clear it has not been approved for treating those infected with the Covid-19 coronavirus. The
couple - both  in their 60s - fell ill within 30 minutes of taking the substance, said Arizona-based hospital system Banner Health. Read our full story on this casehere.

New York has become the
epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in the US. Governor Andrew Cuomo on
Tuesday pleaded for medical supplies, warning the virus was spreading in his
state faster than ""a bullet train"". New York now has over
25,000 confirmed cases and over 200 deaths, with the number of new cases
doubling every three days. ""The apex is higher
than we thought and the apex is sooner than we thought,"" Mr Cuomo told
reporters. The governor's warning
comes as President Trump suggested having the US open for business by early
next month while criticising Mr Cuomo for not having ordered more supplies years
before. Read the full story:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52012048 The Tokyo Olympics 2020 is the latest - and largest - sporting event to be postponed. The coronavirus crisis has decimated this year's sporting calendar. Here is just a snapshot of the major international events which have been affected:  For a full timeline of all sporting events affected gohere. Michelle FleuryNorth America Business Correspondent The Dow Jones index rallied more than 11% (or over 2000 points) for its
best day on the US stock market since 1933. Investors are hopeful that Congress will pass a $2 trillion (Â£1.7 trillion) stimulus package to help businesses and households weather the
economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The S&P 500 also rallied more than 9%,
its biggest gain since October 2008. Shares of companies likely to get help
from the government saw some of the biggest gains, including Chevron, American
Express and Boeing whose stock prices all jumped more than 20%.  Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has said it was âextremely
likelyâ that she fell ill with coronavirus but has now recovered. The 17-year-old said she felt âtired, had shivers, a sore
throat and coughedâ after returning from a trip in Europe, so self-isolated for
two weeks. âEveryone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate
themselves. I have therefore not been tested for Covid-19, but itâs extremely
likely that Iâve had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances,""
she wrote on Instagram. She warned
people to stay at home because âour actions can be the difference between life
and deathâ for others. Maris Hellrand, Estonia Saaremaa relies heavily on the tourist industry which has now come to a halt The largest island in Estonia is at the heart of the Baltic stateâs coronavirus outbreak, with 114 of the countryâs 369 cases. The outbreak in Saaremaa is thought to have begun when an Italian volleyball team from Milan played a local club at the beginning of March. The island, which has a population of 33,000, has spent the past 10 days sealed off from the rest of Estonia. âWeâve been living under in a constant state of emergency for the last two weeks and are aware of an imminent danger of an explosion (of cases). The situation could get much more dramatic,â Mayor Madis Kallas told the BBC. The hospital on Saaremaa was the first in Estonia to set up a drive-in testing facility, but it has been struggling with a lack of supplies of protective gear. Patients in a serious condition have been sent to hospitals on the mainland. Nick BryantBBC New York Correspondent Trump, in common with all populists and demagogues, favours simple solutions to complex problems. However, the coronavirus outbreak has required the kind of multi-pronged approach and long-term thinking that seems beyond him. This has always been a presidency of the here and now. It is not well equipped to deal with a public health and economic emergency that will dominate the rest of his presidency, whether he only gets to spend the next 10 months in the White House or another five years.

Wuhan to ease lockdown as world battles virus,"Wuhan has been sealed off since mid-January The lockdown in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the global coronavirus outbreak began, will be partially lifted on 8 April, officials say. Travel restrictions in the rest of Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, will be lifted from midnight on Tuesday - for residents who are healthy. A single new case of the virus was reported in Wuhan on Tuesday following almost a week of no reported new cases. Countries around the world have gone into lockdown or imposed severe curbs. The UK is getting to grips with sweeping new measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus, including a ban on public gatherings of more than two people and the immediate closure of shops selling non-essential goods. The WHO has urged the G20 group of nations to boost production of protective equipment Meanwhile, health experts say Americans must limit their social interactions or the number of infections will overwhelm the health care system in the US. Spanish soldiers helping to fight the coronavirus pandemic have found elderly patients in retirement homes abandoned and, in some cases, dead in their beds, the defence ministry has said. An ice rink in Madrid is to be used as a temporary mortuary for Covid-19 victims. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the pandemic is accelerating, with more than 300,000 cases now confirmed. It is urging countries to adopt rigorous testing and contact-tracing strategies. LIVE: Latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak Spain's coronavirus death toll jumps 514 in 24 hours Father Berardelli among 50 priests killed How did Australia's cruise ship debacle happen? Wuhan has been shut off from the rest of the worldsince the middle of January. But officials now say anyone who has a ""green"" code on a widely used smartphone health app will be allowed to leave the city from 8 April. Earlier, the authorities reported a new case of coronavirus in Wuhan, ending a five-day run of no reported new cases in the city. This video can not be played Coronavirus: People in Beijing begin to head outdoors It comes after health officials there confirmed that they were not counting cases of people who were positive but had not been admitted to hospital or did not show any symptoms of the disease. Official government figures say there have been 78 new cases reported on the Chinese mainland in the last 24 hours. All but four of them were caused by infected travellers arriving from abroad. This so-called ""second wave"" of imported infections is also affecting countries like South Korea and Singapore, which had been successful in stopping the spread of disease in recent weeks. South Korea's 'trace, test and treat' may be saving lives The detectives racing to contain the virus in Singapore South Korea has been seeing a drop in its daily tally of new cases. On Tuesday it reported its lowest number since 29 February. By Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai China considers itself to be - very nearly - a ""post corona"" country. In the last week we've heard Wuhan medics warning the UK and others that they need to do more to protect frontline health workers, citing the mistakes they made early on when some treated patients without wearing proper protective clothing. But there's also been reporting in state media of the reported death toll in Italy surpassing that in China. This has been combined with some commentary from prominent media figures that has appeared distasteful, almost triumphalist. At the same time there is a panic about the threat of a second wave from imported cases - travellers arriving from abroad. This has fuelled the view - right or wrong - that some other countries aren't taking the threat seriously because they aren't doing what China did. (Almost all the cases in Beijing that have been made public are of Chinese nationals returning home). Meanwhile, well away from senior leaders, there are some high-profile diplomatic figures using international-facing social media to spread theories that the US may have weaponised and dumped the virus in China. Or that Italy had cases that may have been Covid-19 earlier than China. China is sowing seeds of doubt and questioning assumed truths as it looks to repair its reputation. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Almost all of India with its 1.3bn people is under lockdown. Buses, trains and other forms of public transport are suspended. On Monday, the authorities said domestic flights would also stopped. The country has reported 485 cases and nine people have died. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation again this evening. Mumbai's suburban train network carries eight million passengers a day Neighbouring Pakistan has almost twice as many confirmed cases - 878 as of Monday evening. Sweeping restrictions are in place although the government has stopped short of imposing a nationwide lockdown. However, several provinces have announced them independently. The army is being brought in to help enforce the restrictions. Bangladesh, which has reported 33 cases and three deaths, is also deploying its armed forces to help maintain social distancing and boost Covid-19 preventive measures. The soldiers will also monitor thousands of quarantined expatriate returnees. Across South Asia, there are concerns that the actual number of cases could be much higher than is being reported. Indonesia, which has 49 confirmed Covid-19 deaths - the highest in South-East Asia - has converted an athlete's village built for the 2018 Asian Games into a makeshift hospital for coronavirus patients. A state of emergency was declared in Jakarta on Monday. In Thailand, a month-long state of emergency which will include curfews and checkpoints will begin on Thursday. The government has been criticised for failing to take strong action so far. Four people have died and nearly 900 tested positive. Talks between the Japanese PM and the International Olympic Committee are expected this evening. The most populous country that was without a case until now - Myanmar - has announced two cases. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday night that, with immediate effect, ""people will only be allowed to leave their home...for very limited purposes"". They include shopping for basic necessities, taking one form of exercise per day, fulfilling any medical need, or travelling to work if working from home is impossible.

PM announces strict new curbs on life in UK In Italy, the worst-hit country in the world, the authorities said 602 people with Covid-19 had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll there to 6,077. But the daily increase in cases was the smallest since Thursday, raising hope that the stringent restrictions imposed by the government were starting to have an effect. Spain, however, said on Tuesday that its death toll had risen by 514 to 2,696. Nearly 40,000 are infected, about 5,400 of them healthcare workers.

Iceland vans torched minutes after lockdown,"Police said they believed a ""group of teenagers were involved in these disturbances"" Two supermarket delivery vans were torched less than an hour after Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued his lockdown order. Patrolling officers came across the Iceland vans alight in Southmead, Bristol at about 21:30 GMT on Monday. It was ""beyond belief anyone would be so reckless and thoughtless"", Avon and Somerset Police said. Iceland said it was ""shocking anyone would act so callously"" when the vans were ""most needed"". The vans were set ablaze deliberately, Avon Fire and Rescue Service believe. Ch Insp Mark Runacres said officers were already on patrol in the area following ""recent instances of anti-social behaviour"". ""We put an order in place last night to give officers extra powers to disperse groups and will continue to use our existing powers to tackle this problem,"" he said. ""We believe that a group of teenagers were involved in these disturbances. I have one message for them, their parents and carers. 'Stay at home. Save lives'."" Boris Johnson's coronavirus address in full A spokesman for Iceland said ""both vans would have to be written off"". ""While we can and will bring in replacement vans to maintain our home delivery service in Southmead, our entire van fleet is running at absolutely full capacity at the moment,"" he said. ""And it is shocking and distressing that anyone would act so callously to put vehicles out of service at precisely the time when they are most needed to deliver food to the most vulnerable people in our society.""

UK brings in strict curbs on life to fight virus,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You must stay at home"" Boris Johnson has outlined strict new measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus, including a ban on public gatherings of more than two people. He said people should only leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work ""where this is absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and fulfil any medical or care needs. He also ordered the immediate closure of shops selling non-essential goods. But police said they had received lots of calls asking what was still allowed. In the UK, 340 people have died with the virus. On Monday evening,27 million TV viewers watched Mr Johnsontell the country it was facing a ""moment of national emergency"" and that staying at home was necessary to protect the NHS, save lives and tackle ""the biggest threat this country has faced for decades"". Police and local authorities will have powers to disperse gatherings, including through fines. The restrictions would be under constant review and a relaxation of the rules would be considered in three weeks, he said. ""To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well,"" the prime minister said. For the first time,all the UK's mobile networks are sending out a government messageon Tuesday morning to their customers with details of the new measures. Johnson's coronavirus address in full LIVE:Latest updates A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW GUIDANCE:What must I do? NEW RESTRICTIONS:What are they? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The new measures come after a sunny weekend during which crowds of people were seen at beaches, parks, markets and other public spaces. The new guidance,externalsays people should only leave their homes for: Shopping for basic necessities such as food and medicine. Shopping trips should be as infrequent as possible One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk or cycle. This should be done alone or only with people you live with Any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. This includes moving children under the age of 18 between their parents' homes, where applicable. Key workers or those with children identified as vulnerable can continue to take their children to school Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home Even when following the above guidance, people should minimise the amount of time spent out of their homes and should keep two metres (6ft) away from people they do not live with. The parents of thousands of children are keeping them out of school to try to reduce the spread of the virus. Downing Street said school attendance in England was about 10% on Monday. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said employers should take ""every possible step"" to allow for remote working, but added: ""I want to be absolutely clear, when people absolutely can not work from home they can still go to work - indeed it's important that they do to keep the country running."" The government is also stopping all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies - but funerals attended by immediate family members are allowed. Downing Street said the use of fines, starting at Â£30, would be targeted at dispersing gatherings, and failure to pay could lead to criminal proceedings and a summary conviction. These measures represent some of the most far-reaching curbs on personal freedom ever introduced in the UK in peacetime. But it is unclear how the rules can be made to work. The first hurdle is to get them on to the statute book; although the prime minister said the restrictions on travel and gatherings would come into effect immediately, police don't have the powers to enforce them yet, nor have they had official guidance. The second issue - assuming legal regulations are approved later this week - is the practical difficulty of getting groups to disperse and accurately identifying people who should not be on the streets, without losing public goodwill and sparking disorder. When efforts to persuade those who do not comply have failed, officers will be able to issue fines, with prosecutions likely to be a last resort. But at a time when officer numbers are increasingly depleted through illness and self-isolation, forces will be hoping communities do the right thing without the need for intervention. This video can not be played After Boris Johnson brings in new measures, the BBC explains why staying in is a matter of life and death Businesses that will not need to close,externalinclude supermarkets, petrol stations, post offices, launderettes, bike shops, pet shops, hardware stores and banks. Mr Gove said all major construction work should go ahead but jobs carried out at close quarters in someone's home would not be appropriate. As critics, including London Mayor Sadiq Khan, questioned his approach, Crossrail and housebuilder Taylor Wimpey suspended work. However, competitor Redrow said its sites remained open with ""strict precautions"" in place. The mayor has also warned London Underground commuters that if they do not stop packing into trains, more people will die. Mayor: 'Stop Tube travel or more will die' UK construction workers fear for their safety Why is it taking so long to help the self-employed? Premises such as libraries, non-essential shops, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship have been ordered to close. Hotels, hostels, campsites and caravan parks must also close unless key workers need to stay there, or if others staying there cannot get back home. Parks will remain open for exercise but people are not allowed to gather in groups. Golf courses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will shut - and in Scotland, golfers have been asked not to play. Community centres can stay open but only for the purpose of ""hosting essential voluntary or public services"" such as food banks or service for homeless people, the guidance says. Barristers have been told not to attend Crown Court unless they are involved in one of the 34 ongoing trials in England and Wales. On Monday night, the government changed its travel guidance, advisingall British people travelling abroad to return to the UK now.,external Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said this was ""because of the rate of new border restrictions"" and those needing urgent assistance should call the local UK embassy or high commissioner. Soldiers deliver protective equipment to doctors and nurses working at St Thomas' Hospital in London Prisoners in England and Wales will be confined to their cells for 23 hours a day and allowed out only to shower and use pay-phones, with all visits cancelled, the BBC understands. More than 83,000 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus with 6,710 testing positive. However, the true number of cases will be far higher as tests are primarily done on hospital patients with symptoms of the virus. It seems hard to overstate how huge an impact this will have on the country, and what a massive decision this is for the government to have taken - whose effect will last at least for a period of three weeks at the shortest, potentially for very much longer. Remember this though is not quite the kind of total crackdown we have seen in other countries - at least not yet. Not surprisingly, there is already therefore enormous controversy about whether the UK has been acting fast enough. Read more from Laura But there were calls for more information about the guidance. Lincolnshire Police warned of an ""extremely high volume"" of calls and Humberside Chief Constable Lee Freeman said his force had received ""a number of calls"" on the subject, which he said he was unable to answer. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said enforcing the new restrictions would be ""a real, real challenge"", as there was already ""large amounts of sickness"" among officers across London. Later, the National Police Chiefs' Council said officers would not be deployed on patrol specifically to police social distancing rules but would still patrol their communities ""as always"". Home Secretary Priti Patel saidin a tweet,externalthat the next few weeks would be ""testing"" for police but she would make sure officers had ""the resources they need to keep themselves and the public safe"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the measures were ""the right response"" but called for more guidance on workplace closures. Unite union boss Len McCluskey said millions of workers were confused about whether they should be at work, while millions of self-employed and insecure workers were dreading being sent home because it would mean no wages. Asked in the Commons about help for the UK's five million self-employed workers, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was ""determined to find a way"" to support them, and was looking at the matter in ""immense detail and at pace"". The prime minister said he knew the ""damage"" the restrictions were causing to people's lives, businesses and jobs - and said ""many lives will sadly be lost"" despite the measures. But he added there was ""a clear way through"", by strengthening the NHS with former clinicians returning to work, accelerating the search for treatments and a vaccine and buying millions of testing kits.

Mayor: 'Stop Tube travel or more will die',"Tube commuters packed into carriages for a second day, despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson's lockdown announcement on Monday London Underground commuters have been warned that if they do not stop packing into trains more people will die from coronavirus. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan issued the alert after photos showed crowds in Tube carriages for asecond morning running. Mr Khan insisted the network was running for essential workers only. A transport union called for police officers to be deployed at major stations to stop overcrowding. More than 130 people have died in London from Covid-19 - a third of the whole of the UK. Commuters at Mile End station were packed onto a Central Line train on Tuesday morning But the trains were still crowded during rush hourdespite Boris Johnson putting the UK on lockdown. Mr Khan demanded employers enable their staff to work from home ""unless it's absolutely necessary"". ""Ignoring these rules means more lives lost,"" he warned. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he spoke to Mr Khan about ensuring there is ""enough space to be safe"" on London Underground trains for those who must travel, and offered the support of his department. Nurse Julia Harris, who commutes to work at Imperial College NHS Trust, said she had left earlier and changed her route to avoid crowds but still found services busy. ""Seats on the train all had at least one person so people needed to stand, and the District line was busy as well,"" she said. ""I still don't think things have improved as a large amount of people are commuting early in the morning. Dozens of Tube stations were closed last Thursday as London in order to stop the spread of coronavirus ""It is concerning because I have to come to work. ""The choice isn't there and my commute is quite long. I worry for my health more on my commute than actually being in the hospital."" Nicola Smith, who works at a central London hospital, said ""I'm risking my health."" She called for either Mr Khan to reverse his decision to reduce Tube timetables or the prime minister to ""start policing who's getting on"". Packed Tube trains make distancing 'impossible' Dozens of Tube stations to shut over coronavirus Tube driver tests positive for coronavirus Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA), said: ""Sadly, the situation on the London Underground has not improved. ""We urgently need British Transport Police and other officers at major stations across London's transport network to ensure only those with a valid reason to travel are doing so in this emergency."" Transport for London has put up signs across the Underground warning people against non-essential travel Finn Brennan, of the train drivers' union Aslef, said he had received reports from Tube staff that ""there were a large number of construction workers"" on the Underground. He said: ""Unless the government act with complete clarity to close down construction sites, then the tube will not. ""There are too many employers that are just not taking this seriously. We are trying our best to make everyone listen, but the situation is stark. ""It cannot go on the way it is or the Tube will not be able to continue. But, let me be clear, we very, very much want it to continue as it is vital."" By BBC London's transport correspondent Tom Edwards Public transport is currently meant to be for ""critical workers"" only but it doesn't seem to be working. Union reps on the tube have been left apoplectic for a second day because lines have been very very busy, particularly at the start of the service. Footage I have seen shows passengers crammed in next to each other and there is now talk among members of staff who are union members of a walkout - they are so unhappy with the situation. They are particularly picking out construction workers and believe all the sites in London should be closed. They want the government to put forward a financial package for these self-employed workers. There are also calls for ID checks at stations or the definition of key worker to be tightened. In the strongest wording I have ever seen - Transport for London says fewer people need to travel or people will die. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate?

Coronavirus: When the police knock at your door,"Milo Hsieh is an American University student living in Taiwan under quarantine. The BBC asked him to write this articleafter one of his tweets about having his movements tracked by a satellite-based system,externalwas widely shared. I did not expect two police officers to come knocking at my door at 08:15 when I was still asleep in my bed on Sunday morning. My phone briefly ran out of battery at 07:30, and in less than an hour, four different local administrative units had called. A patrol was dispatched to check my whereabouts. A text was sent notifying that the government had lost track of me, and warned me of potential arrest if I had broken quarantine. I returned to Taiwan last Thursday to experience the island's zero-risk take on coronavirus. Since I was coming back from Europe, I am subjected to a mandatory 14 days home quarantine. Before I had my passport checked, I had to pass through a booth set up by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. I filled out a document detailing places I had visited in the last fortnight, my phone number, landline and address. They notified me that my phone would be ""satellite-tracked"" for enforcement. The level of precaution taken in Taiwan is nothing like what I saw in Europe. People flying back into Taiwan must go into 14 days of quarantine to help combat the spread of coronavirus During the initial phase of lockdown in Belgium, which I had to leave after my study programme was cancelled, people still went out and lined up at fast food kiosks. Even as an outbreak was happening in northern Italy, I saw during my visit to London in the first weekend of March, that people were still going to pubs. Here, I am not allowed to step outside the apartment. I was not allowed to take public transport on my way back, and had to take special ""quarantine taxis."" My entire family has to quarantine with me for two weeks. This includes Biscuit, our dog. The island refers to its phone-tracking system as being an ""electronic fence"". Rather than ask users to download a special app or wear a location-transmitting wristband - as has been the case in some East Asian countries - it uses existing phone signals to triangulate the owner's locations. To ensure users comply, an alert is sent to the authorities if the handset is turned off for more than 15 minutes. More than 6,000 people subjected to home quarantine are simultaneously tracked this way. And to check that the phone has not simply been left behind, officials phone users up to twice a day to check they have their mobile to hand, and to ask about their health. Recently, many Taiwanese, especially students, have returned to the island, as their schools overseas have closed and life around the world has ground to a halt. Some see the mandatory quarantine they have to go through as a necessary measure. Frank Tseng is among them. He is one of my friends at American University, and he recently returned from Washington DC. Arrivals to Taiwan have to sign a pledge saying they will stay behind closed doors for a fortnight and keep a record of their temperature ""I feel like even though it's a pain for the citizens who are coming back, I understand that it's a necessary process many of us have to take to go home,"" he told me. But some see the enforcement mechanism as problematic. Paul Huang, a local freelance journalist who was working abroad, decided to not go back to Taiwan because of surveillance fears. ""The government openly stated your phone will be digitally tracked to enforce quarantine - in the same way the authority usually tracks suspected criminals,"" he explained. ""Except this time they don't have or need a court-issued warrant to spy on your phone. ""You are being suspected of a crime by virtue of having travelled overseas."" LIVE:Latest updates A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Paul has published articles critical of the Taiwan government in the past,including one calling its military a ""hollow shell"",external. When entering the border, I was only notified that my phone would be tracked and that the local township official would give me a call daily. I was not made aware of any rights I had and did not sign documents consenting to surveillance. As cases of the virus rise in Taiwan, the people seem to have entrusted the government with more power to contain the pandemic. Metro station staff in Taiwan have used thermal scans to try to detect passengers who have the virus But as the Taiwan government showcases its mass surveillance capability amid the crisis, it brings into question how it can be used in the wrong hands. Brian Hioe, who runs New Bloom, a left-leaning publication focused on Taiwan, shared this concern with me. His worry is that ""the state may retain its expanded powers and continue with surveillance practices once the crisis has passed"". At the same time, despite analysis by some that Taiwan's alleged culture of obedience makes it easier to empower the state to contain the outbreak, Brian and I both agree that the vibrant civil society will readily fight back if the government oversteps its power. At the end of the day, I will be staying home to complete my mandatory 14 days of home quarantine without being too paranoid about what the government knows or does not know about me. But I do feel a little uncomfortable knowing that my neighbour could turn me in to the police if they see me outside of my apartment door, doing something as simple as taking out the trash.

Sports Direct U-turns on opening after backlash,"Sports Direct has performed a U-turn on keeping its shops open during the coronavirus lockdown following a backlash over its plans. The government has ordered all UK shops selling non-essential goods to close. Sports Direct initially said it would remain open as it was ""uniquely well placed to help keep the UK as fit and healthy as possible"". But after widespread criticism, it now says it will not open ""until we are given the go-ahead by the government"". Sports Direct's chief financial officer, Chris Wootton, said the chain was contacting the government ""at all levels"" to confirm whether its shops were deemed to provide an essential service. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said on Tuesday morning that he could not see ""any justification"" for it to stay open. ""The key thing we need to do is make sure people wherever possible stay at home. Yes it's important people exercise but that should be done once a day and it's a basic thing,"" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. ""People can walk, run or cycle, they should, but there is no reason for a store like Sports Direct to remain open."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The retailer had argued that it provided an essential service. Bosses at the company said the sports equipment it sells can be used to exercise at home at a time when gyms have been closed. In a letter written by Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct and Evans Cycles, Mr Wootton had said: ""Thus our Sports Direct and Evans Cycles stores will remain open where possible to allow us to do this (in accordance with the government's current social distancing guidance). ""There is no one else that has the range of product and range of stores to make this reasonably accessible for the whole population."" Bicycle shops are on the list of retailers that are allowed to stay open during the shutdown. Shops selling non-essential items have been ordered to close But Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the shop workers' trade union Usdaw, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I can't see how it [Sports Direct] is an essential service. It's a sports clothing company. ""In my mind, an essential service would include food and medicine and the supply chain around that,"" as well as the National Health Service, he said. Sports Direct's initial plan to stay open drew widespread backlash on social media. Ian Lavery MP, chair of the Labour Party, told the company's founder and chief executive Mike Ashley to ""take some responsibility"". Allow Twitter content?

A number of High Street retailers and food chains had already shut prior to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement on Monday evening, which set out strict new measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus. The government has now issueda list of which ""essential"" retailers are allowed to stay open.,externalThey include: Supermarkets and other food shops Pharmacies Petrol stations Newsagents Bicycle shops Home and hardware stores Laundrettes and dry cleaners Garages Pet shops Post Offices Banks Businesses will still be able to take online orders and deliver items to people's homes. The government this week said it wouldpay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic, in a move aimed at protecting people's jobs. It will pay 80% of salary for staff who are kept on by their employer, covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month. Meanwhile, on Tuesday: A closely-watched economic survey,externalindicated there had been ""record slump"" in UK business activity in March as emergency public health measures dealt a ""severe blow"" to the economy. The compilers of the survey said the figures suggested ""a recession of a scale we have not seen in modern history is looking increasingly likely"" Waitrose became the first UK supermarket to announce it would limit the number of people who could be in a store at any one time B&Q said it would close temporarily to prepare its stores for selling ""essential products"" The boss of the Wetherspoon pub chain saidits staff should feel free to take jobs at supermarketssuch as Tesco while its pubs remain closed. Many retail and hospitality firms have warned the pandemic could see them collapse, wiping out thousands of jobs, as life in the UK is put on hold. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of retail lobby group the British Retail Consortium, said many shops had already closed temporarily. ""Any retailers that remain open will be following the very latest government public health guidance to ensure they do everything they can to ensure the safety of customers and staff,"" she said. The government had already ordered pubs, restaurants and cafes to close amid concerns that people were ignoring its advice to keep social contact to a minimum. Monday night's announcement came as the number of UK deaths from coronavirus hit 335, while there were 6,650 confirmed cases. Many of the big brands to have already announced closures have promised to pay their staff for several weeks until the government's coronavirus job retention scheme kicks in. However, concern is growing about the millions of self-employed and gig economy workers who will be forced to rely on benefits in the absence of targeted support. Neil Carberry, boss of lobby group the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said the announcement reinforced the need for businesses and workers to access government support measures ""as quickly as possible"". ""With the economy and jobs market in lockdown, all employers can do is stand by their staff as far as possible and reap the benefits during the post-crisis comeback,"" he added.

What am I still allowed to do?,"A series of strict measures to fight the coronavirus outbreak has been introduced by the government. They are aimed at stopping the spread of infection by making people stay at home unless absolutely necessary. Under the new regulations,externalnobody may leave their homes ""without reasonable excuse"". Reasonable excuses include: Shopping for basic necessities such as food or medicine To take exercise (the guidelines suggest once a day, and in Wales that is the law) Seeking medical assistance, or to avoid injury or illness or to escape a risk of harm Providing care or assistance to a vulnerable person, providing emergency assistance, or donating blood Travelling to work or to carry out voluntary services, where it's not possible to do these from home Attending the funeral of a member of your household, or a close family member (or in some circumstances, a friend) Fulfilling legal obligations, such as attending court, satisfying bail requirements or participating in legal proceedings Accessing critical public services including childcare or education, social services, or victim support Allowing children of separated parents to move between both households Moving house where reasonably necessary Religious ministers are also allowed to visit their place of worship. When outside your home, you should keep a safe distance of 2m or more from anyone who is not a member of your household. Many businesses and venues have been ordered to close. These include: Pubs, cafes and restaurants - although food delivery and takeaway are still permitted Cinemas and theatres, libraries, community centres, youth centres, and places of worship All shops selling ""non-essential"" goods - this includes clothing and electronics stores, and hair, beauty and nail salons Indoor and outdoor leisure facilities such as bowling alleys, arcades and soft play facilities Communal places within parks, such as playgrounds, sports courts and outdoor gyms Hotels, hostels, bed-and-breakfasts, campsites and caravan parks (excluding those providing accommodation for key workers, permanent residents and the homeless) Shops that remain open include supermarkets, pharmacies, petrol stations and post offices. A full list can be foundhere,external. Tradespeople can still carry out repair and maintenance work in people's homes as long as they are well and have no symptoms, and keep 2m away from people in the household. However, in households where people are self-isolating, or where a vulnerable individual is beingshielded, no work should be carried out except emergency repairs to remedy a direct safety risk to the household. All gatherings of more than two people have been banned by the government. The only exceptions are: Where the gathering is of a group of people who live together - for example, a parent can take their children to the shops if they can't be left at home alone Where the gathering is essential for work purposes - although workers should try to keep all meetings to a minimum In addition, the government has stopped weddings, baptisms and other religious ceremonies, apart from funerals. The restrictions were announced on 23 March by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, with the plan to review them after three weeks. The police have been given powers to make sure people follow the measures. If you leave your home or gather in public for any reason other than those allowed, the police may instruct you to go home or disperse. They may also instruct you to stop your children from also breaking the rules. They also have the power to take you home or arrest you. What powers do the police have? If the police believe you have broken rules, or if you refuse to follow their instructions, they may issue you with a fine of Â£60 (reduced to Â£30 if paid within 14 days). If it's the second time you've received a fine, the amount will increase to Â£120 and double on each further repeat offence. The guidance says that ""the police will act with discretion and common sense in applying these measures"". Local authorities (such as trading standards officers) will be monitoring local businesses to make sure they also follow the rules. Those that don't comply will face the threat of fines, and of being closed down. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW GUIDANCE:What must I do? NEW RESTRICTIONS:What are they?

'How is Â£94 a week going to pay anyoneâs bills?â,"Freelance marketing consultant Chloe Hall says the self-employed feel forgotten about Freelance workers feel they have been forgotten, after hearing about the latest financial measures announced by the UK government on Friday to bolster the economy against the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Chancellor Rishi Sunakannounced increased benefits for the self-employed, but did not guarantee their wages. ""I was absolutely devastated,"" said Chloe Hall, a freelance marketing consultant based in Newcastle upon Tyne. ""We work just as hard, but freelancers are always sort of at the bottom of the pile."" According to the Office for National Statistics, there are five million self-employed people in the UK, who make up 15% of the labour market. Ms Hall told the BBC she had cancelled subscription services and even her business bank account in a bid to reduce costs, but without work, she didn't know how she would pay her bills. ""Without the mortgage, my essential bills come to Â£948 a month,"" she said. ""Â£94.25 a week [the Universal Credit payment] - how is that going to pay anybody's bills?"" The measures announced by the Chancellor to help small businesses and the self-employed included: VAT payments by companies deferred until the end of June Interest free cash grants to small businesses Self-assessment income tax payments for July 2020 deferred for six months Increase in standard Universal Credit of Â£20 a week, with the same rise for those still on the working tax credit scheme Nearly Â£1bn for those struggling to pay rent, through increases in housing benefit and Universal Credit The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents gig economy workers, has announced that it is suing the government over its failure to protect the wages and jobs of millions of workers during the pandemic, as well as its failure to ensure the health and safety of those still employed through proper sick pay. IWGB General Secretary Dr Jason Moyer-Lee said: ""No one wants to be litigating right now. We all have extremely pressing things to be getting on with, but we also can't stand by and watch our members being driven into financial destitution because the government has simply forgotten about them. ""The low paid precarious workers must have the means to follow public health advice and continue to pay their bills and put food on the table. Right now, they don't."" The government has said there will be further measures to help self-employed people. Rishi Sunak told the Commons: ""We absolutely understand the situation... and are determined to find a way to support them"". The Chief Secretary to the Treasury - Steven Barclay - added that the self-employed had not been forgotten by ministers. He said: ""Further help is indeed coming - but we have to make sure we get this right."" Deliveroo driver Greg Howard says delivery orders have gone down, not up Deliveroo rider Greg Howard, says that gig economy delivery drivers are extremely worried about their incomes, and says that the perception that the takeaway industry is booming is false. ""People are quite concerned as we've had news that quite a few of the restaurants that are integral for our everyday work are closing, despite being allowed to stay open for takeaways,"" he said. Mr Howard, who is based in Nottingham, which is one of the UK's busiest zones for deliveries, said that typically, he would make 25-30 deliveries a day, working five or six days a week on 10-hour-long shifts, and his take-home pay would be about Â£500 a week. Now, he makes 10-15 deliveries a day, working shifts lasting up to 14 hours, because fewer restaurants are open, but the same number of couriers are still on the roads. ""I don't know how I'm going to be able to make ends meet for myself and my family. Â£94.25 a week is not enough for us."" Coronavirus: 'If you can't work, what do you do?' Coronavirus: 'There isn't time. Firms are closing now' Coronavirus: Government to pay up to 80% of workers' wages Diane Evans, based in Brentwood, Essex, has been a freelance childminder for 16 years. As a single parent with two children, she provides childcare services from her home, but with schools closing, her work has been severely affected. ""A lot of us feel that we're considered to be babysitters by the government and we get left behind, almost not taken seriously for our jobs,"" she said. Freelance childminder Diane Evans (centre) with daughters Jessica and Rebecca Ms Evans said that at the minimum, she would require double the amount of the weekly Universal Credit payment to make ends meet, and that childminders could be forced to stay closed until the new school year in September. ""We can't go get another job stacking shelves in the supermarket, for example, because we can't leave our children at home on their own. We're stuck and we're not getting any support from the government."" Julia Martin is a professional singer based in Brigg, North Lincolnshire, specialising in tributes to artists like Celion Dion and Dame Shirley Bassey. Her son is disabled and needs a warm home at all times, which means her utility bills typically cost about Â£300 a month. Even with mortgage payments frozen, she won't be able to get by. ""My disappointment was palpable when I realised we were yet again to be overlooked and effectively thrown under the bus to fend for ourselves,"" she said. ""For over 20 years I and many others in a similar occupation have contributed to the economy of the UK. I have never claimed benefits and I pay my taxes, yet through no fault of my own I have had all my performances terminated for a minimum of two months."" Professional singer Julia Martin says freelancers have been left to fend for themselves The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) has launched a petition and written to the prime minister along with with numerous other industry bodies,calling on the government to implement a temporary income protection fund specifically for the self-employed,external. According to the IPSE, prior to the coronavirus outbreak, self-employed people contributed Â£305bn to the British economy. IPSE's policy director Andy Chamberlain says he understands the government's hesitation over self-employed people, because it is more difficult to confirm how much they are actually earning month to month. But he does think it is possible to put a similar wage guarantee in place as has been offered to British employers. ""We can look at past earnings as evidenced by tax returns to make a reasonable projection and there are some ideas which are being formulated around software which could capture banking data and build projections off that as well,"" he said. ""While we're grateful to the government for the measures it has unveiled so far, we still believe that much more needs to be done to support the UK's five million self-employed people.""

Spanish army finds care home residents 'abandoned',"Madrid's main funeral home says its workers lack the equipment to deal with Covid-19 victims Spanish soldiers helping to fight the coronavirus pandemic have found elderly patients in retirement homes abandoned and, in some cases, dead in their beds, the defence ministry has said. Spanish prosecutors said an investigation had been launched. The military has been brought in to help disinfect care homes in Spain, one of Europe's worst hit countries. Meanwhile, an ice rink in Madrid is to be used as a temporary mortuary for Covid-19 victims, officials said. The virus is spreading very fast in Spain - the second worst-hit European country after Italy. On Tuesday, the health ministry announced that the number of deaths had risen by 514 in the past 24 hours - a daily record. A total of 2,696 people have now died and there are 39,637 confirmed cases. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles told the private TV channel Telecinco that the government was ""going to be strict and inflexible when dealing with the way older people are treated"" in retirement homes. ""The army, during certain visits, found some older people completely abandoned, sometimes even dead in their beds,"" she said. The defence ministry said that staff at some care homes had left after the coronavirus was detected. Health officials have said that in normal circumstances the bodies of deceased residents are put in cold storage until they are collected by the funeral services. But when the cause of death is suspected to be linked to coronavirus they are left in their beds until they can be retrieved by properly equipped funeral staff. In the capital Madrid, which has seen the highest number of cases and deaths, that could take up to 24 hours, officials said. Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa told a news conference that retirement homes were ""an absolute priority for the government"". ""We will exercise the most intensive monitoring of these centres,"" she added. As the crisis in Madrid worsened, the city's municipal funeral home said it would stop the collection of Covid-19 victims from Tuesday because of a lack of protective equipment. The city is to use a major ice rink, the Palacio de Hielo (Ice Palace), as a temporary mortuary where bodies will be stored until funeral homes can collect them, officials told Spanish media. The first coffins arrived at the Palacio de Hielo in Madrid on Monday The Palacio de Hielo complex, which also includes shops, restaurants, a bowling alley and cinemas, is not far from the Ifema congress centre where a field hospital has been set up for coronavirus patients. Spain is the second worst affected country in Europe after Italy, which now has the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world. Italian authorities said on Monday that 602 people with Covid-19 had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 6,077. But the daily increase was the smallest since Thursday, raising hope that stringent restrictions imposed by the government were starting to have an effect.

Wetherspoon boss tells staff get a job at Tesco,"The boss of the Wetherspoon pub chain has said its staff can take jobs with supermarkets amid the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Tim Martin told 40,000 workers in a video that they should feel free to take jobs at retailers such as Tesco while Wetherspoon pubs remain closed. He said: âIf youâre offered a jobâ¦ if you think itâs a good idea, do it.â The government has said it will pay 80% of salary forworkers at firms such as Wetherspoon affected by Covid-19. In the video, he called the government proposals âgreat, because we currently have no money coming in through the tills. Thatâs not something we had ever planned for.â All of Wetherspoon's 850 UK pubs were closed over the weekend after the government introduced new measures to try to stop the spread of Covid-19. Sports Direct U-turns on opening after backlash Supermarkets go on hiring spree amid virus crisis However, Mr Martin cited concerns that there could be some delay to the payment of any wage subsidy. In the video, he said he would therefore âcompletely understandâ if workers did not want âto wait aroundâ. He added that any former workers for the pub chain would receive first priority on future applications to rejoin the company. Tesco is looking to take on 20,000 temporary workers Mr Martin said that âalmost all of our trade has now gone to supermarketsâ, as demand for food surges as a result of the coronavirus crisis. âWeâve had lots of calls from supermarkets, Tesco alone want to recruit more than 20,000 people - more than half the number of people who work at our pubs,â he added. Mr Martin was previously resistant to government advice to consumers on avoiding pubs before more formal measures on closures were introduced. Last week,he branded a shutdown in the face of coronavirus ""over the top"". Many major supermarkets have been recruiting thousands of staff to cope with the huge surge in demand from shoppers. Tesco, the UKâs biggest supermarket, said it wanted to take on 20,000 temporary workers to âhelp feed the nationâ. Other firms that have launched a recruitment drive in recent weeks include Aldi, which is creating 5,000 new temporary posts, Lidl with 2,500 temporary posts, and Morrisons, which is creating 3,500 new jobs including pickers, drivers and staff for its distribution centres.

Tokyo 2020 organisers 'agree postponement',"The Olympic Games were due to run from 24 July to 9 August The Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games have been postponed until next year because of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. The event, due to begin on 24 July, will now take place ""no later than summer 2021"". ""I proposed to postpone for a year and [IOC] president Thomas Bach responded with 100% agreement,"" said Shinzo Abe, Japan's Prime Minister. The event will still be called Tokyo 2020 despite taking place in 2021. In a joint statement, the organisers of Tokyo 2020 and the IOC said: ""The unprecedented and unpredictable spread of the outbreak has seen the situation in the rest of the world deteriorating. ""On Monday, the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the Covid-19 pandemic is 'accelerating'. ""There are more than 375,000 cases now recorded worldwide and in nearly every country, and their number is growing by the hour. ""In the present circumstances and based on the information provided by the WHO today [Tuesday], the IOC president and the prime minister of Japan have concluded that the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Tokyo must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community."" 'Tokyo Olympics will be a carnival unleashed that no-one will take for granted ever again' 'Heartbreaking' but a 'relief' - how athletes reacted to Olympic delay GB Paralympians praise decision to delay Tokyo Games 'This is about protecting lives' - IOC chief says costs of Tokyo 2020 delay not discussed The Inside Track podcast: Tokyo 2020 is postponed While the Games is the biggest sporting event to be affected by the pandemic, there has been a huge impact on a host of other major tournaments and sports: In rugby union, the end of this year's Six Nations was postponed, with four outstanding fixtures to be rearranged in the men's tournament. In football, Euro 2020 was postponed and will be played in the summer of 2021, while the sport is suspended in the UK until 30 April at the earliest. The first eight grands prix of the Formula 1 season have been delayed, with the Monaco Grand Prix cancelled. County cricket in England and Wales will not be played before 28 May, while England's three-Test series against West Indies, due to start at The Oval on 4 June, is in doubt. All forms of professional tennis have been postponed until 7 June, ruling out the clay-court season, while the French Open - the year's second Grand Slam, has been rescheduled for September. Golf's Masters and PGA Championship have both been postponed, with a decision yet to be made about September's Ryder Cup. The London Marathon has been moved from 26 April to 4 October. The IOC had given itself adeadline of four weeksto consider delaying the Games but there had been mounting pressure from a host of Olympic committees and athletes demanding a quicker decision. Canada became the first major country to withdrawfrom both events on Sunday, while USA Track and Field, athletics' US governing body, had also called for a postponement. The Paralympics were due to start on 25 August but International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons said the postponement was ""the only logical option"". He added: ""The health and wellbeing of human life must always be our number-one priority and staging a sporting event of any kind during this pandemic is simply not possible. ""Sport is not the most important thing right now, preserving human life is. It is essential, therefore, that all steps are taken to try to limit the spread of this disease. ""By taking this decision now, everyone involved in the Paralympic movement, including all Para-athletes, can fully focus on their own health and wellbeing and staying safe during this unprecedented and difficult time."" World Athletics president Lord Coe said: ""The athletes have been under intolerable conditions, many of them are unable to train and many have been going through real emotional turmoil. ""The integrity of competition would have been seriously compromised if we had tried to force the Games into the remaining part of this year."" Coe, who was chairman of the London 2012 organising committee, said World Athletics was looking at moving the 2021 World Championships in Eugene, Oregon, to 2022. The Olympics have never been delayed in their 124-year modern history, though they were cancelled altogether in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during World War One and World War Two. Major Cold War boycotts disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles summer Games in 1980 and 1984. The Tokyo 2020-IOC statement continued: ""The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present. ""Therefore, it was agreed that the Olympic flame will stay in Japan. It was also agreed that the Games will keep the name Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020."" British Olympic Association chief executive Andy Anson said: ""It would have been unthinkable for us to continue to prepare for an Olympic Games at a time the nation and the world no less is enduring great hardship. A postponement is the right decision."" British Paralympics Association chief executive Mike Sharrock said: ""Stemming this global public health crisis and doing everything possible to safeguard the health and wellbeing of people should clearly take priority in these unprecedented times. ""We welcome the clarity this now gives Paralympic athletes throughout the world who have had their training and qualification plans severely disrupted."" On 22 January, Olympic qualifying events in boxing and women's football that were due to be held in Wuhan, China - the centre of the coronavirus outbreak - became the first to be moved or postponed. There have now been almost 400,000 recorded cases of the virus worldwide, with the number of deaths approaching 17,000. How coronavirus has impacted sporting events around the world The latest news on the coronavirus crisis Dan Roan, BBC sports editor This is arguably the biggest decision sport has seen in peacetime. It has looked inevitable for weeks, and many will ask why it has taken until now. With athletes unable to train safely, and the calendar of Olympic and Paralympic qualification events decimated amid travel restrictions and lockdowns, a postponement or cancellation emerged as the only viable options. Faced with the unenviable task of reorganising a sprawling mega-event that has already cost at least Â£10bn in preparations, the IOC and Japan had hoped to buy themselves some time to consider their next step. But with Olympic committees and athletes increasingly frustrated and confused at what some saw as delaying tactics, the decision was effectively taken out of the organisers' hands, and just 48 hours after the IOC said it was giving itself four weeks to mull it over, we now know the Games cannot go on as planned. The ramifications will be significant. It's a huge blow to Japan, and the country will now have to spend yet more money. Commercial contracts will have to be unpicked and the availability of venues revisited. A crowded sporting calendar will have to be flexible. And the IOC, sports federations, broadcasters, sponsors and a myriad of other related businesses will have to wait an additional year for the financial bonanza that the event generates. The Games has had to deal with many challenges over the years, from terrorism and boycotts to war and doping. But nothing quite like this. Olympians Alistair Brownlee, double Olympic triathlon champion: ""Evidently a very tough decision for the IOC and other stakeholders to make but in my opinion the right one. Both, for the message it sends to people around the world battling with the virus and to give clarity to athletes attempting to prepare."" Jazmin Sawyers, long jumper: ""The right choice. For now we have to stay home to protect ourselves and everyone else. Look after each other, sport will be here when this is over, and we will be ready to give you all the greatest show on earth."" Callum Skinner, retired cycling team sprint Olympic champion, who fronts competitor-led movement Global Athlete: ""The right decision has been made. Tokyo 2021 presents an amazing opportunity to host a full Games celebrating the world (hopefully) entering the ""post-pandemic"" phase."" Sophie McKinna, British shot putter: ""The right call in unprecedented circumstances. Welcome to #Tokyo2021 This video can not be played Olympics postponement a 'release' for athletes - Peaty Paralympians Ali Jawad, silver medal-winning powerlifter: ""The right call in unprecedented circumstances. Welcome to #Tokyo2021"" Kadeena Cox, cycling and athletics champion: ""The right choice. Health before everything. Let's all stick together through these tough times and when the time is right we can enjoy the Games and its legacy."" CyclistLora Fachie: ""On a personal level I am devastated. Tokyo 2020 has been my target for the past four years. I've lived, slept and breathed it, giving me focus and drive. But it is also without doubt the right decision to have made. Back to the drawing board we go."" Dan Greaves, discus thrower: ""Absolutely the right decision to postpone both the Olympics & Paralympics by a year. Health comes first.

Father rejects killer's rough sex defenceChloe Miazek was strangled to death during sex but her father rejects claims that she consented.,"Chloe Miazek was killed after a night out in Aberdeen The father of a 20-year-old who was killed by a man she met after a night out says his daughter was unfairly shamed by her killer's defence. Chloe Miazek died at a flat in Aberdeen in November 2017 after she was strangled by Mark Bruce. Speaking out for the first time, her father Bob rejects the claim that his daughter and Bruce had a ""shared interest"" in asphyxiation during sex. He says it was later admitted by Bruce that the pair never even discussed it. In fact, the court was told that Bruce had accepted, when sentencing reports were being prepared after his conviction, he did not have the consent of his victim to use strangulation during sex. The death of Chloe Miazek was recently echoed in the case of British backpacker Grace Millane who was strangled by a man she met on a Tinder date in New Zealand. Rough sex murder defence: Why campaigners want it banned Both Ms Millane and Ms Miazek were unable to defend themselves from claims that their deaths were ""kinky sex games"" gone wrong. Ms Miazek's father says his daughter was just an ordinary young girl on a night out who was killed by a man she had just met. Mark Bruce pleaded guilty to culpable homicide Her killer was originally charged with murder but Bruce pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of culpable homicide and was sentenced to six years. When he was convicted at the High Court in Aberdeen in March 2018, there was an ""agreed narrative"" between the Crown prosecutors and the defence over what happened that night. The court was told how Ms Miazek was ejected from a nightclub and met Bruce, who had also been drinking, at a bus stop in the early hours. They went back to Bruce's flat and the CCTV footage of Ms Miazek entering the building is the last time she was seen alive. Through his tears, Ms Miazek's father toldBBC Disclosurehow the family felt sidelined by the legal process and how his daughter's reputation was trashed without her being able to defend herself. Mr Miazek thinks personal remarks about his daughter's private life were used to reduce the culpability of Bruce. Bob Miazek says his daughter Chloe was just an ordinary Scottish girl The killer's defence lawyer told the judge that Ms Miazek had ""somewhat lost her way"" and was ""experimenting...with drink, drugs and sexual practices"", a claim her father rejects. The defence lawyer also referenced a statement taken from a previous partner of Ms Miazek that outlined ""erotic sexual asphyxiation was something she was interested in"", although the couple never practised it. The lawyer told the judge that Bruce could not recall the specifics of what happened on the night Ms Miazek died but he said that it seemed they had ""a shared interest in that particular practice"". The statements in court still haunt Bob Miazek and his wife Theresa. ""They used quite a long time to implicate Chloe,"" Bob says. ""And that was when all the headlines hit the tabloids. We had to sit through that and listen to that about our little girl."" The Daily Record ran with ""strangled to death in kinky sex romp"" while The Scottish Sun and Daily Mail both referenced a fatal ""sex game"". Mr Miazek rejects the suggestion that his daughter consented to the fatal violence inflicted by Mark Bruce. He questions how someone who has strangled a person to death is allowed to say the victim consented without any proof. The BBC can reveal that the sentencing in April 2018 calls the defence's original claims into question. After reading out sections of Mark Bruce's ""Criminal Justice Social Work Report"", his defence lawyer stated that Bruce had told the authors of the report ""there was no conversation between himself and Ms Miazek about violence during sex, there was no discussion and that at no point would she have expected such"". The lawyer added: ""In particular, Mr Bruce has stated in this report, or it is recorded in this report, that he accepts that he did not have the consent of the victim to use strangulation during sex."" Mr Miazek recalls hearing this statement in court. ""We stood up and we're likeâ¦'this means murder',"" he says. The same report that stated Chloe did not give consent also referenced that Bruce had previously choked a partner during sex. Chloe Miazek had only just met Mark Bruce Although Bruce swiftly took responsibility for Chloe's death, Mr Miazek questions why more was not made of his failure to call for help. Three hours after Ms Miazek was last seen alive, Bruce left the flat but it took more than an hour before he handed himself into a local police station, confessing that he had killed her. ""Our opinion was he didn't report it anywhere near [early] enough. He should have reported it when it happened,"" Mr Miazek says. ""He should've done something, not just leave her,"" he added. Mr Miazek says what happened has had a ripple effect through the whole family. He says that Chloe's death and the aftermath of it is still affecting ""brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews"" and that he doesn't know how long is it going to take for the pain to subside. ""The law should actually help people that are the victims,"" he says.

"Tokyo 2020 organisers 'agree postponement'The organisers of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, due to begin on 24 July, agree to a one-year postponement of the event because of the global coronavirus pandemic.BBC Sport","The Olympic Games were due to run from 24 July to 9 August The Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games have been postponed until next year because of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. The event, due to begin on 24 July, will now take place ""no later than summer 2021"". ""I proposed to postpone for a year and [IOC] president Thomas Bach responded with 100% agreement,"" said Shinzo Abe, Japan's Prime Minister. The event will still be called Tokyo 2020 despite taking place in 2021. In a joint statement, the organisers of Tokyo 2020 and the IOC said: ""The unprecedented and unpredictable spread of the outbreak has seen the situation in the rest of the world deteriorating. ""On Monday, the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the Covid-19 pandemic is 'accelerating'. ""There are more than 375,000 cases now recorded worldwide and in nearly every country, and their number is growing by the hour. ""In the present circumstances and based on the information provided by the WHO today [Tuesday], the IOC president and the prime minister of Japan have concluded that the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Tokyo must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community."" 'Tokyo Olympics will be a carnival unleashed that no-one will take for granted ever again' 'Heartbreaking' but a 'relief' - how athletes reacted to Olympic delay GB Paralympians praise decision to delay Tokyo Games 'This is about protecting lives' - IOC chief says costs of Tokyo 2020 delay not discussed The Inside Track podcast: Tokyo 2020 is postponed While the Games is the biggest sporting event to be affected by the pandemic, there has been a huge impact on a host of other major tournaments and sports: In rugby union, the end of this year's Six Nations was postponed, with four outstanding fixtures to be rearranged in the men's tournament. In football, Euro 2020 was postponed and will be played in the summer of 2021, while the sport is suspended in the UK until 30 April at the earliest. The first eight grands prix of the Formula 1 season have been delayed, with the Monaco Grand Prix cancelled. County cricket in England and Wales will not be played before 28 May, while England's three-Test series against West Indies, due to start at The Oval on 4 June, is in doubt. All forms of professional tennis have been postponed until 7 June, ruling out the clay-court season, while the French Open - the year's second Grand Slam, has been rescheduled for September. Golf's Masters and PGA Championship have both been postponed, with a decision yet to be made about September's Ryder Cup. The London Marathon has been moved from 26 April to 4 October. The IOC had given itself adeadline of four weeksto consider delaying the Games but there had been mounting pressure from a host of Olympic committees and athletes demanding a quicker decision. Canada became the first major country to withdrawfrom both events on Sunday, while USA Track and Field, athletics' US governing body, had also called for a postponement. The Paralympics were due to start on 25 August but International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons said the postponement was ""the only logical option"". He added: ""The health and wellbeing of human life must always be our number-one priority and staging a sporting event of any kind during this pandemic is simply not possible. ""Sport is not the most important thing right now, preserving human life is. It is essential, therefore, that all steps are taken to try to limit the spread of this disease. ""By taking this decision now, everyone involved in the Paralympic movement, including all Para-athletes, can fully focus on their own health and wellbeing and staying safe during this unprecedented and difficult time."" World Athletics president Lord Coe said: ""The athletes have been under intolerable conditions, many of them are unable to train and many have been going through real emotional turmoil. ""The integrity of competition would have been seriously compromised if we had tried to force the Games into the remaining part of this year."" Coe, who was chairman of the London 2012 organising committee, said World Athletics was looking at moving the 2021 World Championships in Eugene, Oregon, to 2022. The Olympics have never been delayed in their 124-year modern history, though they were cancelled altogether in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during World War One and World War Two. Major Cold War boycotts disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles summer Games in 1980 and 1984. The Tokyo 2020-IOC statement continued: ""The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present. ""Therefore, it was agreed that the Olympic flame will stay in Japan. It was also agreed that the Games will keep the name Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020."" British Olympic Association chief executive Andy Anson said: ""It would have been unthinkable for us to continue to prepare for an Olympic Games at a time the nation and the world no less is enduring great hardship. A postponement is the right decision."" British Paralympics Association chief executive Mike Sharrock said: ""Stemming this global public health crisis and doing everything possible to safeguard the health and wellbeing of people should clearly take priority in these unprecedented times. ""We welcome the clarity this now gives Paralympic athletes throughout the world who have had their training and qualification plans severely disrupted."" On 22 January, Olympic qualifying events in boxing and women's football that were due to be held in Wuhan, China - the centre of the coronavirus outbreak - became the first to be moved or postponed. There have now been almost 400,000 recorded cases of the virus worldwide, with the number of deaths approaching 17,000. How coronavirus has impacted sporting events around the world The latest news on the coronavirus crisis Dan Roan, BBC sports editor This is arguably the biggest decision sport has seen in peacetime. It has looked inevitable for weeks, and many will ask why it has taken until now. With athletes unable to train safely, and the calendar of Olympic and Paralympic qualification events decimated amid travel restrictions and lockdowns, a postponement or cancellation emerged as the only viable options. Faced with the unenviable task of reorganising a sprawling mega-event that has already cost at least Â£10bn in preparations, the IOC and Japan had hoped to buy themselves some time to consider their next step. But with Olympic committees and athletes increasingly frustrated and confused at what some saw as delaying tactics, the decision was effectively taken out of the organisers' hands, and just 48 hours after the IOC said it was giving itself four weeks to mull it over, we now know the Games cannot go on as planned. The ramifications will be significant. It's a huge blow to Japan, and the country will now have to spend yet more money. Commercial contracts will have to be unpicked and the availability of venues revisited. A crowded sporting calendar will have to be flexible. And the IOC, sports federations, broadcasters, sponsors and a myriad of other related businesses will have to wait an additional year for the financial bonanza that the event generates. The Games has had to deal with many challenges over the years, from terrorism and boycotts to war and doping. But nothing quite like this. Olympians Alistair Brownlee, double Olympic triathlon champion: ""Evidently a very tough decision for the IOC and other stakeholders to make but in my opinion the right one. Both, for the message it sends to people around the world battling with the virus and to give clarity to athletes attempting to prepare."" Jazmin Sawyers, long jumper: ""The right choice. For now we have to stay home to protect ourselves and everyone else. Look after each other, sport will be here when this is over, and we will be ready to give you all the greatest show on earth."" Callum Skinner, retired cycling team sprint Olympic champion, who fronts competitor-led movement Global Athlete: ""The right decision has been made. Tokyo 2021 presents an amazing opportunity to host a full Games celebrating the world (hopefully) entering the ""post-pandemic"" phase."" Sophie McKinna, British shot putter: ""The right call in unprecedented circumstances. Welcome to #Tokyo2021 This video can not be played Olympics postponement a 'release' for athletes - Peaty Paralympians Ali Jawad, silver medal-winning powerlifter: ""The right call in unprecedented circumstances. Welcome to #Tokyo2021"" Kadeena Cox, cycling and athletics champion: ""The right choice. Health before everything. Let's all stick together through these tough times and when the time is right we can enjoy the Games and its legacy."" CyclistLora Fachie: ""On a personal level I am devastated. Tokyo 2020 has been my target for the past four years. I've lived, slept and breathed it, giving me focus and drive. But it is also without doubt the right decision to have made. Back to the drawing board we go."" Dan Greaves, discus thrower: ""Absolutely the right decision to postpone both the Olympics & Paralympics by a year. Health comes first.

Wetherspoon boss tells staff get a job at TescoTim Martin says workers can take up jobs with supermarkets following the coronavirus shutdown.,"The boss of the Wetherspoon pub chain has said its staff can take jobs with supermarkets amid the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Tim Martin told 40,000 workers in a video that they should feel free to take jobs at retailers such as Tesco while Wetherspoon pubs remain closed. He said: âIf youâre offered a jobâ¦ if you think itâs a good idea, do it.â The government has said it will pay 80% of salary forworkers at firms such as Wetherspoon affected by Covid-19. In the video, he called the government proposals âgreat, because we currently have no money coming in through the tills. Thatâs not something we had ever planned for.â All of Wetherspoon's 850 UK pubs were closed over the weekend after the government introduced new measures to try to stop the spread of Covid-19. Sports Direct U-turns on opening after backlash Supermarkets go on hiring spree amid virus crisis However, Mr Martin cited concerns that there could be some delay to the payment of any wage subsidy. In the video, he said he would therefore âcompletely understandâ if workers did not want âto wait aroundâ. He added that any former workers for the pub chain would receive first priority on future applications to rejoin the company. Tesco is looking to take on 20,000 temporary workers Mr Martin said that âalmost all of our trade has now gone to supermarketsâ, as demand for food surges as a result of the coronavirus crisis. âWeâve had lots of calls from supermarkets, Tesco alone want to recruit more than 20,000 people - more than half the number of people who work at our pubs,â he added. Mr Martin was previously resistant to government advice to consumers on avoiding pubs before more formal measures on closures were introduced. Last week,he branded a shutdown in the face of coronavirus ""over the top"". Many major supermarkets have been recruiting thousands of staff to cope with the huge surge in demand from shoppers. Tesco, the UKâs biggest supermarket, said it wanted to take on 20,000 temporary workers to âhelp feed the nationâ. Other firms that have launched a recruitment drive in recent weeks include Aldi, which is creating 5,000 new temporary posts, Lidl with 2,500 temporary posts, and Morrisons, which is creating 3,500 new jobs including pickers, drivers and staff for its distribution centres.

'How is Â£94 a week going to pay anyoneâs bills?âFreelance gig economy workers say they cannot survive on the support offered by the government.Business,"Freelance marketing consultant Chloe Hall says the self-employed feel forgotten about Freelance workers feel they have been forgotten, after hearing about the latest financial measures announced by the UK government on Friday to bolster the economy against the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Chancellor Rishi Sunakannounced increased benefits for the self-employed, but did not guarantee their wages. ""I was absolutely devastated,"" said Chloe Hall, a freelance marketing consultant based in Newcastle upon Tyne. ""We work just as hard, but freelancers are always sort of at the bottom of the pile."" According to the Office for National Statistics, there are five million self-employed people in the UK, who make up 15% of the labour market. Ms Hall told the BBC she had cancelled subscription services and even her business bank account in a bid to reduce costs, but without work, she didn't know how she would pay her bills. ""Without the mortgage, my essential bills come to Â£948 a month,"" she said. ""Â£94.25 a week [the Universal Credit payment] - how is that going to pay anybody's bills?"" The measures announced by the Chancellor to help small businesses and the self-employed included: VAT payments by companies deferred until the end of June Interest free cash grants to small businesses Self-assessment income tax payments for July 2020 deferred for six months Increase in standard Universal Credit of Â£20 a week, with the same rise for those still on the working tax credit scheme Nearly Â£1bn for those struggling to pay rent, through increases in housing benefit and Universal Credit The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents gig economy workers, has announced that it is suing the government over its failure to protect the wages and jobs of millions of workers during the pandemic, as well as its failure to ensure the health and safety of those still employed through proper sick pay. IWGB General Secretary Dr Jason Moyer-Lee said: ""No one wants to be litigating right now. We all have extremely pressing things to be getting on with, but we also can't stand by and watch our members being driven into financial destitution because the government has simply forgotten about them. ""The low paid precarious workers must have the means to follow public health advice and continue to pay their bills and put food on the table. Right now, they don't."" The government has said there will be further measures to help self-employed people. Rishi Sunak told the Commons: ""We absolutely understand the situation... and are determined to find a way to support them"". The Chief Secretary to the Treasury - Steven Barclay - added that the self-employed had not been forgotten by ministers. He said: ""Further help is indeed coming - but we have to make sure we get this right."" Deliveroo driver Greg Howard says delivery orders have gone down, not up Deliveroo rider Greg Howard, says that gig economy delivery drivers are extremely worried about their incomes, and says that the perception that the takeaway industry is booming is false. ""People are quite concerned as we've had news that quite a few of the restaurants that are integral for our everyday work are closing, despite being allowed to stay open for takeaways,"" he said. Mr Howard, who is based in Nottingham, which is one of the UK's busiest zones for deliveries, said that typically, he would make 25-30 deliveries a day, working five or six days a week on 10-hour-long shifts, and his take-home pay would be about Â£500 a week. Now, he makes 10-15 deliveries a day, working shifts lasting up to 14 hours, because fewer restaurants are open, but the same number of couriers are still on the roads. ""I don't know how I'm going to be able to make ends meet for myself and my family. Â£94.25 a week is not enough for us."" Coronavirus: 'If you can't work, what do you do?' Coronavirus: 'There isn't time. Firms are closing now' Coronavirus: Government to pay up to 80% of workers' wages Diane Evans, based in Brentwood, Essex, has been a freelance childminder for 16 years. As a single parent with two children, she provides childcare services from her home, but with schools closing, her work has been severely affected. ""A lot of us feel that we're considered to be babysitters by the government and we get left behind, almost not taken seriously for our jobs,"" she said. Freelance childminder Diane Evans (centre) with daughters Jessica and Rebecca Ms Evans said that at the minimum, she would require double the amount of the weekly Universal Credit payment to make ends meet, and that childminders could be forced to stay closed until the new school year in September. ""We can't go get another job stacking shelves in the supermarket, for example, because we can't leave our children at home on their own. We're stuck and we're not getting any support from the government."" Julia Martin is a professional singer based in Brigg, North Lincolnshire, specialising in tributes to artists like Celion Dion and Dame Shirley Bassey. Her son is disabled and needs a warm home at all times, which means her utility bills typically cost about Â£300 a month. Even with mortgage payments frozen, she won't be able to get by. ""My disappointment was palpable when I realised we were yet again to be overlooked and effectively thrown under the bus to fend for ourselves,"" she said. ""For over 20 years I and many others in a similar occupation have contributed to the economy of the UK. I have never claimed benefits and I pay my taxes, yet through no fault of my own I have had all my performances terminated for a minimum of two months."" Professional singer Julia Martin says freelancers have been left to fend for themselves The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) has launched a petition and written to the prime minister along with with numerous other industry bodies,calling on the government to implement a temporary income protection fund specifically for the self-employed,external. According to the IPSE, prior to the coronavirus outbreak, self-employed people contributed Â£305bn to the British economy. IPSE's policy director Andy Chamberlain says he understands the government's hesitation over self-employed people, because it is more difficult to confirm how much they are actually earning month to month. But he does think it is possible to put a similar wage guarantee in place as has been offered to British employers. ""We can look at past earnings as evidenced by tax returns to make a reasonable projection and there are some ideas which are being formulated around software which could capture banking data and build projections off that as well,"" he said. ""While we're grateful to the government for the measures it has unveiled so far, we still believe that much more needs to be done to support the UK's five million self-employed people.""

"Spanish army finds care home residents 'abandoned'An inquiry is launched after soldiers discover elderly coronavirus victims ""dead in their beds"".Europe","Madrid's main funeral home says its workers lack the equipment to deal with Covid-19 victims Spanish soldiers helping to fight the coronavirus pandemic have found elderly patients in retirement homes abandoned and, in some cases, dead in their beds, the defence ministry has said. Spanish prosecutors said an investigation had been launched. The military has been brought in to help disinfect care homes in Spain, one of Europe's worst hit countries. Meanwhile, an ice rink in Madrid is to be used as a temporary mortuary for Covid-19 victims, officials said. The virus is spreading very fast in Spain - the second worst-hit European country after Italy. On Tuesday, the health ministry announced that the number of deaths had risen by 514 in the past 24 hours - a daily record. A total of 2,696 people have now died and there are 39,637 confirmed cases. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles told the private TV channel Telecinco that the government was ""going to be strict and inflexible when dealing with the way older people are treated"" in retirement homes. ""The army, during certain visits, found some older people completely abandoned, sometimes even dead in their beds,"" she said. The defence ministry said that staff at some care homes had left after the coronavirus was detected. Health officials have said that in normal circumstances the bodies of deceased residents are put in cold storage until they are collected by the funeral services. But when the cause of death is suspected to be linked to coronavirus they are left in their beds until they can be retrieved by properly equipped funeral staff. In the capital Madrid, which has seen the highest number of cases and deaths, that could take up to 24 hours, officials said. Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa told a news conference that retirement homes were ""an absolute priority for the government"". ""We will exercise the most intensive monitoring of these centres,"" she added. As the crisis in Madrid worsened, the city's municipal funeral home said it would stop the collection of Covid-19 victims from Tuesday because of a lack of protective equipment. The city is to use a major ice rink, the Palacio de Hielo (Ice Palace), as a temporary mortuary where bodies will be stored until funeral homes can collect them, officials told Spanish media. The first coffins arrived at the Palacio de Hielo in Madrid on Monday The Palacio de Hielo complex, which also includes shops, restaurants, a bowling alley and cinemas, is not far from the Ifema congress centre where a field hospital has been set up for coronavirus patients. Spain is the second worst affected country in Europe after Italy, which now has the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world. Italian authorities said on Monday that 602 people with Covid-19 had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 6,077.

Coronavirus: Clinic defends charging Â£375 for test,"A private healthcare clinic in London has defended its decision to charge Â£375 ($434) for a coronavirus test. The Private Harley Street Clinic said the price reflected ""the costs of these logistic and clinical services that we provide"" and added that it was offering free tests for NHS staff. It followed newspaper reports that the clinic had sold several thousand at full price. According to its website, the test is no longer available. In a statement released on Monday, the clinic said it was ""pausing"" the service now that the UK government has committed to carrying out more tests nationwide, with an aim to carry out 25,000 tests a day within four weeks. Chief executive Dr Mark Ali did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. It is believed the test offered was made by a firm called Randox Health, which was selling them online for Â£120 each, although according to its website it is currently out of stock. Randox Health, which is based in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, was also contacted by the BBC. Public Health England currently does not advise buying home tests. It says there is not yet enough information about them. ""It is not known whether either a positive or negative result is reliable"", readsa statement on its website,external. A spokesman for the General Medical Council said: ""We expect doctors to be clear about the safety and accuracy of Covid-19 tests, and not to offer or recommend tests that are unproven, clinically unverified and/or otherwise unreliable."" Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the needs of NHS staff and patients should be ""put over making profit from the situation"". Coronavirus: Clinic defends charging Â£375 for test EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What's the UK's plan and what could happen next? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The Private Harley Street Clinic said it had never advertised its service. Google told the BBC that while it did not have a specific rule about ads for coronavirus tests, it had placed  the pandemic under its ""sensitive events policy"", which means ads are banned which ""may capitalise on tragic events such as a natural disaster, conflict or death"". Facebook said that test kit ads were banned. Australian firm Rapidward said that five days ago it began supplying Covid-19 blood tests direct from China to Switzerland, Italy and Iran at a cost of $12 each, including shipping. The test, which detects antibodies, claims to be around 95% accurate. It has not yet been approved by the Federal Drugs Agency (FDA) in the US but it is registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK. The firm said it would not sell to individuals. ""The kits are simple enough to be used by individuals, but we want to supply the medical industry and healthcare sector,"" said founder Milton Zhou. Mr Zhou added that he believed it was ""outrageous"" to charge more than the cost price. Academics at Leicester University are developing a mask-based test that could cost just Â£2 per unit, it said. The mask collects a sample of what the wearer is breathing out - which then requires laboratory analysis. Who can still get free Covid tests? How can I tell if I've got Covid?

Father rejects killer's rough sex defence,"Chloe Miazek was killed after a night out in Aberdeen The father of a 20-year-old who was killed by a man she met after a night out says his daughter was unfairly shamed by her killer's defence. Chloe Miazek died at a flat in Aberdeen in November 2017 after she was strangled by Mark Bruce. Speaking out for the first time, her father Bob rejects the claim that his daughter and Bruce had a ""shared interest"" in asphyxiation during sex. He says it was later admitted by Bruce that the pair never even discussed it. In fact, the court was told that Bruce had accepted, when sentencing reports were being prepared after his conviction, he did not have the consent of his victim to use strangulation during sex. The death of Chloe Miazek was recently echoed in the case of British backpacker Grace Millane who was strangled by a man she met on a Tinder date in New Zealand. Rough sex murder defence: Why campaigners want it banned Both Ms Millane and Ms Miazek were unable to defend themselves from claims that their deaths were ""kinky sex games"" gone wrong. Ms Miazek's father says his daughter was just an ordinary young girl on a night out who was killed by a man she had just met. Mark Bruce pleaded guilty to culpable homicide Her killer was originally charged with murder but Bruce pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of culpable homicide and was sentenced to six years. When he was convicted at the High Court in Aberdeen in March 2018, there was an ""agreed narrative"" between the Crown prosecutors and the defence over what happened that night. The court was told how Ms Miazek was ejected from a nightclub and met Bruce, who had also been drinking, at a bus stop in the early hours. They went back to Bruce's flat and the CCTV footage of Ms Miazek entering the building is the last time she was seen alive. Through his tears, Ms Miazek's father toldBBC Disclosurehow the family felt sidelined by the legal process and how his daughter's reputation was trashed without her being able to defend herself. Mr Miazek thinks personal remarks about his daughter's private life were used to reduce the culpability of Bruce. Bob Miazek says his daughter Chloe was just an ordinary Scottish girl The killer's defence lawyer told the judge that Ms Miazek had ""somewhat lost her way"" and was ""experimenting...with drink, drugs and sexual practices"", a claim her father rejects. The defence lawyer also referenced a statement taken from a previous partner of Ms Miazek that outlined ""erotic sexual asphyxiation was something she was interested in"", although the couple never practised it. The lawyer told the judge that Bruce could not recall the specifics of what happened on the night Ms Miazek died but he said that it seemed they had ""a shared interest in that particular practice"". The statements in court still haunt Bob Miazek and his wife Theresa. ""They used quite a long time to implicate Chloe,"" Bob says. ""And that was when all the headlines hit the tabloids. We had to sit through that and listen to that about our little girl."" The Daily Record ran with ""strangled to death in kinky sex romp"" while The Scottish Sun and Daily Mail both referenced a fatal ""sex game"". Mr Miazek rejects the suggestion that his daughter consented to the fatal violence inflicted by Mark Bruce. He questions how someone who has strangled a person to death is allowed to say the victim consented without any proof. The BBC can reveal that the sentencing in April 2018 calls the defence's original claims into question. After reading out sections of Mark Bruce's ""Criminal Justice Social Work Report"", his defence lawyer stated that Bruce had told the authors of the report ""there was no conversation between himself and Ms Miazek about violence during sex, there was no discussion and that at no point would she have expected such"". The lawyer added: ""In particular, Mr Bruce has stated in this report, or it is recorded in this report, that he accepts that he did not have the consent of the victim to use strangulation during sex."" Mr Miazek recalls hearing this statement in court. ""We stood up and we're likeâ¦'this means murder',"" he says. The same report that stated Chloe did not give consent also referenced that Bruce had previously choked a partner during sex. Chloe Miazek had only just met Mark Bruce Although Bruce swiftly took responsibility for Chloe's death, Mr Miazek questions why more was not made of his failure to call for help. Three hours after Ms Miazek was last seen alive, Bruce left the flat but it took more than an hour before he handed himself into a local police station, confessing that he had killed her. ""Our opinion was he didn't report it anywhere near [early] enough. He should have reported it when it happened,"" Mr Miazek says. ""He should've done something, not just leave her,"" he added. Mr Miazek says what happened has had a ripple effect through the whole family. He says that Chloe's death and the aftermath of it is still affecting ""brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews"" and that he doesn't know how long is it going to take for the pain to subside. ""The law should actually help people that are the victims,"" he says.

The workers braving coronavirus,"Mehfuz says his company is taking ""precautions and trying to serve our customers"" ""It's been non-stop for the past few weeks. No matter how hard we try, the shelves aren't full."" There are many people around the country who have been following the government'sadvice around social distancing- that's avoiding going out for non-essential reasons due to the coronavirus pandemic. For quite a few of us, that means having to work from home. But that's not an option everyone can take. Supermarket worker Tiff has no choice but to go to work, despite the infection risks. ""In an ideal world, supermarkets would close too, but I know that's not possible right now,"" the 26-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. You've probably seen people flooding to supermarkets, trying to get as many items as they can -panic buying things like handwash and antibacterial gel. Tiff's in charge of the health and beauty section in her supermarket, which includes those items. And she says the rush of panic buying because of coronavirus has been ""horrible and overwhelming"". ""People have been yelling at me, asking why it's not there when we run out."" With cases of Covid-19 rising around the country, you might imagine that lots of frontline workers wouldn't want to work anymore. But not Mehfuz Dasu Patel. The 28-year-old helps run a group of community pharmacies in north west England, which serve 250 care homes and deliver medicines to around 20,000 patients. And those patients are the reason he's still going to work. If Mehfuz decides to stop working, ""vulnerable people will go without medicines"", he says. ""It's difficult but people in the NHS have it tougher,"" Jade says ""It's not the sort of business that can just disappear or you can work from home. We have to keep delivering to them, despite what's happening in the world."" And despite her experiences in the supermarket, Tiff agrees with Mehfuz that it's important for those on the frontline to keep working at a time of crisis. ""People need supplies - they're looking for hygiene products and food - so we have to do what we can. If we don't, it'll just be more anger and panic,"" she says. Tiff admits feeling ""anxious and afraid"" because of the uncertainty around the virus and possible impact on her health. She suffered with a bad cough a few years ago, which she worries has damaged her lungs. People withunderlying health problemsare at greater risk of developing severe symptoms. ""I'm always thinking about it and a bit worried,"" she says. And Tiff's not the only one to have those concerns. Jade Barnett, 19, has two jobs - in a warehouse and a supermarket - and she's worried she could catch the coronavirus at work and take it home to her family. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash ""It's not as much about me. I just don't want to catch anything and then pass it onto my nan or nephew,"" she says. She wears gloves at work and is ""quite cautious"". But with lots of people whose jobs are at risk, Jade says she's grateful she's still able to work, despite the potential health risk. ""There are lots of people out there who have lost their jobs, or aren't able to earn any money. How are people meant to survive without money and a job?"" Like Tiff and Mehfuz, she acknowledges that she has a vital ""role to play"" in helping the country fight coronavirus. Jade feels it's something that now comes with ""extra pressure"". When she's packing deliveries in the warehouse, she's aware that not having all the items someone needs can make things difficult for customers. ""It means they won't get a good shop and it might be someone who can't physically come to the shops,"" she says. ""So you do think about things like that and feel more responsibility."" When working in the supermarket, she says it can be hard when dealing with elderly people because of limits on buying certain items. ""They often get lots of things and you have to tell them they can't take that much. You feel bad because you never know how much someone needs."" 'People need our help', says Mehfuz Mehfuz says the current crisis is ""the toughest time"" he's ever experienced. ""Everyone at work understands the pressure is on us to deliver for the vulnerable,"" he says, adding that customers have called up worried his service may be shut down. ""They tell us that the country needs you to continue working. That motivates me and the others a lot."" It's an exhausting time for both Jade and Tiff, and they can't wait for the crisis to be over. ""It can be a lot of night shifts, sometimes 16-hour shifts. It feels like 24/7,"" Jade says. ""Hopefully all of this calms down soon. Because you do have some really rough days and it's not nice."" ""We'll keep working, but even if it's just for a few weeks, we need a break,"" Tiff adds. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

Strict new curbs on life in UK announced by PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You must stay at home"" Strict new curbs on life in the UK to tackle the spread of coronavirus have been announced by the prime minister. People may only leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when it is ""absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and fulfil any medical or care needs. Shops selling non-essential goods have been told to shut and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together will be prohibited. The UK death toll has reached 335. If people do not follow the rules police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in atelevised statement from Downing Street. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Johnson said the country faced a ""moment of national emergency"" and staying at home was necessary to protect the NHS and save lives. He said the restrictions would be in place for at least three weeks and would be kept under constant review. The government guidance,externalsays people should only leave home for one of four reasons: Shopping for basic necessities such as food and medicine. Shopping trips should be as infrequent as possible One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk, or cycle. This should be done alone or only with people you live with Any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. This includes moving children under the age of 18 between their parents' homes, where applicable. Key workers or those with children identified as vulnerable can continue to take their children to school Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home Even when following the above guidance, people should minimise the amount of time spent out of their homes and should keep two metres (6ft) away from people they do not live with. The government is also stopping all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies - but funerals will be allowed. Businesses that will not need to close,externalinclude: Restaurants, cafes and work canteens - but only for food delivery and takeaway services Supermarkets and other premises selling food, including market stalls ""Health shops"" such as pharmacies Petrol stations, garages and car rental businesses Bicycle shops Home and hardware shops Launderettes and dry cleaners Pet shops Corner shops, newsagents and post offices Banks Other premises including libraries, non-essential shops, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship have been ordered to close. Parks will remain open for exercise but people are not allowed to gather in groups. Community centres can remain open but only for the purpose of ""hosting essential voluntary or public services"" such as food banks or service for homeless people, the guidance says. Hotels, hostels, campsites and caravan parks must also close unless key workers need to stay there, or if other people staying there cannot return to their primary residence. This video can not be played What is social distancing? Scientists have said each person with coronavirus infects 2.5 people and that takes about five days. This means, over a period of 30 days, more than 400 people will have been infected as a result of that one person. If a person halves their social exposure, that first infection leads to only 15 infections after 30 days. Several police forces said they were facing a high number of phone calls from members of the public seeking clarification on the new restrictions. Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley warned the public not to ""cripple"" his force's phone lines. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said they were working with the government and other agencies to work out how best to enforce the new rules. But Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said he was already seeing ""large amounts of sickness"" among officers across London and enforcing the new restrictions would be ""a real, real challenge"". ""We will be dealing with it, but I'm not sure we will have the resources to be able to see it through,"" he added. Home Secretary Priti Patel saidin a tweet,externalthat the next few weeks would be ""testing"" for police but that she would make sure officers had ""the resources they need to keep themselves and the public safe"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the new restrictions ""amount to a lockdown"" and are ""not done lightly"". ""I am not going to sugarcoat it in any way,"" she said. ""Coronavirus is the biggest challenge of our lifetime."" In a tweet,external, First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster urged people to follow the restrictions ""to save lives and protect our hospitals"". First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said ""these are really big changes for us all"". ""We are making them because of the speed the virus is continuing to spread,"" he added. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the measures were ""the right response"". ""The government must close the loopholes to give security to all workers, including the self-employed, as well as renters and mortgage holders,"" he added. Five things that will now be banned All non-essential shops to close immediately Stay at home, first minister tells Wales This is a lockdown, says Scottish first minister 'Wave of deaths' in NI if social distancing not followed The prime minister said the measures were necessary to tackle ""the biggest threat this country has faced for decades"". ""Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won't be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,"" he said. ""And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. ""To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well."" It seems hard to overstate how huge an impact this will have on the country, and what a massive decision this is for the government to have taken - whose effect will last at least for a period of three weeks at the shortest, potentially for very much longer. Remember this though is not quite the kind of total crackdown we have seen in other countries - at least not yet. Despite tonight's enormous announcement, there are steps that other places have taken - curfews or total travel bans for example - that the UK is not pursuing. The government is not triggering the Civil Contingencies Act, designed for the most serious emergencies which gives ministers draconian powers. Not surprisingly, there is already therefore enormous controversy about whether the UK has been acting fast enough. Read more from Laura The prime minister said he knew the ""damage"" the restrictions were causing to people's lives, businesses and jobs but at present there were ""no easy options"". ""The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost,"" he said. However, Mr Johnson said there was ""a clear way through"", by strengthening the NHS with former clinicians returning to work, accelerating the search for treatments and a vaccine and buying millions of testing kits. This video can not be played Saturday was the ""busiest ever visitor day in living memory"" in Snowdonia, officials say A further 46 people have died in England since Sunday - aged between 47 and 105 and all with underlying health conditions - while there were four deaths in Scotland and four in Wales. There have been 83,945 tests to date, with 6,650 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Britons travelling abroad should return to the UK as soon as possible because international travel is becoming more difficult with the closure of borders and the suspension of flights. And people inthe most at-risk groups,externalhave begun receiving an NHS text urging them to stay at home for 12 weeks. Clapham Common in London was one of the UK's many busy parks at the weekend Later on Monday night, following Mr Johnson's address,emergency legislationintroducing measures to respond to the outbreak cleared the House of Commons and will now go to the Lords for further debate. Under the legislation, airports could shut and police would be able to force people with virus symptoms to isolate. The powers, which would have to be renewed every six months, are expected to be approved by MPs. Elsewhere, the British Olympic Association said Great Britain will not send a team to Tokyo 2020 if the spread of coronavirus continues as predicted. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has given itself four weeks to decide on the future of the Games, butIOC member Dick Pound saidit has already been decided that the tournament will be postponed until 2021.

UK wakes to strict new anti-virus measures,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You must stay at home"" Boris Johnson has outlined strict new measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus, including a ban on public gatherings of more than two people. He said people should only leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work ""where this is absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and fulfil any medical or care needs. He also ordered the immediate closure of shops selling non-essential goods. But police said they had received lots of calls asking what was still allowed. In the UK, 340 people have died with the virus. On Monday evening,27 million TV viewers watched Mr Johnsontell the country it was facing a ""moment of national emergency"" and that staying at home was necessary to protect the NHS, save lives and tackle ""the biggest threat this country has faced for decades"". Police and local authorities will have powers to disperse gatherings, including through fines. The restrictions would be under constant review and a relaxation of the rules would be considered in three weeks, he said. ""To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well,"" the prime minister said. For the first time,all the UK's mobile networks are sending out a government messageon Tuesday morning to their customers with details of the new measures. Johnson's coronavirus address in full LIVE:Latest updates A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW GUIDANCE:What must I do? NEW RESTRICTIONS:What are they? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The new measures come after a sunny weekend during which crowds of people were seen at beaches, parks, markets and other public spaces. The new guidance,externalsays people should only leave their homes for: Shopping for basic necessities such as food and medicine. Shopping trips should be as infrequent as possible One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk or cycle. This should be done alone or only with people you live with Any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. This includes moving children under the age of 18 between their parents' homes, where applicable. Key workers or those with children identified as vulnerable can continue to take their children to school Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home Even when following the above guidance, people should minimise the amount of time spent out of their homes and should keep two metres (6ft) away from people they do not live with. The parents of thousands of children are keeping them out of school to try to reduce the spread of the virus. Downing Street said school attendance in England was about 10% on Monday. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said employers should take ""every possible step"" to allow for remote working, but added: ""I want to be absolutely clear, when people absolutely can not work from home they can still go to work - indeed it's important that they do to keep the country running."" The government is also stopping all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies - but funerals attended by immediate family members are allowed. Downing Street said the use of fines, starting at Â£30, would be targeted at dispersing gatherings, and failure to pay could lead to criminal proceedings and a summary conviction. These measures represent some of the most far-reaching curbs on personal freedom ever introduced in the UK in peacetime. But it is unclear how the rules can be made to work. The first hurdle is to get them on to the statute book; although the prime minister said the restrictions on travel and gatherings would come into effect immediately, police don't have the powers to enforce them yet, nor have they had official guidance. The second issue - assuming legal regulations are approved later this week - is the practical difficulty of getting groups to disperse and accurately identifying people who should not be on the streets, without losing public goodwill and sparking disorder. When efforts to persuade those who do not comply have failed, officers will be able to issue fines, with prosecutions likely to be a last resort. But at a time when officer numbers are increasingly depleted through illness and self-isolation, forces will be hoping communities do the right thing without the need for intervention. This video can not be played After Boris Johnson brings in new measures, the BBC explains why staying in is a matter of life and death Businesses that will not need to close,externalinclude supermarkets, petrol stations, post offices, launderettes, bike shops, pet shops, hardware stores and banks. Mr Gove said all major construction work should go ahead but jobs carried out at close quarters in someone's home would not be appropriate. As critics, including London Mayor Sadiq Khan, questioned his approach, Crossrail and housebuilder Taylor Wimpey suspended work. However, competitor Redrow said its sites remained open with ""strict precautions"" in place. The mayor has also warned London Underground commuters that if they do not stop packing into trains, more people will die. Mayor: 'Stop Tube travel or more will die' UK construction workers fear for their safety Why is it taking so long to help the self-employed? Premises such as libraries, non-essential shops, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship have been ordered to close. Hotels, hostels, campsites and caravan parks must also close unless key workers need to stay there, or if others staying there cannot get back home. Parks will remain open for exercise but people are not allowed to gather in groups. Golf courses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will shut - and in Scotland, golfers have been asked not to play. Community centres can stay open but only for the purpose of ""hosting essential voluntary or public services"" such as food banks or service for homeless people, the guidance says. Barristers have been told not to attend Crown Court unless they are involved in one of the 34 ongoing trials in England and Wales. On Monday night, the government changed its travel guidance, advisingall British people travelling abroad to return to the UK now.,external Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said this was ""because of the rate of new border restrictions"" and those needing urgent assistance should call the local UK embassy or high commissioner. Soldiers deliver protective equipment to doctors and nurses working at St Thomas' Hospital in London Prisoners in England and Wales will be confined to their cells for 23 hours a day and allowed out only to shower and use pay-phones, with all visits cancelled, the BBC understands. More than 83,000 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus with 6,710 testing positive. However, the true number of cases will be far higher as tests are primarily done on hospital patients with symptoms of the virus. It seems hard to overstate how huge an impact this will have on the country, and what a massive decision this is for the government to have taken - whose effect will last at least for a period of three weeks at the shortest, potentially for very much longer. Remember this though is not quite the kind of total crackdown we have seen in other countries - at least not yet. Not surprisingly, there is already therefore enormous controversy about whether the UK has been acting fast enough. Read more from Laura But there were calls for more information about the guidance. Lincolnshire Police warned of an ""extremely high volume"" of calls and Humberside Chief Constable Lee Freeman said his force had received ""a number of calls"" on the subject, which he said he was unable to answer. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said enforcing the new restrictions would be ""a real, real challenge"", as there was already ""large amounts of sickness"" among officers across London. Later, the National Police Chiefs' Council said officers would not be deployed on patrol specifically to police social distancing rules but would still patrol their communities ""as always"". Home Secretary Priti Patel saidin a tweet,externalthat the next few weeks would be ""testing"" for police but she would make sure officers had ""the resources they need to keep themselves and the public safe"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the measures were ""the right response"" but called for more guidance on workplace closures. Unite union boss Len McCluskey said millions of workers were confused about whether they should be at work, while millions of self-employed and insecure workers were dreading being sent home because it would mean no wages. Asked in the Commons about help for the UK's five million self-employed workers, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was ""determined to find a way"" to support them, and was looking at the matter in ""immense detail and at pace"". The prime minister said he knew the ""damage"" the restrictions were causing to people's lives, businesses and jobs - and said ""many lives will sadly be lost"" despite the measures. But he added there was ""a clear way through"", by strengthening the NHS with former clinicians returning to work, accelerating the search for treatments and a vaccine and buying millions of testing kits.

We're going to keep bringing you all the latest updates from around the world but as the new day starts in the UK our London colleagues will join us and we'll be posting the lateston this page here. Please do follow us there. As a goodbye from us here's a reminder of where to find the most accurate and up-to-date information on how to protect yourself and your loved ones in these uncertain times.  As uncertainty over the future of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics continues Japanese media are now reporting that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will hold a phone call with Thomas Bach, head of the International Olympic Committee, at 8pm local time, 11GMT. There's been mounting criticism over the IOC and Japan's insistence the Games will go ahead. Many athletes and a number of national Olympic committees say it's impossible to train for the event and that it's extremely unlikely that the global pandemic will be under control by 24 July, the scheduled kick-off date for the Games. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and US Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin say they have not yet reached a deal on a  $2 trillion (Â£1.7tn) coronavirus economic stimulus package, but progress has been made. Mr Schumer said a vote on the deal in the US Senate could take place as early as Tuesday. Democrats in the Republican-controlled chamber have complained that the package does not contain enough funding for states and hospitals. They also want more restrictions on a fund to help large businesses. On the first day of a country-wide lockdown in India, hundreds were held for violating the curfew - and the police dealt out some fairly unusual forms of punishment in some states. Local media reports showed videos of police in Punjab and Maharashtra punishingmen who broke the curfew by forcing them to do push-ups,external. In Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh,police also took to shaming people on social media,external- they posted photos of the alleged violators, saying âthey were against society as they will not stay at homeâ, reported the Hindustan Times. Elsewhere,officials seized vehicles,externalafter questioning people where they were going to determine if it was essential for them to be outside their home. States have also been asked to take legal action if necessary as many have imposed a colonial-era law that prohibits four or more people gathering. Checks and fines are expected to increase on Tuesday as more cities and states go into lockdown to fight the spread of Covid-19 - India has reported 446 active cases, and nine deaths so far.  We have important panda news to lighten your mood. After 58 days of keeping visitors away, the Beijing Zoo reopened on Monday. According to state media, the animals have been faring well during the virus lockdown, some of them seem to have enjoyed the quiet. ""Some of the animals, such as the pandas, preferred to have more exercise when the zoo was empty,"" the China Daily cites zoo director Zhang Chenglin. He also says the area is still being disinfected on a regular basis. For those who can't come down in person to see the animals, the zoo also has online tours where you can watch the animals being fed - or the enclosures being disinfected. The Association of Asian Pacific Airlines (AAPA) has said its members need state support immediately as they face upwards of a $60bn revenue shortfall due to the coronavirus pandemic. âThe magnitude is beyond
belief. Itâs unimaginable,â APAA Director General Andrew Herdman told the BBC. The trade group's member airlines include Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific among others. He added that although carriers were cutting costs by slashing schedules, which saves on expenses like fuel, they continue to shoulder major overheads: ""Weâre still left with fixed costs including staff. The tough thing is that for a lot of staff, thereâs no work for them to do.â The AAPA is calling for government action in the form of deferred tax payments and extensions of interest-free loans to improve cash flow. âThe big focus is protecting the workforce. The airlines will need them once again once thereâs a recovery. But when that will be, nobody knows,â Mr Herman concluded. The gambling hub of Macau will ban all visitors from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan who have travelled overseas in the past 14 days, said a Reuters report quoting its leader Ho Iat Seng. It comes a week after it banned all foreign visitors from entering the region. There are 25 confirmed cases of the virus in Macau - a once bustling casino hub which has now fallen silent amid virus fears. Macau's once bustling casinos are now silent Crime gangs in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro are reported to have ordered curfews to combat coronavirus, saying they are taking action because the government refuses to. Residents of several favelas (shanty towns) say they have received social media messages ordering people off the streets overnight. ""We want the best for the population. If the government doesn't have the capacity to do something [about coronavirus], then organised crime will sort it out,"" said one message reported by the G1 news website. President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticised for his lacklustre response to the outbreak, prompting protests in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio. Simon AtkinsonBBC News, Sydney For the past couple of hours Iâve been talking to Brits stuck in Australia and New Zealand. Several of them are health workers desperate to get back home to help out. For others, they have older relatives who they want to be near. And then there are the young travellers on working holiday visas who are losing their casual jobs and worry about being stuck far from home with no money and no support. For many whoâd already booked to get back, flights booked with airlines such as Emirates and Etihad are no longer flying. Planes going straight to the UK are few and far between and, of course, sold out. The general feeling is helplessness. Being passed around by airlines and travel agents while struggling to get information from the British government. Everyone understands this is a global crisis. Nobody expects an easy answer. But the frustration seems to stem from being told get home as soon as possible â but finding it very hard to work out how to do that. Iâm told the British High Commission here in Australia will have some information soon. Weâll share that as soon as we get it. Busy morning here in Singapore - where most of us are writing this live page from home - catching up on some major developments overnight. TheUKhas told people to stay home, and we're checking in with our colleagues in London on how they and their families might be affected. TheUSreported more than 100 deaths in a single day and theWHOhas warned that the pandemic is ""accelerating"". Here are some updates from closer to home: The 23 de Enero neighbourhood in Caracas has limited water supplies There are major concerns over how Venezuela could deal with a coronavirus outbreak, as the South American country has long been in economic crisis, with regular food and medicine shortages. The lockdown began on 17 March. All borders are shut and there are no flights in or out. People are only permitted to leave their house to buy food or medicines or attend medical appointments. They must wear a mask and, from Sunday, they also need to wear gloves. William Bello, a concierge in his 50s from Caracas, told the BBCâs Guillermo Olmo about his concerns. Mr Bello lives in the 23 de Enero neighbourhood, which is working class and largely pro-government. âPeople are very worried about the disease, so they are respecting the quarantine, but many street traders need to go out and sell stuff if they want something to eat. Police are everywhere and are ordering people to go home when they catch them.â He typically gets running water only twice a week. This needs to be stored in containers and boiled before drinking. âWith the water that we have, weâre trying to follow the recommendations and wash our hands frequently."" Amazon is teaming up with researchers funded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to pick up and deliver coronavirus test kits. The Gates Foundation-backed Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) is learning how the infection spreads. It involves collecting nasal swabs to track the virus among residents of Seattle's King County in Washington. Amazon Care, the retail giant's employee medical care arm, is now helping with deliveries of the kits. King County is one of the places hardest hit by the outbreak in the US. Read more here Online retail giant Amazon and Microsoft's Bill Gates are working together to track the outbreak's spread. Frances MaoSydney As we mentioned earlier, one woman has died and over 50 cases have now been traced back to the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which docked in Sydney last Thursday. Around 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark then, despite authorities knowing that some on board were feeling unwell. However this wasn't relayed to passengers, and by the time the first cases were revealed on Friday, some of those on board were half-way around the round. Just how did Australian authorities get it so wrong in this instance?Read my full report into the debacle. I spoke to one passenger, Elisa McCafferty, who has returned home to London with her husband but fears they both have the virus now. ""They shouldn't have let us disembark,"" she told me this morning. Passengers Elisa McCafferty and her husband are furious over the mishandling of the ship's return to Sydney With domestic transmissions very low, China is focussing on people from overseas bringing the virus into the country. The city of Beijing has now tightened its rules on international arrivals even further, state media report. Anyone entering the city from abroad will go into mandatory centralised quarantine for 14 days and will have to be tested for the coronavirus. The report in the China Daily cited by Reuters also says that whoever enters the city from the rest of China and has travelled from overseas in the past two weeks will also have to be tested and quarantined. China is where the global pandemic started and nearly 3,300 people have died from it there. Asian stocks have jumped after the US central bank rolled out a new plan to ease the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In its latest emergency measure, the Federal Reserve said it would buy unlimited amounts of assets to steady markets. However, a US government bailout bill worth almost $2 trillion being debated in Congress has failed to advance for a second time, as Democrats said proposed financial relief for industries such as airlines would not do enough to help workers. In morning tradingJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was the 6.5% higher, the Hang Seng inHong Konggained 4%, andChina's Shanghai Composite was up by 1.7%. The US Embassy in Peru says it is working to bring its citizens home, after the South American country enforced a nationwide lockdown stranding thousands of people. No flights are allowed to enter or leave the country without government permission. The Charge d'Affaires Denison Offutt said the embassy was ""actively coordinating with Peru on official repatriation flights for US citizens"". Mr Offutt says there are 5,000 US citizens currently in Peru - though he doesn't say how many are tourists or residents. The comments section of the video however, are filled with comments by people claiming to be stranded US citizens in Peru. ""We are 12 family members stranded,"" says one comment. ""I'm still waiting in Magdalena Del Mar - please help us,"" another says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A female  passenger in her 70s who caught the virus on a cruise ship which docked in Sydney last Thursday has died in hospital this morning, health officials say. She was one of the first three cases confirmed on the ship last Friday, and had been taken to hospital immediately after disembarking. About 2,700 passengers were allowed off the ship last week, with many flying overseas, not knowing there were confirmed virus cases on board. This has sparked huge public criticism. We know that many people are contracting the coronavirus around the world, but establishing a death rate is no simple task. The World Health Organization says about 3.4% of all cases have resulted in deaths, but scientists estimate that the death rate is actually much lower because many cases have mild symptoms and are not reported. The rate of fatalities also depends on a range of factors including age, sex, pre-existing conditions and the health system you are in. From the evidence available, we know that some groups of people are more likely to die if they contract the virus - the elderly, the unwell and, maybe, men. Find out more about the difficulty in calculating death rates and the groups most at risk. Cuba has now closed its doors to all tourists, and those that are already in the country will have to go into quarantine. There were on Monday around 32,500 overseas tourists in Cuba - of which 9,400 were staying in homestays. The government says they will be moved to state-run hotels to complete their quarantine, according to Reuters, They won't be let out of quarantine until they find a flight home - though many flights have already been cancelled. - so its likely many will find themselves stranded. Cubans themselves also cannot leave the island without authorisation. There are currently 40 confirmed cases in Cuba.  Holidaymakers scrambled to get out of Cuba Â© 2025 BBC.

New York has become the
epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in the US. Governor Andrew Cuomo on
Tuesday pleaded for medical supplies, warning the virus was spreading in his
state faster than ""a bullet train"". New York now has over
25,000 confirmed cases and over 200 deaths, with the number of new cases
doubling every three days. ""The apex is higher
than we thought and the apex is sooner than we thought,"" Mr Cuomo told
reporters. The governor's warning
comes as President Trump suggested having the US open for business by early
next month while criticising Mr Cuomo for not having ordered more supplies years
before. Read the full story:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52012048 The Tokyo Olympics 2020 is the latest - and largest - sporting event to be postponed. The coronavirus crisis has decimated this year's sporting calendar. Here is just a snapshot of the major international events which have been affected:  For a full timeline of all sporting events affected gohere. Michelle FleuryNorth America Business Correspondent The Dow Jones index rallied more than 11% (or over 2000 points) for its
best day on the US stock market since 1933. Investors are hopeful that Congress will pass a $2 trillion (Â£1.7 trillion) stimulus package to help businesses and households weather the
economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The S&P 500 also rallied more than 9%,
its biggest gain since October 2008. Shares of companies likely to get help
from the government saw some of the biggest gains, including Chevron, American
Express and Boeing whose stock prices all jumped more than 20%.  Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has said it was âextremely
likelyâ that she fell ill with coronavirus but has now recovered. The 17-year-old said she felt âtired, had shivers, a sore
throat and coughedâ after returning from a trip in Europe, so self-isolated for
two weeks. âEveryone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate
themselves. I have therefore not been tested for Covid-19, but itâs extremely
likely that Iâve had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances,""
she wrote on Instagram. She warned
people to stay at home because âour actions can be the difference between life
and deathâ for others. Maris Hellrand, Estonia Saaremaa relies heavily on the tourist industry which has now come to a halt The largest island in Estonia is at the heart of the Baltic stateâs coronavirus outbreak, with 114 of the countryâs 369 cases. The outbreak in Saaremaa is thought to have begun when an Italian volleyball team from Milan played a local club at the beginning of March. The island, which has a population of 33,000, has spent the past 10 days sealed off from the rest of Estonia. âWeâve been living under in a constant state of emergency for the last two weeks and are aware of an imminent danger of an explosion (of cases). The situation could get much more dramatic,â Mayor Madis Kallas told the BBC. The hospital on Saaremaa was the first in Estonia to set up a drive-in testing facility, but it has been struggling with a lack of supplies of protective gear. Patients in a serious condition have been sent to hospitals on the mainland. Nick BryantBBC New York Correspondent Trump, in common with all populists and demagogues, favours simple solutions to complex problems. However, the coronavirus outbreak has required the kind of multi-pronged approach and long-term thinking that seems beyond him. This has always been a presidency of the here and now. It is not well equipped to deal with a public health and economic emergency that will dominate the rest of his presidency, whether he only gets to spend the next 10 months in the White House or another five years. Read more from Nick here. Chris Bockman, Toulouse Tuesday could be the last day of trading for stall holders at this market in Toulouse The Crystal market in the centre of Toulouse is one of the biggest daily outdoor markets in south-west France. When Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced the closure of outdoor food markets with almost immediate effect late on Monday, stall owners feared the worst. Although they were given a reprieve on Tuesday morning, they know this could have been their last day. Mayor Jean-Luc Moudenc has appealed for the markets to stay open, warning that closure could create food shortages and hit the most vulnerable. Toulouse is home to one of the biggest British communities in France.  Many work in the aerospace industry - European plane maker Airbus is based here. For the past eight days PR consultant Trudi Harris and her family have been confined to their home. She says the highlight of her life now is the walk to the corner shop every three days. Aerospace engineer Richard Tookey says working from home has made him into something of a battery hen - working, eating and sleeping. The death toll in France from the coronavirus has jumped by 240 in the last 24 hours to reach 1,100. That's its biggest daily rise yet. There were 2,444 new confirmed cases in the same period,
bringing the total number in the country to at least 22,300, Franceâs health
ministry said. The death toll is likely to be higher, as those confirmed so
far have only been people who died in hospital,French media reports say,external. Like most other European countries, France has implemented Draconian restrictions on life to prevent the virus from spreading. The country was put into lockdown on 17 March, requiring
people to stay indoors stay except for essential trips for an initial 15-day
period. But on Tuesday, Franceâs scientific council advised the
government to extend the lockdown, saying it should last at least six weeks to suppress
the virus more effectively. Health minister Olivier VÃ©ran said the lockdown
will âlast as long as it needs toâ. France has been in lockdown since 17 March Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has donated 1m euros (Â£920,000) to help fight the coronavirus outbreak in Spain. Almost 2,700 people have now died in the country and close to 40,000 are infected. Italy is the only European country to see more cases. Guardiola, who is from Catalonia and currently at home in Barcelona, has been working with his lawyers over the past few days to decide the best way of using the money. Read morehere. Former Spain international Guardiola is an icon at Barcelona after his successes as a player and a manager Naomi Grimley, BBC News Until now, limited testing has meant that experts donât have a
hold on whoâs really had the virus and who has not. Many of us in the UK will know
someone who has been told they probably had it but they werenât allowed a
laboratory test to confirm it. Thatâs where a finger-prick antibody test to
check for immunity would make a big difference. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would be a ""game changer"". In the words of the Chief Medical Officer â Professor Chris
Whitty â it means âwe'll be able to say to somebody, you've had this virus,
youâre not likely to get it again at least in the immediate term, and now we
can be confident you can return to work and you donât
need to be taking some of the precautions youâve been taking to date."" This would be especially useful for healthcare workers whoâve
already had the virus but perhaps displayed few or no symptoms. It would
mean they wouldnât need to spend several days in self-isolation just because a
fellow family member is now sick. The news from Health Secretary Matt Hancock that the UK has now purchased 3.5 million of these
tests is especially welcome as the death toll grows. This week Spain also took
delivery of 640,000 test kits, thought to be of a similar kind, from China and
South Korea. They will be used on healthcare professionals first. Big questions still remain: not least, how reliable are these
new tests? And for how long does immunity to Covid-19 last? Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world that we have been covering over the past few hours: A US man has died and his wife is in critical condition after taking a form of a drug that has been touted by President Donald Trump as a possible treatment for the novel coronavirus. The couple took chloroquine phosphate - a form of chloroquine used to clean fish tanks - in an apparent effort to guard against Covid-19. Chloroquine itself is one of the oldest and best-known anti-malarial drugs, but the US Food and Drugs Administrationhas made it clear it has not been approved for treating those infected with the Covid-19 coronavirus. The
couple - both  in their 60s - fell ill within 30 minutes of taking the substance, said Arizona-based hospital system Banner Health. Read our full story on this casehere. Nigeria also reported cases of chloroquine poisoning that had officials there issuing their own warning: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Publicist Matt Polk said McNally was a lung cancer survivor who had been living with a chronic inflammatory lung disease. McNally is survived by his husband Tom Kirdahy.

The most common signs of Covid-19 are a fever and a dry cough, which can lead to breathing difficulties. For most people the symptoms will be mild but the coronavirus can be serious for some, including the elderly or people with certain pre-existing conditions. Some of the early symptoms can easily be confused with other winter bugs including colds and flu. But for now the UK government is advising anyone with a high temperature or a new, continuous cough sto self-isolate at home for at least seven days just in case. Under current guidance, most people may not need to get tested. If you are in the UK and worried about having the symptoms, use the NHS 111 advice servicehere,external.

Even though the decisionto postpone the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Gameslooked inevitable, today's announcement has come as a relief for the many athletes who have not been able to train properly because of the restrictions. âWe felt under pressure to train and compete,"" British swimmerAdam Peaty,who won gold at Rio 2016 in the 100m breaststroke, told BBC Sport. âThe decision from the IOC lifts that relief that we donât have to be in shape over summer and we donât have to put unnecessary risk on others.â HeptathleteKatarina Johnson-Thompson,the current world champion who was among the favourites for gold, described the postponement as ""heartbreaking"". But she also joked: ""Waited eight years for this, whatâs another one in the grand scheme of things?"" British golferJustin Rose,who described his gold-medal win four years ago as the ""biggest gift"" of his career, says he would be making the Olympics his ""priority"" in a rejigged 2021 schedule. Paralympic cycling and athletics championKadeena Coxalso backed the decision, saying the Games and its legacy can be enjoyed ""when the time is right"". Read more reaction from leading athletes on BBC Sport. British swimmer Adam Peaty won Great Britain's first medal at Rio 2016 with a world record in the men's 100m breaststroke Tom FordyceBBC chief sports writer There is a moment at an Olympic Games, some point after the opening ceremony and around the time where everything around you is drama and smashed records and new heroes, when you look around and think: there is no other square mile or so of the planet that has as many people staring at it as this. That's what the summer Games do. They make you feel like you're at the centre of the world. And it's why it took the International Olympic Committee so long to realise that Tokyo 2020 had to be postponed, and why there could be no other decision. The IOC has the history, the power and the self-regard to pull off something as complicated, expensive and vainglorious as an Olympics. Those same characteristics can also leave it out of touch with wider forces at play around it. It is used to nations wooing it and coming in supplication, not the other way round.

Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent Long queues of people stocking up on essentials formed outside markets and supermarkets in Gurgaon, a suburb of Delhi, minutes after Narendra Modiâs announcement this evening. Two people were being allowed in at a time into a leading supermarket and only five people in total were allowed to shop inside. The utter confusion and lack of information over how the government plans to keep essential supplies going has led to confusion and panic, reminiscent of what happenedafter Mr Modiâs currency banin 2016.

The workers braving coronavirus in shops and pharmacies,"Mehfuz says his company is taking ""precautions and trying to serve our customers"" ""It's been non-stop for the past few weeks. No matter how hard we try, the shelves aren't full."" There are many people around the country who have been following the government'sadvice around social distancing- that's avoiding going out for non-essential reasons due to the coronavirus pandemic. For quite a few of us, that means having to work from home. But that's not an option everyone can take. Supermarket worker Tiff has no choice but to go to work, despite the infection risks. ""In an ideal world, supermarkets would close too, but I know that's not possible right now,"" the 26-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. You've probably seen people flooding to supermarkets, trying to get as many items as they can -panic buying things like handwash and antibacterial gel. Tiff's in charge of the health and beauty section in her supermarket, which includes those items. And she says the rush of panic buying because of coronavirus has been ""horrible and overwhelming"". ""People have been yelling at me, asking why it's not there when we run out."" With cases of Covid-19 rising around the country, you might imagine that lots of frontline workers wouldn't want to work anymore. But not Mehfuz Dasu Patel. The 28-year-old helps run a group of community pharmacies in north west England, which serve 250 care homes and deliver medicines to around 20,000 patients. And those patients are the reason he's still going to work. If Mehfuz decides to stop working, ""vulnerable people will go without medicines"", he says. ""It's difficult but people in the NHS have it tougher,"" Jade says ""It's not the sort of business that can just disappear or you can work from home. We have to keep delivering to them, despite what's happening in the world."" And despite her experiences in the supermarket, Tiff agrees with Mehfuz that it's important for those on the frontline to keep working at a time of crisis. ""People need supplies - they're looking for hygiene products and food - so we have to do what we can. If we don't, it'll just be more anger and panic,"" she says. Tiff admits feeling ""anxious and afraid"" because of the uncertainty around the virus and possible impact on her health. She suffered with a bad cough a few years ago, which she worries has damaged her lungs. People withunderlying health problemsare at greater risk of developing severe symptoms. ""I'm always thinking about it and a bit worried,"" she says. And Tiff's not the only one to have those concerns. Jade Barnett, 19, has two jobs - in a warehouse and a supermarket - and she's worried she could catch the coronavirus at work and take it home to her family. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash ""It's not as much about me. I just don't want to catch anything and then pass it onto my nan or nephew,"" she says. She wears gloves at work and is ""quite cautious"". But with lots of people whose jobs are at risk, Jade says she's grateful she's still able to work, despite the potential health risk. ""There are lots of people out there who have lost their jobs, or aren't able to earn any money. How are people meant to survive without money and a job?"" Like Tiff and Mehfuz, she acknowledges that she has a vital ""role to play"" in helping the country fight coronavirus. Jade feels it's something that now comes with ""extra pressure"". When she's packing deliveries in the warehouse, she's aware that not having all the items someone needs can make things difficult for customers. ""It means they won't get a good shop and it might be someone who can't physically come to the shops,"" she says. ""So you do think about things like that and feel more responsibility."" When working in the supermarket, she says it can be hard when dealing with elderly people because of limits on buying certain items. ""They often get lots of things and you have to tell them they can't take that much. You feel bad because you never know how much someone needs."" 'People need our help', says Mehfuz Mehfuz says the current crisis is ""the toughest time"" he's ever experienced. ""Everyone at work understands the pressure is on us to deliver for the vulnerable,"" he says, adding that customers have called up worried his service may be shut down. ""They tell us that the country needs you to continue working. That motivates me and the others a lot."" It's an exhausting time for both Jade and Tiff, and they can't wait for the crisis to be over. ""It can be a lot of night shifts, sometimes 16-hour shifts. It feels like 24/7,"" Jade says. ""Hopefully all of this calms down soon. Because you do have some really rough days and it's not nice."" ""We'll keep working, but even if it's just for a few weeks, we need a break,"" Tiff adds. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.
