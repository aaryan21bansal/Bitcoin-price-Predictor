Search for kidnapped UK tourists in DR Congo,"The Virunga National Park director said the tourist's vehicle was ambushed by gunmen A search is continuing for two British tourists who were kidnapped in a national park in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). DRC army spokesman Major Guillaume Kaiko Ndjike told Reuters that soldiers had joined rangers in the search operation at the Virunga National Park. The park's director said the tourists' vehicle was ambushed by gunmen, who killed a ranger and seized the driver. The Foreign Office said it was supporting the families. It also said it was in close contact with the DRC authorities. Local media reports say the ranger shot dead was a female guard, while the UK citizens - who have not been named - were taken along with their Congolese driver. Park director Emmanuel de Merode told the AFP news agency: ""I confirm that our vehicle was attacked. Three people were kidnapped, including two tourists."" The incident took place just north of the city of Goma, North Kivu province. The BBC's Louise Dewast, reporting from the country's capital Kinshasa, said the situation was ""very serious"". She said there were armed groups operating in the park and there had been kidnappings before, with half of these involving a ransom. The national park, which runs along the border with Uganda and Rwanda, covers 3,000 sq miles (7,800 sq km). It is a Unesco world heritage site and is home to critically-endangered mountain gorillas as well as lions, elephants and hippos. In April, Mr de Merode,told the BBC World Servicethat recent attacks were part of ""a bigger picture which involves the trafficking of natural resources"". He said the park was protected by around 800 rangers but there were also estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 militia in and around the park. There have been a number of killings and kidnappings in recent years. Five rangers and a driver were killed in the park on 9 April. A week earlier, a park ranger died in an attack by armed men as he guarded the construction site of a hydroelectric plant. The national park is known for its mountain gorillas BBC Africa editor Will Ross said poachers were active in the park, which was also under threat due to the illegal felling of trees to make charcoal and plans for oil exploration. Wildlife authorities have tried to protect it but 170 rangers have been killed over the last 20 years, he added. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against all but essential travel to Goma and has urged Britons not to go beyond the city. Theadvice, which was last updated three days ago,,externalsays tourists are vulnerable if travelling without escorted transport in the eastern part of the country, and the ""risk of kidnap or injury as a result of armed or criminal activity remains high"". It said that UK government staff were not always in the area and the British embassy's ability to offer consular assistance could be ""severely limited"".

Pakistan blocks US diplomat's exit,"CCTV footage captured a car jumping the red light and hitting a motorbike Pakistan has prevented a US diplomat from leaving the country after he allegedly killed a motorcyclist by driving through a red light last month. Local press said on Saturday that a plane was sent by the US to collect Col Joseph Emanuel Hall, a military attache, but was denied clearance. US officials have previously said he cannot be arrested or tried because he has diplomatic immunity. The incident has increased political tension between the countries. Ateeq Baig, 22, was killed in the crash in Daman-e-Koh, north of Islamabad, on 7 April. CCTV footage showed a white four-wheel-drive - said to be driven by Col Hall - ignoring the red traffic light at an intersection, crashing with a bike at speed and then braking. The US embassy has denied reports in Pakistan's media that Col Hall was drunk while driving. The dead man's father has called for the colonel to stand trial at Islamabad High Court (IHC). Why Pakistan won't share intelligence with the US US cuts Pakistan aid over terror groups On Friday, the IHC had ruled Col Hall does not have absolute immunity. He had already been put on a travel ""black list"", which meant airports had been told not allow him to leave. Neither the US or Pakistan has officially commented on Saturday's news. Relations between Washington and Islamabad have been in the spotlight sinceUS President Donald Trump's New Year's Day tweet, where he accused Pakistan of ""lies and deceit"". Allow Twitter content?

Protesters demand 'new deal' for workers,"Thousands of people have joined a trade union march calling for a ""new deal"" for workers and public services. The central-London demonstration, led by the Trades Union Congress, highlighted demands for better pay and job security. TUC research said the UK's real wage squeeze,externalwould be the worst in modern history and the slowest for 200 years. The government said its policies had boosted pay for the lowest earners and meant workers could keep more of it. Demonstrators gathering at Saturday's march called for a higher minimum wage of Â£10 an hour, a ban on zero-hours contracts and greater funding for the NHS, education and other public services. At a rally in Hyde Park at the end of the march, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the crowd that his party would create a ministry to guarantee worker's rights. ""We will give workers more power by strengthening their rights and freedoms to organise together to improve their lives,"" he said. He blamed eight years of government cuts for the lack of wage growth. ""They protect the tax havens and cut the spending for public services,"" Mr Corbyn said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed the crowd in Hyde Park Lisa Hampele, BBC News Thousands upon thousands of people marched through London's streets, some dancing, playing drums, shouting slogans and carrying banners aloft. Nurses, teachers, office workers, ambulance crews, civil servants and cleaners joined the noisy and colourful demonstration. As they arrived for the rally in Hyde Park the rain began and it became more like a festival in a soggy field. There were food stalls, bands playing and speeches from union leaders and peace campaigners. The star of the show, Jeremy Corbyn - wearing a cream jacket and a big smile - was cheered like a pop star. The applause was long and loud. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS union, told the crowd that 150,000 civil servants could ballot for strike action after members were offered a below-inflation 1% pay rise for the 11th year running. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""There is a new mood in the country. People have been very patient but they are now demanding a new deal."" Meanwhile, research published by TUC suggested wages in the UK had lagged behind inflation since 2008, and were worth Â£24 less in real terms than in 2008. McDonald's workers marched to highlight their cause The TUC also said wages would not recover until 2025, by which time, it said, the average worker would have lost Â£18,500. The TUC's deputy general secretary Paul Nowack told the BBC that 17 years of falling wages in real terms amounted to the biggest relative wage loss since the Napoleonic Wars. In the last eight years, a million more children from working families were living ""below the breadline"", he said. ""I don't think it's right that people who go out and work are struggling to put food on the table."" Elsewhere, economists said the slow wage growth was a result of low productivity in the UK, rather than austerity policies. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC: ""That means that the amount we produce for each hour we work is basically the same as it was in 2008. If we're not producing any more, we're not in the end going to be able to earn any more."" Tens of thousands of workers joined the TUC demonstration, making it the largest in years A Treasury spokesperson said wages were forecast to grow faster than inflation in each of the next five years, and that government policies were helping British workers. ""Our National Living Wage has boosted pay for the lowest earners by over Â£2,000 already; we are cutting taxes to help people keep more of what they earn; and we are making sure people have the skills they need to secure high-quality, well-paid jobs by investing in technical education and boosting apprenticeships."" The TUC said its figures were based on annual average weekly earnings for total pay (including bonuses) adjusted with the CPI measure of inflation, which were then compared with long-run back data published by the Bank of England. The forward-looking ones were based on the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast to 2022, and then a projection to 2025 using the average forecast growth rate for the 2018-22 period.

"Breaking|Breaking newsSerial killer Dennis Nilsen dies in prisonSerial killer Dennis Nilsen, who claimed to have killed 16 people in the 1970s and 1980s, has died in prison7m7 minutes agoUK","Dennis Nilsen, on the right hand side, lured his victims to his flat before killing them, often by strangulation Serial killer Dennis Nilsen, who admitted killing at least 15 people in the 1970s and 1980s, has died in prison. The 72-year-old was jailed for life in 1983, with a recommendation he serve at least 25 years. The former civil servant murdered and dismembered several of his victims, most of them homeless young gay men, at his home in Muswell Hill, north London. He was convicted of six counts of murder and two of attempted murder. The Prison Service said Nilsen, who was born in Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire, died at HMP Full Sutton near York. The death of Nilsen will be investigated by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, as is normal for custody deaths, a spokesman added. Nilsen was 37 when he was arrested, after human remains were found in a blocked drain at his home. He and other tenants in his block of flats had complained to the landlord about the smell from the drains. An inspection by a plumber found pipes packed with human flesh. During his trial at the Old Bailey, the court heard the remains of three bodies were found at his home and bones from at least eight bodies were found at his previous address in Melrose Avenue, Cricklewood in north-west London. The death of Nilsen - wearing glasses - will be investigated as is normal for custody deaths He met his victims, all of them men, in a pub and he would take them back to his flat for a drink. Most were homeless, some were homosexuals and some were prostitutes. His trial heard how Nilsen strangled many of his victims with a tie and then disposed of the bodies, either through hiding them under the floorboards or by cutting up the body and flushing parts down the toilet. On many occasions, he would sit with their bodies for days before he dismembered them. Nilsen admitted killing at least 15 people, but he was convicted of the murders of six men: Kenneth James Ockenden Martyn Brandon Duffey William David Sutherland Malcolm Barlow John Peter Howlett Stephen Neil Sinclair There were others who survived. Mr Nilsen spent 11 years in the Army, with some time spent in the catering corps where he learned certain butchery skills. He later served briefly as a probationary police constable before becoming a security officer with the Manpower Services Commission in 1974.

Shed hits 100mph to break speed record,"The Fastest Shed has lived up to its name and beat its own record time, reaching 101mph A souped-up motorised shed has broken its own land speed record on a Welsh beach as it hit 100mph. The Fastest Shed smashed its previous 80mph (129km/h) record for the fastest shed at a land speed event at Pendine Sands in Carmarthenshire on Saturday. Owner Kevin Nicks said it was ""marvellous"" to hit 101mph (160 km/h) in what he said was the only road legal motorised shed in the world. ""It couldn't have gone better, I'm so happy,"" said the 53-year-old gardener. Mr Nicks, from Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, spent more than Â£13,000 creating his bespoke shed on wheels, which now boasts a turbo-charged 400 brake horsepower engine that is more powerful than many sports cars. This video can not be played The souped-up shed's previous best was 80mph Naked record skinny dip bid Man walks away from record attempt crash Record attempt for most people playing single piano He first had the idea of creating a shed on wheels in 2015 when his old Volkswagen Passat lay broken on his drive - and he thought: ""Let's see if I can do something a little different."" The father-of-one initially spent Â£5,000 and 12 months making it roadworthy so he could ""take his daughter to school and pop to the shops"". ""I did everything, build the shed, connected the engine, build the chassis,""  said Mr Nicks, who lives in the same village as motoring broadcaster Jeremy Clarkson. ""The only thing I didn't do was felt the roof! I then thought 'I wonder how fast it could go'? ""I entered a few speed events and basically floored it. I hit 80mph to break the record, including the Guinness record. But it blew up so it needed some work."" Kevin Nicks created the Fastest Shed from his old Volkswagen Passat Now two years and 20,000 miles later, Mr Nicks has splashed out an estimated Â£8,000 on revamping the shed with a finely-tuned Audi RS4 engine. ""I've spent all winter doing it up and putting in a new engine and suspension, it's so quick off the mark. ""I had no idea how fast it would go - and it went well. It felt comfortable at 100mph, I was pleased."" Pendine Sands is synonymous with land speed attempts since Sir Malcolm Campbell broke the record in Bluebird in the 1920s Mr Nicks said it was a ""magical moment"" breaking the record at Pendine, a beach which has become synonymous with land speed attempts sinceSir Malcolm Campbell broke the record in the legendary Bluebirdin the 1920s. He was joined by a host of karts, three-wheelers and the most powerful street legal motorbikes as they hope to break the UK record of 194.5mph (313 km/h). Superbike racer Zef Eisenberg will also attempt to break the land-speed record - and the 200mph barrier - on sand on his supercharged Suzuki Hayabusa. ""Pendine Sands is a notoriously difficult race track,"" said Eisenberg. ""Competitors have no idea what the surface is like until the tide goes out. ""It's not just the high-end engineering that makes breaking records on Pendine Sands difficult. As Pendine is a Ministry of Defence test fire site, you'll often end up encountering unexploded ordnance alongside giant washed-up jellyfish."" Zef Eisenberg survived a 230mph crash breaking the land speed record for a turbine bike 18 months ago Eisenberg, from Guernsey, almost died after breaking the land speed record for a turbine bike 18 months ago as he crashed at 230mph (370km/h) and was in hospital for three months. ""No one in history, car or bike has ever exceeded 200mph on the sand at Pendine,"" he added. ""It's the holy grail of speed, where the best speed racers in the world have tried.""

WHSmith sells Â£7.99 hospital toothpasteThe retailer blamed a pricing error and said total proceeds from the sales would be donated to charity.,"The retailer said it had sold 89 tubes of toothpaste priced at Â£7.99 WHSmith has admitted it made more than Â£700 by selling single tubes of toothpaste for Â£7.99 in a hospital. The Pinderfields Hospital branch in Wakefield was caught selling Colgate, normally priced at Â£2.49, by a visitor. The retailer apologised for what it called a pricing error, and said proceeds from the sales would be donated to charity St George's Crypt. In 2015, WHSmith was accused of exploiting hospital customers after it was found charging less in other shops. The retailer said 89 tubes of toothpaste had been sold in the Pinderfields shop while they were priced at Â£7.99. WHSmith under fire for hospital prices WHSmith to cut hospital shop prices A spokeswoman said: ""We would like to apologise to our customers for a recent pricing error in our system relating to this product."" She added: ""The error has been rectified and changed to the correct price of Â£2.49."" Chloe Bond was admitted to Pindersfield Hospital in September last year after suffering stroke-like symptoms when stepping out of the shower. The 26-year-old was taken to hospital by ambulance at around 22:00 BST and remained there for three days while tests were carried out. She says she had no way of getting any toiletries, adding: ""I was dying to wash my hair and I could've killed for a toothbrush. ""The little store [WH Smiths] had the essentials but it was so overpriced - I probably would have had to spend about Â£40 just for personal hygiene. ""When my dad came to visit me I was like, 'it's terrible' - I wanted toiletries, a toothbrush, some clean underwear and I was on my period. I was just so uncomfortable."" Ms Bond describes toothbrushes being sold for around Â£5 or Â£6 and magazines and snacks being sold for multiple times the normal amount. In the end, the products had to be bought from a nearby Sainsbury's, where the total amount spent was about Â£10. This would have cost ""three or four times as much"" at the hospital shop, she says. ""I got to feel human for a lot less money."" Reacting to the story, BBC presenter and cancer blogger Rachael Bland described it as a""wider problem"".,externalShe said she paid Â£5.99 for painkillers while receiving treatment at the Christie in Manchester. Neil Wilson said it highlighted problems with NHS outsourcing, as this created ""captive markets ripe for price gouging"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

N Korea vows to dismantle nuclear site,"A satellite image of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in North Korea North Korea says it will begin dismantling its nuclear test site in less than two weeks in a ceremony attended by foreign journalists. Pyongyang said it was taking ""technical measures"" to carry out the process between 23-25 May, North Korean state news agency KCNA reported on Saturday. Scientists previously said the site may have partially collapsed in September. The move is due to take place three weeks before US President Donald Trump meets North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. In April, South Korean officials said Mr Kim had stated he ""would carry out the closing of the nuclear test site in May"", adding that nuclear experts from South Korea and the US would be invited to watch. Their comments came after talks between Mr Kim and South Korea's President Moon Jae-in. However there was no mention of allowing foreign experts access to the site in Saturday's statement from North Korea. North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear test site UN gains 'unprecedented access' during visit North Korea crisis in 300 words The dismantling of the Punggye-ri site, the exact date of which will depend on weather conditions, will involve the collapsing of all tunnels using explosives and the removal of all observation facilities, research buildings and security posts. Journalists from South Korea, China, the US, the UK and Russia will be asked to attend to witness the event. North Korea said the intention was to allow ""not only the local press but also journalists of other countries to conduct on-the-spot coverage in order to show in a transparent manner the dismantlement of the northern nuclear test ground"". The reason officials gave for limiting the number of countries invited to send journalists was due to the ""small space of the test ground... located in the uninhabited deep mountain area"". Situated in mountainous terrain in the north-east, the Punggye-ri site is thought to be the North's main nuclear facility. Nuclear tests have taken place in a system of tunnels dug below Mount Mantap, near the Punggye-ri site. Six nuclear tests have been carried out there since 2006. After the most recent test, which took place in September 2017,a series of aftershocks hit the site, which seismologists believe collapsed part of the mountain's interior. Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to differ from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament. On a recent visit to North Korea, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stressed that any such claim would require a ""robust verification"" programme by the US and other nations. US offers to help rebuild N Korea if it denuclearises Timeline: North Korea nuclear stand-off North Korea has also reneged on a number of promises made in previous years. In 1994, then-US President Bill Clinton made plans to attack sites in North Korea based on intelligence that the state had begun shipping fuel rods that could be used to produce plutonium to its main nuclear facility, the Yongbyon complex. The threat of US strikes at the time, along with an offer from the Clinton administration to help boost the state's struggling economy, led to an agreement with the North Koreans. The US provided fuel to an energy-starved economy, and North Korea agreed to freeze its programme. But Pyongyang later breached the agreement and the deal fell apart in 2002. In 2007, Pyongyang announced that it had shut its Yongbyon reactoras part of a disarmament-for-aid deal. The following year it demolished the facility's cooling tower in a symbol of its commitment to ending its nuclear programme. Then, in 2013, North Korea said it would restart operations at the Yongbyon site - a move that was later confirmed by experts. Mr Trump and Mr Kim are due to meet in Singapore on 12 June. It will be the first time a sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. The key issue expected to be discussed is North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, over which the two leaders furiously sparred in 2017. The US wants Pyongyang to give up its weapons programme completely and irreversibly. Will historic summit lead to peace? The Koreas - the basics explained Confirmation of the meeting between the two men came after landmark talks between North and South Korea. Mr Trump announced the date and place of the summit earlier this week, hours after he welcomed home three US detainees released from North Korea. ""We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!"" he tweeted. There is a ""sense of optimism"" among North Korea's leaders, the head of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said on Saturday after enjoying what he said was unprecedented access to the country. David Beasley spent two days in the capital, Pyongyang, and two outside it, accompanied by government minders. He said the country was working hard to meet nutritional standards, and hunger was not as high as in the 1990s. Mr Beasley's visit, from 8-11 May, included trips to WFP-funded projects - a children's nursery in South Hwanghae province and a fortified biscuit factory in North North Pyongyan province. ""I didn't see starvation like you had in the famine back in the 1990s, that's the good news. But is there a hunger issue, is there under-nutrition? There's no question about it,"" he told the BBC. ""There is a sense of turning a new page in history,"" he said.

Two dead in Paris knife attack,"This video can not be played French police at the scene of the attack in Paris A knifeman has killed one person and wounded four in a suspected terror attack in central Paris, French officials say. The attacker was then shot dead by police in the OpÃ©ra district. Witnesses say they heard him shout ""Allah Akbar"". So-called Islamic State (IS) later said one of its ""soldiers"" had carried out the attack on Saturday evening. Judicial sources told French media the attacker was a man born in 1997 in the southern Russian republic of Chechnya. The sources said his parents had been held for questioning. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said the victim of the attack was a 29-year-old man, but gave no further details. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted (in French): ""France has once again paid in blood,external, but will not give an inch to the enemies of freedom."" The attacker began stabbing passers-by at about 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on the rue Monsigny. Eyewitnesses described him as a young man with brown hair and a beard, dressed in black tracksuit trousers. The man tried to enter several bars and restaurants but was blocked by people inside. Police arrived at the scene within minutes. They first tried to stop the assailant with a stun-gun before shooting him dead. An eyewitness, named as Gloria, told AFP news agency: ""We didn't know what was going on, we were quickly moved inside the bar, I went outside and I saw a man lying on the floor."" Forensic officers have been examining the scene of the attack Jonathan, a waiter at a local restaurant, told AFP: ""I saw him with a knife in his hand. He looked crazy."" He said a woman the attacker had stabbed ran into into the restaurant bleeding. The assailant tried to follow her inside, but was fended off and finally fled. Two of the wounded in the attack are in a serious condition but do not have life-threatening injuries. Later in the evening the IS group said it was behind the attack, in a brief statement posted on its news outlet. The anti-terrorism unit of the Paris prosecutor's office has launched an investigation. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said police were on the scene five minutes after an emergency call and the attacker was killed ""less than nine minutes later"". Mr Collomb praised police for their ""cool response"". He said his first thoughts were ""with the victims of this heinous act"". Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo tweeted (in French): ""Tonight, our city was bruised."",external ""I want to tell them that all Parisians are on their side,"" she added. The Opera district is renowned for its nightlife France has been on high alert following a series of attacks. More than 230 people have been killed by IS-inspired jihadists in the past three years. The deadliest violence occurred on 13 November 2015, when gunmen and suicide bombers struck various venues in Paris almost simultaneously - killing a total 130 people. Paris attacks: What happened on the night After winning last year's elections,President Macron pledged that fighting Islamist terrorism would be his top foreign policy priority.

Macron: Anti-terror 'top priority',"Mr Macron spelled out a plan for revitalising French diplomacy French President Emmanuel Macron says fighting Islamist terrorism will be his top foreign policy priority. Defeating so-called Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria must go hand-in-hand with anti-terror measures in Africa, he told some 200 French ambassadors. He called the security of French citizens ""the raison d'Ãªtre of our diplomacy"". IS-inspired terror attacks in France have killed more than 230 people since early 2015. ""We need an inclusive transition in Syria,"" he said, adding that France and its partners would have to invest in the reconstruction of both Syria and Iraq. ""We need to win the peace in both countries."" He also spoke of some ""specific results with the Russians"" on preventing further use of chemical weapons in Syria, but did not elaborate. ""Providing security for our citizens means that the fight against Islamist terrorism is our first priority,"" he said. Within weeks of becoming president, Mr Macron held separate talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump in Paris, visited French troops in troubled Mali and toured Central and Eastern Europe. But recent opinion polls suggest a big slump in his popularity. Besides security, he stressed that French independence would be one of his foreign policy priorities. Another would be restoring French influence internationally. He noted that poverty was a driver of African migration towards Europe, and stressed the importance of development aid for the Sahel region. That was the focus of talks he held on Monday with the leaders of Niger, Chad and Libya, and European partners. ""Africa is a continent of the future - we cannot just leave it alone,"" he said, outlining a strategy of ""creating an axis between Africa, the Mediterranean and Europe"". Soon after his May election triumph Mr Macron visited French anti-terror forces in Mali This year some 125,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean on perilous journeys, during which more than 2,000 drowned. More than 90,000 of them reached Italy's shores, mostly fleeing violence and chaos in Libya. ""Italy and Libya expect more support from us, which we must provide,"" Mr Macron told the diplomats. Is France already losing its Macron frisson? Macron unveils African migration plan Macron team complete French vote rout Macron: France's controversial man on the move He announced that France would have a special envoy to steer negotiations on the migration crisis. He is pressing the EU to help establish new centres in Chad and Niger to process asylum applications. The idea is to curb the flow of asylum seekers who are exploited by people-smugglers in Libya and who risk their lives aboard overcrowded, unseaworthy boats. The new centres would focus on identifying genuine refugees who qualify for asylum. ""It's a human duty to welcome migrants,"" he said, while admitting that ""it's a considerable challenge for all European countries"". Turning to the EU's challenges, he said ""we can't let Europe get bogged down in technocratic quarrels"". The answer to voters' sense of malaise with the EU, he said, was to reinvigorate democratic participation. ""Europeans need to take ownership of the European idea,"" he said, adding that the UK Brexit vote happened ""because for years we didn't dare to make proposals"". ""Europe suffered too much from being a crisis management union... we've got to build a union that is highly ambitious and protective."" He called for an EU of ""several formats"", to give space to those members wanting to integrate faster than others. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

UN gains 'unprecedented' access,"People are going hungry in North Korea, the head of the WFP said, but are not starving The head of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) believes there is a ""sense of optimism"" among North Korea's leaders after enjoying what he said was unprecedented access to the country. David Beasley spent two days in the capital, Pyongyang, and two outside it, accompanied by government minders. He said the country was working hard to meet nutritional standards, and hunger was not as high as in the 1990s. ""There is a sense of turning a new page in history,"" he told the BBC. Relations between North Korea and the rest of the world have seen a dramatic shift. Last year the North Korean government carried out a string of nuclear and missile tests. But next month, its leader Kim Jong-un will meet US President Donald Trump, in what would be the first time a sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. Confirmation of the meeting came after landmark talks between North and South Korea. Mr Trump announced the details of the meeting - in Singapore on 12 June - earlier this week, hours after he welcomed home three US detainees released from North Korea. Will historic summit lead to peace? The Koreas - the basics explained David Beasley visited North Korea from 8-11 May. The visit included trips to WFP-funded projects - a children's nursery in South Hwanghae province and a fortified biscuit factory in North Pyongyan province. He told the BBC's Radio 4 programme Today that the farming he saw in the countryside reflected the fact that only about a fifth of the land is arable. ""One of the most powerful things that I saw was out in the countryside - it's spring, they're planting - there's not mechanisation, you've got oxen pulling ploughs, men and women in the fields,"" he said. David Beasley visited WFP programmes in the North Korean countryside ""It's very structured, very organised, every foot and inch of dirt is being toiled with rakes and hoes and shovels and they're literally planting crops up to the edge of the road, down embankments, using every available space, because it is a land that's mostly mountainous. ""I didn't see starvation like you had in the famine back in the 1990s, that's the good news. But is there a hunger issue, is there under-nutrition? There's no question about it."" Between 1994 and 1998, hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have died in North Korea in a widespread famine. After drought last year, the UN said seven in 10 North Koreans were relying on food aid, while four in 10 were malnourished. Two in five N Koreans 'undernourished' UN sounds alarm over N Korea drought Last month the UN requested $111m in aid funding to help people in North Korea.The US has offered to help rebuild the country, on condition of denuclearisation.

France country profile,"France is known the world over for its cuisine, fashion, culture and language. A key player on the global stage and a country at the political heart of Europe, France paid a high price in both economic and human terms during the two world wars. The years which followed saw protracted conflicts culminating in independence for Algeria and most other French colonies in Africa, as well as decolonisation in south-east Asia. France was one of the key players in European integration as the continent sought to rebuild after the devastation of World War Two.

The former banker launched an independent campaign for the presidency little over a year before the election, and his En Marche! movement galvanised enough support from the centre-right and left to knock the traditional Socialist and Republican party candidates out in the first round of voting. The following year saw President Macron's popularity fall as he tried to overhaul the economy, with major street protests in November 2018 over his attempt to wean the public off fossil fuels through price hikes. In the April 2022 presidential election, Macron again defeated Le Pen in the second round of voting. Prime Minister: Gabriel Attal President Macron appointed Gabriel Attal as France's prime minister in January 2024, in a move aimed at reviving his presidency with a new government. Appointed at the age of 34, Attal is the youngest prime minister in modern French history. He replaced Ãlisabeth Borne, who resigned after 20 months in office. Throughout that time she struggled with a lack of a majority in parliament. The appointment of Attal, the former education minister, does not necessarily signal any major political shift, but signals a desire by President Macron to try and move beyond 2023's unpopular pension and immigration reforms and improve his party's chances in the EU parliamentary elections in June 2024.

Female stars in Cannes red-carpet protest,"This video can not be played Eighty-two women take part in an equality march on the Cannes red carpet Dozens of women film stars have held a protest at the Cannes film festival against gender-based discrimination in the industry. Cate Blanchett, Kristen Stewart and Salma Hayek were among those taking part in the red-carpet demonstration. The prestigious Cannes festival has come under criticism for failing to showcase more films by women directors. The protest comes after a period of turmoil in the industry following allegations of sexual harassment. This is the first Cannes festival since allegations of sexual abuse were first made against producer Harvey Weinstein last year. He has always denied engaging in non-consensual sex. Cate Blanchett leads the festival's jury this year The actresses and film-makers linked arms to stroll along the red carpet. Cate Blanchett spoke of the film industry's gender inequalities. ""We are 82 women, representing the number of female directors who have climbed these stairs since the first edition of the Cannes film festival in 1946. In the same period, 1,688 male directors have climbed these very same stairs,"" the two-time Oscar winner said. ""The prestigious Palme d'Or has been bestowed upon 71 male directors, too numerous to mention by name, but only two female directors,"" Ms Blanchett remarked. What has #MeToo actually changed? Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo The women taking part in the protest included all of the festival's female jury members and many women actors, directors and producers. 82 women took part in a Cannes protest against sexual harassment in the film industry Producer and activist Melissa Silverstein of Women and Hollywood said the protest was a ""massive milestone towards change"".

By Neil Smith, Entertainment reporter at Cannes At an event often more associated with the flashy and superficial, this was a moment of real heft and resonance. The sight of 82 women walking slowly, silently and purposefully up the red-carpeted stars of Cannes' Grand Theatre Lumiere brought home the shocking under-representation of female film-makers at an event meant to celebrate the totality of world cinema. The timing was perfect. The evening's film, Girls of the Sun, not only has a female director but also tells of a commando unit of female fighters in Kurdistan. Some of the 82 were familiar. Many were not. Together, though, they sent out a powerful statement that both this festival and the industry that sustains it would do well to heed. For the 2018 festival, an anti-harassment hotline has been created. The French Equality Minister Marlene Schiappa said it had received ""several calls"" since the gathering began on 9 May. Harvey Weinstein's accusers Exploring the casting couch culture of LA The allegations of sexual harassment made against well-known male film industry figures has created a public conversation about gender discrimination and sexual harassment in many industries. It led to the creation of a #MeToo hashtag, giving women an opportunity to share their experiences. The Time's Up movement was created by more than 300 actresses, writers and directorsto help fight sexual harassment in the film industry and other workplaces. At the Golden Globes in January, many film stars wore black gowns in support of the Time's Up movement, standing in solidarity with victims of sexual assault and harassment.

Iraq holds first election since IS defeat,"This video can not be played Female Iraqi MP, Dr Hanan al-Fatlawi, says she's been threatened because of her work Iraqis have voted in the first parliamentary elections since the government declared victory over so-called Islamic State (IS) last year. Around 7,000 candidates from rival coalition alliances are vying for seats in the 329-member assembly. The results are scheduled to be officially announced on Monday. Despite improved security, Iraq is still struggling to rebuild itself after four years of war against IS, a BBC correspondent says. He says whoever wins will need to keep Iraq's fragile unity in the face of sectarian and separatist tensions. The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts Iraq country profile Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had called on ""all Iraqis"" to take part in the election. ""Today Iraq is powerful and unified after defeating terrorism, and this is a huge achievement for all Iraqis,"" he said after casting his vote. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi cast his vote in the capital Baghdad Iraqis voted for rival lists of candidates. Most are predominantly Shia or Sunni, though the Kurds have their own lists. The Shia-led government has won praise for the fight against IS militants, and security has vastly improved across the country. This video can not be played Many Iraqis have lost faith in their politicians But many Iraqis are disillusioned by widespread government corruption and a weak economy, the BBC's Martin Patience reports. There is also frustration at a perceived lack of change. One Baghdad resident said that he ""regretted"" voting in the 2014 elections because ""all the promises are lies"". Reuters reported that voter turnout in several polling stations in the capital appeared low, although the government partially lifted a curfew to encourage voting. Security around voting centres was tight. At least three people were killed in an attack near a polling station in the northern province of Kirkuk, according to local media. People turned out to vote in the city of Mosul, which was severely damaged in the fight against IS The vote came just days after US President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal.

Discount shop Poundworld 'put up for sale',"Poundworld employs about 5,500 staff in the UK Discount retailer Poundworld has been put up for sale by its owner, private equity firm TPG, the BBC understands. The chain had been looking at closing about 100 of its 355 stores as part of a restructuring plan, as it battled a tough retail environment. That process has now been put on hold by US owner TPG after it received expressions of interest in the company. Poundworld, which employs about 5,500 people, is among many stores on the High Street which have been struggling. Like many retailers, it has been hit by falling consumer confidence, rising overheads, the weaker pound and the growth of online shopping. The chain imports a lot of its stock and is having to pay more for it because of the fall in the value of the pound. Poundworld adds to retail gloom Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Five things to do with empty retail space The process of finding a buyer will happen over a short timeframe, the BBC understands, to allow any new buyer to continue the restructuring process if required. It had been expected to announce the terms of that process - known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) - this month. CVA's have become popular among retailers because they allow firms to offload underperforming stores and reduce rents while avoiding administration. Poundworld, which has its headquarters in West Yorkshire, was formed in 2004, but it says it can trace its origins ""back to 1974 and a market stall in Wakefield, West Yorkshire"". Private equity firm TPG Capital, which bought a majority stake in Poundworld in 2015, also controls the restaurant chain Prezzo whose landlords agreed to a CVA last month.Prezzo is closing 94 branches. A number of other retailers have chosen to go through a CVA, including New Look and Carpetright, while House of Fraser is expected to make a formal CVA proposal next month, with a full restructuring in place by early 2019. Earlier this year, both Toys R Us UK and electronics chain Maplin went into administration.

R Kelly defiant on stage amid protests,"Campaign groups are joining forces to boycott singer R Kelly R&B singer R Kelly took defiantly to the stage in the US state of North Carolina amid a campaign over his treatment of women. The singer told the crowd on Friday night that he had ""been through a lot"" in recent days before launching into a number of sexually suggestive songs. Protesters demonstrated outside the venue against Kelly, who has been accused of sexual misconduct. The singer denies wrongdoing and is not facing any criminal charges. In one of his first performances since a campaign against him was launched, Kelly thanked his supporters at the Greensboro Coliseum for continuing to ""fight for me"". He added that he had been asked to perform a more low key set before breaking into sexually explicit songs and at one point rubbing a fan's smartphone between his legs, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reports. How #MeToo has changed the world 50 Cent defends R Kelly over Spotify Singer hits back at Time's Up demands Kelly, 51, was removed from Spotify playlists this week as part of the streaming service's new ""Hate Content & Hateful Conduct"" policy,who has been hit with a number of allegations including trapping women in a sex ""cult"". He has recently been targeted by the #MuteRKelly campaign, which calls for the singer to be boycotted. The campaign gained momentum last week when it was picked up by the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment. Time's Up has called for ""appropriate investigations... into the allegations of R Kelly's abuse made by women of colour"". He denies the allegations and has said he ""supports the pro-women goals"" of the movement. This video can not be played Why people are calling to #MuteRKelly... again In April, Kelly faced a fresh allegation of sexual misconduct from a former partner who said he ""intentionally"" infected her with a sexually transmitted disease. In 2008, Kelly was acquitted of 14 charges of making child pornography after a videotape emerged allegedly showing him having sex with a 14-year-old girl. Kelly is one of the most successful R&B artists of all time, with 40 million records sold worldwide. His best known hits include I Believe I Can Fly and Ignition (Remix). 50 Cent defends R Kelly over Spotify removal R Kelly removed from Spotify playlists R Kelly hits back at Time's Up demands Why the #MuteRKelly campaign is back.

"Protesters demand 'new deal' for workersThousands of people join a march in London over wages, workers' rights and public services.4h4 hours agoBusiness","Thousands of people have joined a trade union march calling for a ""new deal"" for workers and public services. The central-London demonstration, led by the Trades Union Congress, highlighted demands for better pay and job security. TUC research said the UK's real wage squeeze,externalwould be the worst in modern history and the slowest for 200 years. The government said its policies had boosted pay for the lowest earners and meant workers could keep more of it. Demonstrators gathering at Saturday's march called for a higher minimum wage of Â£10 an hour, a ban on zero-hours contracts and greater funding for the NHS, education and other public services. At a rally in Hyde Park at the end of the march, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the crowd that his party would create a ministry to guarantee worker's rights. ""We will give workers more power by strengthening their rights and freedoms to organise together to improve their lives,"" he said. He blamed eight years of government cuts for the lack of wage growth. ""They protect the tax havens and cut the spending for public services,"" Mr Corbyn said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed the crowd in Hyde Park Lisa Hampele, BBC News Thousands upon thousands of people marched through London's streets, some dancing, playing drums, shouting slogans and carrying banners aloft. Nurses, teachers, office workers, ambulance crews, civil servants and cleaners joined the noisy and colourful demonstration. As they arrived for the rally in Hyde Park the rain began and it became more like a festival in a soggy field. There were food stalls, bands playing and speeches from union leaders and peace campaigners. The star of the show, Jeremy Corbyn - wearing a cream jacket and a big smile - was cheered like a pop star. The applause was long and loud. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS union, told the crowd that 150,000 civil servants could ballot for strike action after members were offered a below-inflation 1% pay rise for the 11th year running. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""There is a new mood in the country. People have been very patient but they are now demanding a new deal."" Meanwhile, research published by TUC suggested wages in the UK had lagged behind inflation since 2008, and were worth Â£24 less in real terms than in 2008. McDonald's workers marched to highlight their cause The TUC also said wages would not recover until 2025, by which time, it said, the average worker would have lost Â£18,500. The TUC's deputy general secretary Paul Nowack told the BBC that 17 years of falling wages in real terms amounted to the biggest relative wage loss since the Napoleonic Wars. In the last eight years, a million more children from working families were living ""below the breadline"", he said. ""I don't think it's right that people who go out and work are struggling to put food on the table."" Elsewhere, economists said the slow wage growth was a result of low productivity in the UK, rather than austerity policies. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC: ""That means that the amount we produce for each hour we work is basically the same as it was in 2008. If we're not producing any more, we're not in the end going to be able to earn any more."" Tens of thousands of workers joined the TUC demonstration, making it the largest in years A Treasury spokesperson said wages were forecast to grow faster than inflation in each of the next five years, and that government policies were helping British workers. ""Our National Living Wage has boosted pay for the lowest earners by over Â£2,000 already; we are cutting taxes to help people keep more of what they earn; and we are making sure people have the skills they need to secure high-quality, well-paid jobs by investing in technical education and boosting apprenticeships."" The TUC said its figures were based on annual average weekly earnings for total pay (including bonuses) adjusted with the CPI measure of inflation, which were then compared with long-run back data published by the Bank of England. The forward-looking ones were based on the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast to 2022, and then a projection to 2025 using the average forecast growth rate for the 2018-22 period.

"Seven things to look out for at EurovisionIreland's controversial dancers, chicken impressions and a massive dress - what not to miss tonight.6h6 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Rylan on who to watch at Eurovision The moment you've all been waiting for is here: Saturday's Eurovision grand final. The excitement has been building all week in Lisbon, as have the number of crazy outfits and national flags. You'll know already that Cyprus is odds-on favourite to win this year's competition. But don't fret,the UK is the bookies' favourites,externalas well... to finish dead last. Oh dear. So don't get your hopes up for a British win in 2018, but just enjoy the show - the songs really are particularly strong this year. Here are my seven things to look out for. Eurovision 2018: follow live coverage Saara, you've got something on your face... You'll remember Saara from 2016's X Factor and our Finnish favourite is back on our screens again - this time competing for her country. Watch out for Aalto on a rotating board which looks like she's about to have someone throw knives at her while blindfolded. She also has an amazing sparkler-come-firework gun which she fires towards the end of her allotted three minutes. All very dramatic... when it works. It's failed to fire off occasionally during rehearsal, so it will be interesting to see if it manages on the night. 10 things you need to know about SuRie What these UK Eurovision acts know now Ryan O'Shaughnessy's beautiful rendition of Together is a tale of heartbreak Ryan O'Shaughnessy made headlines around the world earlier this week when theEBU banned a Chinese television network from airing the final, after they refused to air the Irish performance and blurred out gay pride flags in earlier broadcasts. The controversy has arisen because O'Shaughnessy's dancers tell a story of love and heartbreak - and they are both male. O'Shaughnessy told BBC News: ""From the very start we've said love is love - whether it's between two guys, two girls or a guy and a girl, so I think this is a really important decision."" Will this controversy and the added publicity play in Ireland's favour? This video can not be played Eurovision street style: What fans are wearing in Lisbon OK we get it Amaia and Alfred: you're in love This year's Eurovision seems to be even more of a love-in than it is usually. Literally. The number of on-off stage romances seems particularly high. One of the favourites, Madame Monsieur from France, are a real life Mrs and Mr Emilie Satt and Jean-Karl Lucas, who met in 2008 and have been married for three years. Lithuania's Ieva Zasimauskaite sings an endearing song about finding the person to grow old with, only to finish the song meeting a tall, handsome stranger on a bridge. Cue her real-life actual husband. And perhaps the most obvious pairing is Spain's Amaia and Alfred who spend the whole of their duet no more than three inches away from the other's face, and end the song with a kiss. They say they've been dating for several months. I say isn't this all a bit too soon? Netta's chicken dance... natch If you haven't heard about Israel's entry already, she has been the one with all the buzz around her in the lead-up to Eurovision. She has a unique appearance and original performance style. Oh, and she also does a chicken noise and dance to go with it. Seriously. Chicken impressions aside,the song has a real messagethat fits right in with 2018's#MeTooand#TimesUpmovements. ...run. There will be no village pillaging this time, I promise Rasmussen may look,as some media have noted,external, like the lanky kid brother of Tormund Giantsbane from Game of Thrones, but the message he brings is peace. The song is all about laying down your sword and taking the Higher Ground (the name of the song). It may not sound like the ingredients for a hit, but c'mon guys this is Eurovision. Trust me, the primordial sounds of this song are going to do well. If they're playing guitar, I'll eat Waylon's stetson Waylon provides the country music sound of the competition and shows up on stage in a stetson and leopard print jacket. So far, so normal. He has a drummer and three guitarists with him - although I sincerely doubt any guitar music is being produced by the trio. But then they toss away their instruments and start some kind of jerky dance moves, which make them look like Pinocchio being electrocuted. There is some crotch grabbing and a few back flips. I don't even know where this kind of dancing belongs, but it's not here... Help, my dress is on fire! It takes Estonia's Elina Nechayeva and eight members of crew to get her dress on stage - but I think we'll all agree it's worth the effort. Elina's act consists of her in a massive dress with images projected onto the skirt, while she belts out opera and reaches notes that would make even Mariah Carey wince.

When Eurovision last came to Britain,"The contest was presented by Terry Wogan and Ulrika Jonsson, with Wogan also taking on commentating duties It's now 20 years since the UK last hosted the Eurovision Song Contest. Two decades of mostly underwhelming results since Katrina and the Waves landed the crown in 1997 mean that the buzz of welcoming the cream of European pop - as Lisbon is set to do this weekend - is something the nation has almost forgotten. It wasn't always this way: seven of the first 27 were held in the UK, but 1998 is the only time in the past 36 contests that Eurovision has been staged here. As it turned out, the event at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena proved to be one of the great nights of Eurovision. BBC News takes a trip down memory lane. This video can not be played Eurovision: When Birmingham hosted the singing Olympics Israeli singer Dana International made history by becoming the first transsexual woman to win the contest with her song, Diva. Her selection as Israel's representative had caused outrage among some Orthodox Jews and she even received death threats. However, her victory by public vote was a signal of how progressive Europe was becoming in its attitudes towards the trans community. Alasdair Rendall, president of OGAE UK, the UK's largest Eurovision fan club, describes her as ""one of Eurovision's most iconic and groundbreaking winners"". ""There were conservatives in her country unhappy about her representing Israel, [but] the fact she won showed Europe had become a more progressive place to be,"" he says. Dana International has been described as one of the ""most iconic and groundbreaking winners"" And the winner certainly lived up to the title of her song, leaving the audience at the National Indoor Arena waiting after she'd triumphed. ""In your own time,"" Terry Wogan remarked as he and fellow host Ulrika Jonsson waited on stage. Indeed. But Dana International wasn't the only act that had people talking in 1998. Germany's Guildo Horn brought the house down withan outlandish performance of his song Guildo hat euch lieb!,external(Guildo loves you!). The balding singer, clad in a turquoise suit (though he discarded his cloak and jacket over the course of his three glorious minutes in the spotlight), twice jumped into the crowd, stroked people in the front row of the audience includinglegendary former Eurovision host Katie Boyle, badly mimed playing cowbells and even clambered up the set, completing his song astride a podium several feet above the stage. ""If that man doesn't have a heart attack, he's a constant encouragement to all we elderly broadcasters,"" mused a chuckling Wogan. While some feared Guildo's eccentric act would make Germany look silly, his antics saw him finish in a respectable seventh place and conferred cult status on him in his homeland. Guildo loves you! Yes, you! Imaani, who came second, initially didn't want to take part at all In recent years the UK has spent more time in the bottom half of the table than the top - with the ultimate rejection coming in 2003 when Jemini didn't score a single point - but back in 1998 it was still a nation that believed in its ability to deliver a continent-pleasing pop tune. While Britain might now be the sick man of Eurovision, it is still actually the third most successful country - level with Luxembourg and France and behind only Sweden and Ireland - having triumphed five times. Sandie Shaw, Lulu, Brotherhood of Man and Bucks Fizz had all graced the top spot, before Katrina and the Waves won with Love Shine A Light in 1997. Twelve months on and Imaani almost made it back-to-back success, finishing in second place with Where Are You?, her 166 points only slightly behind Dana International's 172. ""I was shocked to come second and come that far,"" says Imaani, who is currently touring with the acid jazz band Incognito. ""It was really big and it's probably my proudest moment because I represented my country. I was pleased as punch."" Katrina and the Waves successfully shone a light for the UK in 1997 Not bad for a singer who had initially been dubious about entering the competition. ""I was approached and asked 'will you be the vocalist?' and I said 'most certainly not, I'm far too cool for Eurovision'."" She says she's glad she changed her mind. ""I thought it was the most famous competition and it would be an opportunity I would be stupid to miss. It turned out being one of the most fun things I've ever done - fun and stressful."" This year's contest in Lisbon sees the hopes of millions of Brits rest with Royal Academy of Music graduate SuRie, who represents the UK with her track Storm. Imaani believes the changes to the Eurovision voting system were good for the contest Before 1998, the decision on who to award ""douze points"" was down to national ""juries"" of experts in each country. But for the first time - after a trial the previous year - mass televoting was introduced and from the comfort of our own armchairs us mere mortals were allowed to cast our votes Only countries that didn't have fully functional telephone systems were still allowed to vote through juries. What makes a Eurovision winner? Conchita Wurst: 'I want to be clear this is not a joke' Eurovision 2018: What these six UK entrants know now ""I think it certainly made it a lot more of a performance contest as well as a song contest,"" says Mr Rendall, who attended his first Eurovision in 1998 as a fresh-faced 16-year-old. ""You've got three minutes to cram something in that's memorable."" The change in the voting system saw people vote with emotion, according to Imaani. ""It didn't matter how good they were,"" she says. ""I truly believe to this day it's difficult not to vote with your heart. I don't necessarily think [coming second was] all based on my performance."" SuRie will represent the UK at this year's Eurovision Song Contest Over the years the credibility of the voting system has been marred by rumours of vote-rigging and claims of countries doing deals to support their neighbours. Nowadays fans can vote over the phone, on the Eurovision app or by text. And jury votes have also made a return, accounting for 50% of the total score. ""People go on about political voting - I don't think there's political voting, there's cultural voting,"" Mr Rendall says. ""And obviously a few years ago they brought back the jury so it's 50/50, so I think we've got the right balance."" The introduction of televoting wasn't all plain sailing though. Despite voters in Spain awarding 12 points to Germany, the top score went to Israel instead. The mistake was rectified after the show. Terry Wogan and Ulrika Jonsson were later named the most popular presenters of the 90s by Eurovision fans The contest was hosted by Ulrika Jonsson and Terry Wogan, who also provided his legendarily barbed television commentary, dashing between the stage and the commentary box during the live show. Wogan commentated on the contest for the BBC from the 1970s until 2008, although for some fans he was not a popular choice as they felt he didn't take it seriously enough. But it was Jonsson who provided an unintentionally comic moment while she was receiving the scores from the Netherlands. Dutch spokeswoman Conny Vandenbos, a former entrant, told Jonsson her ""heart goes to all the singers in the contest because I know what they feel"". She added that it was ""long ago"", but, due to the noise in the arena, the audience only heard Ulrika's apparently rude reply of: ""A long time ago was it?"". Jonsson was visibly taken aback by the audience's boos, although Vandenbos remained oblivious. None of this did Jonsson or Wogan much harm though - they werevoted the most popular presenters of the 90s,externalin a 2016 vote on the Eurovision website. US President Bill Clinton enjoying a pint of warm beer at the Malt House during the G8 summit in Birmingham OK, so we're pushing it a little bit on this one, but Wogan did namecheck the then-US president in his Eurovision opening. Just a week after Dana International had left the city in triumph, world leaders descended for the G8 summit. Wogan referred to this impending visit during the Eurovision opening. ""Next week [Birmingham will] host G8, the meeting of all the world's most powerful leaders,"" he said. ""Just to show you how important that is, Bill Clinton will be taking over the very bedroom I've just vacated in the hotel here."" We can't confirm whether the pair did indeed stay in the same hotel room. But what we can do is give you a picture of President Clinton enjoying a crafty pint at the canalside Malt House pub during the summit. Cheers! Salud! Prost!

The rarest language used at Eurovision,"This video can not be played Eurovision Song Contest 2018: SuRie makes sign language version of song You might think you know everything there is to know about the all-singing, all-dancing, Eurovision Song Contest, but do you know which is the rarest language? As UK representative SuRie prepares to take to the stage with her song Storm, on Saturday for the Grand Final in Lisbon, she is thought to be the first entrant to release a version of her music video in sign language. Classically trained SuRie (a combination of her forenames Susanna and Marie), from Hertfordshire, was approached by fan Tom Moran, who sent her a video of himself signing the song. Moran, who is not deaf himself, uses sign language to talk to many of his family members who are deaf. SuRie was so moved by the gesture she invited Moran to help her film a signed version of the video. ""I had really been wanting to learn BSL (British Sign Language) for a while now,"" SuRie says. ""But this was the first time I had actually done it. ""He was there behind the camera signing with me to make sure everything was correct."" Allow Twitter content?

Moran was impressed with SuRie's efforts and loved the finished product. He said: ""It's so important that we increase the accessibility of music and inclusivity of Eurovision for all."" While SuRie is the first to make her music more accessible ahead of the competition, this isn't the first time Eurovision has signed songs for the deaf community. Since 2015, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which produces the Eurovision Song Contest, has collaborated with the national broadcaster of each host nation to provide sign language interpreters as part of a scheme called Eurovision Signs. The initiative uses International Sign, or IS, which is a more generalised version of sign language and combines signs from different sign languages. However, IS differs from other sign languages in the way it relies on gestures to convey meaning. Interpreters use signs, as well as body language, to translate the songs and also dance to the beat. The interpreter's aim is to tell the story of the song. This video can not be played SuRie explains her passion for Eurovision It is up to the networks that broadcast the contest to provide Sign Language interpreters. So far, nine countries are on board with Eurovision Signs including Denmark, Norway and the first host nation to take part, Austria. Eva-Maria Hinterwirth of Austrian broadcaster ORF previously said: ""We always say that music is a language which is understood by everyone. ""And we felt that we should make this world [be]come reality, and to offer music to everyone, including deaf people."" Sweden is particularly renowned for providing interpreters. Tommy KrÃ¥ngh from Sweden has become well-known for his enthusiastic signing of songs Tommy KrÃ¥ngh became a viral hit after his enthusiastic interpretation of songs for Sweden's 2015 Eurovision heats amassed 3.7 million views on YouTube. Accessibility for disabled people is a hot topic amongst music fans. In January, Sally Reynolds, who is deaf,took legal action against the organisers of a Little Mix concertafter it only supplied a BSL interpreter for the headline act and not for the supporting acts. The organisers had initially refused to provide an interpreter at all saying it was the customers responsibility to arrange it. But Under the Equality Act 2010, any organisation which supplies a service to the public is under duty to make reasonable adjustments to ensure a disabled person's experience is as close as possible to that of someone without a disability. Walter and Kazha performed the chorus of their entry The War Is Not Over in Latvian Sign Language SuRie says: ""I think it's really important that music is inclusive and accessible to all people. Eurovision is great because it unites people through a love of great music, and that should be open to all."" In fact, one entry has already been performed in the Grand Final in Latvian Sign Language. In 2005, Walter and Kazha performed the chorus of their entry The War Is Not Over in sign. And here are a few more facts to get you one-up on your fellow Eurovision fans. Monika Kuszynska became the first wheelchair user to appear at Eurovision when she represented Poland in 2015 and Russia's semi-finalist this year, Julia Samoylova, performed in her wheelchair. The singer of I Won't Break, has spinal muscular atrophy, a condition which weakens the muscles and makes movement difficult. SuRie has remained tight-lipped about her final performance in the final and is looking forward to seeing what her fellow-contestants have planned. But when asked whether she would consider signing her music videos in the future, she emphatically replied, ""Definitely!"" Inclusivity remains the cornerstone of the competition's ethos. Launched in 1956, it was originally a way of uniting post-war Europe and the competition has gone on to become the largest non-sporting event in the world. With this year's theme #AllAboard, let's hope Eurovision continues to work towards creating a diverse and welcoming space for everyone to celebrate music.

But also the old jazz singers: Etta James, Nina Simone, Billie Holiday etc."" ""Orange."" But SuRie confesses there is no orange in her performance. Underwear then? ""Yeh, pants,"" she says. Who runs the world? ""Beyonce's Love on Top - with all of the key changes. That's my vocal warm up, just gotta hit them all."" The black power behind 'iconic' Beychella No-one likes a show-off. ""Playing the piano with my toes!"" ""What can't I play,"" she quips, when asked what toe-tapping renditions she does. ""No I can't really play anything much - but I CAN do chopsticks with my big toes if you keep them really still. I'll show you sometime..."" No, not these chopsticks... Think I'm washing my hair that night... ""I'd be able to speak all the languages in the world,"" she exclaims. ""It's actually Eurovision-related as well - although I didn't even intend that.""

SuRie's pose at the gym ""I like working out. I've recently got into weights - I'm a little bodybuilder. ""I love yoga as well - I love the combination of both, but weight lifting has been really genuinely thrilling. The strength that you can gain, that I've then found mentally, emotionally and psychologically so helpful. My sleep's really good, my mood's really good, so it's just amazing all round."" All of that from weight lifting? I've been wasting my time... ""I've just got a dog!"" ""She's so fun - a maltichon - a cross between a maltese and bichon frise, so she's a glorified cushion."" Want! ""She comes everywhere with me. Not to Lisbon, as the schedule is so mad, I couldn't do that to her. But she did come to Graham Norton's radio show the other day.

Reality Check: Why is China censoring Eurovision?,"When you're at home watching TV, you wouldn't normally expect a broadcast to suddenly cut out. But that's exactly what audiences in China have become used to. During the first semi-final of the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest, Chinese broadcaster Mango TV edited out footage. It blurred rainbow flags and removed some entries altogether. Irish singer Ryan O'Shaughnessy's performance was not aired because it featured two male dancers enacting a gay love story. Albania's entry was also removed because some of its performers had tattoos The censorship prompted the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)to bar Mango TV from airing the second semi-final and the final. Social media users said it was a ""major step backwards"", and criticised the broadcaster for seeming to bow down to the state. But how does China decide what is censored? And how common are such incidents? All TV broadcasters in China are state-owned, heavily regulated and subject to censorship. Domestic programmes must often submit papers to their local Communist party bureau at least two months in advance for official approval. For foreign TV broadcasts, this process can take even longer. Beijing says that it will only allow broadcasts that ""do not threaten national or political security"". That means international channels - such as BBC World News - are only available to view in closed venues, such as luxury hotels. Even in these places, it is not uncommon for live broadcasts regarded as sensitive to be suddenly censored, leaving viewers to watch a black screen. Chinese TV often blurs over Taiwanese flags. TV censorship broadly falls into two categories: where sensitive images are blurred over, or the whole screen is completely blacked out. Live broadcasts happen on a slight time delay, and it is fairly common to see blurs over brand logos. But there are many well-documented instances where broadcasters have received a backlash after blurring content - both innocuous and heavily politicised. In February, Mango TV came under fire for blurring the faces of the Korean members of Sino-Korean boyband EXO. Following tensions with South Korea over its THAAD missile defence system, the government restricted broadcasts of South Korean content. Yet Chinese fans felt that censoring boyband members' faces was excessive. Broadcasters have also been criticised many times by anti-establishment media for blurring over Taiwanese flags. This is because Beijing does not recognise Taiwan as a separate country and sees this as a symbol of independence. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Outright blocking of international TV bulletins is common practice in China. While international channels are available to view, reports that go against the official government line are completely banned. China has censored numerous TV reports about Hong Kong politics. Itblocked all footage of the 2014 Hong Kong protestsand mutes pro-independence voices. Umbrellas became a symbol of the 2014 pro-democracy protests It also blocks reports on domestic events that it officially denies or considers sensitive,such as the 1989 Tian'anmen Square massacre, so broadcasts on the 4 June anniversary are blocked every year. Reality Check: Who loves the UK China censorship after Xi Jinping presidency extension proposal Many Chinese stars are concerned that if they do not dress appropriately, they may be taken off the air or their careers may be affected. In November, singer Katy Perry notably had her Chinese visa rejected for the Victoria's Secret show. Online spectators suspected that this was because she wore a sunflower dress at a 2015 Taiwan concert, which may have been interpreted as a show of support forTaiwanese independence. Recently, the state has taken steps to crack down on the appearance of tattoos, with broadcast regulators saying that they promote a negative subculture. Domestic sports stars with tattoos have reportedly been instructed to cover up their arms or legs in TV matches, and actors and performers notably cover up when appearing in interviews. Zhang Linpeng, one of China's top football players, could be a target for censors National paper Global Times says it suspects that the heavily-tattooed appearance of Albanian Eurovision entry, Eugent Bushpepa, is why his segment was removed from the Chinese broadcast. Even Peppa Pig has been subject to censorship in China Censorship of broadcast media, but also written publications and online content, is becoming a more common practice in mainland China. As well as continuing to censor historically contentious material, growing tensions between the mainland and independence factions in Hong Kong and Taiwan mean that Beijing is ramping up regulations to mute any sense of internal dissent. Regulation has also extended beyond television to digital platforms, owing to people increasingly watching TV over the internet, and even broadcasting their own content. The popularity of live streaming apps unsettles the Chinese government, who want absolute control over anything that is broadcast. However, social media users have noted their dissatisfaction over a growing list of what they can and cannot watch. While censorship ofviolent and pornographic contentmay seem acceptable, there have been government reprimands over content containingswearing, tattoos andhip-hop. Earlier in the yearPeppa Pig was also subject to censorshipafter the cartoon character was accused by state media of being used subversively.

Bono's son hits back in band name row,"The Irish version of Inhaler (Eli Hewson pictured bottom left) say they got there first The son of U2's Bono has hit back in a row over the name of his band. Eli Hewson, 18, the third child of the Irish rock legend, is frontman with a Dublin-based group called Inhaler - a name shared with a four-piece group of rockers from Hertford. The English Inhaler say they were using the moniker before Bono's son's band andhave demanded an apology. But the Irish rockers accused their namesakes of trying to ""generate publicity"" by bringing up the issue. The Dublin band said they had researched the name carefully and had used it first. Luca Centro (pictured) said his band were taking a stand ""for independent musicians"" In a statement, the Irish group said: ""It is not uncommon for bands in different locations to have matching names. ""We have never been in dispute with anyone over our name. There are other bands called Inhaler on the planet, but we seem to be the one the Hertfordshire band have targeted for some reason."" The Dublin quartet say they have been together since late 2012, but finally settled on using the name Inhaler in February 2015 after careful research. ""Based on what the Hertfordshire band say online, their first gig was at Saracens Head Ware on March 24th 2016,"" the statement added. The group sign off by saying they are prepared to let their namesakes ""have their limelight"" but plan on letting their ""music do the talking"". According to the English Inhaler's frontman Luca Centro, 17, the issue came to a head when an Irish newspaper used a picture of him, instead of Hewson, in an article about the Irish band. Centro said his ""psych noise punk rock"" band were not taking a stand for publicity, but for ""independent music"".

Round-the-world cyclists murdered,"Krzysztof Chmielewski (l) and Holger Hagenbusch had spent years travelling the world on bikes Mexican investigators say two European cyclists did not die in an accident as first claimed - they were murdered. The bodies of Holger Hagenbusch, from Germany, and Krzysztof Chmielewski, from Poland, were found at the bottom of a cliff in Chiapas state. Local authorities had said the pair appeared to have fallen after losing control. However, relatives and fellow cyclists suspected it was more sinister, and had called for a deeper investigation. The newly appointed special prosecutor, Luis Alberto SÃ¡nchez, said, on Friday, that they were killed in what appears to have been a robbery. ""Our investigations up to now indicate this was an intentional homicide,"" he said. Chmielewski's body was found first, 40 metres below the road, on 26 April. Hagenbusch was found eight days later - on 4 May - further down the ravine, but beneath the same road that runs between Ocosingo and San CristÃ³bal de las Casas in the country's far south. The regional attorney general in Chiapas, Arturo Pablo Lievano, originally said there was no evidence of bad intent and everything pointed to an accident. He said they may have been run off the road by a vehicle. However, Hagenbusch's brother, Reiner, told the German press he believed they had been killed and there had been some sort of attempted cover-up. Mexico's most violent year Clowns march against crime in Acapulco After travelling to Mexico to identify his brother's body, he also found out information about the Polish biker. ""The Polish cyclist was decapitated and had a foot missing,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""Justice for Holger and Krzysztof"" - a sign held during a protest in San Cristobal de las Casas last week Investigators now believe that the pair were assaulted on either the 19 or 20 April. Chmielewski sustained a head injury that may be a gunshot wound, said Mr SÃ¡nchez. His body was found next to a bike - but it was not his own. It belonged to his German companion, which aroused suspicions. Talking to BBC Mundo, Mr SÃ¡nchez said the assailants were probably trying to cover their tracks. ""Those that did this wanted to make it appear like an accident, so they put the bike there, but they made a mistake and used the German's bike,"" he said. Krzysztof Chmielewski, 37, was a Polish citizen and had been travelling the world by bike for three years. He had visited 51 countries and in the last year he had been to Canada and the US, before arriving in Mexico. He was planning to continue south all the way to Argentina, and had almost made it to Guatemala when he was killed. Holger Hagenbusch, a 43-year-old German, was also an experienced cyclist. He had been to 34 countries and had been travelling by bike for four years, according to his blog. Cyclists have painted a cycling angel on the road where the two men were assaulted The pair had not set out together, but their paths had crossed in Chiapas. Mr SÃ¡nchez told the BBC: ""We think that they were travelling short distance from each other, maybe one was assaulted first ... and then the second one arrived and they were both captured."" He said some of their belongings were missing. ""It was very premature to call this an accident. The bike [belonging to the German] did not show signs of having been in a traffic accident,"" he added. On 6 May, people from nearby San CristÃ³bal de las Casa walked, with their bikes, to kilometre 158 on the highway where the two men were found. They carried a bicycle that had been painted white - a symbolic gesture used worldwide for cyclists who die while riding - and called for justice for the pair. Rainer Hagenbusch posted his thanks on Facebook. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

US pastor to give royal wedding address,"Bishop Curry will travel to Windsor to take part in the service An American bishop is to give the address at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle next week. The Most Reverend Michael Curry became the first black presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church - like the Church of England, part of the Anglican Communion - when he was appointed in 2015. Bishop Curry, from Chicago, said the couple's love had an ""origin in God, and is the key to life and happiness"". The wedding will take place at Windsor Castle on 19 May. Royal wedding: What we know so far What kind of wedding dress will Meghan Markle wear? Harry and Megan already got married! The Dean of Windsor, the Rt Rev David Conner, will conduct the service before the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, officiates the ceremony in St George's Chapel. Archbishop Welby said he was thrilled the prince and Ms Markle had chosen Bishop Curry to carry out the address, describing him as a ""brilliant pastor, stunning preacher"". Allow Twitter content?

Ms Markle was baptised by the archbishop ahead of her nuptials to Prince Harry. Bishop Curry, who was ordained as a priest in 1978, is the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church and has spoken on issues including social justice, immigration policy and marriage equality. He most recently campaigned for the creation of family day care providers, educational centres and investment in inner-city neighbourhoods in all three of his parish ministries - North Carolina, Ohio, and Maryland. In North Carolina, he helped to refocus the church's development goals to fund malaria nets to save more than 100,000 lives. Bishop Curry defended the Episcopal Church's move to allow same sex couples to marry in church in 2015, which caused some churches to cut ties. The US Episcopal Church is one of only two Anglican churches worldwide that allow gay marriage in church - the other being the Scottish Episcopal Church. The couple announced their engagement in November Speaking after Kensington Palace announced his role on Saturday, Bishop Curry said: ""The love that has brought and will bind Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle together has its source and origin in God, and is the key to life and happiness. ""And so we celebrate and pray for them today."" It comes in the wake of other revelations about the wedding, with the Duke of Cambridge taking up the honour of being Prince Harry's best man, and Ms Markle's father set to walk her down the aisle. Some 1,200 members of the public have been invited to watch the ceremony on the grounds of the castle in Berkshire, and 250 members of the armed forceshave been given ceremonial duties. There is evena promise of confetti for train travellershoping to catch a glimpse of the couple on their wedding day. With less than a week to go,Prince Harry and Ms Markle's waxworks have been installedat Madame Tussauds, shops have stocked up on souvenirs, and Legoland's Windsor resort has recreated the wedding day.

WHSmith sells Â£7.99 hospital toothpasteThe retailer blamed a pricing error and said total proceeds from the sales would be donated to charity.1h31 minutes agoLeeds & West Yorkshire,"The retailer said it had sold 89 tubes of toothpaste priced at Â£7.99 WHSmith has admitted it made more than Â£700 by selling single tubes of toothpaste for Â£7.99 in a hospital. The Pinderfields Hospital branch in Wakefield was caught selling Colgate, normally priced at Â£2.49, by a visitor. The retailer apologised for what it called a pricing error, and said proceeds from the sales would be donated to charity St George's Crypt. In 2015, WHSmith was accused of exploiting hospital customers after it was found charging less in other shops. The retailer said 89 tubes of toothpaste had been sold in the Pinderfields shop while they were priced at Â£7.99. WHSmith under fire for hospital prices WHSmith to cut hospital shop prices A spokeswoman said: ""We would like to apologise to our customers for a recent pricing error in our system relating to this product."" She added: ""The error has been rectified and changed to the correct price of Â£2.49."" Chloe Bond was admitted to Pindersfield Hospital in September last year after suffering stroke-like symptoms when stepping out of the shower. The 26-year-old was taken to hospital by ambulance at around 22:00 BST and remained there for three days while tests were carried out. She says she had no way of getting any toiletries, adding: ""I was dying to wash my hair and I could've killed for a toothbrush. ""The little store [WH Smiths] had the essentials but it was so overpriced - I probably would have had to spend about Â£40 just for personal hygiene. ""When my dad came to visit me I was like, 'it's terrible' - I wanted toiletries, a toothbrush, some clean underwear and I was on my period. I was just so uncomfortable."" Ms Bond describes toothbrushes being sold for around Â£5 or Â£6 and magazines and snacks being sold for multiple times the normal amount. In the end, the products had to be bought from a nearby Sainsbury's, where the total amount spent was about Â£10. This would have cost ""three or four times as much"" at the hospital shop, she says. ""I got to feel human for a lot less money."" Reacting to the story, BBC presenter and cancer blogger Rachael Bland described it as a""wider problem"".,externalShe said she paid Â£5.99 for painkillers while receiving treatment at the Christie in Manchester. Neil Wilson said it highlighted problems with NHS outsourcing, as this created ""captive markets ripe for price gouging"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UN gains 'unprecedented' N Korea access,"People are going hungry in North Korea, the head of the WFP said, but are not starving The head of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) believes there is a ""sense of optimism"" among North Korea's leaders after enjoying what he said was unprecedented access to the country. David Beasley spent two days in the capital, Pyongyang, and two outside it, accompanied by government minders. He said the country was working hard to meet nutritional standards, and hunger was not as high as in the 1990s. ""There is a sense of turning a new page in history,"" he told the BBC. Relations between North Korea and the rest of the world have seen a dramatic shift. Last year the North Korean government carried out a string of nuclear and missile tests. But next month, its leader Kim Jong-un will meet US President Donald Trump, in what would be the first time a sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. Confirmation of the meeting came after landmark talks between North and South Korea. Mr Trump announced the details of the meeting - in Singapore on 12 June - earlier this week, hours after he welcomed home three US detainees released from North Korea. Will historic summit lead to peace? The Koreas - the basics explained David Beasley visited North Korea from 8-11 May. The visit included trips to WFP-funded projects - a children's nursery in South Hwanghae province and a fortified biscuit factory in North Pyongyan province. He told the BBC's Radio 4 programme Today that the farming he saw in the countryside reflected the fact that only about a fifth of the land is arable. ""One of the most powerful things that I saw was out in the countryside - it's spring, they're planting - there's not mechanisation, you've got oxen pulling ploughs, men and women in the fields,"" he said. David Beasley visited WFP programmes in the North Korean countryside ""It's very structured, very organised, every foot and inch of dirt is being toiled with rakes and hoes and shovels and they're literally planting crops up to the edge of the road, down embankments, using every available space, because it is a land that's mostly mountainous. ""I didn't see starvation like you had in the famine back in the 1990s, that's the good news. But is there a hunger issue, is there under-nutrition? There's no question about it."" Between 1994 and 1998, hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have died in North Korea in a widespread famine. After drought last year, the UN said seven in 10 North Koreans were relying on food aid, while four in 10 were malnourished. Two in five N Koreans 'undernourished' UN sounds alarm over N Korea drought Last month the UN requested $111m in aid funding to help people in North Korea.The US has offered to help rebuild the country, on condition of denuclearisation.

WHSmith sells Â£7.99 hospital toothpaste,"The retailer said it had sold 89 tubes of toothpaste priced at Â£7.99 WHSmith has admitted it made more than Â£700 by selling single tubes of toothpaste for Â£7.99 in a hospital. The Pinderfields Hospital branch in Wakefield was caught selling Colgate, normally priced at Â£2.49, by a visitor. The retailer apologised for what it called a pricing error, and said proceeds from the sales would be donated to charity St George's Crypt. In 2015, WHSmith was accused of exploiting hospital customers after it was found charging less in other shops. The retailer said 89 tubes of toothpaste had been sold in the Pinderfields shop while they were priced at Â£7.99. WHSmith under fire for hospital prices WHSmith to cut hospital shop prices A spokeswoman said: ""We would like to apologise to our customers for a recent pricing error in our system relating to this product."" She added: ""The error has been rectified and changed to the correct price of Â£2.49."" Chloe Bond was admitted to Pindersfield Hospital in September last year after suffering stroke-like symptoms when stepping out of the shower. The 26-year-old was taken to hospital by ambulance at around 22:00 BST and remained there for three days while tests were carried out. She says she had no way of getting any toiletries, adding: ""I was dying to wash my hair and I could've killed for a toothbrush. ""The little store [WH Smiths] had the essentials but it was so overpriced - I probably would have had to spend about Â£40 just for personal hygiene. ""When my dad came to visit me I was like, 'it's terrible' - I wanted toiletries, a toothbrush, some clean underwear and I was on my period. I was just so uncomfortable."" Ms Bond describes toothbrushes being sold for around Â£5 or Â£6 and magazines and snacks being sold for multiple times the normal amount. In the end, the products had to be bought from a nearby Sainsbury's, where the total amount spent was about Â£10. This would have cost ""three or four times as much"" at the hospital shop, she says. ""I got to feel human for a lot less money."" Reacting to the story, BBC presenter and cancer blogger Rachael Bland described it as a""wider problem"".,externalShe said she paid Â£5.99 for painkillers while receiving treatment at the Christie in Manchester. Neil Wilson said it highlighted problems with NHS outsourcing, as this created ""captive markets ripe for price gouging"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ban on Berlusconi holding office lifted,"Silvio Berlusconi was sentenced to four years in prison for tax fraud in 2013 An Italian court has lifted a ban on former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi holding public office. He was barred in 2013 after receiving a four-year sentence for tax fraud, although he never spent time in prison. The court decision comes just days after the 81-year-old agreed to his right-wing ally, the League party, talking to the anti-establishment Five Star party about forming a government. If talks fail and a fresh election is called, Mr Berlusconi could now stand. Silvio Berlusconi: Italy's perpetual powerbroker Why Italy is still searching for a leader Italy election: What does the result mean? The court in Milan overturned the ban against the four-time prime minister and billionaire, which was due to remain in effect until 2019. His lawyers had taken his case to the European Court of Human Rights. Following his conviction in 2013, Mr Berlusconi's sentence was automatically reduced to 12 months. It was then commuted to community service because of his age. But his political influence has remained. Despite being officially barred from public office and expelled from the Italian Senate, he has continued to head the Forza Italia party, and his name appeared on ballot papers during Italy's 4 March general election. He has also proven to be a point of contention in talks between League and Five Star - both populist parties - to form a government, ahead of Sunday's deadline. Five Star had urged the League to end its links with Mr Berlusconi, whom it sees as a symbol of the corrupt political practises it rejects. Mr Berlusconi, on Wednesday, said he would not stand in the way of coalition between the two parties, although he said his Forza Italia party would not back a confidence motion of it in parliament.

NK to break up nuclear site in May ceremony,"A satellite image of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in North Korea North Korea says it will begin dismantling its nuclear test site in less than two weeks in a ceremony attended by foreign journalists. Pyongyang said it was taking ""technical measures"" to carry out the process between 23-25 May, North Korean state news agency KCNA reported on Saturday. Scientists previously said the site may have partially collapsed in September. The move is due to take place three weeks before US President Donald Trump meets North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. In April, South Korean officials said Mr Kim had stated he ""would carry out the closing of the nuclear test site in May"", adding that nuclear experts from South Korea and the US would be invited to watch. Their comments came after talks between Mr Kim and South Korea's President Moon Jae-in. However there was no mention of allowing foreign experts access to the site in Saturday's statement from North Korea. North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear test site UN gains 'unprecedented access' during visit North Korea crisis in 300 words The dismantling of the Punggye-ri site, the exact date of which will depend on weather conditions, will involve the collapsing of all tunnels using explosives and the removal of all observation facilities, research buildings and security posts. Journalists from South Korea, China, the US, the UK and Russia will be asked to attend to witness the event. North Korea said the intention was to allow ""not only the local press but also journalists of other countries to conduct on-the-spot coverage in order to show in a transparent manner the dismantlement of the northern nuclear test ground"". The reason officials gave for limiting the number of countries invited to send journalists was due to the ""small space of the test ground... located in the uninhabited deep mountain area"". Situated in mountainous terrain in the north-east, the Punggye-ri site is thought to be the North's main nuclear facility. Nuclear tests have taken place in a system of tunnels dug below Mount Mantap, near the Punggye-ri site. Six nuclear tests have been carried out there since 2006. After the most recent test, which took place in September 2017,a series of aftershocks hit the site, which seismologists believe collapsed part of the mountain's interior. Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to differ from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament. On a recent visit to North Korea, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stressed that any such claim would require a ""robust verification"" programme by the US and other nations. US offers to help rebuild N Korea if it denuclearises Timeline: North Korea nuclear stand-off North Korea has also reneged on a number of promises made in previous years. In 1994, then-US President Bill Clinton made plans to attack sites in North Korea based on intelligence that the state had begun shipping fuel rods that could be used to produce plutonium to its main nuclear facility, the Yongbyon complex. The threat of US strikes at the time, along with an offer from the Clinton administration to help boost the state's struggling economy, led to an agreement with the North Koreans. The US provided fuel to an energy-starved economy, and North Korea agreed to freeze its programme. But Pyongyang later breached the agreement and the deal fell apart in 2002. In 2007, Pyongyang announced that it had shut its Yongbyon reactoras part of a disarmament-for-aid deal. The following year it demolished the facility's cooling tower in a symbol of its commitment to ending its nuclear programme. Then, in 2013, North Korea said it would restart operations at the Yongbyon site - a move that was later confirmed by experts. Mr Trump and Mr Kim are due to meet in Singapore on 12 June. It will be the first time a sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. The key issue expected to be discussed is North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, over which the two leaders furiously sparred in 2017. The US wants Pyongyang to give up its weapons programme completely and irreversibly. Will historic summit lead to peace? The Koreas - the basics explained Confirmation of the meeting between the two men came after landmark talks between North and South Korea. Mr Trump announced the date and place of the summit earlier this week, hours after he welcomed home three US detainees released from North Korea. ""We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!"" he tweeted. There is a ""sense of optimism"" among North Korea's leaders, the head of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said on Saturday after enjoying what he said was unprecedented access to the country. David Beasley spent two days in the capital, Pyongyang, and two outside it, accompanied by government minders.

Corbyn must change Brexit stance - Kinnock,"Lord Kinnock (right) says objections to EEA membership are based on ""infantile leftist illusion"" Jeremy Corbyn will commit ""a serious evasion of duty"" if he does not change his stance on Brexit, former Labour leader Lord Kinnock has said. The peer told the Independent,externalthat Labour should endorse the UK staying in the European Economic Area (EEA) or risk ""sacrificing thousands"" of jobs. Staying in the EEA would mean the UK retained key aspects of the single market after leaving the EU. But Mr Corbyn has opposed this idea as the UK would not make the rules. A Labour spokesman said the party would not be commenting on Lord Kinnock's remarks. Lord Kinnock was one of the 83 Labour peers who defied the party leadership this week and voted for an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill in the House of Lords to keep the UK in the EEA. EEA membership would see the UK retain full access to the EU's internal market of 300 million consumers in return for making financial contributions and accepting most EU laws. Lords backs single market Brexit plan MPs urge free trade area after Brexit Johnson: No 10's customs plans 'crazy' Under what is known as the ""Norway model"", free movement laws would also apply - so EU citizens could move to all EEA countries to work and live. Norway is one of three countries outside the EU which is an existing EEA member. Supporters of the plan think keeping the maximum-possible access to the single market should be the top priority. However critics of the Norway model say it would mean the UK would still be subject to EU laws after Brexit, but with no say in how they are made. This video can not be played Can the House of Lords stop the Brexit Bill? Labour urged its peers to abstain in Tuesday's vote on EEA membership, but 83 of them defied the leadership and the amendment was backed by 245 votes to 218 in the House of Lords. The issue will now return to the Commons and Lord Kinnock said: ""It would be a serious evasion of duty if Labour did not seize this chance to protect our country from the rockslide of 'hard' Brexit."" ""Labour must make this challenge. ""By supporting continued EEA participation we can end the prime minister's deference to the cliff-edge kamikaze squad and force her, or her successor, into the pragmatic patriotism of putting country before party."" Please upgrade your browser Lord Kinnock defended his refusal to abstain in the EEA vote, as Mr Corbyn had wanted, saying: ""I do not break the whip lightly. ""In this case, not continuing in the EEA would mean endangering, sacrificing, thousands of skilled and decently-paid jobs and, with them, the life chances of countless families and communities."" He added that objections to EEA membership were based on ""infantile leftist illusion"". Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, said he agreed with Lord Kinnock's warning that leaving the single market would ""destroy"" jobs. ""By walking hand-in-hand with extreme Tory Brexiteers... Labour will be just as culpable for the catastrophic damage to the economy,"" he added. The government is expected to seek to reverse a number of the Lords amendments when the bill returns to the Commons.

Iraq votes in first poll since IS defeat,"This video can not be played Female Iraqi MP, Dr Hanan al-Fatlawi, says she's been threatened because of her work Iraqis have voted in the first parliamentary elections since the government declared victory over so-called Islamic State (IS) last year. Around 7,000 candidates from rival coalition alliances are vying for seats in the 329-member assembly. The results are scheduled to be officially announced on Monday. Despite improved security, Iraq is still struggling to rebuild itself after four years of war against IS, a BBC correspondent says. He says whoever wins will need to keep Iraq's fragile unity in the face of sectarian and separatist tensions. The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts Iraq country profile Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had called on ""all Iraqis"" to take part in the election. ""Today Iraq is powerful and unified after defeating terrorism, and this is a huge achievement for all Iraqis,"" he said after casting his vote. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi cast his vote in the capital Baghdad Iraqis voted for rival lists of candidates. Most are predominantly Shia or Sunni, though the Kurds have their own lists. The Shia-led government has won praise for the fight against IS militants, and security has vastly improved across the country. This video can not be played Many Iraqis have lost faith in their politicians But many Iraqis are disillusioned by widespread government corruption and a weak economy, the BBC's Martin Patience reports. There is also frustration at a perceived lack of change. One Baghdad resident said that he ""regretted"" voting in the 2014 elections because ""all the promises are lies"". Reuters reported that voter turnout in several polling stations in the capital appeared low, although the government partially lifted a curfew to encourage voting. Security around voting centres was tight. At least three people were killed in an attack near a polling station in the northern province of Kirkuk, according to local media. People turned out to vote in the city of Mosul, which was severely damaged in the fight against IS The vote came just days after US President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. Some Iraqis fear their country could once again become a casualty in any struggle between America and Iran, our correspondent adds. Iraq elections: Could Iran be the real winner?

Could Iran be the winner of Iraq's elections?,"After three years under IS, the traditional spring festival takes on a new meaning for Mosul and its rebirth The Mosul spring festival was held this week for the first time since 2003 - the year of the US-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. Organisers said they revived the festival to symbolise the rebirth of Iraq's second city. Much of it still lies in ruins after last year's war to destroy the jihadist extremists who called themselves Islamic State (IS), and the entity they declared as the caliphate. The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts Iraq country profile The spring festival looked to be a success. Art students painted a mural 50m (165ft) long on the road and floats represented everything from the historic al-Nuri mosque - destroyed by IS - to the local cement factory which is presumably now working at full stretch. Youths marched with Iraqi flags. Young girls took part dressed as brides while boys were dressed as soldiers. Following up were real fighters, veterans of the war against IS, from elite units of the Iraqi army to tough-looking Shia volunteers from the paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Units known as the Hashd. Mosul's children also took part in the celebrations - the first in 15 years They are mainly funded by Iran, and did a lot of the hard fighting against the jihadist extremists. This spring could be a season of rebirth, for Mosul and the whole of Iraq. Remnants of IS carry out hit-and-run attacks and bombings, but by the blood-soaked standards of this country, security is much improved. A lot rides on the elections, due to be held on 12 May. Whoever ends up as prime minister faces huge challenges, not just reconstruction, but holding the country together and taking big steps to stop Iraq descending back into sectarian civil war. Even amid the festivities, security remained tight For that to happen, the elections need to produce a government all groups in Iraq can trust. In a country that has seen so much sectarian killing, that is a tall order. Iraqis can vote for rival lists of candidates. Most are predominantly Shia or Sunni, though the Kurds have their own lists. The three most likely candidates for prime minister are all Shias. The current prime minister, Haidar al-Abadi, heads the Nasr list, which is tipped to get the most votes. But under the Iraqi system he will not be able to form a majority government, which means negotiations for a coalition that could go on for months. Most people believe that Mr Abadi's most serious rival for prime minister is the veteran paramilitary commander Hadi al-Amiri. He heads the Fatah list, which has become the political home of the Shia fighters of the Hashd and their supporters. Mr Amiri, and Fatah, believe that the Iraqi people will show their gratitude for the sacrifices that the Hashd made in the fight against IS. Iraqi flags are held aloft by marchers in the spring festival The third frontrunner is Nouri al-Maliki, the former prime minister.  He was forced out of office in 2014 after IS swept through Iraq, capturing Mosul and great swathes of predominantly Sunni territory. Mr Maliki's sectarian policies so alienated Sunnis that, at first, many welcomed the jihadists. The brutality of IS quickly changed minds, but by then the jihadists had declared their caliphate. Mr Maliki's past probably means he cannot be prime minister. But he is powerful and might want to be the kingmaker. A European diplomat said Mr Maliki was ""on manoeuvres"". This video can not be played IS have gone but fear and hatred remain in Iraq Iraq needs some good news after so many years of appalling suffering and this election, optimists say, could be a turning point. The bright scenario is that Haidar al-Abadi will win a second term and then work hard to bridge the divisions between Iraq's sects. Getting the economy right would help. But this is Iraq, full of weapons, grudges and resentments, so there are always risks. Sunnis I have spoken to are nervous about the Hashd fighters and their leader and candidate, Mr Amiri. He is very close to his fellow Shias in Iran, which for him is an entirely natural alliance. It also makes the Iranians, through their friends in the Hashd, the strongest foreign force in Iraq. This video can not be played Will Iran maintain its influence over Iraq? The Americans have troops here, too. After US President Donald Trump's decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal, there is obvious scope for trouble. Iraq is fragile after the battering it has had since the Americans and their allies invaded in 2003. If this election produces a result that most Iraqis can accept, and a government that most of them do not fear, this country has a chance to rebuild and to reconcile. But sadly, that is no certainty.

The Korean meeting explained,"Kim Jong-un has become the first North Korean leader to enter South Korea since the end of the 1953 Korean War. But why has it taken so long, where did the dispute between the two countries start, and why are there even two Korean countries - rather than the one it was before 1948? It's a long and complicated history that started with the end of World War Two. The aftermath of a US air raid over Pyongyang during the Korean War War broke out on the Korean peninsula in 1950 as a direct result of the Cold War taking place between the West and the Soviet Union. Japan ruled Korea (when it was just one country) from 1910 up until the end of the Second World War. The Soviet Union (USSR) saw an opportunity when Japan surrendered at the end of the war and entered Korea. The USSR and the US agreed to divide Korea in 1948, with the Soviets taking control of the north and the US the south. They would come to be known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). What was the Cold War? The USSR installed a communist dictatorship north of the border, giving power to the former guerrilla soldier Kim Il-sung (Kim Jong-un's grandfather) who ended up ruling until 1994. Democratic elections in the South led to Syngman Rhee becoming the country's first president. The USSR and US left Korea in 1949, and a year later Kim Il-sung attacked the South by surprise. His goal was a unified communist Korea. The strange history of North Korea's Communists North Korea had a bigger army, thanks to the USSR, and made it count at first. But US reinforcements arrived to help the South and, following a plea to the UN's Security Council, troops were also sent in from fourteen UN countries - including Australia, France and the UK. A stalemate led to an armistice being signed in 1953 after new US president Dwight Eisenhower threatened to use nuclear weapons to end the war, while the death of USSR leader Joseph Stalin in the same year also contributed. The armistice was intended to be a temporary truce, resulting in a ceasefire ""until a final peaceful settlement is achieved"". But the settlement still hasn't arrived - which is why the meeting between the two Korean leaders is so significant. Seoul is the capital of South Korea Daily life in South and North Korea couldn't be more different. The South, having been occupied by western forces, embraced a capitalist philosophy. It has developed into one of Asia's most affluent nations. A government-sponsored industrial push in the 1960s led to huge corporations like Samsung and Hyundai being created. Moon Jae-in: The son of refugees who became president The country 's culture is exported around the world. Its soap operas are popular in the likes of China and K-Pop hasbecome a phenomenon. Around 45 of the country's 48 million people are estimated to have high-speed wireless internet, and people have access to all the brands that are coveted in the west - and then some. Pyongyang is the capital of North Korea And what do they teach people in South Korea about the North? ""We have been taught that North Korea is a main enemy but our fellow country at the same time,"" says YouTuber Korean Billy. Life in North Korea is different, to say the least. This video can not be played Four defectors talk about what life is like in North Korea North Korea is a communist country, but capitalism iscreeping into the country. There are things to buy - but only for some people, those who have money. The majority of people in North Korea live in poverty. Citizens are told from a young age into believing the Supreme Leader is the be-all and end-all, as well as that countries like South Korea and America - and the west generally - are evil. Reality Check: How North Korea does business Economic pain pushes N Korea to talks In 2014 a UN panel accused North Korea of crimes against humanity, including systematic extermination, torture, rape, forced abortions and starvation. It recommended prosecution of the country's top leaders by the International Criminal Court. The UN report said there is an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, information and association, in the country. This video can not be played Was your T-shirt made in North Korea? Kim Il-sung in 1992 Kim Il-sung was North Korea's first and longest-serving leader, who introduced the philosophy of ""juche"" - self-reliance - to the country. He also created a cult of personality around himself through incessant propaganda, which allowed him to rule for 46 years without any real rivals. If there were real rivals,they were purged- a traditioncontinued by Kim Jong-unwhen he took over. Kim Il-sung promoted his son, Kim Jong-il, to senior roles within the Korean Workers' Party and the military in the 1980s, making it clear he would eventually take over. Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon Profile: Kim Jong-un Kim Il-sung was given the title of ""eternal president of the republic"" after his death in 1994, and is almost worshipped as a god in the country. The reigns being passed on to Kim Jong-il made North Korea the world's first hereditary communist state - and he continued the cult of personality. As an example of the type of information fed to the North Korean people, official propaganda says a double rainbow and a bright star marked Kim Jong-il's birth. This video can not be played The BBC's James Robbins reports on the life of North Korea's Kim Jong-il Under Kim Jong-il's leadership the economy worsened and the use of labour camps for political dissenters grew. He also ramped up the country's pursuit of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, something his son Kim Jong-un continued after his death in 2011. Kim Jong-un, the current leader, is the first leader to enter South Korea since the war. His approach to the South appears to have changed dramatically in recent months - which some people attribute to increased sanctions by the US and UN. Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? What missiles does North Korea have? Why has Kim Jong-un halted North Korean tests now? Does Trump deserve the credit for peace talks with North Korea? North Korea now claims it has mastered the design of nuclear weapons, and announced a ban on testing them this month. It comes ahead of a planned meeting with US President Donald Trump. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un Now he says that along with South Korean president Moon Jae-in, he will work to denuclearise the Korean peninsula. Details of how denuclearisation would be achieved were not made clear, and there are two main reasons why analysts are sceptical. The first issue for the North is the security guarantee extended by the US, a nuclear power, to South Korea and Japan. It has military presence in both countries. The second reason: similar agreements have been made between the Koreas in the past, but were later abandoned after the North resorted to nuclear and missile tests and the South elected more conservative presidents.

Will summit lead to peace?,"This video can not be played Welcoming Kim Jong-un with pomp and ritual Friday's dramatic meeting between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his North Korean counterpart, Chairman Kim Jong-un, represents an unambiguous historic breakthrough at least in terms of the image of bilateral reconciliation and the emotional uplift it has given to South Korea public opinion. Whether the agreement announced at the meeting - the new Panmunjeom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula - offers, in substance, the right mix of concrete measures to propel the two Koreas and the wider international community towards a lasting peace remains an open question. The symbolic impact of a North Korean leader setting foot for the first time on South Korean soil cannot be underestimated. Mr Kim's bold decision to stride confidently into nominally hostile territory reflects the young dictator's confidence and acute sense of political theatre and expertly executed timing. This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea His clever, seemingly spontaneous gesture to President Moon to reciprocate his step into the South by having him join him for an instance in stepping back into the North was an inspired way of asserting the equality of the two countries and their leaders. It also, by blurring the boundary between the two countries, hinted at the goal of unification that both Seoul and Pyongyang have long sought to realise. The rest of the day was full of visual firsts and a set of cleverly choreographed images of the two leaders chatting informally and intimately in the open air - deliberately advancing a powerful new narrative of the two Koreas as agents of their own destiny. Handshakes, broad smiles and bear hugs have amplified this message of Koreans determining their own future, in the process offsetting past memories of a peninsula all too often dominated by the self-interest of external great powers, whether China, Japan, or more recently, during the Cold War, the United States and the former Soviet Union. Historic summit as it happened Key moments from the meeting Read the Korean declaration in full,external Five conflicts that continued after they ended The two leaders' joint statements before the international media were another pitch perfect moment for Mr Kim to challenge the world's preconceptions. This video can not be played Kim Jong-un issues his pledge for peace with South Korea In an instance, Mr Kim's confident and relaxed announcement to the press dispelled the picture of a remote, rigid, autocratic leader in favour of a normal, humanised statesman, intent on working to advance the cause of peace and national reconciliation. A cynic might see this as both a simple propaganda victory for Mr Kim, and also his attempt to lock in place the nuclear and missile advances the North has already achieved by calling for ""phasedâ¦disarmament"" - by intentionally downplaying the expectation of immediate progress while emphasising the need for step-by-step negotiations. Why has Kim halted nuclear tests now? Profile: Kim Jong-un North Korea crisis in 300 words The joint declaration echoes the themes of past accords, including the previous Korean leaders summits of 2000 and 2007, and an earlier 1991 bilateral Reconciliation and Non-Aggression agreement. Plans to establish joint liaison missions, military dialogue and confidence building measures, economic co-operation, and the expansion of contact between the citizens of the two countries have featured in earlier agreements. However, Friday's declaration is more specific in its proposals, with the two countries pledging, for example, ""to cease all hostile acts against each other in every domain, including land, sea and airâ¦"" and providing a series of key dates for the early implementation by both sides of a raft of new confidence building measures. These include the cessation of ""all hostile acts"" near the demilitarised zone by 1 May, the start of bilateral military talks in May, joint participation by the two Koreas in the 2018 Asian Games, the re-establishment of family reunions by 15 August, and, perhaps most importantly of all, a return visit to the North by President Moon by as soon as the autumn of this year. Committing to early, albeit incremental, steps in the direction of peace, appears to be motivated by the Korean leaders' wish to foster an irresistible sense of momentum and urgency. The declaration also calls for future peace treaty talks involving the two Koreas, together with one or both of China and the US. The logic of binding external actors into a definite - but evolving - timetable for progress on key issues is that it lowers the risk of conflict on the peninsula - something both Koreas are keen to avoid and which they have long had reason to fear given the past bellicose language of a ""fire and fury"" Donald Trump. Playing for time is a viable option, given that President Moon is at the start of his five-year presidency - a marked contrast to the summits of 2000 and 2007, when the respective leaders of the South, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, were already well into their presidential terms. Mr Moon can count, therefore, on repeat meetings with Mr Kim, and the two men appear genuinely interested in sustaining their dialogue and making progress on the wide-ranging set of initiatives included in the declaration. Mr Kim's own statements at the summit have also been a vocal argument in favour of identity politics, given his stress on ""one nation, one language, one blood"", and his repeated rejection of any future conflict between the Koreas - two themes that will have played well with a South Korean public that traditionally is sympathetic to a narrative of self-confident, although not necessarily strident, nationalism. President Trump says he will continue to exert maximum pressure on North Korea For all of the stress on Koreans determining their common future, there is no escaping the decisive importance of the US. The much anticipated Trump-Kim summit in May or early June will be critical in testing the sincerity of the North's commitment to a peaceful settlement. Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to be very different from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament. Not only will the Trump-Kim summit be a way of measuring the gap between the US and North Korea on this issue; it will also be an important opportunity to gauge how far the US has developed its own strategy for narrowing the differences with the North. Korea summit sparks cold noodle craze Diplomacy on the menu: How food can shape politics President Moon has cleverly and repeatedly allowed Mr Trump to assume credit for the breakthrough in inter-Korean relations, recognising perhaps that boosting the US president's ego is the best way of minimising the risk of war and keeping Mr Trump engaged in dialogue with the North. Whatever the long-term, substantive outcome from the Panmunjeom summit, the event has memorably showcased the political astuteness, diplomatic agility and strategic vision of both Korean leaders. The dramatic events of Friday are a reminder that personality and leadership are key ingredients in effecting historical change, sometimes allowing relatively small powers to advance their interests in spite of the competing interests of larger, more influential states.

"Iraq votes in first poll since IS defeatSome 7,000 candidates from rival coalition blocs are vying for seats in the 329-member parliament.1h40 minutes agoMiddle East","This video can not be played Female Iraqi MP, Dr Hanan al-Fatlawi, says she's been threatened because of her work Iraqis have voted in the first parliamentary elections since the government declared victory over so-called Islamic State (IS) last year. Around 7,000 candidates from rival coalition alliances are vying for seats in the 329-member assembly. The results are scheduled to be officially announced on Monday. Despite improved security, Iraq is still struggling to rebuild itself after four years of war against IS, a BBC correspondent says. He says whoever wins will need to keep Iraq's fragile unity in the face of sectarian and separatist tensions. The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts Iraq country profile Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had called on ""all Iraqis"" to take part in the election. ""Today Iraq is powerful and unified after defeating terrorism, and this is a huge achievement for all Iraqis,"" he said after casting his vote. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi cast his vote in the capital Baghdad Iraqis voted for rival lists of candidates. Most are predominantly Shia or Sunni, though the Kurds have their own lists. The Shia-led government has won praise for the fight against IS militants, and security has vastly improved across the country. This video can not be played Many Iraqis have lost faith in their politicians But many Iraqis are disillusioned by widespread government corruption and a weak economy, the BBC's Martin Patience reports. There is also frustration at a perceived lack of change. One Baghdad resident said that he ""regretted"" voting in the 2014 elections because ""all the promises are lies"". Reuters reported that voter turnout in several polling stations in the capital appeared low, although the government partially lifted a curfew to encourage voting. Security around voting centres was tight. At least three people were killed in an attack near a polling station in the northern province of Kirkuk, according to local media. People turned out to vote in the city of Mosul, which was severely damaged in the fight against IS The vote came just days after US President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal.

Wage squeeze 'worst in modern history',"The UK's real wage squeeze will be the worst in modern history and the slowest for 200 years, according to union data. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) says wages have lagged behind inflation since 2008 and are worth Â£24 less in real terms than in 2008. It says they won't recover until 2025, by which time, it says, workers will have lost Â£18,500. The government said its policies had boosted pay for the lowest earners and ensured workers kept more of it. Next week official figures for employment and average earnings are due. They may show average wage rises have risen above inflation for the first time in a year. But that will not be enough to overturn the trend seen since the credit crisis. The TUC compared the current wages squeeze with every major earnings crisis over the past 200 years. It says this will be the biggest relative real wage loss since Lord Nelson's day and that even during the Great Depression era and the revival from the Second World War real wages recovered more quickly, in 10 years and seven years respectively. The TUC's report comes as thousands of workers plan to march through London for a new deal for working people. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady is planning to give a speech to the marchers, saying: ""UK workers are suffering the worst pay squeeze for two centuries. It's taking wages longer to recover from this crash than from the Great Depression and Second World War. ""This means families are struggling to get by. Millions of kids are growing up in poverty despite having parents in work. Mums and dads are skipping meals and turning to dodgy lenders to make ends meet. ""That's why tens of thousands are marching today for a new deal for working people. We need great jobs in every region and nation of the UK, and higher wages for all workers, not just the bosses."" However a Treasury spokesperson said wages are forecast to grow faster than inflation in each of the next five years and government policies were helping British workers. ""Our National Living Wage has boosted pay for the lowest earners by over Â£2,000 already, we are cutting taxes to help people keep more of what they earn, and we are making sure people have the skills they need to secure high-quality, well-paid jobs by investing in technical education and boosting apprenticeships,"" they said. The TUC says its figures are based on annual average weekly earnings for total pay (including bonuses) adjusted with the CPI measure of inflation, which are then compared with long-run back data published by the Bank of England. The forward looking ones are based on the OBR forecast to 2022, and then a projection to 2025 using the average forecast growth rate for the 2018-22 period.

Student mental health 'failing a generation',"This video can not be played Henry Curtis-Williams, 21, took his own life in 2016 British universities say they risk ""failing a generation"" unless students get better mental health care. A Universities UK report found some students risked ""slipping through the gaps,external"" due to a lack of co-ordination between the NHS and universities. The most up-to-date statistics show 146 students killed themselves in 2016. At Bristol, three students have died suddenly in the past month alone. An NHS official said local services should collaborate with universities. Henry Curtis-Williams, a photography student, took his own life in 2016, aged 21. ""He had lost weight, he had dark shadows under his eyes, he was clearly in crisis,"" said his mother Pippa Travis-Williams. ""He changed from being that super-confident person to [becoming] just a shell of a person."" The number of deaths in 2016 was higher than the 134 students who killed themselves in 2015 - which in turn was the highest total since 2006. Universities UK said that over the past five years, 94% of universities had seen a ""sharp increase"" in the number of people trying to access support services. Some institutions noticed a three-fold increase. 'The wounds heal but you still have scars' The sisters tackling male suicide 'My brother was killed by depression' The report said data on students was rarely shared fully between universities and local health services, which could lead to students accessing ""treatment and support with incomplete information, or not accessing it at all"". The report added students leaving their family homes to attend university often enrolled with a new GP. They would then return home during holidays, meaning they were without their bespoke GP care for several weeks or months. Universities and local NHS services should communicate more about students who may need mental health services Local services and universities should assess the need for mental health services for students in specific towns and cities Institutions should promote positive mental health, make reasonable adjustments for students with pre-existing conditions, and reduce the stigma of mental health Create ""student mental health teams"" with NHS providers to improve referrals to specialist services Universities UK's head of mental health, Professor Steve West, said the system had to be ""radically changed"". ""If we ignore it we will have failed a generation,"" he added. ""We will be setting ourselves up for huge costs and burdens on the NHS, but more than that we will be destroying lives."" Chief executive of Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust Paul Jenkins said: ""We need to improve the links between local NHS services and the support that universities provide. ""It is essential that these young people are provided with the right support at each step of the pathway."" The National Union of Students (NUS) said that mental health services in higher education were ""strained"" and ""at times non-existent"". It welcomed the report, adding: ""A joined-up and coherent approach between the NHS and universities is exactly what students need."" By Hugh Pym, health editor Some of the issues highlighted at universities are linked to the state of child and adolescent mental health services. Young people who may have struggled to get treatment from these NHS services may find that problems resurface when they get to university. Alternatively, the transition to adult mental health provision at 18 will coincide with the start of student life away from home - and that can be disorientating. Universities have been criticised for not investing enough in counselling services and not promoting more general well-being in student life.

Review: Childish Gambino's This is America âââââ,"In his opening monologue as host of last week's Saturday Night Live Donald Glover described himself as ""an actor, a writer, and a singer"". And so he is. But he forgot to mention the fourth string to his gleaming bow of talents, the one that makes him more than just an entertainer. Donald Glover - or Childish Gambino as he calls himself when performing as a pop-rap-trap musician - is an artist. That is, a fine artist, as in a person whose work might be exhibited in an art gallery or bought by a museum. In fact, if the curators at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, or indeed the Metropolitan Museum up the road, are at all switched on, they should already be in discussions with him about acquiring the master video of This Is America for their institution's collection. Why? Because it is a powerful and poignant allegorical portrait of 21st Century America, which warrants a place among the canonical depictions of the USA from Grant Wood's American Gothic to Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, from Emanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware to America the Beautiful by Norman Lewis. I should say at this point, for those of you who have been busy collecting rock samples on the Moon during the past seven days, This Is America is a song by Donald Glover/Childish Gambino, which he posted on the internet last Saturday night along with a video directed by Hiro Murai, with whom he collaborates on his comically surreal TV series Atlanta. I should also point out it contains explicit violence, which is inappropriate for children and possibly unpalatable for some adults. Its subject of race, representation, opportunity and acts of extreme violence against African Americans is shared with the work of several other leading contemporary black American artists. Great America, 1994 by Kerry James Marshall There's Kerry James Marshall's 1994 painting, Great America, for instance. Or, perhaps more obviously, Arthur Jafa's seven-minute video Love is the Message, the Message is Death from 2016, in which the artist has cut together a montage of archive footage that includes photographs of civil rights leaders and footage of the LA riots. Kanye West's gospel-cum-hip-hop Ultralight Beam acts as the backing track. This Is America has already been watched by a gazillion people, commented on by almost as many, and deconstructed for meaning by media far and wide, from the Sun newspaper to the New Yorker. It consists of a series of linked tableaus set in and around a vast whitewashed warehouse-type garage space (a nod, perhaps, to Michael Jackson's 1987 Bad video directed by Martin Scorsese, which itself is a nod to the ""Cool"" scene in the 1961 version of West Side Story). The interior is empty except for a solitary red chair on which there is an acoustic guitar. A bald man with a beard walks towards the chair, picks up the guitar, sits down on the chair and starts to play. The camera moves around him to reveal another man standing with his back to us. He is wearing trousers but no shirt. He jerks his neck in time to the electro-beats. He turns and starts to move his body in rhythmic but exaggerated gestures (choreography by Sherrie Silver). He walks towards the seated man who now has a hood over his head. The shirtless dancer takes a gun from behind his back, strikes a pose (read by many to be mimicking the fictional Jim Crow) and shoots the man from point blank range. Now the tune changes, it's darker, heavier. A boy rushes towards the bare-chested assailant (Childish Gambino), who places his gun carefully on a piece of red cloth held by the young lad who quickly exits stage right. Gambino turns to the camera and sings ""This is America"". We're only 40-seconds in but already have enough symbolism and metaphor to provide a semester's worth of content for discussion on a cultural studies degree course. Like any decent work of art, the more you look the more you see. There's the obvious stuff, such as how a culture obsessed with consuming sugary entertainment is wilfully ignorant to what's really going on (Gambino sings to, and dances with, a group of school children while in the background a Hieronymus Bosch-like world of murder and mayhem goes unseen or unacknowledged). Colour is clearly a major theme. All the performers are black. The space in which the action takes place is largely white. Red is deployed with a Faustian twist. At first it appears to be a colour of artistic expression: the guitarist sits on a red chair to play his music. But is then murdered. A choir sings joyfully against a red wall that echoes their red collars. Until, that is, Gambino machine-guns them down. By the time we see him dancing on top of a red car we know his end is nigh. You can fill your boots with pop-culture references or enjoy the more oblique art-historical asides (the R&B singer SZA poses like the Statue of Liberty, which in turn is based on EugÃ¨ne Delacroix's 1830 pro-revolution painting Liberty Leading the People). This Is America is not perfect, and certainly won't be to everyone's taste. For some it will be too ambiguous, too violent, and quite possibly seen as hypocritical. There is certainly an element of Jeff Koons' slippery superficiality at play. And it is grotesque. But so is the bloody violence of Goya's The Executions. Because it had to be. Both pieces speak of man's inhumanity to man. The only real difference is the time and place.

Taser use rethink in face of gang knives,"This video can not be played South Wales Police Chief Constable Matt Jukes shows some of the knives recovered by his officers All frontline police officers in south Wales could be armed with Tasers to face the increasing threat of gangs carrying knives. Chief Constable Matt Jukes said while stabbings were rare, officers in the force were being assaulted daily and only 10% carry the stun equipment. He said he wanted people to ""think twice"" before assaulting officers. But human rights groups said Tasers could kill and should not be used to ""terrify people into compliance"". Most of the attacks faced by officers related to punching, kicking, biting and spitting, but Mr Jukes said the threat of weapons was growing due to a ""resurgence"" of gang culture. Samurai swords, hunting and combat knives are increasingly being found in stop and searches and drug raids across south Wales, with evidence suggesting groups linked to county lines - dealing drugs from one town to another - are likely to be carrying weapons. Mr Jukes said some young people were telling officers they were carrying knives for protection. In April, a review of Taser use in the force was sparked after officers found a large hunting-style knife when called to deal with agroup of teenagers armed with hammers in the Llanrumney area of Cardiff. The changes could see anything up to 100 percent of frontline police officers in south Wales armed with Tasers. Chief Constable Matt Jukes said he wanted people to ""think twice"" before assaulting officers. Knife crime in UK cities 'turning people into monsters' 'Smiling' South Wales Police 'don't use spit hoods' Hunting knife find sparks South Wales Police review Police officer who had eyes gouged welcomes new law ""You can only imagine the harm that can be done with these kinds of weapons,"" Mr Jukes said. In September an officer was stabbed in Cardiff with a triple-bladed knife, causing a 4-5cm wound to his shoulder.The dealer was jailed for 11 years. While the majority of assaults happen during arrests and are fuelled by drink, drugs or mental health issues, Mr Jukes said other people were just ""plain nasty"" and made a habit of biting, kicking and spitting at officers. This knife folds up to look more like a credit card which can be hidden away In a seven-day period 18 officers were attacked across south Wales. One officer in Ely, Cardiff was bitten on the calf while trying to arrest a woman. Two officers were attacked - one punched in the face, breaking her glasses, and the other bitten - while trying to restrain a man in the Rhondda Valley. The officers said it was the ""most scared they had been"" while on duty. This video can not be played Bodycam footage captured the moment when a man having a ""psychotic episode"" tried to stab a police officer with two kitchen knives Last year the force brought in the use of controversial spit guards - which can be placed on suspects' heads to stop them spitting at officers. Mr Jukes defended their use saying: ""I want officers to have the protection they deserve...because coming home from work, knowing you've been exposed to infectious disease is a deeply troubling thing"". He said he did not think giving more officers with Tasers would lead to an increase in their use - but instead give officers confidence to use their presence to help de-escalate violent situations. The use of spit hoods and Tasers on young people could not be ruled out, but would be taken very seriously by all officers, he said. ""What we will see is many more people thinking twice about assaulting officers, assaulting other people, putting themselves and the public at risk,"" he said. Corey Stoughton, advocacy director for human right's group Liberty, said: ""Tasers can and do kill - which is why they were initially intended for firearms officers only. ""There have been far too many examples of disturbing and inappropriate use, with BAME people and those with mental health conditions most affected. ""The use of Tasers on our streets has grown rapidly, but regulation remains woeful. Forces should be focusing on robust training and much tighter regulation - not rolling these lethal weapons out in the hope they terrify people into compliance."" This knife used by a dealer to stab an officer in Cardiff was described by a judge as ""one of the most vicious weapons"" ever seen in the capital Children aged 11 caught with knives Dealer jailed for stabbing police officer Man jailed for knife attack on PC Hunting knife find sparks police review Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

British tourists kidnapped in DR Congo,"The national park is known for its mountain gorillas Two British tourists are among three people to have been kidnapped in a national park in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The director of the Virunga National Park - known for its endangered mountain gorillas - said their vehicle was ambushed by gunmen who killed a park ranger and also seized the driver. The incident took place just north of the city of Goma, North Kivu province. The Foreign Office said it was supporting the families. It also said it was in close contact with the DRC authorities. Local media reports say the ranger shot dead was a female guard, while the UK citizens were taken along with their Congolese driver. Park director Emmanuel de Merode told the AFP news agency: ""I confirm that our vehicle was attacked. Three people were kidnapped, including two tourists."" The BBC's Louise Dewast, reporting from the country's capital Kinshasa, said the situation was ""very serious"". She said there were armed groups operating in the park and there had been kidnappings before, with half of these involving a ransom. The kidnapping took place in a military area and the national army was ""most likely"" responding to the situation, our correspondent added. The national park, which runs along the border with Uganda and Rwanda, covers 3,000 sq miles (7,800 sq km). It is a Unesco world heritage site and is home to critically-endangered mountain gorillas as well as lions, elephants and hippos. In April, Mr de Merode,told the BBC World Servicethat recent attacks were part of ""a bigger picture which involves the trafficking of natural resources"". He said the park was protected by around 800 rangers but there were also estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 militia in and around the park. There have been a number of killings and kidnappings in recent years. Five rangers and a driver were killed in the park on 9 April. A week earlier, a park ranger died in an attack by armed men as he guarded the construction site of a hydroelectric plant. BBC Africa editor Will Ross said poachers were active in the park, which was also under threat due to the illegal felling of trees to make charcoal and plans for oil exploration. Wildlife authorities have tried to protect it but 170 rangers have been killed over the last 20 years, he added. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against all but essential travel to Goma and has urged Britons not to go beyond the city. Theadvice, which was last updated two days ago,,externalsays tourists are vulnerable if travelling without escorted transport in the eastern part of the country, and the ""risk of kidnap or injury as a result of armed or criminal activity remains high"". It said that UK government staff were not always in the area and the British embassy's ability to offer consular assistance could be ""severely limited"".

Berlusconi ban on holding office lifted,"Silvio Berlusconi was sentenced to four years in prison for tax fraud in 2013 An Italian court has lifted a ban on former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi holding public office. He was barred in 2013 after receiving a four-year sentence for tax fraud, although he never spent time in prison. The court decision comes just days after the 81-year-old agreed to his right-wing ally, the League party, talking to the anti-establishment Five Star party about forming a government. If talks fail and a fresh election is called, Mr Berlusconi could now stand. Silvio Berlusconi: Italy's perpetual powerbroker Why Italy is still searching for a leader Italy election: What does the result mean? The court in Milan overturned the ban against the four-time prime minister and billionaire, which was due to remain in effect until 2019. His lawyers had taken his case to the European Court of Human Rights. Following his conviction in 2013, Mr Berlusconi's sentence was automatically reduced to 12 months. It was then commuted to community service because of his age. But his political influence has remained. Despite being officially barred from public office and expelled from the Italian Senate, he has continued to head the Forza Italia party, and his name appeared on ballot papers during Italy's 4 March general election. He has also proven to be a point of contention in talks between League and Five Star - both populist parties - to form a government, ahead of Sunday's deadline. Five Star had urged the League to end its links with Mr Berlusconi, whom it sees as a symbol of the corrupt political practises it rejects. Mr Berlusconi, on Wednesday, said he would not stand in the way of coalition between the two parties, although he said his Forza Italia party would not back a confidence motion of it in parliament.

Ex-PM Najib banned from leaving Malaysia,"Najib Razak and his wife Rosmah Mansor had planned to go on an overseas holiday Ex-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been banned from leaving the country, immigration officials say. It comes after Mr Najib said that he and his wife were planning to go on an overseas holiday on Saturday. Earlier this week, Mr Najib's long-ruling Barisan Nasional coalition suffered a shock electoral defeat. Mr Najib has been accused of diverting $700m (Â£517m) from a state investment fund in 2015, but has since been cleared by the authorities. However Malaysia's new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who at 92 became the world's oldest elected leader when he was sworn in on Thursday, has said that Mr Najib could face a fresh investigation if sufficient evidence supports it. Mr Mahathir has said that investigations will take place into alleged corruption in the country, including the case involving the state investment fund. What just happened? 'The biggest mistake in my life' Mahathir: 'There are two types of age' Mahathir Mohamad said he believed Malaysia ""can get most of the 1MDB money back"" Mr Mahathir stood down as prime minister 15 years ago, but came out of retirement and defected to the opposition to take on and beat former protÃ©gÃ© Najib Razak. He appears to be making good on a promise, made during his election, to release imprisoned former political leader Anwar Ibrahim. Who is Anwar Ibrahim? Mr Anwar's daughter, Nurul Izzah, on Saturday confirmed reports that her father will ""receive a full royal pardon"" and is due to be released on Tuesday. Mr Anwar was once Mr Mahathir's deputy, but was jailed on widely-criticised charges of sodomy and corruption amid bitter tensions between the two men. In a tweet (in Malay),,externalhe said he had been informed by the immigration authorities that he and his family would not be allowed to travel abroad. He gave no reasons for the authorities' decision, but said he would abide by it. He has also announced he is quitting as chairman of the Barisan Nasional coalition and as president of his United Malay National Organisation party. Mr Najib, 64, had said earlier that he and his wife Rosmah Mansor would go on a holiday on Saturday. It is believed they intended to fly to Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. Mr Najib had faced accusations of corruption and mismanagement over the state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). The scandal has gripped the country for years. 1MDB, set up by Mr Najib in 2009, was meant to turn Kuala Lumpur into a financial hub and boost the economy through strategic investments. But it started to attract negative attention in early 2015 after it missed payments for some of the $11bn it owed to banks and bondholders. Then the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported it had seen a paper trail that allegedly traced close to $700m from the fund to Mr Najib's personal bank accounts. Mr Najib has consistently denied taking money from 1MDB or any public funds. After being sworn in as new prime minister, Mr Mahathir said he would seek the return of millions of dollars lost in the scandal. 1MDB: The case that's riveting Malaysia 1MDB: The United States v The Wolf of Wall Street US looks to seize $540m in 'stolen' assets from Malaysia fund 1MDB Malaysia's election: A battle of old allies What does politics mean to multi-racial Malaysians?

Family 'stunned' by Australia shooting,"Katrina Miles lived on the property with her parents and four children Relatives of the family at the centre of a suspected murder-suicide in Western Australia say they are ""stunned"" by what has happened. The unnamed relatives of the Miles family said they were ""still trying to understand how this could happen"". Katrina Miles, her four children, and her parents Peter and Cynda Miles were all found shot dead at their property in Osmington, near Margaret River. Police confirmed they believe the killer to be among the dead. Police Commissioner Chris Dawson said they received a phone call from a man at the property alerting them to the shootings early on Friday morning. ""I wish to strongly emphasise that police do not believe any other person is involved in these crimes. Police are not searching for any other suspects,"" he told reporters. He said three firearms found on the property belonged to Peter Miles, 61. Relatives of those involved, in a statement issued through the police, asked ""that the community refrain from speculating on the circumstances around this tragic incident"". This video can not be played The bodies of four children and three adults were found Commissioner Dawson said the body of a woman was found in the house on the rural property, while the bodies of a woman and four children were found in a nearby converted shed where Ms Miles lived with her children. A seventh person was found dead outside. Local media report that Katrina Miles was aged 35, and had four children aged between 13 and eight. The children's father had been notified of the killings and was ""understandably grieving"", Commissioner Dawson said. Cynda Miles, 58, and her family were said to have been active members of their tiny rural community of Osmington, which is about 20km from Margaret River, a popular tourist and wine-growing area. Memorials have been posted on Katrina and Cynda's Facebook profiles. Cynda Miles was well known in her community One neighbour, Felicity Haynes, described them as ""lovely people"".,external ""They were a very socially-aware family - doing their best to create a safe community - and that is why it is so shocking to think that could be destroyed so quickly,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Pamela Townshend, president of the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River, told Fairfax Media: ""It's sending shockwaves through the whole community - we're all linked in one way or another, every family."" This is Australia's worst mass shooting since a massacre in Port Arthur, Tasmania, claimed the lives of 35 people in 1996. That incident led to comprehensive reform of the nation's gun laws, which included a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons. Would Australia's gun laws help the US?

Foreign worker charge 'tears families apart',"Foreign nurses who work in the NHS and their families should not be charged to receive healthcare, union leaders say. The Royal College of Nursing said the Â£200 overseas health surcharge, which is paid per family member for every year on the main sponsor's work permit, was tearing families apart. The charge was introduced in 2015 for non-EU migrants to boost NHS funding. The Home Office said the charge allowed access to comprehensive services at a lower cost than other countries. Non-EEA nationals must pay the surcharge, but the RCN said this has resulted in some overseas nurses receiving requests for more than Â£3,000 to cover the possible use of the NHS. The surcharge is due to increase to Â£400 later this year. There have been suggestions that after Brexit it will be applied to EU nationals too. Evaline Omondi says she had to send two of her children back to Kenya because of the charge Kenyan nurse Evaline Omondi, who works for the NHS in Luton, said she was landed with a bill of Â£3,600 to cover a three-year period for two adults and four children. The charge forced her to take her two youngest children, aged six and eight, out of school and send them back to Kenya. She said it was an ""awful moment"". ""We could not meet the cost and my children had to move back to Kenya,"" she said. ""A family who came together is now in pieces, scattered all over the place. ""I try to speak to them on the phone before they sleep but it is hard with the time difference and my work so sometimes I don't get to talk to them."" She is due to address delegates next week at the RCN's annual conference in Belfast, where the issue will be debated. The RCN said there were 25,000 nurses from outside the EU working for the NHS. RCN general secretary Janet Davies said it was ""shameful that families are being torn apart by this policy"". ""We are proud as a profession to have the best and brightest from over 200 countries around the world,"" she said. ""But the government now seems hell-bent on showing that they're no longer welcome."" The Home Office said the surcharge had an important role to play, generating income that goes directly to the NHS. ""The government fully recognises the contribution that international professionals make to the UK and to our health service,"" a spokesman added.

What's Ryan Reynolds got against Eurovision?,"Ryan Reynolds has a bone to pick with the Eurovision Song Contest - if Australia can compete, why can't Canada? Canadians are feeling a serious case of Fomo (fear of missing out) as millions of people around the world tune into the Eurovision Song Contest. The immensely popular international singing competition features contestants from 43 countries - but not Canada. Despite producing plenty of international pop stars -  Bryan Adams, Shawn Mendes and Celine Dion - the country has never been invited to compete. Now if there is one thing Canadians truly hate, it is getting left out of things. Just try bringing up the UN's National Security Council at a dinner party and watch your Canadian friend turn as red as the maple leaf flag. Getting left out of Eurovision while Australia - Australia! - is allowed to perform is an insult too great to bear. The oversight was even mentioned by Canada's official ambassador of handsomeness, Ryan Reynolds, who tweeted a video featuring his character Deadpool warning Europe that it had ""awakened a sleeping moose"".

The Eurovision Song Contest is a global television phenomenon  - about 180 million viewers tuned in last year. More are expected to watch this year's final. But the show is more than just a singing contest, says BBC journalist and the founder of Eurovision news site Wiwibloggs, William Lee Adams- it's an exercise in nation-building. ""This has the nationalism of the United Nations with the fervour of the Olympic Games and the glitter and sequins of a beauty pageant,"" he says. That means that contestants are judged not only on their singing ability and the spectacle of their performance, but on the message behind their music. ""You can't separate politics and performance, because it's inherently political,"" he says. Deadpool and Celine Dion slay on social media The Scot who came second to Celine Dion The pop star helping Cyprus become favourite to win The talent show stars taking on Eurovision The political undertones of the contest occasionally take centre stage, as they did in 2016-2017 during the conflict over the Russian annexation of Crimea. In 2016, Ukraine caused a stir with its fiercely political entry, called 1944. The song performed by Crimean singer Jamala was ostensibly about the expulsion of the Tartars from Crimea by Joseph Stalin, but many read it as an allegory for Ukraine's present-day conflict with Russia. The song went on to win the contest. The next year, Russia withdrew from the competition after its singer, Julia Samoylova, was told she could not enter Ukraine, which as the previous year's winner, was hosting the ceremony. Samoylova was barred from the country because she had illegally entered Crimea to perform a concert, and many interpreted Russia's decision to make her their singer as a political statement. This video can not be played Singer Jessica Mauboy explains why Australia competes in Eurovision There are a number of explanations for why Canada does not compete in Eurovision. One reason could be because it is not an active member of the European Broadcasting Union, which organises the competition and creates the rules. Until 2015, participants had to be active members of the broadcasting union, which includes Europe and several countries in northern Africa and the Middle East. But in 2015, the EBU made an exception by inviting Australia to compete. So why not Canada too? Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Like Australia, Canada is a member of the Commonwealth with a large European diaspora. But those ties to Europe are likely to be overshadowed by its relationship with its southern neighbour, Adams says. ""I think Canada is often seen as an extension of the United States,"" he says. Another possible reason why Canada wasn't invited is simple - perhaps Canada just isn't interested. Australians areobsessedwith Eurovision, and it has been broadcast there for decades. About 500,000 Australians tuned in last year to watch the final. ""Australia is geographically isolated and they really love to participate in international events to kind of feel that connection to their roots,"" Adams says. In Canada the contest was only broadcast on television twice, in 2014 and 2015, on a speciality channel. This video can not be played Netta Barzilai, whose song Toy has racked up millions of views on YouTube, is representing Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest But perhaps the real reason Canada wasn't invited, Canadian conspiracy theorists like to muse, is because Europe is afraid of being outshone by a bunch of hockey-loving, beer-drinking ""hosers"". With rising Canadian pop stars like Shawn Mendes and Alessia Cara getting international airplay, it's easy to imagine Canada winning the final. Adams says dislike of outsiders has hurt Australia in the past. Winners' scores are based both on the input from judges, who are part of the music industry, as well as the general public. While Australia has typically scored well with judges, the public is not as keen. ""There's a bias against Australia,"" he says. ""Canada would be confronted with the same issue."" Just because Canada hasn't had a national entry does not mean it has sat on the sidelines. Canadian singers have entered the competition five times through the years for other countries, including one glorious win. In 1988, Celine Dion - then unknown outside Canada  - represented Switzerland at Eurovision and won the whole contest with her song Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi. The EBU was in talks with Canada and the US to create a spin-off of the contest for North America in the mid-2000s, but the idea was eventually scrapped. Will watching its Commonwealth cousin Australia compete inspire Canadians to demand a seat at the table? If yes, Europe better watch out.

Asylum seekers 'wrongly' banned from study,"Afterthe government was forced to apologisefor declaring some of the so-called Windrush generation illegal immigrants, the Home Office is now reviewing the cases of asylum seekers affected by another aspect of its so-called ""hostile environment"" policy, who may have been inappropriately banned from studying. Ibrahim - not his real name - received a letter four weeks ago from the Home Office telling him he was banned from further study. It arrived two weeks before he was due to sit his English language exams. As a 19-year-old asylum seeker from North Africa living in a foreign country and speaking a new language, he says his English classes - he was studying English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) - had become a lifeline. ""Sometimes I cry. I even thought I would kill myselfâ¦ this is one way I can make my life better but now they closed that one way"", says Ibrahim, who came to England three years ago because he faced threats in his own country. Reality Check: Has the 'hostile environment' worked? He is one of more than 50 asylum seekers Newsnight has been told about who may have had inappropriate study restrictions imposed upon them. It is the result ofrule changes introduced in January,externalafter the introduction of the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policy. ""I've certainly heard of getting on for 100 cases,"" says Adam Hundt, a solicitor with Deighton Pierce Glynn. ""I think it's quite clear that this will be affecting thousands of people."" Since the beginning of the year, asylum seekers who used to be classified as having been granted temporary admissionhave been placed on ""immigration bail"".,external The change was introduced as part of the Immigration Act 2016 and it affects migrants lawfully in the UK but without leave to remain, like asylum seekers. The government said it was only intended to be used on a case-by-case basis when proportionate - for example, when they want to know the whereabouts of an asylum seeker, they could specify a particular institution where they could study. During the passage of the legislation, the government gave assurances that it did not intend to impose a blanket ban on asylum seekers accessing education. But campaigners and immigration lawyers say that appears to have been what has happened. This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? ""We see about 50 asylum seekers a week on average at our advice drop-in and everybody that has come with a bail form has the restriction on study,"" says Becky Hellewell, a case worker with the charity St Augustine's Centre in Halifax. Home Office staff are not the only group to have interpreted the guidance in this way. The University of Leicester wrote to asylum seekers on its roll to update them that they were not permitted to use immigration bail conditions to study there. But that should only have been the case if there was a restriction to study on their bail form - they should not have been prevented because they were on immigration bail. A statement from the university said: ""All email communications on this matter are in accordance with government guidance provided to all universities. ""We change and update our communications in accordance with guidance from the government."" The consequences for asylum seekers caught breaching these conditions can be severe. They are liable to prosecution and could be subject to a fine and/or six months in prison. Earlier this week, the Home Office minister Baroness Williams clarified in the House of Lords that the new immigration provisions were not designed to prevent asylum seekers from studying. ""The Home Office is proactively looking to identify cases where this has been applied inappropriately and will apply a new bail notice to the individual,"" she told peers. This clarification came too late for Ibrahim. He had to take the Home Office to court in order to have his study ban lifted just a day before his exams. He has now been issued with a new bail notice removing his study restriction. ""I think what we've seen with the implementation of immigration bail provisions is that it's different depending on what area you are in,"" says Kamena Dorling of the charity Coram, which works with vulnerable children and young people. ""It's not being applied in accordance with the guidance, nor is it being applied consistently."" The guidance that immigration officials were using has now been updated to say ""anyone who claims asylum should not have a study condition applied to themâ¦ If there is any doubt over whether study should be restricted, no study condition should be applied"". The Home Office told Newsnight the study restrictions on immigration bail are not part of its ""compliant environment"" policy - the phrasepreferred by the new Home Secretary Sajid Javid instead of ""hostile environment"". A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Immigration bail is a valuable tool which enables individuals who are liable to be detained to remain in the community, subject to certain conditions. ""The provisions are not designed to be used to prevent asylum seekers studying and we are proactively looking to identify cases where this may have happened so that we can correct it. ""We have also updated our guidance for staff so that they are absolutely clear when to apply restrictions and we are putting in place new safeguards, so that when the restriction is applied, it has to be approved by a senior officer. These steps will make sure such an issue does not arise in the future."" Reality Check: Has the 'hostile environment' worked?

Hawking service open to time travellers,"Prof Stephen Hawking's life will be celebrated at a service in June Organisers of Prof Stephen Hawking's memorial service have seemingly left the door open for time travellers to attend. Those wishing to honour the theoretical physicist, who died in March aged 76, canapply via a public ballot. Applicants need to give their birth date - which can be any day up to 31 December 2038. Prof Hawking's foundation said the possibility of time travel had not been disproven and could not be excluded. It was London travel bloggerIanVisits,externalwho noticed that those born from 2019 to 2038 were theoretically permitted to attend the service at Westminster Abbey. He said: ""Professor Hawking once threw a party for time travellers, to see if any would turn up if he posted the invite after the party. ""None did, but it seems perfect that the memorial website allows people born in the future to attend the service. ""Look out for time travellers at the Abbey."" In 2009 Discovery Channel filmed the professor waiting for time travellers who never turned up to his party After the ""time traveller party"", held in June 2009, Prof Hawking remarked that the fact that no-one turned up was ""experimental evidence that time travel is not possible"". Within 24 hours of the opening of the ballot for the thanksgiving service, to be held on 15 June,about 12,000 people from more than 50 countries had applied for tickets. While all applicants appear to be from the present day, a spokesman for the Stephen Hawking Foundation said: ""We cannot exclude the possibility of time travel as it has not been disproven to our satisfaction. ""All things are possible until proven otherwise. ""But so far we have had applications from all round the world, and we do mean round - there are no flat-Earthers here."" People from as far away as the US, China, Bolivia and the South Pacific have asked to attend the event to celebrate the life of Prof Hawking, who died on 14 March, more than 50 years after he was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease. Thousands lined the streets of his home city of Cambridge for hisfuneral on 31 March. The ballot for tickets to his memorial service closes at midnight on 15 May.

Student suicide increase warning,"The suicide rate among UK students is higher than among the general population of their age group, claim researchers. The study, to be presented next month at the International Suicide Prevention Conference in New Zealand, has analysed figures for student suicides between 2007 and 2016. But the Office for National Statistics cautions that ""year-to-year differences could reflect change in the population of students across time as opposed to change in the risk of suicide"". There has been much concern about mental health worries on university campuses - but it has often been argued that suicide rates for students have been lower than the general population. University reveals suicide attempt call-outs Universities struggle with rising mental health problems Advice and contact information from the Samaritans,external But the Hong Kong-based researchers say there no longer seems to be this ""protective effect against suicide"". Male students have consistently had higher suicide rates, but the research says there has been a particular increase among female students. Dr Raymond Kwok, of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention, at Hong Kong University, said, ""between 2012 and 2016, there is a significant trend in rising suicides for UK female students, with the exception of those in Scotland"". Researchers say that between 2007 and 2016, student suicide rates increased by 56% - from 6.6 to 10.3 per 100,000 of the population. The 2016 figures showed 146 student suicides, the highest in records going back to 2001. Between 2001 and 2007, there had been a pattern of falling numbers, but since then numbers have tended to rise. These figures also do not specify the type of ""student"", whether at university or some other form of study. But the Office for National Statistics said that this data ""cannot be used to ascertain the risk of suicide among students"". The ONS says it is currently working on developing ""a robust method for understanding the risk of suicide among certain kinds of students"". ""Concerns about students' mental health have been increasing since the economic recession, but until now there has been no comprehensive analysis of UK student suicide data,"" said Edward Pinkney, who has tracked student suicide data and co-authored the analysis. ""This is the first time we can conclusively say that as far as suicide is concerned, there is a real problem in higher education,"" he said. There have been warnings about anxiety and mental health worries among university students. A report published in autumn showed the numbers ofstudents disclosing mental health problems had increased fivefold in a decade. The analysis - from the Institute of Public Policy Research - showed higher rates of problems among female students. Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham and a campaigner on student well-being, said: ""Student suicide rates and emotional distress levels could be reduced at university if we acted differently. ""More support in transitions, better tutoring and early warning, more peer to peer support, an enhanced sense of belonging, would all enhance wellbeing and reduce risk. ""We are obsessed by reactive policy once students hit the bottom of the waterfall; we need to be putting preventative policies in place to prevent them ever tipping over the edge,"" said Sir Anthony.

'Sharp rise' in student mental illness,"The current generation of students is under increased pressure, the report suggests Almost five times as many students as 10 years ago have disclosed a mental health condition to their university, say researchers. In 2015-16, more than 15,000 UK-based first-year students disclosed mental health issues, Institute of Public Policy Research analysis suggests. The 2006 figure was about 3,000 and the rise risks overwhelming university services, the IPPR says. Universities UK said student mental health was ""a strategic priority"". UUK says anew framework,external, published on Monday, will boost the mental health and wellbeing of students and staff and help embed good mental health across all university activities. TheIPPR study,externalanalyses figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, which show a larger rise in disclosure of mental health conditions among female students. Until 2009-10, the rate of male and female students reporting mental health issues was about the same, at about 0.5%. By 2015, however, it had risen to 2.5% of female students and 1.4% of male students. ""So while male students are three times more likely to disclose a mental health condition than they were 10 years ago, female students are five times more likely,"" says the report. The researchers also suggest that ""due to an imperfection in the way data is collected, the actual number of mental health disclosures is likely to be higher than described in this report"". The report notes that official statistics show student suicides rose sharply between 2007 and 2015 - from 75 to 134. And separate figures show a record 1,180 students with mental health problems dropped out of university in 2015, a rise of 210% on five years earlier. ""The extent of support is currently too varied, and many university services are overwhelmed by the level of demand,"" said IPPR senior research fellow Craig Thorley. An IPPR survey of UK higher education providers received 58 responses: 94% experienced a rise in demand for counselling services in the past five years 61% reported a rise in demand of more than 25% 29% had an explicit strategy on student mental health and wellbeing At some universities one in four students is using or waiting to use counselling services, and some report dramatic increases: at Leeds University, the report says, there has been a 50% increase in demand during the past five years, with an 18% rise in the past 12 months alone the University of Birmingham estimated a 5-6% annual increase in demand throughout the past 10 years and the University of Dundee reported an increase in demand of about 70% over eight years Higher education leaders plan to embed good mental health across all university activities The authors suggest the current generation of undergraduates could be under greater pressure than previous generations because of increased study costs and an increasingly competitive jobs market, with more students determined to gain top degrees. They also suggest that with a greater proportion of 18-year-olds going to university than in the past, students more closely reflect the population of young adults as a whole in terms of mental health - and there has been a steady growth in mental illness in young adults during the past 25 years. The report's recommendations include: universities should spend more money on student mental health services better national data on which interventions most improve student mental health better access for students to local NHS services Prof Steve West, vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England, who chairs UUK's working group on mental health in higher education, said its new framework was ""a step change"" in university support for students' mental wellbeing.

Europe strives to keep Iran deal alive,"Iranians have been demonstrating against the US decision A flurry of diplomatic activity is under way to rescue the Iran nuclear deal after President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the US from it and bring back sanctions against Tehran. German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke with President Putin of Russia, and UK PM Theresa May has talked to Mr Trump. French ministers have been loudest in their complaints that major European businesses will be hit hard as US sanctions are re-imposed. Mr Trump says the deal is ""horrible"". Among his concerns are that restrictions on Iran's nuclear programme are due to expire and the deal does not address Iran's ballistic missile programme or its regional influence. On Tuesday Mr Trump honoured an election pledge to scrap US participation in the 2015 accord. Sanctions will be re-imposed in two stages in August and November. Under the agreement Iran undertook to curb nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions. The deal, negotiated by the US, three European Union powers, Russia and China, was designed to prevent Iran developing atomic weapons - something it has always denied trying to do. The agreement is still seen by the non-US signatories as the best way of preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power, though they concede it is not perfect. The Europeans also stand to lose billions of dollars of business when US sanctions return. This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? A deal by the European plane-manufacturer, Airbus, to sell nearly 100 planes to Iran is now in danger. Some parts used in the planes are made in the US. Is Iran's Supreme Leader trolling Trump?

But both Mr Le Maire and his German opposite number, Olaf Scholz, are also speaking to US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to seek exemptions for European companies. Mrs May spoke on the phone to Mr Trump to tell him that Europe remained ""firmly committed"" to the deal, according to Downing Street.

Foreign patient charge 'tears apart families',"Foreign nurses who work in the NHS and their families should not be charged to receive healthcare, union leaders say. The Royal College of Nursing said the Â£200 overseas health surcharge, which is paid per family member for every year on the main sponsor's work permit, was tearing families apart. The charge was introduced in 2015 for non-EU migrants to boost NHS funding. The Home Office said the charge allowed access to comprehensive services at a lower cost than other countries. Non-EEA nationals must pay the surcharge, but the RCN said this has resulted in some overseas nurses receiving requests for more than Â£3,000 to cover the possible use of the NHS. The surcharge is due to increase to Â£400 later this year. There have been suggestions that after Brexit it will be applied to EU nationals too. Evaline Omondi says she had to send two of her children back to Kenya because of the charge Kenyan nurse Evaline Omondi, who works for the NHS in Luton, said she was landed with a bill of Â£3,600 to cover a three-year period for two adults and four children. The charge forced her to take her two youngest children, aged six and eight, out of school and send them back to Kenya. She said it was an ""awful moment"". ""We could not meet the cost and my children had to move back to Kenya,"" she said. ""A family who came together is now in pieces, scattered all over the place. ""I try to speak to them on the phone before they sleep but it is hard with the time difference and my work so sometimes I don't get to talk to them."" She is due to address delegates next week at the RCN's annual conference in Belfast, where the issue will be debated. The RCN said there were 25,000 nurses from outside the EU working for the NHS. RCN general secretary Janet Davies said it was ""shameful that families are being torn apart by this policy"". ""We are proud as a profession to have the best and brightest from over 200 countries around the world,"" she said. ""But the government now seems hell-bent on showing that they're no longer welcome."" The Home Office said the surcharge had an important role to play, generating income that goes directly to the NHS. ""The government fully recognises the contribution that international professionals make to the UK and to our health service,"" a spokesman added.

Your six pros and cons of renting a home,"Renting a room or a home from a private landlord is a reality for millions of people in the UK - but is it a positive or negative experience? We asked you, via the BBC NewsAffordable Living UK Facebook group,external, alongside survey information from flatshare website Spareroom.com. What emerged was a picture of uncertainty from tenants about their landlords' long-term plans, but also a feeling of freedom should they need to move for a new job or for somewhere better. Here are some of the responses. One of the biggest positives for many tenants was the ability to give relatively short notice, then move to a new home. ""I get to live independently and have the ability to move with more ease,"" says one tenant. At a time when many young people are on short-term contracts or work on a freelance basis, such nimbleness can be vital for employment. ""I am still settling into a career in academia,"" says one post. ""Until I know where I am going to end up, renting is best. It is good to know that when I am moving to a new area, I am not making a massive commitment."" The boiler breaks down or the roof leaks and all that is required is a call to the landlord. Among the many expressing relief is one who says: ""You don't have to think about house insurance and massive maintenance costs, although this does assume the landlords are doing their job."" Another says that, as a tenant, you do not have responsibility for the ""big issues"". Tenants' tales - in five charts Number of middle-aged renters doubles Nearly a third of those asked in a survey of more than 13,000 flat sharers by Spareroom.com said that they chose to live with others as it was more sociable. A number of people say that renting a room is a good way of meeting new people in a new area, or simply to help find their way around. ""It is useful to get to know a new area or country,"" says one. The vast majority (83%) of respondents in the Spareroom survey said that they rented in a house-share for financial reasons. Yet, the costs involved in renting are a regular gripe. ""You're paying someone else's mortgage"" is a common refrain. Rent levels are a worry for many, particularly those in more expensive areas of the country. Reality Check: Are we spending more money on rent? Fees. which many see as unreasonable, are facing acrackdown from the government, similar to a ban already in place in Scotland. That cannot come soon enough, according to many tenants. ""I pay a fee to renew every six months. I have no idea what that covers,"" says one. There is concern about the number of landlords who fail to ensure that the property is maintained properly. The general view is that some bad landlords has given the sector a bad name. Deposits are controversial. Some argue that a landlord expects too much, potentially withholding deposits for general wear and tear, or old things being thrown out. ""I can't wait for the day when I don't have to argue about why a three-and-a-half-year-old tin of paint the landlord left in my kitchen cupboard is no longer there,"" says one tenant. Tenant rights: Can a landlord kick me out? Others worry that not every landlord is putting deposits into ring-fenced account. Across the UK, landlords must put deposits into a government-backedtenancy deposit protection scheme,external. Different schemes operate in different parts of the country. Nearly half of those asked in the Spareroom survey said that being in control of when they move home is a key attraction of buying. While renting does offer flexibility, one of the big fears among tenants is being told by their landlord that they will have to move. One tenant sums it up by saying there is ""constant uncertainty of [landlords] wanting to sell and therefore having to find somewhere else to live"". This has been tackled, to an extent, in Scotland wherenew rulesrequire longer notice periods and other measures designed to increase security. Tenants' tales - in five charts Number of middle-aged renters doubles Can a landlord kick me out? Renting in retirement: Is it feasible? Where can I afford to live?
