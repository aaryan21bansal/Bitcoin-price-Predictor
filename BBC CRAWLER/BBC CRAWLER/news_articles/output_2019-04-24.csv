Kim and Putin set for summit meetingThe North Korean leader will meet Vladimir Putin for the first time on an island in Russia's far east.Asia,"This video can not be played Putin and Kim toast at the summit in Vladivostok Russian President Vladimir Putin has said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un needs international security guarantees if he is to end his nuclear programme. Such guarantees would need to be offered within a multinational framework, he added, following talks near Vladivostok in Russia's far east. Mr Kim praised the summit as a ""very meaningful one-on-one exchange"". Mr Putin said North Korea's leader was ""fairly open"" and had ""talked freely on all issues that were on the agenda"". The meeting followed the breakdown of talks between the US and North Korea in February, when Mr Kim met US President Donald Trump in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. Those talks reportedly stalled over North Korea's demand for full economic sanctions relief in return for some denuclearisation commitments - a deal the US was not willing to make. What to expect from Putin-Kim meeting The secret world of Russia's North Korean workers What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Speaking after the talks on Thursday, Mr Putin said he wanted to see full denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. But he said this could only be achieved through respect for international law. ""We need to restore the power of international law, to return to a state where international law, not the law of the strongest, determines the situation in the world,"" he said. Russky Island lies just off the mainland Mr Kim greeted Russian officials warmly when he arrived in Russia on Wednesday. The North Korean leader was entertained by a brass band in Vladivostok before he got inside a car flanked by bodyguards, who - in now familiar scenes - jogged alongside the vehicle as it departed. According to the Russian presidential spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin believes the six-party talks on North Korea, which are currently stalled, are the only efficient way of addressing the issue of nuclear weapons on the peninsula. This video can not be played Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un meet in Vladivostok Those talks, which began in 2003, involve the two Koreas as well as China, Japan, Russia and the US. ""There are no other efficient international mechanisms at the moment,"" Mr Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. ""But, on the other hand, efforts are being made by other countries. Here all efforts merit support as long as they really aim at de-nuclearisation and resolving the problem of the two Koreas."" This visit is being widely viewed as an opportunity for North Korea to show it has powerful allies following the breakdown of the talks with the US. The country has blamed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the collapse of the Hanoi summit. Earlier this monthNorth Korea demanded that Mr Pompeo be removed from nuclear talks, accusing him of ""talking nonsense"" and asking for someone ""more careful"" to replace him. The summit is also an opportunity for Pyongyang to show that its economic future does not depend solely on the US, and for Russia to show that it is an important player on the Korean peninsula. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea President Putin has been eager to meet the North Korean leader for quite some time. Yet amid the two Trump-Kim summits, the Kremlin has been somewhat sidelined. Russia, like the US and China, is uncomfortable with North Korea being a nuclear state. By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Vladivostok This summit was held right in the middle of a college campus, but no classes were cancelled. The students clearly weren't expected to stage protests. Small groups gathered to watch and film on their phones instead as first Vladimir Putin - some 35 minutes late - and then Kim Jong-un - even later - swept up the sports hall in their limousines. A sniper was poised on the roof; plain-clothed security officers dotted all around. Inside, though, the tone of this first meeting was deliberately positive: the red carpet rolled out, then big smiles, firm handshakes and warm words. It was a show of support by Russia meant to tell Donald Trump that his tactics of pressuring and threatening Pyongyang are mistaken. There was no joint statement or road map at the end of it all. But instead of collapse - like in Hanoi - this meeting ended in a champagne reception with the two leaders and their delegations serenaded by a Cossack choir as they tucked into beetroot soup and reindeer dumplings. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union (of which Russia is the main successor state) maintained close military and trade links with its communist ally, North Korea, for ideological and strategic reasons. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, trade links with post-communist Russia shrank and North Korea leaned towards China as its main ally. Under President Putin, Russia recovered economically and in 2014 he wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt in a major goodwill gesture. While it is arguable how much leverage Russia has with the North today, the communist state still regards it as one of the least hostile foreign powers.

Facebook sets aside $3bn for privacy probe,"Facebook has said it will set aside $3bn (Â£2.3bn) to cover the potential costs of an investigation by US authorities into its privacy practices. While it has provided for a heavy toll from the investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission, the final cost could be $5bn, it said. The social media giant also said total sales for the first three months of the year leapt 26% to $15.08bn, narrowly beating market expectations. Monthly users rose 8%, it said. That rise takes the number of users to 2.38 billion. ""We had a good quarter and our business and community continued to grow,"" founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said. ""We are focused on building out our privacy-focused vision for the future of social networking, and working collaboratively to address important issues around the internet."" The shares are up by nearly 40% in the year to date, far outperforming the broader market, and were up nearly 5% in late trading on Wall Street. Facebook is facing a probe over the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, however no findings have yet been published. Facebook was labelled ""morally bankrupt pathological liars"" by New Zealand's privacy commissioner this month after hosting a livestream of the Christchurch attacks that left 50 dead. In an interview after the attacks, Mr Zuckerberg refused to commit to any changes to the platform's live technology, including a time delay on livestreams. Facebook, which owns Instagram, last week admitted that millions more Instagram users were affected by a security lapse than it had previously disclosed. It had mistakenly stored the passwords of hundreds of millions of users without encryption.

London climate demo 'to end on Thursday'Extinction Rebellion members will have been protesting in London for a total of 10 days.,"This video can not be played Police have cleared the final Extinction Rebellion road block at Marble Arch A climate protest that has disrupted parts of London for nine days is to end on Thursday, organisers say. Police cleared Extinction Rebellion's final road block in Marble Arch earlier and arrested 22 people, bringing the total to 1,088 since protests began. Specialist equipment has been deployed in Parliament Square to remove protesters camping in trees. Makeshift camps at Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge were removed earlier in the week. One protester told the BBC: ""This is our last stand."" Organisers said a closing ceremony would be held at 18:00 BST on Thursday at Speaker's Corner, Hyde Park. ""We will leave the physical locations but a space for truth-telling has been opened up in the world,"" they said in a statement. ""We know we have disrupted your lives. We do not do this lightly. We only do this because this is an emergency."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he welcomed the decision to cease the protests, which had been a ""huge challenge for our over-stretched and under-resourced Metropolitan Police"". Protesters at Parliament Square have been camped in trees for nearly a week, organisers said So far 69 people have been charged in connection with the protest, the Met Police said. Police have extended restrictions at the Marble Arch site, preventing protesters congregating on the road, until Saturday afternoon. A senior Scotland Yard officer has warned that officers will require new powers to deal with demonstrations on a similar scale in the future. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Climate protesters 'making a difference' Who is Greta Thunberg? Giving evidence to the parliamentary Human Rights Committee, Commander Adrian Usher, head of the Metropolitan Police's protection command, said it should not be enough for a protest to be ""peaceful"" to be considered lawful. ""We will conduct a sober review of our tactics against recent protests, but I think it is likely to say the legislation associated with policing protest is quite dated and that policing and protest has moved on and that legislation should follow suit,"" he said. A protester climbed a lamp post an unfurled a banner at Marble Arch Police chiefs have called for greater powers to clear peaceful protests on the scale of Extinction Rebellion Earlier, Extinction Rebellion Youth handed a letter addressed to MPs, to Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott. In response, Ms Abbott said MPs needed to come together to host a ""broad conversation"" on bringing the country's greenhouse gas emissions down. Campaignershave issued three core demands to the government: to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. In a letter to MPs Extinction Rebellion Youth said: ""We are asking you to hear the science, to feel the public's change of heart and to act now to save our futures"" Elliott Cuciurean, 20, believed to be the first climate activist successfully prosecuted over the fresh wave of protests, was spared a fine at a court hearing on Tuesday. More actions are expected in the future.

Tory MPs rule out early challenge to May,"Senior Tories have ruled out changing their rules to allow an early challenge to Theresa May's leadership, but have asked for more clarity about how long she will remain in office. Under current rules, MPs cannot hold a new confidence vote in her leadership until December - 12 months on from last year's vote which she won. The 1922 Committee rejected bringing forward this deadline at a meeting. But chair Graham Brady said MPs asked for a ""clear roadmap"" about her future. And amid signs of a growing grassroots revolt against Mrs May, the Clwyd South Conservative Associationhas passed a motion of no confidence in the prime minister. Calls for progress in Brexit deal talks PM to face grassroots no-confidence vote Are Tory members 'taking back control'? In a ballot of its members, only 3.7% supported Mrs May, while 88.8% said they had no confidence in her. Last month, Mrs May pledged to stand down if and when Parliament ratified her Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some long-standing Leave campaigners want her to announce a date now, irrespective of whether a Brexit deal is completed. Joint executive secretary of the 1922 Nigel Evans was among them, insisting on Tuesday that the calls for her to quit had become ""a clamour"". Following a meeting of all Tory MPs, Sir Graham said colleagues concerned about Mrs May's leadership were free to express their concerns to him, which would be ""communicated"" to Downing Street. In light of the PM's commitment to stand down if Parliament approved a Brexit deal, he said MPs were seeking ""similar clarity from her"" about what would happen ""in other circumstances"". ""I think the 1922 executive is asking on behalf of the Conservative Party in Parliament that we should have a clear road map forward,"" he told the BBC. ""We haven't set out a timetable, we asked her to set out a clear timetable, just to give some certainty and clarity to colleagues in Parliament and the wider Conservative Party and to the country most importantly."" Sir Graham said MPs were not giving the prime minister an ultimatum Former minister Robert Halfon said it would have been ""entirely wrong"" to have staged another vote right now given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. ""The rules are the rules,"" he told BBC News. ""We are the Conservative Party, not a Stalinist Party, where you suddenly rip up the rule book and change them if you don't like them."" ""It would have been behaving like a dictatorship, not the Conservative Party."" Speaking before Wednesday's meeting, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had given a commitment to stand down ""earlier than she would have liked"" and would not lead negotiations on the UK's future relations with the EU. But he said this did ""not necessarily mean"" she would quit straight away if Brexit happened on 31 October, the new deadline set by the EU for the UK's exit. The party's most senior backbenchers met twice behind closed doors but were split on whether to change its leadership rules. Sources suggest there was a slim majority in favour of the status quo. But while Conservative MPs decided not to change the rules, grandee Sir Graham Brady said they wanted more clarity from the PM on when she would stand down. Some MPs are keen that the PM signals a willingness to go soon after next month's unwanted European elections. So this could be a coup postponed - not a coup averted. Mrs May survived a vote of no confidence in her on 12 December 2018 by 200 to 117 votes. The ballot was triggered after 48 Tory MPs wrote to the 1922 committee's chair Sir Graham Brady to say they had lost faith in her, exceeding the threshold required. Some of those who wanted to change the Conservative rules argued another vote of confidence should be permitted after six months, rather than a year, if a relatively high number of MPs - 30% or 40% - call for it. But other members of 1922 Committee, who started discussing the issue on Tuesday, were sceptical of long-term rule changes to address a very specific circumstance. They were also worried about showing further party divisions ahead of local elections next week and the potential European elections on 23 May.

Opera singer with transplanted lungs dies,"Charity Tilleman-Dick performed on stages across the world Charity ""Sunshine"" Tillemann-Dick, a venerated American opera singer who survived two double lung transplants, has died at age 35. Tillemann-Dick was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension in 2004, forcing her to undergo two emergency lung transplants needed to save her life. Despite her illness Tillemann-Dick pursued a renowned career, performing her soprano work across the world. Her family announced her death on her Facebook page on Wednesday. ""This morning, life's curtain closed on one of its consummate heroines,"" the post said. ""Our beloved Charity passed peacefully with her husband, mother, and siblings at her side and sunshine on her face."" A cause of death was not immediately clear. Tillemann-Dick lived in Baltimore, Maryland with her husband Yonatan Doron. She performed across the US, Europe and Asia. Her opera roles included Titania in A Midsummer's Night Dream, Gilda in Rigoletto and Violetta in La Traviata. The singer took the stage at storied theatres worldwide, including the Rose Theater at Lincoln Center in New York, the John F Kennedy Center in Washington DC and the Palace of the Arts in Budapest. Tillemann-Dick on vacation in Argentina with her husband Tillmann-Dick was raised in Denver, Colorado, growing up in a Mormon-Jewish family alongside her 10 siblings. Though she loved to sing from an early age, cherishing family trips to the symphony and opera, Tillemann-Dick initially thought she might pursue a career in politics. She would be following in the footsteps of her grandfather, Tom Lantos, a Holocaust survivor who served as a Democrat in the House of Representatives for almost 30 years, and an older brother, Tomicah Tillemann, who worked as a speech writer for Hillary Clinton. ""That's kind of our family trade I suppose,"" Tillemann-Dick said of politics in an interview with BBC World Service in 2013. But after graduating from college and spending time on a few political campaigns, she made the choice to return to music. Soprano Who Had Two Lung Transplants Genes found for deadly heart condition Obituary: Andrea Levy ""I decided I could never forgive myself if I didn't try my hand at music"", she told the BBC. Tillemann-Dick began an intensive training programme at the renowned Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, Hungary. At age 20 she was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, a rare disease marked by extreme pressure on the heart with no apparent cause. The condition had caused Tillemann-Dick's heart to swell three and a half times beyond its normal size. The diagnosis provided an explanation for her recent fainting spells and shortness of breath, and carried a life expectancy of two to five years. Tillemann-Dick had said that one of her doctors told her she should stop singing for her condition. Hoping to avoid a lung transplant, Tillemann-Dick was prescribed Flolan, a liquid medication delivered directly to the heart through a tube in her chest. Tillemann-Dick lived with her husband in Baltimore The pump, along with the necessary ice packs and auxiliary equipment, weighed about 4lbs (2kg), Tillemann-Dick told the BBC. Not wanting to draw attention to her condition as she continued to audition and perform, Tillemann-Dick said she would strap her medication to her thigh. ""Sopranos are unpredictable enough, without critical illness,"" she said, In 2009, five years after the initial diagnosis, Tillemann-Dick received her first double lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Though the transplant was life-saving, Tilleman-Dick said she was very concerned about the surgery, particularly its impact on her voice. ""I had spent a lifetime training my body and my lungs and my voice to work in sync and I knew I would lose all of that,"" she told the BBC. The brutal surgery put Tillemann-Dick in a coma for over a month, unable to breathe on her own for almost two months. Eating, walking and talking came next before Tillemann-Dick finally tried to sing again. The first song she tried, she said, was Smile - made famous by Nat King Cole. The average lung transplant lasts for about five years, but Tillemann-Dick's body began to reject the transplanted organs just months after surgery. As she awaited another donor match, doctors told her family that Tillemann-Dick was unlikely to survive,according to the Washington Post,external. But as she waited, Tillemann-Dick continued to sing. In 2011, still without functioning lungs, she debuted at Lincoln Center's Rose Theater. As she sang, Tilleman-Dick had an oxygen tank and wheelchair waiting in the wings. ""I could barely breathe but I could still sing"", she told the BBC. ""It was a miracle."" In January 2012, she underwent her second double-lung transplant, from a middle-aged Honduran American woman. Tillemann-Dick became close friends with her donor's daughter, Esperanza Tufani. Tillemann-Dick's debut album, American Grace, reached number one on the traditional classical charts on Billboard upon release Apparently undeterred by her illness, Tillemann-Dick continued to pursue her career, singing with a new pair of lungs. Her debut album, American Grace, reached no 1 on Billboard's traditional classical charts upon its release in 2014. Tillemann-Dick's dedication to music was perhaps matched by her advocacy work. She was a national spokeswoman for the Pulmonary Hypertension Association, working to raise awareness, increase federal research funding and promote preventative medicine. Tillemann-Dick also shared her inspiring story with audiences across the US, including at numerous TED Talks. ""It was so many miracles that paved this most unexpected of paths"", she said to the BBC. In 2015, Tillemann-Dick was confronted with another health problem. She was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive skin cancer, thought to be a result of the anti-rejection drugs she had taken for her lungs. Treatment required chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, including a particular procedure that required cutting a nerve on her face, affecting muscle movement on the right side of her mouth, theWashington Post reported,external. ""Life is full of death. Music, full of sorrow"", Tillemann-Dick wrote in her 2017 book, The Encore: A Memoir in Three Acts. ""Great artists have always amplified both.""

Sturgeon wants independence vote by 2021,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says a second independence referendum will need a transfer of power from Westminster Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the country is taken out of the EU. The first minister told Holyrood that she would introduce legislation soon to set the rules for another vote. But she indicated that she would need the agreement of the UK government before actually holding a referendum. Downing Street has previously said it will not grant a new Section 30 order, which underpinned the 2014 referendum. Ms Sturgeon claimed this position was ""unsustainable"" and challenged her party to increase support and demand for independence. But the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""As we have been repeatedly clear, Scotland has already had an independence referendum in 2014 and voted decisively to remain in the United Kingdom. This should be respected. Our position hasn't changed."" Will there be indyref2 before May 2021? UK government 'will say no indyref2' What is the SNP's Brexit policy? Ms Sturgeon has faced calls from some within the SNP - which will hold its conference at the weekend - and the wider independence movement to hold a referendum sooner rather than later. She told MSPs that to ""rush into an immediate decision before a Brexit path has been determined would not allow for an informed choice to be made"" about the future. However, the first minister added: ""If we are to safeguard Scotland's interests, we cannot wait indefinitely. ""That is why I consider that a choice between Brexit and a future for Scotland as an independent European nation should be offered in the lifetime of this parliament. ""I can confirm that the Scottish government will act to ensure that the option of giving people a choice on independence later in this term of parliament is progressed."" The next Scottish Parliament election is due to be held in May 2021. This video can not be played Brexit versus Scottish independence Ms Sturgeon believes she has a mandate to hold a second independence referendum as a result of the SNP's victory in the 2016 Holyrood elections - with the party's manifesto stating a vote should take place if there was a ""material change of circumstances"" such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will. The first minister said she hoped a ""framework Bill"" - legislation paving the way for a referendum - will be in place by the end of this year. She said: ""We do not need a transfer of power such as a Section 30 order to pass such a framework Bill, though we would need it to put beyond doubt or challenge our ability to apply the bill to an independence referendum."" The first minister insisted: ""If we are successful in further growing the support and the demand for independence, then no UK government will be able to stop the will of the people or stop that will being expressed."" The SNP conference will be held at the weekend - with Ms Sturgeon due to speak on Sunday The first minister extended an invitation to other parties, including those opposed to independence, to come forward for their own proposals for Scotland's constitutional future. She said: ""The immediate opportunity we now have is to help stop Brexit for the whole UK - and we should seize that opportunity. But if that cannot be achieved, dealing with the consequences of Brexit and facing up to its challenges will be unavoidable. ""I believe that the case for independence is stronger than ever. I will make that case, but I know others take a different view. ""So, as we take the necessary legislative steps over the next few months, I will also seek to open up space for us to come together and find areas of agreement as mature politicians should."" But she predicted that if the only alternative presented by opposition politicians was a ""failed and damaging status quo"", then ""the process of change will pass them by and support for independence will grow"". Analysis by Sarah Smith, Scotland editor Nicola Sturgeon knows that the Westminster government will almost certainly refuse to allow another referendum within the next two years - so she needs to find a way to keep the constitutional argument alive while there is little prospect of an imminent vote. The SNP know that by proposing another referendum they will be accused by those who do not support independence of introducing a divisive political issue at the worst possible time. So the first minister is challenging other parties who do not support Scottish independence to come forward with their own ideas for constitutional change, promising that the SNP will engage fully and in good faith. Ms Sturgeon is very deliberately talking of trying to find compromise and consensus amongst politicians - saying Scotland can do things differently from Westminster. It is an appeal that is clearly meant to reach beyond other party leaders and straight to voters who may not welcome independence, but might well appreciate the approach the first minister is proposing. The first minister also announced plans to establish a Citizens Assembly to consider Scotland's future, which she said had been done in Ireland to ""help find consensus on issues where people have sharply divided opinions"". She said this would bring together a representative cross-section of Scotland with an independent chair, and be tasked with considering: What kind of country are we seeking to build? How can we best overcome the challenges we face, including those arising from Brexit? What further work should be carried out to give people the detail they need to make informed choices about the future of the country? Scotland rejected independence by 55% to 45% in the 2014 referendum - with opinion polls suggesting support for independence remains largely unchanged five years later. Ms Sturgeon initially called for a second referendum after the Brexit vote in 2016, butput her plans on holdafter the SNP lost 21 seats in the general election the following year. Downing Street says the prime minister is still of the view that there should not be another independence referendum Speaking after Ms Sturgeon's statement, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said people in Scotland had ""voted decisively in 2014 to remain part of the UK, on a promise that the referendum would settle the issue for a generation"". He added: ""Instead of respecting that result, Nicola Sturgeon continues to press for divisive constitutional change when it is clear that most people in Scotland do not want another independence referendum. The UK government will stand up for them. ""Nicola Sturgeon needs to listen to the views of the Scottish people and concentrate on improving Scotland's economy and schools, not continually trying to orchestrate upheaval and division."" Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's statement to MSPs Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard accused Ms Sturgeon of ""using her office as first minister to put the interests of the SNP before the interests of our country"". He said: ""Her statement today is not about Brexit, this is about Nicola Sturgeon trying to pacify her party members and back benchers ahead of the SNP's conference"". The pro-independence Scottish Greens broadly welcomed the first minister's statement. But the party's Holyrood co-convener Alison Johnstone warned that the SNP's vision of independence ""looks more like the failed economic model of the UK, a vision which has led to cuts to public services and increasing child poverty, than the bold vision for independence the Greens campaigned for and believed in"".

London climate demo 'to end on Thursday',"This video can not be played Police have cleared the final Extinction Rebellion road block at Marble Arch A climate protest that has disrupted parts of London for nine days is to end on Thursday, organisers say. Police cleared Extinction Rebellion's final road block in Marble Arch earlier and arrested 22 people, bringing the total to 1,088 since protests began. Specialist equipment has been deployed in Parliament Square to remove protesters camping in trees. Makeshift camps at Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge were removed earlier in the week. One protester told the BBC: ""This is our last stand."" Organisers said a closing ceremony would be held at 18:00 BST on Thursday at Speaker's Corner, Hyde Park. ""We will leave the physical locations but a space for truth-telling has been opened up in the world,"" they said in a statement. ""We know we have disrupted your lives. We do not do this lightly. We only do this because this is an emergency."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he welcomed the decision to cease the protests, which had been a ""huge challenge for our over-stretched and under-resourced Metropolitan Police"". Protesters at Parliament Square have been camped in trees for nearly a week, organisers said So far 69 people have been charged in connection with the protest, the Met Police said. Police have extended restrictions at the Marble Arch site, preventing protesters congregating on the road, until Saturday afternoon. A senior Scotland Yard officer has warned that officers will require new powers to deal with demonstrations on a similar scale in the future. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Climate protesters 'making a difference' Who is Greta Thunberg? Giving evidence to the parliamentary Human Rights Committee, Commander Adrian Usher, head of the Metropolitan Police's protection command, said it should not be enough for a protest to be ""peaceful"" to be considered lawful. ""We will conduct a sober review of our tactics against recent protests, but I think it is likely to say the legislation associated with policing protest is quite dated and that policing and protest has moved on and that legislation should follow suit,"" he said. A protester climbed a lamp post an unfurled a banner at Marble Arch Police chiefs have called for greater powers to clear peaceful protests on the scale of Extinction Rebellion Earlier, Extinction Rebellion Youth handed a letter addressed to MPs, to Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott. In response, Ms Abbott said MPs needed to come together to host a ""broad conversation"" on bringing the country's greenhouse gas emissions down. Campaignershave issued three core demands to the government: to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. In a letter to MPs Extinction Rebellion Youth said: ""We are asking you to hear the science, to feel the public's change of heart and to act now to save our futures"" Elliott Cuciurean, 20, believed to be the first climate activist successfully prosecuted over the fresh wave of protests, was spared a fine at a court hearing on Tuesday. More actions are expected in the future.

Russia eases passport rules for east UkrainiansThe move is considered a challenge to incoming president Volodymyr Zelensky.,"People in the self-proclaimed ""Donetsk Republic"" await Denis Pushilin, the acting leader, in November 2018 President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Wednesday that makes it easier for those living in eastern Ukraine's separatist territories to access a Russian passport. The move is seen as a challenge to Volodymyr Zelensky, the former comedian elected president this weekend. In a Facebook post, Mr Zelensky's team labelled Russia ""an aggressor state which wages war against Ukraine"". Mr Putin said there was ""nothing unusual"" about the passport offer. ""It's strange that this provokes a negative reaction,"" he said on Thursday. The Zelensky team said earlier that through the decree Russia had ""acknowledged its responsibility as an occupier state"". ""This decree is not bringing us closer to achieving the ultimate goal: a ceasefire,"" it said. It called on the international community to provide ""diplomatic pressure and the pressure of sanctions"". The decree is aimed at people living in the unrecognised, self-styled republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, seized by Russian-backed separatists in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. ""For many years already - about 10 years - Poland has been giving out passports, Hungary has also been doing so, to Hungarians, and Romania... so are Russians living in Ukraine worse than Poles, Hungarians?"" Mr Putin said in Vladivostok. ""They have family ties, mixed marriages, and so on. I see nothing unusual in this"". Mr Putin had said earlier that people living in those areas were ""completely deprived of civil rights"" and could not ""move normally"" or ""realise their most elementary needs"". ""We have no desire to create problems for the new Ukrainian authorities,"" Mr Putin added. Conflict in the region has claimed about 13,000 lives since Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014. Mr Zelensky was elected as Ukraine's next president on Sunday, with no previous political experience. He played the role of president in a comedy television show. Volodymyr Zelensky: His predecessor as president called him too inexperienced to stand up to Russia effectively In the run-up to his election, he said he wanted to ""renew relations"" with eastern Ukraine and start a ""powerful information war to end the conflict"". In response, Russia says it wants him to show ""sound judgement"", ""honesty"" and ""pragmatism"" so that relations can improve. What does a comic president mean for Ukraine? Zelensky team plans Ukraine anti-corruption drive Ukraine crisis: Timeline Analysis by Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Kiev There had been a school of thought that the election of Volodymyr Zelensky might bring fresh life to efforts to solve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. During the campaign he'd made vague if slightly conciliatory noises about the important of dialogue and talks. Russia seems to have killed any prospect of that. First, Moscow held off from congratulating Mr Zelensky for his landslide win. Then just three days after the vote, Vladimir Putin announced he would give Russian passports to people regarded by everyone bar Russia as Ukrainians living on Ukrainian soil. In Kiev it's being seen another step towards eventual Russian annexation. Mr Zelensky has been left with no choice. He's issued a statement condemning the Russian move and calling for increased pressure through diplomacy and sanctions. It's the sort of wording we've become used to seeing in the last five years from Ukraine. The fact that this time it has come from Mr Zelensky suggests that relations are unlikely to improve. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin labelled the decree a ""continuation of aggression and interference in our internal affairs"" and urged the residents of eastern Ukraine not to accept the passports. In a Twitter post, he told them: ""Russia has deprived you of the present, and now it is trespassing on your future."" Iryna Gerashchenko, the deputy speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, noted the timing of the announcement. Mr Putin ""always uses moments of uncertainty and transition periods to plunge another knife into Ukraine's back"", she said. President Putin delivered the speech announcing the passport policy to lawmakers in Saint Petersburg, Russia on April 24 She labelled the decision a ""gross violation"" of peace agreements signed by Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany in 2015. In a tweet, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius noted how Mr Putin used ""passportization"" in the breakaway Georgian areas of Abkhazia in 2002 and then South Ossetia in 2008, resulting in a 20% occupation of Georgian territory.

Archers actor Edward Kelsey dies aged 88,"Kelsey was described as ""a truly lovely man and great company member"" Edward Kelsey, who played Joe Grundy on BBC Radio 4 soap The Archers for 34 years, has died at the age of 88. The actor first appeared on air as the irascible patriarch of the Grundy clan in 1985. Kelsey had given ""one of the great performances in the history of British radio"", editor Jeremy Howe said. The actor was also known for voicing the characters Colonel K and Baron Silas Greenback on the 1980s children's animated series Danger Mouse. Howe described his performance on The Archers as ""idiosyncratic, warm, cantankerous yet generous, dripping with the Grundy magic and wonderfully funny"". Joe Grundy was fond of his daughter-in-law Clarrie, played here by Rosalind Adams He added: ""Ted's Joe Grundy was a brilliant creation because Ted was a brilliant actor - and a truly lovely man and great company member. ""A cherished part of our team, I am sure all of us will agree that working with Ted was a rare privilege and he will be very much missed."" The Archers - tribute to Edward Kelsey In a statement, his family said the actor ""counted himself immensely lucky that he was able to enjoy a long and varied career doing the thing that he loved"". They added: ""He had an insatiably curious mind and never lost his appetite for lively conversation, good company and, of course, a great storyline."" The Archers' Tim Bentinck has said it was a privilege to work with Kelsey, who he said gave an ""object lesson in great radio acting."" Bentinck, who plays David Archer, said his character's next birthday would be particularly poignant because he shared his special day with Joe. ""It was a privilege and a huge pleasure to work with him when Joe and David had scenes together,"" said Bentick, ""and they share a birthday, which, with David's 60th coming up, will be poignant as the first one David doesn't share with Joe."" He added: ""He brought such life and subtlety to his performances, an object lesson in great radio acting."" Fans have paid tribute to the actor on social media. Allow Twitter content?

McKee funeral priest confronts politicians,"This video can not be played ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" A priest received a standing ovation at Lyra McKee's funeral when he asked why it took her death to unite politicians. Politicians attended a vigil in Londonderry after her murder, and also her funeral in Belfast on Wednesday. Fr Martin Magill asked: ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" However, DUP MP Sammy Wilson said he was not convinced it marked a turning point to restore power-sharing. Profile: Lyra McKee In pictures: Mourners pay respects Call for Irish border fix after McKee death Leo Varadkar, Theresa May and Michael D Higgins sat at the front of St Anne's Cathedral Ms McKeewas shot dead on Thursdayas she observed rioting in the Creggan area of Derry. A dissident republican paramilitary group, the New IRA,said its members killed her. Prime Minister Theresa May, President of Ireland Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and other politicians were at the service. Irish President Michael D Higgins consoles Ms McKee's partner Sara Canning Ms McKee was an avid fan of Harry Potter A friend told mourners at her funeral that Ms McKee revealed her plans to propose to her partner Sara Canning just hours before she was murdered. Stephen Lusty said she showed him pictures of the engagement ring. ""She showed me pictures of the ring she had bought for Sara and told me of the fabulous plans she had of her proposal in May,"" said Mr Lusty. ""She made me put a date in my diary for the wedding in Donegal in 2022 and gave me strict instructions to wear my kilt, which she always wanted to borrow, adorn it with some Harry Potter."" DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn FÃ©in's Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI Political leaders from Belfast, Dublin and London, all under the one roof. The disagreements over Brexit and the return of the Stormont Assembly were put into context by matters of life and death. But those political disputes were not forgotten; quite the opposite. The message from the pulpit to political leaders in Northern Ireland was clear - sort out your differences now, don't wait. The funeral took two hours. Those involved in the service hope its impact will be long lasting and far reaching. Ms McKee's sister, Nichola Corner, told mourners: ""In the words of Lyra herself, we must change our own world, one piece at a time. Now let's get to work."" Hundreds gathered for the funeral of Ms McKee, who was from a Catholic background, at a Protestant cathedral. The congregation was led by Ms McKee's partner, mother Joan McKee, brothers Gary and David and sisters Joan, Nichola and Mary. Her family chose the location due to its reputation as a ""shared space"" in a divided city. Many friends of the journalist and campaigner for LGBT rights wore Harry Potter-themed T-shirts, scarves and badges to the service. Ms McKee was an avid fan of the series. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral in Belfast's St Anne's Cathedral Messages of condolence left by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Prime Minister Theresa May At the beginning of the service, the Anglican dean of Belfast, the Very Reverend Stephen Forde, said: ""Lyra was a person who broke down barriers and reached across boundaries, this was her hallmark in life, this is her legacy in death. ""She was a child of the Good Friday agreement. She was a primary school pupil in north Belfast when the agreement was signed. ""She grew up to champion its hope for a society that was free from the prejudices of the past."" Grief and outrage over Ms McKee's murder has sparked hopes there is now momentum to break the political deadlock in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government since January 2017,when the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. On Wednesday, NI Secretary Karen Bradley said she intended tohold talks with Stormont party leaders in a bid to make progress. This video can not be played Family, friends and political leaders mourn Lyra McKee The Democratic Unionist Party's Sammy Wilson told BBC News NI that his party had offered solutions, including a time-limited process running parallel alongside the running of the assembly. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald rejected Mr Wilson's criticisms. ""He knows that the issues that have held us back are issues of equality and recognition,"" she said. ""This stalemate is not acceptable and we need to act to resolve it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Three people have been arrested over the murder, and all have been released without charge. Speaking after her funeral, Northern Ireland's top police officer said Ms McKee ""cared passionately about issues and worked hard and with integrity"". ""Of course that is in complete contrast to those people who came out of the shadows last Thursday night, fired shots at police lines, hitting Lyra and fatally injuring her,"" said Chief Constable George Hamilton. ""I suppose the outpouring of condemnation from the communities of Derry, Creggan all standing together in Creggan last Friday, was something I think was quite unique and quite different."" Members of the public stood outside the church to pay their respects to Ms McKee Ms McKee had written for publications including Private Eye, the Atlantic, Mosaic Science and Mediagazer. She had also signed a two-book deal with the publisher Faber and Faber, with her forthcoming book The Lost Boys due out in 2020. The hashtag #IStandWithLyra has been trending on Twitter, which Ms McKee used prolifically. Comedian Patrick Kielty, who is from Northern Ireland,tweeted:,external""Today Lyra McKee is laid to rest. She believed in peace, tolerance and equality. The exact opposite of those responsible. They will never win because Lyra will always be the future. And her truth will continue to be told. #IStandWithLyra"" Fellow members of the National Union of Journalists formed a guard of honour at the cathedral. The union described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. There was also a gathering at Guildhall Square in Derry for those who could not attend the funeral.

Will indyref2 happen before May 2021?,"The first minister update MSPs on her plans for independence with a statement at Holyrood First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants to hold a fresh independence referendum before the next Holyrood elections in 2021. How likely is this to happen, and what are the issues underpinning it? In March 2017, Ms Sturgeon announced her intention to hold a second Scottish independence referendum, as a response to the Brexit vote the previous year, andMSPs voted to back her. But that same month, Prime Minister Theresa May said""now is not the time""for a new vote, saying all attention should be on the Brexit negotiations. Mrs May then called a snap general election, and Ms Sturgeondecided to ""reset"" her independence plansin the wake of the SNP losing 21 seats in that vote. Two years on, thefirst minister has returned to update MSPson her timetable, saying she still hopes to hold ""indyref2"" before the end of the current Scottish Parliament term. Work is to begin on legislation to make this happen - but Ms Sturgeon said she would hold off on moving to actually trigger such a vote until she can get the UK government to back it via a ""section 30 order"" Meanwhile, all of this remains contingent on what happens with Brexit. Since the exit deadline was extended until October, that remains an open question, with no resolution in sight. Alex Salmond and David Cameron signed up to the 2014 referendum, but no agreement has yet been struck for another This much-discussed technicality refers toSection 30 of the 1998 Scotland Act,external, the mechanism by which Holyrood can legislate on reserved areas. For the 2014 referendum, David Cameron and Alex Salmond - then the leaders of the UK and Scottish governments -signed the Edinburgh Agreementto transfer powers north of the border to underpin the referendum. Nicola Sturgeon - also a signatory of the Edinburgh Agreement, as deputy first minister - wants to get a similar deal from the current PM, Mrs May. She says this isn't strictly needed to draw up legislation for a referendum, but would be needed to ""put beyond doubt or challenge"" her government's ability to actually use the bill to trigger a vote. Mike Russell will get the job of setting out plans for legislation In May, Scottish Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell will set out plans for legislation to underpin a new referendum. This would be generic legislation for a vote, which could then be specifically shaped for a referendum at a later date. Ms Sturgeon says her government ""will aim for this legislation to be on the statute book by the end of the year"" - something which should be possible with the support of the pro-independence Greens. The first minister is also setting up a ""Citizen's Assembly"" to gather views from the public, and has reached out to opposition parties to see if there are any areas of consensus for constitutional change. However, there remains an element of ""wait and see"" to the plans. To start with, if there is a referendum at all it is contingent on what happens with Brexit - and clarity on that front could be months away. And the impasse with the UK government remains. Ms Sturgeon wants a section 30 order, but it does not seem likely she will get one from Theresa May, or indeed any Conservative government. On that front, the plans remain as up in the air as ever. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says a second independence referendum will need a transfer of power from Westminster At this point, it is not particularly obvious. Ms Sturgeon believes the UK government position is ""unsustainable"", and that in any case they might not be in power for long. She told MSPs that ""no UK government will be able to deny the will of the people"" if her party is ""successful in further growing the support and demand for independence"". Her party has launcheda new campaign website,externalto this end. The SNP leader will also have her fingers crossed for a change of government at Westminster, particularly given the potential influence of her MPs in a parliament of slim margins. If none of that comes to pass - is there anything she can do to force the UK government's hand? The first minister will not hold a ""wildcat"" referendum without Westminster's backing. She has been clear that ""the legal basis of any future referendum should be the same as the referendum in 2014"". Nor, if her position in 2017 is maintained, is Ms Sturgeonplanning to go to court, despite some unresolved questions over whether Holyrood has the power to hold a referendum or not. Conservative MSPs have already raised questions about the legality of the legislation for the new referendum, which could provide a forum to test the question once and for all - but in any case taking matters to the Supreme Court would take up more time than Ms Sturgeon has available to her this term. If things drag on for long enough, she might simply have to seek a new mandate in the 2021 elections - a risk she would rather not take. Will independence supporters get the referendum they want before the next Holyrood election? Passing legislation would be the first step towards having a vote, and completing that before the end of 2019 would leave the door open for a vote inside Ms Sturgeon's timetable. There would need to be time for the Electoral Commission to scrutinise proposals and for a campaign period before the vote is actually held, so a decision will have to come in time for that as well. But Brexit hangs over all of this - to start with, Ms Sturgeon's call for a referendum is contingent on the UK actually leaving the EU. She continues to campaign for another new referendum to prevent that. And if there is no clarity on what Brexit Britain is going to look like, it is difficult to put it on a ballot paper as a proposition people can vote for or against. In Mr Russell's words, there needs to be ""thesis and antithesis"" for people to make a genuine choice. Ms Sturgeon is seeking to make productive use of the ongoing period of confusion, by laying the groundwork for a poll and getting her party ready for the campaign. But as to whether there actually will be a referendum in the coming years - we still don't really know, and we're not likely to find out in the short term.

Profile: Lyra McKee,"Lyra McKee was a ""hero"" to the LGBT community in Northern Ireland, says a friend ""Kid, it's gonna be okay... it's going to get better. ""You're going to join a scheme that trains people your age to be journalists... for the first time in your life you'll feel like you're good at something. You'll have found your calling."" Those were the words of Lyra McKee, written for the short film Letter to My 14-Year-Old Self. On Thursday night in Londonderry, Ms McKee was shot dead during rioting that police are treating as a ""terrorist incident"". This video can not be played People sign a book of condolence in the Guildhall in Derry On Friday morning, friends, colleagues and many others paid tribute to a ""rising star"" in the world of journalism. Her close friend Ann Travers, whose sister was shot dead by IRA gunmen in 1984, said Ms McKee was a journalist ""who liked to help others, to try to give answers to people and empower people"". Ann Travers said Lyra McKee was a journalist who ""wanted to empower people"" ""I used to call her Sherlock Holmes,"" she said. ""Once she got hold of something she really didn't give up. ""Lyra did not deserve this to happen to her and her family don't deserve any of this."" Ms McKee had written for many publications, including Buzzfeed, Private Eye, the Atlantic and Mosaic Science. Recently, she worked for the California-based news site Mediagazer, a trade publication covering the media industry. She was named Sky News young journalist of the year in 2006 and Forbes Magazine named her as one of their 30 under 30 in media in Europe in 2016. The 29-year-old north Belfast woman had signed a two-book deal with the publisher Faber and Faber, with her forthcoming book The Lost Boys due out in 2020. Police are blaming dissident republicans for the rioting on Thursday night According to those who knew her best, the gay rights advocate was someone who ""believed passionately in social and religious tolerance"". Eva Grosman of the Centre for Democracy and Peace Building considered Ms McKee ""a good friend"". Ms Grosman told BBC News NI on Friday that she and others who knew her best felt ""numb with grief"". ""Life was just getting good for Lyra,"" she said. ""She had fallen in love, she was so happy up in Derry - things were starting to go really well."" Ms Grosman had invited Lyra to present a TED talk at Stormont in 2017 - she used the opportunity to reflect onthe 2016 shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando in Florida, in which 49 people were killed. ""It's so poignant when I think back on what she said now,"" said Ms Grosman. ""She was talking about intolerance and hate and violence and how senseless it all is, how destructive.

""And she had the whole audience on their feet at the end of it - it was such a moving speech and it's so sad to remember her words this morning in light of what has happened... sickening."" CiarÃ¡n Ã MaolÃ¡in, the Belfast secretary of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), who knew Ms McKee well, described her as ""intelligent, determined and very witty"". ""Those whom she trusted were privileged to be taken into her confidence,"" he added. ""There is no comfort for us in knowing that her killing, unlike that ofMartin O'Hagan,externalorVeronica Guerin, was not targeted. ""Like them, Lyra was killed because she was a journalist. ""It would be wrong to say that she was fearless - she was too intelligent for that. ""She was, however, brave enough to take calculated risks in pursuit of a story and before the shot was fired she may have felt safest in the lee of an armoured police vehicle."" Ms McKee's most recent story,external, published on Sunday, was an analysis piece on the rising rate of young suicides since the ceasefires and the Good Friday Agreement. Lyra McKee gave a TED talk in 2017 about the Orlando gay nightclub shootings the previous year In it, she wrote: ""People are no longer dying at the hands of paramilitaries, but they're still dying, too young and too soon. The culprit now is suicide."" On Valentine's Day,she had paid tribute to the ""love of my life"" Sara (Canning),externalin an article for the Belfast Telegraph. Speaking about the moments leading to her death, Mr Ã MaolÃ¡in said: ""Having heard the rioting, Lyra went out with Sara to cover events and had only just finished discussing the situation with a colleague in Belfast when she was shot. ""Sara was beside her at the time and later when she died in Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry."" Journalist Veronica Guerin was shot dead in 1996 while driving her car John O'Doherty, the director of the Rainbow Project, described her as ""a hero to many in the LGBT community"". ""Lyra was a remarkable person,"" he said. ""We have been reading about the huge impact Lyra had on so many within Northern Ireland's LGBT community, including supporting people in coming out and using her own coming out story to empower others to live as their most authentic selves. ""Lyra has volunteered and fundraised for us, including at a Strictly Come Dancing fundraising event. ""Lyra described herself as someone with two left feet but like everything she did in her life, she gave it everything she had and our lasting memory will be of a smiling and dancing Lyra."" Amnesty International's Patrick Corrigan tweeted that Ms McKee's ""commitment to truth was absolute"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The writer Ruth Dudley-Edwards described Ms McKee as a ""huge talent"" who cared deeply about her mother, who had a disability. ""You sat with Lyra for an evening and she had to stop every half an hour to check that her mother was OK,"" she said. ""One of the things that was so remarkable about her in Northern Ireland was she was completely non-tribal. ""She came from what was a republican estate but she had no time for any of that. ""She had friends who were republicans, she had friends who were loyalists, she had friends from all over the place. ""The only thing she required of you was that you were decent."" Ms Dudley-Edwards said that Ms McKee was just beginning to feel successful in her career after years of ""struggle"". ""It was tough and she was poor and she was crowdfunding a bookâ¦ and suddenly she was doing brilliantly."" Ms McKee endedher Belfast Telegraph article on suicide last week,externalwith an emotional appeal to those experiencing mental health problems. ""There's a saying within the LGBT community: It gets better,"" she wrote. ""It's what we tell LGBT youths and others who are currently journeying through hell. ""Keep going, we say, because one day you'll wake up and be glad that you lived. ""That piece of advice applies to all of us who are struggling. ""So please, I beg you - live.""

McKee funeral priest confronts politiciansFr Martin Magill receives a standing ovation when he asks why it took the journalist's death to unite parties.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" A priest received a standing ovation at Lyra McKee's funeral when he asked why it took her death to unite politicians. Politicians attended a vigil in Londonderry after her murder, and also her funeral in Belfast on Wednesday. Fr Martin Magill asked: ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" However, DUP MP Sammy Wilson said he was not convinced it marked a turning point to restore power-sharing. Profile: Lyra McKee In pictures: Mourners pay respects Call for Irish border fix after McKee death Leo Varadkar, Theresa May and Michael D Higgins sat at the front of St Anne's Cathedral Ms McKeewas shot dead on Thursdayas she observed rioting in the Creggan area of Derry. A dissident republican paramilitary group, the New IRA,said its members killed her. Prime Minister Theresa May, President of Ireland Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and other politicians were at the service. Irish President Michael D Higgins consoles Ms McKee's partner Sara Canning Ms McKee was an avid fan of Harry Potter A friend told mourners at her funeral that Ms McKee revealed her plans to propose to her partner Sara Canning just hours before she was murdered. Stephen Lusty said she showed him pictures of the engagement ring. ""She showed me pictures of the ring she had bought for Sara and told me of the fabulous plans she had of her proposal in May,"" said Mr Lusty. ""She made me put a date in my diary for the wedding in Donegal in 2022 and gave me strict instructions to wear my kilt, which she always wanted to borrow, adorn it with some Harry Potter."" DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn FÃ©in's Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI Political leaders from Belfast, Dublin and London, all under the one roof. The disagreements over Brexit and the return of the Stormont Assembly were put into context by matters of life and death. But those political disputes were not forgotten; quite the opposite. The message from the pulpit to political leaders in Northern Ireland was clear - sort out your differences now, don't wait. The funeral took two hours. Those involved in the service hope its impact will be long lasting and far reaching. Ms McKee's sister, Nichola Corner, told mourners: ""In the words of Lyra herself, we must change our own world, one piece at a time. Now let's get to work."" Hundreds gathered for the funeral of Ms McKee, who was from a Catholic background, at a Protestant cathedral. The congregation was led by Ms McKee's partner, mother Joan McKee, brothers Gary and David and sisters Joan, Nichola and Mary. Her family chose the location due to its reputation as a ""shared space"" in a divided city. Many friends of the journalist and campaigner for LGBT rights wore Harry Potter-themed T-shirts, scarves and badges to the service. Ms McKee was an avid fan of the series. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral in Belfast's St Anne's Cathedral Messages of condolence left by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Prime Minister Theresa May At the beginning of the service, the Anglican dean of Belfast, the Very Reverend Stephen Forde, said: ""Lyra was a person who broke down barriers and reached across boundaries, this was her hallmark in life, this is her legacy in death. ""She was a child of the Good Friday agreement. She was a primary school pupil in north Belfast when the agreement was signed. ""She grew up to champion its hope for a society that was free from the prejudices of the past."" Grief and outrage over Ms McKee's murder has sparked hopes there is now momentum to break the political deadlock in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government since January 2017,when the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. On Wednesday, NI Secretary Karen Bradley said she intended tohold talks with Stormont party leaders in a bid to make progress. This video can not be played Family, friends and political leaders mourn Lyra McKee The Democratic Unionist Party's Sammy Wilson told BBC News NI that his party had offered solutions, including a time-limited process running parallel alongside the running of the assembly. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald rejected Mr Wilson's criticisms. ""He knows that the issues that have held us back are issues of equality and recognition,"" she said.

Three people have been arrested over the murder, and all have been released without charge. Speaking after her funeral, Northern Ireland's top police officer said Ms McKee ""cared passionately about issues and worked hard and with integrity"". ""Of course that is in complete contrast to those people who came out of the shadows last Thursday night, fired shots at police lines, hitting Lyra and fatally injuring her,"" said Chief Constable George Hamilton. ""I suppose the outpouring of condemnation from the communities of Derry, Creggan all standing together in Creggan last Friday, was something I think was quite unique and quite different."" Members of the public stood outside the church to pay their respects to Ms McKee Ms McKee had written for publications including Private Eye, the Atlantic, Mosaic Science and Mediagazer. She had also signed a two-book deal with the publisher Faber and Faber, with her forthcoming book The Lost Boys due out in 2020. The hashtag #IStandWithLyra has been trending on Twitter, which Ms McKee used prolifically. Comedian Patrick Kielty, who is from Northern Ireland,tweeted:,external""Today Lyra McKee is laid to rest.

And her truth will continue to be told. #IStandWithLyra"" Fellow members of the National Union of Journalists formed a guard of honour at the cathedral. The union described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. There was also a gathering at Guildhall Square in Derry for those who could not attend the funeral.

Sturgeon wants independence vote by 2021Scotland's first minister says an independence vote should be held before the next Holyrood election.Scotland politicsComments,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says a second independence referendum will need a transfer of power from Westminster Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the country is taken out of the EU. The first minister told Holyrood that she would introduce legislation soon to set the rules for another vote. But she indicated that she would need the agreement of the UK government before actually holding a referendum. Downing Street has previously said it will not grant a new Section 30 order, which underpinned the 2014 referendum. Ms Sturgeon claimed this position was ""unsustainable"" and challenged her party to increase support and demand for independence. But the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""As we have been repeatedly clear, Scotland has already had an independence referendum in 2014 and voted decisively to remain in the United Kingdom. This should be respected. Our position hasn't changed."" Will there be indyref2 before May 2021? UK government 'will say no indyref2' What is the SNP's Brexit policy? Ms Sturgeon has faced calls from some within the SNP - which will hold its conference at the weekend - and the wider independence movement to hold a referendum sooner rather than later. She told MSPs that to ""rush into an immediate decision before a Brexit path has been determined would not allow for an informed choice to be made"" about the future. However, the first minister added: ""If we are to safeguard Scotland's interests, we cannot wait indefinitely. ""That is why I consider that a choice between Brexit and a future for Scotland as an independent European nation should be offered in the lifetime of this parliament. ""I can confirm that the Scottish government will act to ensure that the option of giving people a choice on independence later in this term of parliament is progressed."" The next Scottish Parliament election is due to be held in May 2021. This video can not be played Brexit versus Scottish independence Ms Sturgeon believes she has a mandate to hold a second independence referendum as a result of the SNP's victory in the 2016 Holyrood elections - with the party's manifesto stating a vote should take place if there was a ""material change of circumstances"" such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will. The first minister said she hoped a ""framework Bill"" - legislation paving the way for a referendum - will be in place by the end of this year. She said: ""We do not need a transfer of power such as a Section 30 order to pass such a framework Bill, though we would need it to put beyond doubt or challenge our ability to apply the bill to an independence referendum."" The first minister insisted: ""If we are successful in further growing the support and the demand for independence, then no UK government will be able to stop the will of the people or stop that will being expressed."" The SNP conference will be held at the weekend - with Ms Sturgeon due to speak on Sunday The first minister extended an invitation to other parties, including those opposed to independence, to come forward for their own proposals for Scotland's constitutional future. She said: ""The immediate opportunity we now have is to help stop Brexit for the whole UK - and we should seize that opportunity. But if that cannot be achieved, dealing with the consequences of Brexit and facing up to its challenges will be unavoidable. ""I believe that the case for independence is stronger than ever. I will make that case, but I know others take a different view. ""So, as we take the necessary legislative steps over the next few months, I will also seek to open up space for us to come together and find areas of agreement as mature politicians should."" But she predicted that if the only alternative presented by opposition politicians was a ""failed and damaging status quo"", then ""the process of change will pass them by and support for independence will grow"". Analysis by Sarah Smith, Scotland editor Nicola Sturgeon knows that the Westminster government will almost certainly refuse to allow another referendum within the next two years - so she needs to find a way to keep the constitutional argument alive while there is little prospect of an imminent vote. The SNP know that by proposing another referendum they will be accused by those who do not support independence of introducing a divisive political issue at the worst possible time. So the first minister is challenging other parties who do not support Scottish independence to come forward with their own ideas for constitutional change, promising that the SNP will engage fully and in good faith. Ms Sturgeon is very deliberately talking of trying to find compromise and consensus amongst politicians - saying Scotland can do things differently from Westminster. It is an appeal that is clearly meant to reach beyond other party leaders and straight to voters who may not welcome independence, but might well appreciate the approach the first minister is proposing. The first minister also announced plans to establish a Citizens Assembly to consider Scotland's future, which she said had been done in Ireland to ""help find consensus on issues where people have sharply divided opinions"". She said this would bring together a representative cross-section of Scotland with an independent chair, and be tasked with considering: What kind of country are we seeking to build? How can we best overcome the challenges we face, including those arising from Brexit? What further work should be carried out to give people the detail they need to make informed choices about the future of the country? Scotland rejected independence by 55% to 45% in the 2014 referendum - with opinion polls suggesting support for independence remains largely unchanged five years later. Ms Sturgeon initially called for a second referendum after the Brexit vote in 2016, butput her plans on holdafter the SNP lost 21 seats in the general election the following year. Downing Street says the prime minister is still of the view that there should not be another independence referendum Speaking after Ms Sturgeon's statement, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said people in Scotland had ""voted decisively in 2014 to remain part of the UK, on a promise that the referendum would settle the issue for a generation"". He added: ""Instead of respecting that result, Nicola Sturgeon continues to press for divisive constitutional change when it is clear that most people in Scotland do not want another independence referendum. The UK government will stand up for them. ""Nicola Sturgeon needs to listen to the views of the Scottish people and concentrate on improving Scotland's economy and schools, not continually trying to orchestrate upheaval and division."" Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's statement to MSPs Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard accused Ms Sturgeon of ""using her office as first minister to put the interests of the SNP before the interests of our country"". He said: ""Her statement today is not about Brexit, this is about Nicola Sturgeon trying to pacify her party members and back benchers ahead of the SNP's conference"". The pro-independence Scottish Greens broadly welcomed the first minister's statement. But the party's Holyrood co-convener Alison Johnstone warned that the SNP's vision of independence ""looks more like the failed economic model of the UK, a vision which has led to cuts to public services and increasing child poverty, than the bold vision for independence the Greens campaigned for and believed in"".

Man admits murdering Glasgow woman in 1997,"Tracey Wylde was found dead in her home in 1997 A 44-year-old man has admitted murdering a woman in Glasgow more than 20 years ago. Zhi Min Chen choked Tracey Wylde to death at her flat in Barmulloch in November 1997. The body of the 21-year-old mother-of-one - who had been working as a prostitute - was found the next day. Chinese-born Chen had been due to stand trial at the High Court in Glasgow. He will return to the court to be sentenced next month. Judge Lord Arthurson told the fast food shop owner: ""You have been convicted of a murder of a 21-year-old young woman in her own home. ""The only sentence that the court can and will pass is that of life imprisonment."" A large-scale manhunt - initially lasting two-and-a-half years - failed to catch Ms Wylde's killer. A cold case review in 2013 was also unsuccessful. But Chen was eventually arrested in July last year after being held for an alleged assault in Glasgow's Cowcaddens area. His DNA matched samples found at the scene of Ms Wylde's murder at time. Police described Ms Wylde as having a ""turbulent background"" and said she had been a sex worker in Glasgow at the time of her death. She had previously been raised by her grandparents before moving into her own flat and giving birth to her daughter in August 1994. The court heard Ms Wylde had gone into Glasgow city centre on 23 November 1997, and was last spotted on CCTV in the city's red-light area at about 03:20 the next morning. Prosecutor Steven Borthwick told the court a neighbour heard arguing in Ms Wylde's flat at about 04:40. Her body was discovered in the house the following day. It was not revealed in court how Chen met Ms Wylde. Following Chen's guilty plea, Det Insp Gordon MacKenzie, of Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team, said: ""Today marks the end of a 21-year wait for the family of Tracy Wylde, to see the man responsible for her brutal murder finally brought to justice. ""They never lost faith that this day would come and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for the support they have given the inquiry team over the years. ""It is a real shame that Tracey's mother Fay, who died a couple of years ago, is not here to see her daughter's killer held accountable. ""This investigation involved a wide range of officers and detectives due to its scale and longevity and I speak for them all in welcoming today's result, which will hopefully provide a sense of closure to Tracey's family.""

Russia eases passport rules for east Ukrainians,"People in the self-proclaimed ""Donetsk Republic"" await Denis Pushilin, the acting leader, in November 2018 President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Wednesday that makes it easier for those living in eastern Ukraine's separatist territories to access a Russian passport. The move is seen as a challenge to Volodymyr Zelensky, the former comedian elected president this weekend. In a Facebook post, Mr Zelensky's team labelled Russia ""an aggressor state which wages war against Ukraine"". Mr Putin said there was ""nothing unusual"" about the passport offer. ""It's strange that this provokes a negative reaction,"" he said on Thursday. The Zelensky team said earlier that through the decree Russia had ""acknowledged its responsibility as an occupier state"". ""This decree is not bringing us closer to achieving the ultimate goal: a ceasefire,"" it said. It called on the international community to provide ""diplomatic pressure and the pressure of sanctions"". The decree is aimed at people living in the unrecognised, self-styled republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, seized by Russian-backed separatists in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. ""For many years already - about 10 years - Poland has been giving out passports, Hungary has also been doing so, to Hungarians, and Romania... so are Russians living in Ukraine worse than Poles, Hungarians?"" Mr Putin said in Vladivostok. ""They have family ties, mixed marriages, and so on. I see nothing unusual in this"". Mr Putin had said earlier that people living in those areas were ""completely deprived of civil rights"" and could not ""move normally"" or ""realise their most elementary needs"". ""We have no desire to create problems for the new Ukrainian authorities,"" Mr Putin added. Conflict in the region has claimed about 13,000 lives since Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014. Mr Zelensky was elected as Ukraine's next president on Sunday, with no previous political experience. He played the role of president in a comedy television show. Volodymyr Zelensky: His predecessor as president called him too inexperienced to stand up to Russia effectively In the run-up to his election, he said he wanted to ""renew relations"" with eastern Ukraine and start a ""powerful information war to end the conflict"". In response, Russia says it wants him to show ""sound judgement"", ""honesty"" and ""pragmatism"" so that relations can improve. What does a comic president mean for Ukraine? Zelensky team plans Ukraine anti-corruption drive Ukraine crisis: Timeline Analysis by Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Kiev There had been a school of thought that the election of Volodymyr Zelensky might bring fresh life to efforts to solve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. During the campaign he'd made vague if slightly conciliatory noises about the important of dialogue and talks. Russia seems to have killed any prospect of that. First, Moscow held off from congratulating Mr Zelensky for his landslide win. Then just three days after the vote, Vladimir Putin announced he would give Russian passports to people regarded by everyone bar Russia as Ukrainians living on Ukrainian soil. In Kiev it's being seen another step towards eventual Russian annexation. Mr Zelensky has been left with no choice. He's issued a statement condemning the Russian move and calling for increased pressure through diplomacy and sanctions. It's the sort of wording we've become used to seeing in the last five years from Ukraine. The fact that this time it has come from Mr Zelensky suggests that relations are unlikely to improve. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin labelled the decree a ""continuation of aggression and interference in our internal affairs"" and urged the residents of eastern Ukraine not to accept the passports. In a Twitter post, he told them: ""Russia has deprived you of the present, and now it is trespassing on your future."" Iryna Gerashchenko, the deputy speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, noted the timing of the announcement. Mr Putin ""always uses moments of uncertainty and transition periods to plunge another knife into Ukraine's back"", she said. President Putin delivered the speech announcing the passport policy to lawmakers in Saint Petersburg, Russia on April 24 She labelled the decision a ""gross violation"" of peace agreements signed by Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany in 2015. In a tweet, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius noted how Mr Putin used ""passportization"" in the breakaway Georgian areas of Abkhazia in 2002 and then South Ossetia in 2008, resulting in a 20% occupation of Georgian territory.

Ministers demand Huawei leak inquiry,"Government ministers are calling for a ""full and proper"" investigation after high-level discussions about the UK using Huawei technology were leaked. The government has approved the supply of equipment by the Chinese telecoms firm for the UK's new 5G data network - despite warnings of a security risk. It is believed the decision was taken at a meeting of the government's National Security Council on Tuesday. One minister said leaking from the council was ""simply not acceptable"". The senior minister told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that leaking the conversations was ""extraordinary...the security council is the holy of holies"". There were ""huge concerns"" over ""getting into bed"" with the telecoms giant, the minister said. Ministers were deciding whether or not to allow equipment from Huawei to be used to construct the new 5G data network - a decision that could have long-term consequences for national security. There are fears that giving the Chinese company a key role could open the UK network to espionage. But Huawei has denied there is any risk of espionage or sabotage, or that it is controlled by the Chinese government. All you need to know about Huawei's problems Huawei: The story of a controversial company Why is UK at odds with cyber-allies over Huawei? What is 5G and what will it mean for you? BT bars Huawei kit from core of 5G network According to the Daily Telegraph,external, Huawei would be allowed to help build the ""non-core"" parts of the UK's 5G network, such as antennas. Prime Minister Theresa May chaired the meeting of the National Security Council on Tuesday, where it is believed the decision was taken. There has been no formal confirmation of Huawei's role in the 5G network and Number 10 said a final decision would be made at the end of spring. The National Security Council is where senior ministers with key security roles meet - and their talks are supposed to be confidential. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was ""real upset"" that the discussions had leaked. A senior minister said there had to be a ""full and proper leak inquiry"", with those responsible losing their jobs if necessary. Conservative backbench MP Sir Nicholas Soames said the inquiry must be a criminal one and that the leak would ""cause our friends and allies to wonder if we can be considered reliable - whoever is responsible should be dismissed [from] the Queen's service"". A source also told our political editor that four cabinet ministers had spoken against Huawei, fearing that security could be compromised. There have beenwarnings in the US since at least 2012that equipment from Huawei poses a security threat. Last year a UK government report said it could provide ""only limited assurance"" that the company's infrastructure did not pose a threat to national security. Now the US wants its allies in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence grouping - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to exclude the company. Australia last year blocked its networks from using Huawei's 5G gear. The current cabinet was memorably described as the ""worst in British political history"" for leaking by the man who, ironically, is meant to be in charge of discipline itself - the chief whip. But for a leak to come from the security council is quite a different order. As many as six ministers are therefore likely to write to Number 10 complaining and calling for a ""full and proper"" inquiry into who divulged the information. Read more from Laura here. 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. Existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns - particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G is also much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45mbps (megabits per second) on average. Experts say 5G - which is starting to be introduced in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster.

'Exhilarating' implant turns thoughts to speech,"Electrodes read the electrical activity in the brain Scientists have developed a brain implant that can read people's minds and turn their thoughts to speech. The team at the University of California, San Francisco says the technology is ""exhilarating"". They add that their findings,published in the journal Nature,external, could help people when disease robs them of their ability to talk. Experts said the findings were compelling and offered hope of restoring speech. The mind-reading technology works in two stages. First an electrode is implanted in the brain to pick up the electrical signals that manoeuvre the lips, tongue, voice box and jaw. Then powerful computing is used to simulate how the movements in the mouth and throat would form different sounds. This results in synthesised speech coming out of a ""virtual vocal tract"". You might think it would be easier to scour the brain for the pattern of electrical signals that code for each word. However, attempts to do so have only had limited success. Instead it was focusing on the shape of the mouth and the sounds it would produce that allowed the scientists to achieve a world first. The profoundly deaf girl who found her voice after brain surgery Parkinson's Disease course uses shouting to help patients Prof Edward Chang, one of the researchers, said: ""For the first time, this study demonstrates that we can generate entire spoken sentences based on an individual's brain activity. ""This is an exhilarating proof of principle that, with technology that is already within reach, we should be able to build a device that is clinically viable in patients with speech loss."" It is not perfect. If you listen to this recording of synthesised speech: This video can not be played Listen to speech decoded from brain activity You can tell it is not crystal clear (the recording says ""the proof you are seeking is not available in books""). The system is better with prolonged sounds like the ""sh"" in ship than with abrupt sounds such as the ""buh"" sound in ""books"". In experiments with five people, who read hundreds of sentences, listeners were able to discern what was being spoken up to 70% of the time when they were given a list of words to choose from. Many diseases can lead to the loss of speech including: motor neurone disease brain injuries throat cancer some strokes neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis The team say it could work in some of these diseases. However, the technology relies on the parts of the brain which control the lips, tongue, voice box and jaw working correctly. So patients with some types of stroke would not be able to benefit. ""This is not a solution for everyone who cannot communicate,"" says Prof Chang. There is also the more distant prospect of helping people who have never spoken, including some children with cerebral palsy, to learn to speak with such a device, say the researchers. The participants in the study were told not to make any specific mouth movements. Prof Chang said: ""There were just asked to do the very simple thing of reading some sentences. ""So it's a very natural act that the brain translates into movements itself."" At the moment it is too hard. Prof Chang said: ""We and others actually have tried to look at whether it's actually possible to decode just thoughts alone. ""And it turns out, it's a very, very difficult and challenging problem. ""That's only one reason why, of many, we really focus on what people are actually trying to say."" However,some scientists have argued,externalthere is an ethical debate to be had about brain-machine interface technologies that read the mind. A commentary, published alongside the research, said the results were ""compelling"". It added: ""We can hope that individuals with speech impairments will regain the ability to freely speak their minds and reconnect with the world around them."" Prof Sophie Scott, from University College London, said: ""This is very interesting work from a great lab but it must be noted that it is at very early stages and is not close to clinical applications yet.""

"Tory MPs rule out early challenge to MayRules barring another vote before December will not be changed, but MPs seek clarity about PM's future.UK PoliticsComments","Senior Tories have ruled out changing their rules to allow an early challenge to Theresa May's leadership, but have asked for more clarity about how long she will remain in office. Under current rules, MPs cannot hold a new confidence vote in her leadership until December - 12 months on from last year's vote which she won. The 1922 Committee rejected bringing forward this deadline at a meeting. But chair Graham Brady said MPs asked for a ""clear roadmap"" about her future. And amid signs of a growing grassroots revolt against Mrs May, the Clwyd South Conservative Associationhas passed a motion of no confidence in the prime minister. Calls for progress in Brexit deal talks PM to face grassroots no-confidence vote Are Tory members 'taking back control'? In a ballot of its members, only 3.7% supported Mrs May, while 88.8% said they had no confidence in her. Last month, Mrs May pledged to stand down if and when Parliament ratified her Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some long-standing Leave campaigners want her to announce a date now, irrespective of whether a Brexit deal is completed. Joint executive secretary of the 1922 Nigel Evans was among them, insisting on Tuesday that the calls for her to quit had become ""a clamour"". Following a meeting of all Tory MPs, Sir Graham said colleagues concerned about Mrs May's leadership were free to express their concerns to him, which would be ""communicated"" to Downing Street. In light of the PM's commitment to stand down if Parliament approved a Brexit deal, he said MPs were seeking ""similar clarity from her"" about what would happen ""in other circumstances"". ""I think the 1922 executive is asking on behalf of the Conservative Party in Parliament that we should have a clear road map forward,"" he told the BBC. ""We haven't set out a timetable, we asked her to set out a clear timetable, just to give some certainty and clarity to colleagues in Parliament and the wider Conservative Party and to the country most importantly."" Sir Graham said MPs were not giving the prime minister an ultimatum Former minister Robert Halfon said it would have been ""entirely wrong"" to have staged another vote right now given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. ""The rules are the rules,"" he told BBC News. ""We are the Conservative Party, not a Stalinist Party, where you suddenly rip up the rule book and change them if you don't like them."" ""It would have been behaving like a dictatorship, not the Conservative Party."" Speaking before Wednesday's meeting, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had given a commitment to stand down ""earlier than she would have liked"" and would not lead negotiations on the UK's future relations with the EU. But he said this did ""not necessarily mean"" she would quit straight away if Brexit happened on 31 October, the new deadline set by the EU for the UK's exit. The party's most senior backbenchers met twice behind closed doors but were split on whether to change its leadership rules. Sources suggest there was a slim majority in favour of the status quo. But while Conservative MPs decided not to change the rules, grandee Sir Graham Brady said they wanted more clarity from the PM on when she would stand down. Some MPs are keen that the PM signals a willingness to go soon after next month's unwanted European elections. So this could be a coup postponed - not a coup averted. Mrs May survived a vote of no confidence in her on 12 December 2018 by 200 to 117 votes. The ballot was triggered after 48 Tory MPs wrote to the 1922 committee's chair Sir Graham Brady to say they had lost faith in her, exceeding the threshold required. Some of those who wanted to change the Conservative rules argued another vote of confidence should be permitted after six months, rather than a year, if a relatively high number of MPs - 30% or 40% - call for it. But other members of 1922 Committee, who started discussing the issue on Tuesday, were sceptical of long-term rule changes to address a very specific circumstance. They were also worried about showing further party divisions ahead of local elections next week and the potential European elections on 23 May.

Facebook to set aside $3bn over investigationThe social media giant said sales for the first three months of the year leapt 26% to $15.08bnBusiness,"Facebook has said it will set aside $3bn (Â£2.3bn) to cover the potential costs of an investigation by US authorities into its privacy practices. While it has provided for a heavy toll from the investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission, the final cost could be $5bn, it said. The social media giant also said total sales for the first three months of the year leapt 26% to $15.08bn, narrowly beating market expectations. Monthly users rose 8%, it said. That rise takes the number of users to 2.38 billion. ""We had a good quarter and our business and community continued to grow,"" founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said. ""We are focused on building out our privacy-focused vision for the future of social networking, and working collaboratively to address important issues around the internet."" The shares are up by nearly 40% in the year to date, far outperforming the broader market, and were up nearly 5% in late trading on Wall Street. Facebook is facing a probe over the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, however no findings have yet been published. Facebook was labelled ""morally bankrupt pathological liars"" by New Zealand's privacy commissioner this month after hosting a livestream of the Christchurch attacks that left 50 dead. In an interview after the attacks, Mr Zuckerberg refused to commit to any changes to the platform's live technology, including a time delay on livestreams. Facebook, which owns Instagram, last week admitted that millions more Instagram users were affected by a security lapse than it had previously disclosed. It had mistakenly stored the passwords of hundreds of millions of users without encryption.

Neo-Nazi's Facebook account left activeThe social network says it is investigating why the profile was not removed - as it had promised.Technology,"Jack Renshaw admitted two charges on the first day of his trial Facebook is investigating after the account of a neo-Nazi who planned to kill an MP remained active despite the company saying it would be deactivated. Last week the social media giant announced a series of far-right Facebook pages would be removed. One of those it named - Jack Renshaw, 23, from Skelmersdale in Lancashire - is awaiting sentencing after admitting a terrorist plot to murder a Labour MP. But his personal profile remained live until the BBC raised it with the firm. Those banned from Facebook last week- in an announcement that received significant publicity - include the British National Party, the former BNP leader Nick Griffin, and the National Front. Labour MP Rosie Cooper said she ""was to be murdered to send a message to the state"" The social network said it had taken action because those involved proclaimed a ""violent or hateful mission"". ""Individuals and organisations who spread hate, or attack or call for the exclusion of others on the basis of who they are, have no place on Facebook,"" the company said. But Renshaw's account, which was linked to other extreme right figures, remained active. The neo-Nazi paedophile who plotted to kill Renshaw pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to preparing to murder his local MP, Rosie Cooper, with a machete and threatening to kill a female detective. He will be sentenced next month, but is already serving time after being convicted last year of sexually grooming adolescent boys and stirring up racial hatred in speeches. Before being arrested he used Facebook to declare himself a ""Nazi terrorist"". At one stage fellow activists created a ""unity group"" for Renshaw in which he stated - in a reference to Thomas Mair, the man who killed MP Jo Cox - that he was going to ""Mair"" others. Facebook only removed Renshaw's account - bearing his picture and which featured in his trial - hours after the BBC contacted the company to say it was still active. It said: ""We design our policies to keep people safe on Facebook and we are very sorry to have discovered an additional account for Jack Renshaw. ""The account in question managed to elude our systems by using a different identity. ""We have taken immediate action to remove this profile, which is in addition to the accounts associated with his name that we removed on 18 April,"" Facebook added. MPs on Wednesday challenged Facebookfor not doing enough to remove videos of the Christchurch mosque attacks and was asked why so much neo-Nazi content is available.

Easyjet bans nuts on all flights,"Easyjet has banned the sale of nuts on flights to help protect passengers with allergies. The airline will also ban passengers from eating nut products if somebody on board has an allergy to them. Nut policy among airlines differs. British Airways and Ryanair, ask passengers to refrain from eating peanuts if a fellow passenger has an allergy. At present there are no rules governing the serving of nuts during flights. A proposed UK passenger charter, which could include rules for protecting allergy sufferers, is currently under consultation. The plans are part of the government'sAviation 2050 strategy,external. German carrier Lufthansa is among firms with a rule against serving peanuts on its planes. However, like most airlines, it says it cannot guarantee a nut-free environment. Outlining the new policy, Easyjet said: ""We recommend that passengers inform us of their allergy at the time of booking which enables us to pass this information onto the cabin crew operating the flight."" Passengers can also notify the airline during the online booking process. Peanuts put Josie at risk of an anaphylactic shock An overarching policy for airlines is supported by 11 year-old Josie, who would like to see nuts banned by all operators. Josie, from Wolviston in Stockton-on-Tees, worries about going on holiday due to her life-threatening nut allergy. She carries an EpiPen with her on flights but says they only delay an anaphylactic reaction by a few minutes. ""You cannot do anything if you are 30,000 feet in the air,"" she said.

London climate demo 'to end on Thursday'Extinction Rebellion members will have been protesting in London for a total of 10 days.London,"This video can not be played Police have cleared the final Extinction Rebellion road block at Marble Arch A climate protest that has disrupted parts of London for nine days is to end on Thursday, organisers say. Police cleared Extinction Rebellion's final road block in Marble Arch earlier and arrested 22 people, bringing the total to 1,088 since protests began. Specialist equipment has been deployed in Parliament Square to remove protesters camping in trees. Makeshift camps at Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge were removed earlier in the week. One protester told the BBC: ""This is our last stand."" Organisers said a closing ceremony would be held at 18:00 BST on Thursday at Speaker's Corner, Hyde Park. ""We will leave the physical locations but a space for truth-telling has been opened up in the world,"" they said in a statement. ""We know we have disrupted your lives. We do not do this lightly. We only do this because this is an emergency."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he welcomed the decision to cease the protests, which had been a ""huge challenge for our over-stretched and under-resourced Metropolitan Police"". Protesters at Parliament Square have been camped in trees for nearly a week, organisers said So far 69 people have been charged in connection with the protest, the Met Police said. Police have extended restrictions at the Marble Arch site, preventing protesters congregating on the road, until Saturday afternoon. A senior Scotland Yard officer has warned that officers will require new powers to deal with demonstrations on a similar scale in the future. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Climate protesters 'making a difference' Who is Greta Thunberg? Giving evidence to the parliamentary Human Rights Committee, Commander Adrian Usher, head of the Metropolitan Police's protection command, said it should not be enough for a protest to be ""peaceful"" to be considered lawful. ""We will conduct a sober review of our tactics against recent protests, but I think it is likely to say the legislation associated with policing protest is quite dated and that policing and protest has moved on and that legislation should follow suit,"" he said. A protester climbed a lamp post an unfurled a banner at Marble Arch Police chiefs have called for greater powers to clear peaceful protests on the scale of Extinction Rebellion Earlier, Extinction Rebellion Youth handed a letter addressed to MPs, to Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott. In response, Ms Abbott said MPs needed to come together to host a ""broad conversation"" on bringing the country's greenhouse gas emissions down. Campaignershave issued three core demands to the government: to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. In a letter to MPs Extinction Rebellion Youth said: ""We are asking you to hear the science, to feel the public's change of heart and to act now to save our futures"" Elliott Cuciurean, 20, believed to be the first climate activist successfully prosecuted over the fresh wave of protests, was spared a fine at a court hearing on Tuesday.

Sri Lanka admits 'major intelligence lapse',"This video can not be played Volunteers provide water, food and support to those mourning the bombing Sri Lanka has admitted a ""major intelligence lapse"" before the Easter Sunday bomb attacks which killed 359 people and wounded more than 500. An Indian intelligence warning from the beginning of the month about planned attacks was not properly shared by the authorities, parliament heard. President Maithripala Sirisena has moved to sack the defence secretary and inspector general of police. Eight of the nine attackers have been identified as Sri Lankan citizens. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who were the victims? The government is investigating whether the Islamic State (IS) group was involved in the attacks which targeted churches and high-end hotels. It has emerged thatone of the attackers once studied in the UK and Australiabefore returning to Sri Lanka. ""We have to take responsibility because unfortunately if the sharing of the intelligence information had been given to the right people, I think that at least this could have been avoided or even minimised,"" said Deputy Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene. Lakshman Kiriella, the leader of parliament, said senior officials had deliberately withheld intelligence about possible attacks. This video can not be played Hero Ramesh was killed in the blast in Batticaloa ""Some top intelligence officials hid the intelligence information purposefully,"" he told MPs. ""Information was there but the top brass security officials did not take appropriate actions."" He said the Indian tip-off had been received on 4 April but, Reuters news agency says, both the president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reportedly did not receive it. President Sirisena replaced Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando and took steps to sack the Inspector General of Police, Pujith Jayasundara. The whereabouts of Islamist preacher Zahran Hashim, who is suspected of being the bombers' ringleader, remain unclear. A man believed to be him appears in an IS video but police do not know whether he detonated one of the suicide bombs or is still at large. His sister told the BBC: ""I came to know about his actions only through the media. Even for a moment, I never thought that he wouldÂ do such a thing. ""I strongly deplore what he has done. Even if he is my brother, I cannot accept this. I don't care what happens to him any more."" This video can not be played The footage shows a man wearing a large backpack calmly walking towards St Sebastian's church Most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and came from ""middle or upper middle class"" families, according to Mr Wijewardene. One of the attackers, named as Abdul Latif Jamil Mohammed, had spent time studying in the UK. A senior Whitehall official told the BBC that he visited south-east England in 2006-7 to study but did not complete a full university degree. Analysis by the BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner The announcement that most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and ""middle class"" is not as surprising as it sounds. Although poverty and lack of opportunities have steered many down a path to terrorism, there are also numerous examples of individuals abandoning a relatively comfortable lifestyle for a violent cause. Ziad Jarrah, one of the 9/11 attackers who hijacked United Airlines flight 93, came from a privileged Lebanese family. More recently, there have been cases of British jihadists who have worked for the NHS, including doctors. The late IS executioner Mohammed Emwazi, aka ""Jihadi John"", attended the University of Westminster in London.  And the original co-founder of al-Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, chose to leave behind a luxurious life in Jeddah to go and fight the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s. Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) but Mr Wickremesinghe said the attacks ""could not have been done just locally"". NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings. The worshipper who blocked a bomber The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? IS said online that it had ""targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka"". It provided no evidence for the claim other than images on social media of the suspected attackers. Police have now detained around 60 suspects in connection with the attack. A state of emergency remains in effect to prevent further attacks. Funerals continued on Wednesday The nearly simultaneous attacks targeted three churches packed for Easter services and three major hotels in the capital, Colombo. An attack on a fourth hotel on Sunday was foiled, Mr Wickremesinghe said. He also warned that further militants and explosives could still be ""out there"" following the attack. One of the targeted hotels, the Kingsbury, has now reopened. The country remains tense with police still looking for suspects and possible further explosives. Cautioning about ""ongoing terrorist plots in the country"", US envoy to Sri Lanka Alaina Teplitz told reporters that terrorists could ""strike without warning"". The first mass funeral was held on Tuesday, as Sri Lanka marked an official day of mourning for the victims. Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services. Some 38 foreign nationals were among the dead, with another 14 unaccounted for. The death toll includes at least eight British citizens and at least 11 Indian nationals. 'I was praying - let that not be Monique' 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' Woman named as eighth UK Sri Lanka victim The mass funeral for about 30 victims took place at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, north of Colombo, which was one of the places targeted in Sunday's blasts.

Iran offers Zaghari-Ratcliffe prisoner swap,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her daughter Gabriella, who she saw during a temporary release from prison Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe could be released from jail in a prisoner swap with Iranians detained in the US and Australia, Iran has suggested. The British-Iranian was jailed for five years in Iran in 2016 after being convicted of spying, which she denies. Speaking in New York, Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif said he felt sorry for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and had done his best to help her. ""Let's have an exchange. I'm ready to do it,"" he said. Mr Zarif said there were Iranians being held in prison in the US, Germany and Australia on what he claimed were phony charges. He highlighted one particular case of an Iranian woman who had given birth in an Australian prison, with her child now growing up outside prison. ""Nobody talks about this lady in Australia,"" he said. ""So, what can I do as a foreign minister? I put this offer on the table publicly now. Exchange them,"" he said, adding that he had the authority to do it. He said he made a previous offer to the US six months ago but got no response. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent At first sight, the Iranian offer of a prisoner swap to release Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe appears positive. These are the first substantive remarks Iran's foreign minister has made about her case since the UK government gave her diplomatic protection last month. British officials had feared that Iran might react negatively to the granting of this new status, which turned the case into a formal legal dispute between both countries. Instead Tehran's first response appears to be the offer of some kind of deal. The move also shows that Iran does indeed seem willing to use Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe for diplomatic leverage, something it has in the past denied. But diplomats do not think this means any deal is immediately on the cards. Prisoner exchanges can take years to arrange. And they are no easier if several different countries are involved. Richard Ratcliffe, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, said he was surprised and disoriented by the announcement. He said he was not sure whether it was a serious proposal or if it was said as part of a wider context. ""Normally my sense with Iran is nothing is flippant, and so it will have a meaning, but it might not be the obvious meaning,"" he said. Mr Ratcliffe said a prisoner swap was only mentioned in one of the 40 or so messages he had received from Iranian authorities about his wife's case. ""It has felt increasingly that we are in the doorway, and we might be held in the doorway for a while, but Nazanin's situation cannot go on for much longer,"" he said. ""It's always good when we're not forgotten."" What is diplomatic protection? What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Iran 'tried to get jailed mum to spy on UK' Briton jailed in Iran begins hunger strike On Wednesday, the Foreign Office said the treatment of all British-Iranians detained in Iran, including Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, was a priority for the government. ""We remain concerned about all of our consular cases and raise them at every level and every opportunity,"" a spokesperson said. Exact figures for the number of British-Iranians held in Iran are not available, and some families do not publicise the cases, for fear of making the situation worse. This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, was a project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and lived in London when she was arrested in Iran in April 2016.

'No passive screen time' for babies,"Babies and toddlers should not be left to passively watch TV or other screens, according to newWorld Health Organization guidelines,external. Sedentary screen time, including computer games, should not happen before a child is two, the WHO says. The limit for two- to four-year-olds is an hour a day and less is better. The UK has no plans to update its own advice on screen use, which sets no time limits, although it says children should avoid screens before bedtime. The UK's Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health insists there is little evidence screen use for children is harmful in itself. 'Worry less' about children's screen use Screen time may harm toddlers The new WHO advice focuses on passive viewing - youngsters being placed in front of a TV or computer screen or handed a tablet or mobile phone for entertainment - and is aimed at tackling child inactivity, a leading risk factor for global mortality and obesity-related ill health. It is the first time the WHO has made recommendations on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep for children under five. As well as warning against passive screen time, it says babies should not spend longer than an hour at a time strapped into a buggy, car seat or sling. The guidelines will be presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow on Sunday. For babies: Be physically active several times a day, including at least 30 minutes' ""tummy time"" - lying on their front No sedentary screen time 14-17 hours' sleep a day, including naps, for newborns - reducing to 12-16 by four to 11 months Should not be restrained (ie strapped into a recliner, seat or sling) for more than an hour at a time For one- and two-year-olds: At least three hours'  physical activity a day No sedentary screen time for one-year-olds and less than an hour for two-year-olds 11-14 hours' sleep a day, including naps Should not be restrained for more than an hour at a time or sit for extended periods of time For three- and four-year-olds: At least three hours' physical activity a day, including at least one of moderate or vigorous intensity Up to an hour of sedentary screen time - less is better 10-13 hours' sleep a day, which may include a nap Should not be restrained for more than an hour at a time or sit for extended periods of time The WHO advice is based on available evidence, but there is still a lack of definitive research into the harms and possible benefits of screen use. However, it was unlikely very young children gained from passive, sedentary viewing, said one of the guideline authors, Dr Juana Willumsen. ""Sedentary time should be made into quality time. Reading a book with your child, for example, can help them develop their language skills. ""A child who is given a tablet to keep them quiet while they are sitting in a pushchair is not getting the same [quality sedentary time]. ""Children need to be given opportunities throughout the day to actively play and we should be reducing sedentary, passive screen time,"" she said. Some TV programmes that encouraged young children to move about while viewing might be OK, she added, particularly if the parent or caregiver was also present to explain and join in. In the US, experts saychildren should not use screens before they are 18 months old,external. In Canada,screen time for children younger than two is not recommended,external. ButUK guidelines set no such limit,external. Dr Max Davie, from the RCPCH, said: ""The restricted screen time limits suggested by the WHO do not seem proportionate to the potential harm. ""Our research has shown that currently there is not strong enough evidence to support the setting of screen time limits. ""It is difficult to see how a household with mixed-age children can shield a baby from any screen exposure at all, as is recommended. ""Overall, these WHO guidelines serve as useful benchmarks to help steer families towards active and healthy lifestyles - but without the right support in place, striving for the perfect could become the enemy of the good."" Dr Tim Smith, a brain development expert at Birbeck, University of London, said parents were being bombarded with conflicting advice, which could be confusing. ""There is currently no clear evidence for the specific duration limits proposed at this age range. ""While the report makes a potentially helpful step in distinguishing sedentary screen time from active screen-based games, where physical activity is required, this remains an oversimplification of the many ways young children and their families engage with screen media."" Paula Morton has two pre-school children Paula Morton, a teacher and mother of two young children, said her son learned a lot from watching programmes about dinosaurs and came out with ""random facts about them"". ""He doesn't just sit there and zone out,"" she said. ""He's obviously thinking and using his brain. ""I don't know how I would make the dinner, cook and clean if he didn't have something to watch."" According to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, parents can ask themselves: Is screen time controlled? Does screen use interfere with what your family want to do? Does screen use interfere with sleep? Are you able to control snacking during screen time? If a family are satisfied with their answers to these questions, then they are likely to be handling screen time well, the college says.

The move also shows that Iran does indeed seem willing to use Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe for diplomatic leverage, something it has in the past denied. But diplomats do not think this means any deal is immediately on the cards. Prisoner exchanges can take years to arrange. And they are no easier if several different countries are involved. Richard Ratcliffe, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, said he was surprised and disoriented by the announcement. He said he was not sure whether it was a serious proposal or if it was said as part of a wider context. ""Normally my sense with Iran is nothing is flippant, and so it will have a meaning, but it might not be the obvious meaning,"" he said. Mr Ratcliffe said a prisoner swap was only mentioned in one of the 40 or so messages he had received from Iranian authorities about his wife's case. ""It has felt increasingly that we are in the doorway, and we might be held in the doorway for a while, but Nazanin's situation cannot go on for much longer,"" he said. ""It's always good when we're not forgotten."" What is diplomatic protection? What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Iran 'tried to get jailed mum to spy on UK' Briton jailed in Iran begins hunger strike On Wednesday, the Foreign Office said the treatment of all British-Iranians detained in Iran, including Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, was a priority for the government. ""We remain concerned about all of our consular cases and raise them at every level and every opportunity,"" a spokesperson said. Exact figures for the number of British-Iranians held in Iran are not available, and some families do not publicise the cases, for fear of making the situation worse.

Sri Lanka admits 'major intelligence lapse'An official says the government must answer for its failure to prevent the Easter Sunday bombings.Asia,"This video can not be played Volunteers provide water, food and support to those mourning the bombing Sri Lanka has admitted a ""major intelligence lapse"" before the Easter Sunday bomb attacks which killed 359 people and wounded more than 500. An Indian intelligence warning from the beginning of the month about planned attacks was not properly shared by the authorities, parliament heard. President Maithripala Sirisena has moved to sack the defence secretary and inspector general of police. Eight of the nine attackers have been identified as Sri Lankan citizens. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who were the victims? The government is investigating whether the Islamic State (IS) group was involved in the attacks which targeted churches and high-end hotels. It has emerged thatone of the attackers once studied in the UK and Australiabefore returning to Sri Lanka. ""We have to take responsibility because unfortunately if the sharing of the intelligence information had been given to the right people, I think that at least this could have been avoided or even minimised,"" said Deputy Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene. Lakshman Kiriella, the leader of parliament, said senior officials had deliberately withheld intelligence about possible attacks. This video can not be played Hero Ramesh was killed in the blast in Batticaloa ""Some top intelligence officials hid the intelligence information purposefully,"" he told MPs. ""Information was there but the top brass security officials did not take appropriate actions."" He said the Indian tip-off had been received on 4 April but, Reuters news agency says, both the president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reportedly did not receive it. President Sirisena replaced Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando and took steps to sack the Inspector General of Police, Pujith Jayasundara. The whereabouts of Islamist preacher Zahran Hashim, who is suspected of being the bombers' ringleader, remain unclear. A man believed to be him appears in an IS video but police do not know whether he detonated one of the suicide bombs or is still at large. His sister told the BBC: ""I came to know about his actions only through the media. Even for a moment, I never thought that he wouldÂ do such a thing. ""I strongly deplore what he has done. Even if he is my brother, I cannot accept this. I don't care what happens to him any more."" This video can not be played The footage shows a man wearing a large backpack calmly walking towards St Sebastian's church Most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and came from ""middle or upper middle class"" families, according to Mr Wijewardene. One of the attackers, named as Abdul Latif Jamil Mohammed, had spent time studying in the UK. A senior Whitehall official told the BBC that he visited south-east England in 2006-7 to study but did not complete a full university degree. Analysis by the BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner The announcement that most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and ""middle class"" is not as surprising as it sounds. Although poverty and lack of opportunities have steered many down a path to terrorism, there are also numerous examples of individuals abandoning a relatively comfortable lifestyle for a violent cause. Ziad Jarrah, one of the 9/11 attackers who hijacked United Airlines flight 93, came from a privileged Lebanese family. More recently, there have been cases of British jihadists who have worked for the NHS, including doctors. The late IS executioner Mohammed Emwazi, aka ""Jihadi John"", attended the University of Westminster in London.  And the original co-founder of al-Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, chose to leave behind a luxurious life in Jeddah to go and fight the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s. Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) but Mr Wickremesinghe said the attacks ""could not have been done just locally"". NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings. The worshipper who blocked a bomber The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? IS said online that it had ""targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka"". It provided no evidence for the claim other than images on social media of the suspected attackers. Police have now detained around 60 suspects in connection with the attack. A state of emergency remains in effect to prevent further attacks. Funerals continued on Wednesday The nearly simultaneous attacks targeted three churches packed for Easter services and three major hotels in the capital, Colombo. An attack on a fourth hotel on Sunday was foiled, Mr Wickremesinghe said. He also warned that further militants and explosives could still be ""out there"" following the attack. One of the targeted hotels, the Kingsbury, has now reopened. The country remains tense with police still looking for suspects and possible further explosives. Cautioning about ""ongoing terrorist plots in the country"", US envoy to Sri Lanka Alaina Teplitz told reporters that terrorists could ""strike without warning"". The first mass funeral was held on Tuesday, as Sri Lanka marked an official day of mourning for the victims. Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services. Some 38 foreign nationals were among the dead, with another 14 unaccounted for. The death toll includes at least eight British citizens and at least 11 Indian nationals. 'I was praying - let that not be Monique' 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' Woman named as eighth UK Sri Lanka victim The mass funeral for about 30 victims took place at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, north of Colombo, which was one of the places targeted in Sunday's blasts.

"Ban standing on long journeys, says VirginThe train operator calls for reservation-only seating, in proposals to the government's rail review.","Virgin Trains has proposed an end to standing on long-distance journeys by managing rail services like flights. The firm argues seats should be sold as reservation-only, as part of a broader break-up of the rail franchise system. The firm, which operates trains on the West Coast Main Line, said customers should have to book a ticket and a seat for a particular train. Its proposal is part of Virgin's submission to a government-commissioned  review into the rail system. Currently, train operators typically accept walk-up fares, meaning they have no control over the number of people getting on a particular train unless it is judged unsafe. They are also obliged to stick to rigid timetables which Virgin Group said leads to some trains so packed that passengers are forced to stand for several hours, while others are mostly empty. Under its plans, Virgin would also discard peak and off-peak pricing tiers.

Virgin described the current system as ""something of a straitjacket"" for operators. It said the process of bundling slots would work in a similar way to how some football broadcasting rights are auctioned. Virgin argues that the move would encourage investment and allow operators to ""innovate and adapt to a changing market"". But unions said the plans would lead to ""total chaos"".

"Fans rejoice as Microsoft keeps PaintAfter suggestions Paint could be removed from Windows, Microsoft says it's staying - ""for now"".Technology","A scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, digitally rendered in Paint by artist Pat Hines Fans of low-fidelity art app Microsoft Paint are rejoicing after it was confirmed it would remain a part of the Windows operation system ""for now"". In 2017, Microsoft had said that Paint would be deprecatedbut it survived. Confusion returned in recent weeks as users questioned whether Paint would be part of the next Window 10 update, which launches in May. AMicrosoft developer confirmed,externalthat Paint would be included - to the relief of many. Sydney-based digital artistMiranda Lorikeet,external, known as ""Lazy Bones"", uses Paint for her work and is sponsored by Microsoft. She told BBC News she was surprised to hear that uncertainty over the program's survival had been raised again. ""The way I discovered it was when I was like six or seven when I was mucking around on the computer,"" she said. ""It's a crappy tool at the end of the day, it's not good, and I think I like using something that is genuinely a rubbish tool to make artwork."" A Microsoft Paint artwork by Miranda Lorikeet It is possible that Microsoft will change Windows 10 so that Paint has to be downloaded separately, rather than being included as a standard app. This would be unfortunate, added Ms Lorikeet, who praised the ""accessible"" nature of the program. Other fans expressed their fondness for the program on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Despite its basic suite of digital paint tools, Paint has attracted interest from patient artists ever since it was launched in the very first version of Microsoft Windows in 1985. Massachusetts-based illustrator Pat Hines, who goes by the name of ""Captain Redblood"", is among those who have harnessed the app to produce astoundingly detailed artworks. In 2017, he released an e-book withillustrations painstakingly produced in Paint,external. ""I use it pretty much every day,"" he told BBC News, adding that his illustrations can take anywhere from 15 to 40 hours to complete. He uses a $7 (Â£5.41) mouse and $200 computer running an old version of Paint. ""The limitations are kind of what dictates my aesthetic with it, it's why I chose it as my primary medium.

Call for investigation into Huawei leaking,"Government ministers are calling for a ""full and proper"" investigation after high-level discussions about the UK using Huawei technology were leaked. The government has approved the supply of equipment by the Chinese telecoms firm for the UK's new 5G data network - despite warnings of a security risk. It is believed the decision was taken at a meeting of the government's National Security Council on Tuesday. One minister said leaking from the council was ""simply not acceptable"". The senior minister told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that leaking the conversations was ""extraordinary...the security council is the holy of holies"". There were ""huge concerns"" over ""getting into bed"" with the telecoms giant, the minister said. Ministers were deciding whether or not to allow equipment from Huawei to be used to construct the new 5G data network - a decision that could have long-term consequences for national security. There are fears that giving the Chinese company a key role could open the UK network to espionage. But Huawei has denied there is any risk of espionage or sabotage, or that it is controlled by the Chinese government. All you need to know about Huawei's problems Huawei: The story of a controversial company Why is UK at odds with cyber-allies over Huawei? What is 5G and what will it mean for you? BT bars Huawei kit from core of 5G network According to the Daily Telegraph,external, Huawei would be allowed to help build the ""non-core"" parts of the UK's 5G network, such as antennas. Prime Minister Theresa May chaired the meeting of the National Security Council on Tuesday, where it is believed the decision was taken. There has been no formal confirmation of Huawei's role in the 5G network and Number 10 said a final decision would be made at the end of spring. The National Security Council is where senior ministers with key security roles meet - and their talks are supposed to be confidential. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was ""real upset"" that the discussions had leaked. A senior minister said there had to be a ""full and proper leak inquiry"", with those responsible losing their jobs if necessary. Conservative backbench MP Sir Nicholas Soames said the inquiry must be a criminal one and that the leak would ""cause our friends and allies to wonder if we can be considered reliable - whoever is responsible should be dismissed [from] the Queen's service"". A source also told our political editor that four cabinet ministers had spoken against Huawei, fearing that security could be compromised. There have beenwarnings in the US since at least 2012that equipment from Huawei poses a security threat. Last year a UK government report said it could provide ""only limited assurance"" that the company's infrastructure did not pose a threat to national security. Now the US wants its allies in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence grouping - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to exclude the company. Australia last year blocked its networks from using Huawei's 5G gear. The current cabinet was memorably described as the ""worst in British political history"" for leaking by the man who, ironically, is meant to be in charge of discipline itself - the chief whip. But for a leak to come from the security council is quite a different order. As many as six ministers are therefore likely to write to Number 10 complaining and calling for a ""full and proper"" inquiry into who divulged the information. Read more from Laura here. 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. Existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns - particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G is also much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45mbps (megabits per second) on average. Experts say 5G - which is starting to be introduced in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster.

Kim Jong-un visits Russia for summit,"This video can not be played North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrives in Vladivostok ahead of Putin summit North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has arrived in the far east of Russia for a summit with President Vladimir Putin. Mr Kim arrived by train in the Pacific Coast city of Vladivostok for his first talks with the Russian president, which are expected to start on Thursday. He was welcomed by officials with a traditional offering of bread and salt. Russia says they will discuss the Korean peninsula's ""nuclear problem"" but Mr Kim is also said to be seeking support after talks with the US failed. US President Donald Trump and Mr Kim met in Hanoi earlier this year to discuss North Korea's nuclear weapons programme but the summit - their second - ended without agreement. What to expect from Putin-Kim meeting What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? The North Korean leader greeted Russian officials warmly on his arrival in Vladivostok. After tasting traditional korovai bread and salt, Mr Kim was entertained by a brass band before he got inside a car flanked by bodyguards who - in now familiar scenes - jogged alongside the vehicle as it departed.

""I arrived in Russia bearing the warm feelings of our people, and as I already said, I hope this visit will be successful and useful,"" Mr Kim told Russian TV earlier, after crossing the border at Khasan. ""I hope that during the talks with respected President Putin, I will be able to discuss in a concrete manner issues relating to the settlement of the situation on the Korean peninsula, and to the development of our bilateral relations."" It is due to take place on Thursday afternoon at about 13:00 (03:00 GMT) on Russky island, just off Vladivostok, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Russian and North Korean national flags are already in place on the island, where the leaders are expected to meet on a university campus. Mr Kim travelled on his armoured train Mr Putin was expected to arrive for the summit later. According to his spokesman, the Kremlin believes the six-party talks on North Korea, which are currently stalled, are the only efficient way of addressing the issue of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. Those talks, which began in 2003, involve the two Koreas as well as China, Japan, Russia and the US. ""There are no other efficient international mechanisms at the moment,"" Mr Peskov told reporters. ""But, on the other hand, efforts are being made by other countries. Here all efforts merit support as long as they really aim at de-nuclearisation and resolving the problem of the two Koreas."" This visit is being widely viewed as an opportunity for North Korea to show it has powerful allies following the breakdown of nuclear talks with the US earlier this year, the BBC's Laura Bicker says. The country has blamed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the collapse of the Hanoi summit in February. Earlier this monthNorth Korea demanded that Mr Pompeo be removed from nuclear talks, accusing him of ""talking nonsense"" and asking for someone ""more careful"" to replace him. The summit is also an opportunity for Pyongyang to show that its economic future does not depend solely on the US, our correspondent adds. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea Mr Kim may also try to put pressure on Moscow to ease sanctions. Analysts believe this summit is a chance for Russia to show that it is an important player on the Korean peninsula. President Putin has been eager to meet the North Korean leader for quite some time. Yet amid the two Trump-Kim summits, the Kremlin has been somewhat sidelined. Russia, like the US and China, is uncomfortable with North Korea being a nuclear state. Senior officials say the Kremlin is hoping to see a reduction in tensions on the peninsula. Mr Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, said the situation there had ""stabilised somewhat"" in recent months. ""Russia intends to help in any way possible to cement that positive trend,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. A South Korean foreign ministry spokesman said Russia ""shares our viewpoints"" on denuclearisation and peace on the peninsula. Nuclear activity seems to be continuing in North Korea, and the country said it had tested a new ""tactical guided weapon"" - thought to be a short-range missile - earlier in April. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union (of which Russia is the main successor state) maintained close military and trade links with its communist ally, North Korea, for ideological and strategic reasons. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, trade links with post-communist Russia shrank and North Korea leaned towards China as its main ally. Under President Putin, Russia recovered economically and in 2014 he wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt in a major goodwill gesture. While it is arguable how much leverage Russia has with the North today, the communist state still regards it as one of the least hostile foreign powers.

UK to allow Huawei to help build 5G,"The government has approved the supply of equipment by Chinese telecoms firm Huawei for the UK's new 5G data network despite warnings of a security risk. There is no formal confirmation but theDaily Telegraph says,externalHuawei will build ""non-core"" components such as antennas. The US wants its allies in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence grouping - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to exclude the company. Huawei has denied that its work poses any risks of espionage or sabotage. But Australia has already said it is siding with Washington - which has spoken of ""serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere"". UK at odds with cyber-allies over Huawei Huawei - The world's most controversial company Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes? 5G: 'A cyber-attack could stop the country' A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has said it is reviewing the supply of equipment for the 5G network and will report in due course. Digital minister Margot James responded to the reports bytweeting,external: ""In spite of Cabinet leaks to the contrary, final decision yet to be made on managing threats to telecoms infrastructure."" According to the Daily Telegraph, Huawei would be allowed to help build the ""non-core"" infrastructure of the 5G network. This would mean Huawei would not supply equipment for what is known as the ""core"" parts - where tasks such as checking device IDs and deciding how to route voice calls and data take place. Huawei, a private company which already supplies equipment for the UK's existing mobile networks, has always denied claims it is controlled by the Chinese government. It said it was awaiting a formal announcement, but was ""pleased that the UK is continuing to take an evidence-based approach to its work"", adding it would continue to work cooperatively with the government and the industry. Ciaran Martin, the head of the National Cyber Security Centre - which oversees Huawei's current UK work - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a framework would be put in place to ensure the 5G network was ""sufficiently safe"". Asked about the potential of a conflict in the position of Five Eyes members, he added: ""In the past decade there have been different approaches across the Five Eyes and across the allied wider Western alliance towards Huawei and towards other issues as well."" 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. The world is going mobile and existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns, particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G is also much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45Mbps (megabits per second) on average and experts say 5G - which is starting to be rolled out in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster. What is 5G and what will it mean for you? Six UK cities named as 5G pioneers BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says it is believed the decision to involve Huawei was taken by ministers at a meeting of the government'snational security council,externalon Tuesday, chaired by Prime Minister Theresa May. The home, defence and foreign secretaries were reported to have raised concerns during the discussions. In atweet,external, shadow Cabinet Office minister Jo Platt said using Huawei equipment would raise ""serious questions"" about the ""government's interests and how they will secure networks"". BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera The decision on Huawei is one of the most significant long-term national security decisions this government will make and was always going to be contentious. 5G will underpin our daily lives in ways that are hard to predict. So does allowing a Chinese company to build those networks put people at risk of being spied on or even switched off? That is the concern from Washington and other critics who wanted the company excluded. But deciding to ban Huawei entirely from the network would have risked slowing down the development of 5G and also upsetting China. The UK believes it has experience in managing the risks posed by Huawei and can continue to do so going forward. But one retired senior intelligence official recently told me his view on what to do about Huawei had changed. In the past, he said, he had believed the policy of managing the risk had been sufficient. But now he was less sure. The reason was not to do with any change in his view of what the company could do. Rather it was about the risks to relationships with close allies, namely those of the Five Eyes and US. Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tugendhattweeted,externalthat allowing Huawei to build some of the UK's 5G infrastructure would ""cause allies to doubt our ability to keep data secure and erode the trust essential to #FiveEyes cooperation"". This video can not be played We explain the controversy around Huawei's 5G tech â using castles Speaking on the Today programme, Mr Tugendhat said the proposals still raised concerns, as 5G involved an ""internet system that can genuinely connect everything, and therefore the distinction between non-core and core is much harder to make"". 'Shoddy' Huawei work risks Westminster ban Huawei sales top $100bn despite backlash Joyce Hakmeh, a research fellow at think tank Chatham House and co-editor of the Journal of Cyber Policy, said the UK's current mobile network needs to be transformed to the ""the next level... quicker, more stable 5G"". But she added the government would be hoping its decision on Huawei did not upset either China or the US. Limiting - but not barring - Huawei technology from the 5G networks would be a ""diplomatic way of managing a difficult situation"" for the UK, said Ms Hakmeh. Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes?

Fans rejoice as Microsoft keeps Paint,"A scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, digitally rendered in Paint by artist Pat Hines Fans of low-fidelity art app Microsoft Paint are rejoicing after it was confirmed it would remain a part of the Windows operation system ""for now"". In 2017, Microsoft had said that Paint would be deprecatedbut it survived.

AMicrosoft developer confirmed,externalthat Paint would be included - to the relief of many. Sydney-based digital artistMiranda Lorikeet,external, known as ""Lazy Bones"", uses Paint for her work and is sponsored by Microsoft.

""The way I discovered it was when I was like six or seven when I was mucking around on the computer,"" she said. ""It's a crappy tool at the end of the day, it's not good, and I think I like using something that is genuinely a rubbish tool to make artwork."" A Microsoft Paint artwork by Miranda Lorikeet It is possible that Microsoft will change Windows 10 so that Paint has to be downloaded separately, rather than being included as a standard app. This would be unfortunate, added Ms Lorikeet, who praised the ""accessible"" nature of the program.

"Calls for MP to quit over ÃÂ£85k salaryJohnny Mercer's salary was funded by Surge Financial, which marketed the collapsed LCF bond scheme.Devon","On top of his pay as an MP, Johnny Mercer receives Â£85,000 a year from Crucial Academy to do four hours work per week A company that marketed a failed bond scheme that lost savers Â£236m has been funding an MP's private salary. Johnny Mercer receives Â£85,000 from Crucial Academy, a company ultimately funded by Surge Financial Limited. Surge Financial Limited took 25% commission for marketing bonds by London Capital and Finance (LCF), which is now in administration. Mr Mercer - who is facing calls from investors to quit as an MP - said he had done nothing wrong. The Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View is a non-executive director of Crucial Academy, which trains military veterans and aims to find them employment. Mr Mercer, himself a former Army officer, is contracted to work 20 hours per month, a rate of more than Â£350 per hour. The basic annual salary,externalfor an MP is Â£79,468, and they also receive expenses to cover the costs of running an office. According to Mr Mercer's register of members' interests, his only other regular income is the Â£85,000 per year from Crucial Academy.

Currently, there are a number of lawyers, some doctors and nurses, and even a football referee in the Commons. But there are some rules they have to follow. All MPs have to declare any individual work payments to the Register of Members' Financial Interests if they are more than Â£100. If, over the course of the year, they earn more than Â£300 from one source, they then have to declare every payment from that employer, however big or small. Government ministers are subject to the same rules, plus they are not allowed to be paid for writing newspaper articles and can't write books about their jobs while in employment.

She said she was never told Surge Financial Ltd was taking 25% commission and was angry some of that money had been funding Mr Mercer's salary. ""Politicians are there for the people, and Johnny Mercer is not thinking about the people,"" she said. ""The best thing for him to do would be resign - or give that money back."" Surge Group Limited and Surge Financial Limited are both owned by Paul Careless Surge Financial takes commission for acting for companies such as London Capital and Finance, which collapsed in February It takes commissions of up to 25% of the capital invested Surge Group is funded entirely by Surge Financial, and invests in various associated businesses including the Crucial Group, whose subsidiary company Crucial Academy employs Johnny Mercer MP Surge Group's independent auditors said Surge Group was reliant on funds from Surge Financial John Wright invested Â£36,000 of his wife's money into LCF after being enticed by the 8% interest rates - far higher than the 0.25% offered by their bank. ""[Mr Mercer is] involved with a company like Surge, which took a quarter of my money for putting adverts on the web recommending LCF as their top buy,"" he said. Mr Wright, a long-time Conservative supporter, said he had lost all faith in Parliament and called for Mr Mercer to stand down. LCF promised returns of 8% for people investing for more than three years The company claims to have trained 80 veterans since July 2018, with more than 72 ""finding gainful employment post-course in the cyber security industry"". Mr Mercer said: ""I totally reject the assertion that I have done anything wrong in working as a non-executive director of Crucial Academy. ""I have sought rigorous assurances that at no stage was capital used from any business with LCF, in Crucial Academy. ""I received those assurances.

Surge Group then loaned Â£325,095 to the Crucial Group, which owns Crucial Academy. An industry expert told the BBC the cost of training 80 people on the courses provided by Crucial would be about Â£240,000. When added to the cost of Mr Mercer's Â£85,000 salary, the total almost exactly matches the amount loaned to Crucial Group.

Mr Wright, a long-time Conservative supporter, said he had lost all faith in Parliament and called for Mr Mercer to stand down. LCF promised returns of 8% for people investing for more than three years The company claims to have trained 80 veterans since July 2018, with more than 72 ""finding gainful employment post-course in the cyber security industry"". Mr Mercer said: ""I totally reject the assertion that I have done anything wrong in working as a non-executive director of Crucial Academy. ""I have sought rigorous assurances that at no stage was capital used from any business with LCF, in Crucial Academy. ""I received those assurances. It now appears there is a historical link between the two, that has been uncovered in the accounts when Surge Group loaned the Crucial Group Â£325,095."" Plymouth MP Johnny Mercer, centre left, and Paul Careless, centre right, owner of Surge Financial Limited, which has ultimately funded Mr Mercer's salary He said having joined the academy ""only last autumn"" he clearly ""had no role"" in setting up the link. ""When this historic link was discovered, the leadership of Crucial Academy immediately implemented a management buy-out and the loan was repaid, in order to ensure the continuing integrity of Crucial Academy,"" Mr Mercer explained. Crucial Academy was ""a good organisation, doing good things, run by good people, with no financial link to London Capital and Finance"", he said. Four targeted over missing millions Compensation unlikely for LCF investors Thousands face ruin as Â£236m firm folds Surge said LCF ""signed off all marketing materials and financial promotions prior to publication"" However, the accounts of Surge Group have been published and show nearly Â£9m was loaned from Surge Financial to Surge Group without which, the auditors said, the company would be unlikely to survive. Surge Group then loaned Â£325,095 to the Crucial Group, which owns Crucial Academy. An industry expert told the BBC the cost of training 80 people on the courses provided by Crucial would be about Â£240,000. When added to the cost of Mr Mercer's Â£85,000 salary, the total almost exactly matches the amount loaned to Crucial Group. In a statement to the BBC, representatives of Surge Group said that all financial links with the Crucial Group had now been severed. London Capital & Finance (LCF) is now in administration after collapsing while owing Â£236m to bondholders It advertised bonds as ISAs, offering returns of 8% despite giving 25% of the money straight to Surge Financial Limited as a commission Nearly 12,000 lost their money, with many investing for the first time with inheritances or pensions Four people were arrested by the Serious Fraud Office in relation to LCF Less than 20% of the lost money is expected to be recovered Update 12 June 2019: The headline of this article has been amended to clarify the source of funding for Mr Mercer's salary.

Saoradh Twitter account is suspendedFacebook has also acted against political party linked to dissident republican paramilitary group.Northern Ireland,"Women smear red handprints on slogans outside the office of a political group linked to the New IRA Social media giant Twitter has suspended an account linked to the dissident republican party Saoradh. Saoradh, which translates as liberation in Irish, has the support of the New IRA. The paramilitary group carried out the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, whose funeral took place on Wednesday. Paddy Gallagher, spokesman for Saoradh, said that the party was aware the account had been suspended. 'New IRA' admits responsibility for killing 'Her commitment to truth was absolute' Timeline of Irish dissident activity He added that there would be ""no comment"". In a statement, a Twitter spokesperson said: ""We have clear Terms of Service in place which we enforce when violations are identified."" A Saoradh spokesperson said that the party would not comment on the suspension According to its terms of service, common reasons for suspending a Twitter account include spam, account security at risk and abusive tweets or behaviour. In January it emerged that Saoradh was taking legal action against Facebook for removing pages from its platform. Last week the group claimed that one of its accounts linked to a Belfast branch had been removed. On Monday friends of Ms McKee staged a protest outside the office of Saoradh in Derry. A message of condolence was added to the mural at Free Derry corner in the city A number of women smeared red paint in handprints on republican slogans outside the office. Police were present but no arrests were made. The prime minister attended the funeral of murdered journalist in Belfast on Wednesday. The President of Ireland, the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also attended the service at St Anne's Cathedral. Floral tributes to Lyra McKee have been left in the Creggan estate where she was shot Before the service, her family paid tribute to the ""gentle, innocent soul"" whose ""desire to bring people together made her totally apolitical"". Ms McKee was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle when she was shot after a masked gunman fired towards police and onlookers. A statement issued by Saoradh on Friday sought to justify the use of violence on Thursday night.

The actor was also known for voicing the characters Colonel K and Baron Silas Greenback on the 1980s children's animated series Danger Mouse.

Joe Grundy was fond of his daughter-in-law Clarrie, played here by Rosalind Adams He added: ""Ted's Joe Grundy was a brilliant creation because Ted was a brilliant actor - and a truly lovely man and great company member. ""A cherished part of our team, I am sure all of us will agree that working with Ted was a rare privilege and he will be very much missed.""

London climate protest 'to end Thursday',"This video can not be played Police have cleared the final Extinction Rebellion road block at Marble Arch A climate protest that has disrupted parts of London for nine days is to end on Thursday, organisers say. Police cleared Extinction Rebellion's final road block in Marble Arch earlier and arrested 22 people, bringing the total to 1,088 since protests began. Specialist equipment has been deployed in Parliament Square to remove protesters camping in trees. Makeshift camps at Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge were removed earlier in the week. One protester told the BBC: ""This is our last stand."" Organisers said a closing ceremony would be held at 18:00 BST on Thursday at Speaker's Corner, Hyde Park. ""We will leave the physical locations but a space for truth-telling has been opened up in the world,"" they said in a statement. ""We know we have disrupted your lives. We do not do this lightly. We only do this because this is an emergency."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he welcomed the decision to cease the protests, which had been a ""huge challenge for our over-stretched and under-resourced Metropolitan Police"". Protesters at Parliament Square have been camped in trees for nearly a week, organisers said So far 69 people have been charged in connection with the protest, the Met Police said. Police have extended restrictions at the Marble Arch site, preventing protesters congregating on the road, until Saturday afternoon. A senior Scotland Yard officer has warned that officers will require new powers to deal with demonstrations on a similar scale in the future. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Climate protesters 'making a difference' Who is Greta Thunberg? Giving evidence to the parliamentary Human Rights Committee, Commander Adrian Usher, head of the Metropolitan Police's protection command, said it should not be enough for a protest to be ""peaceful"" to be considered lawful. ""We will conduct a sober review of our tactics against recent protests, but I think it is likely to say the legislation associated with policing protest is quite dated and that policing and protest has moved on and that legislation should follow suit,"" he said. A protester climbed a lamp post an unfurled a banner at Marble Arch Police chiefs have called for greater powers to clear peaceful protests on the scale of Extinction Rebellion Earlier, Extinction Rebellion Youth handed a letter addressed to MPs, to Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott. In response, Ms Abbott said MPs needed to come together to host a ""broad conversation"" on bringing the country's greenhouse gas emissions down. Campaignershave issued three core demands to the government: to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. In a letter to MPs Extinction Rebellion Youth said: ""We are asking you to hear the science, to feel the public's change of heart and to act now to save our futures"" Elliott Cuciurean, 20, believed to be the first climate activist successfully prosecuted over the fresh wave of protests, was spared a fine at a court hearing on Tuesday. More actions are expected in the future.

"UK to allow Huawei to help build 5GThe US wants its intelligence allies, including the UK, to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant.UK","The government has approved the supply of equipment by Chinese telecoms firm Huawei for the UK's new 5G data network despite warnings of a security risk. There is no formal confirmation but theDaily Telegraph says,externalHuawei will build ""non-core"" components such as antennas. The US wants its allies in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence grouping - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to exclude the company. Huawei has denied that its work poses any risks of espionage or sabotage. But Australia has already said it is siding with Washington - which has spoken of ""serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere"". UK at odds with cyber-allies over Huawei Huawei - The world's most controversial company Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes? 5G: 'A cyber-attack could stop the country' A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has said it is reviewing the supply of equipment for the 5G network and will report in due course. Digital minister Margot James responded to the reports bytweeting,external: ""In spite of Cabinet leaks to the contrary, final decision yet to be made on managing threats to telecoms infrastructure."" According to the Daily Telegraph, Huawei would be allowed to help build the ""non-core"" infrastructure of the 5G network. This would mean Huawei would not supply equipment for what is known as the ""core"" parts - where tasks such as checking device IDs and deciding how to route voice calls and data take place. Huawei, a private company which already supplies equipment for the UK's existing mobile networks, has always denied claims it is controlled by the Chinese government. It said it was awaiting a formal announcement, but was ""pleased that the UK is continuing to take an evidence-based approach to its work"", adding it would continue to work cooperatively with the government and the industry. Ciaran Martin, the head of the National Cyber Security Centre - which oversees Huawei's current UK work - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a framework would be put in place to ensure the 5G network was ""sufficiently safe"". Asked about the potential of a conflict in the position of Five Eyes members, he added: ""In the past decade there have been different approaches across the Five Eyes and across the allied wider Western alliance towards Huawei and towards other issues as well."" 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. The world is going mobile and existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns, particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G is also much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45Mbps (megabits per second) on average and experts say 5G - which is starting to be rolled out in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster. What is 5G and what will it mean for you? Six UK cities named as 5G pioneers BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says it is believed the decision to involve Huawei was taken by ministers at a meeting of the government'snational security council,externalon Tuesday, chaired by Prime Minister Theresa May. The home, defence and foreign secretaries were reported to have raised concerns during the discussions. In atweet,external, shadow Cabinet Office minister Jo Platt said using Huawei equipment would raise ""serious questions"" about the ""government's interests and how they will secure networks"". BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera The decision on Huawei is one of the most significant long-term national security decisions this government will make and was always going to be contentious. 5G will underpin our daily lives in ways that are hard to predict. So does allowing a Chinese company to build those networks put people at risk of being spied on or even switched off? That is the concern from Washington and other critics who wanted the company excluded. But deciding to ban Huawei entirely from the network would have risked slowing down the development of 5G and also upsetting China. The UK believes it has experience in managing the risks posed by Huawei and can continue to do so going forward. But one retired senior intelligence official recently told me his view on what to do about Huawei had changed. In the past, he said, he had believed the policy of managing the risk had been sufficient. But now he was less sure. The reason was not to do with any change in his view of what the company could do. Rather it was about the risks to relationships with close allies, namely those of the Five Eyes and US. Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tugendhattweeted,externalthat allowing Huawei to build some of the UK's 5G infrastructure would ""cause allies to doubt our ability to keep data secure and erode the trust essential to #FiveEyes cooperation"". This video can not be played We explain the controversy around Huawei's 5G tech â using castles Speaking on the Today programme, Mr Tugendhat said the proposals still raised concerns, as 5G involved an ""internet system that can genuinely connect everything, and therefore the distinction between non-core and core is much harder to make"". 'Shoddy' Huawei work risks Westminster ban Huawei sales top $100bn despite backlash Joyce Hakmeh, a research fellow at think tank Chatham House and co-editor of the Journal of Cyber Policy, said the UK's current mobile network needs to be transformed to the ""the next level... quicker, more stable 5G"". But she added the government would be hoping its decision on Huawei did not upset either China or the US. Limiting - but not barring - Huawei technology from the 5G networks would be a ""diplomatic way of managing a difficult situation"" for the UK, said Ms Hakmeh. Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes?

The scandal of the lost babies," The walls were high and the wrought-iron gates opened on to a long, winding avenue. At the end was a once-grand three-storey Georgian mansion in one of the better-off, sleepy suburbs of Cork city. It was 1960, and Bridget arrived with a single suitcase and a rose-pink coat with a belt. She felt immediately uneasy. “Everything was hidden from the outside, surrounded by shrubbery and trees. People couldn't see in.” Once through the door, her clothes, her savings book, her small stud earrings and her bracelet were taken from her. She was given a uniform - clogs and a starched denim dress. Bridget - like the other arrivals - was told not to speak about her life outside. All of them were given a different name. Hers was Alma - but she couldn’t get used to it. None of the girls had committed any crime. But they had two things in common. They were all unmarried and they were all pregnant. At Bessborough, the long rooms of the girls’ quarters were on the top floor, looking out towards the cemetery. The nuns called them all “girls”, but in truth the residents were anything from 13 to 30. Bridget was 17 when she arrived. She was there because she had sinned, or so the nuns told her, by falling pregnant. This was a mother and baby home, not a prison. Legally, Bridget and the other girls could have left at any time. But in practice it wasn’t as simple as that. Any girl who ran away might find themselves rounded up by the police. And in any case, for the vast majority there was just nowhere else for them to go. Each girl admitted to the home knew they would give birth there and stay until their baby was adopted - as long as three years. They weren’t allowed outside except for short walks around the grounds and they had to be accompanied. They were all given jobs. Some worked in the kitchens or in the red-bricked laundry building. Bridget worked nights in a small room off the labour ward. Even in the quieter times, there was little chance to rest. “We had to scrub the passageway… a massive wide passage with multi-coloured tiles on it.” Occasionally she fed babies in a nursery lined with rows of cots. Another nursery held toddlers up until the age of three. Bridget and the other girls were only allowed to spend about 30 minutes with each child. She doesn’t remember any toys. “Some of the babies, they’d still hold their hands out. They didn’t want you to let go of them.” Nuns and children at Bessborough When a new girl arrived the others would quiz her about what was in the papers, desperate for some connection with life outside. There were no calendars. All the days merged into one - an anxious wait for the birth and then for the inevitable separation from their children. The girls signed release forms to allow for the adoptions but they were under overwhelming pressure to do so. They knew they couldn’t return to their families with their babies. Joan, who worked in the kitchen, showed Bridget her toddler. He had a rash on his face and every day she prayed it wouldn’t heal in the hope that would stop him being adopted. Another mother, Josie, showed off the intricate cardigans she was making for a small, dark-haired child. The little girl, who now goes by the name Mari Steed, went on to be adopted by a Catholic family in the US. Mari Steed as a toddler (left) June Goulding, a midwife who worked there in 1951, describes in her memoir the procedure for handing over the children. Without warning, babies and toddlers would be washed and dressed up in new clothes and given to their mothers. They would walk down a long passageway to a door that opened on to the nuns’ quarters where the children would be taken from their arms. “The girls stood at the doorways watching this heartrending scene and the mother’s uncontrolled crying could be heard all along that long corridor,” wrote June Goulding. “I witnessed the horrific ritual that would be repeated for each and every mother and baby in this hellhole.” Just a few months earlier, Bridget had been a teenager in love. They were dancehall sweethearts. He was a man from Tipperary and 10 years older. At the weekends she would cycle five or six miles to the nearest dance to see him. “My first love. God, my first lesson in life. I thought he was lovely.” Bridget was working as a cook in a big house for a racehorse-owning family outside Clonmel, the largest town in the county. Most girls her age didn’t know the basic facts about sex and relationships. Contraception was illegal. Catholic leaflets encouraged girls to avoid kissing. It was a conservative time. The Country Girls, Edna O’Brien’s novel about the love lives of two young women, had been banned by the Irish censor, publicly burned and dismissed as “filth”. “I didn’t know anything about babies,” says Bridget. So when she began to feel unwell, and guessed that she might be pregnant, she had no idea what to do. Abortion was out of the question. It was against the law and destined to remain so until 2019. But having a child out of wedlock was also a scandal. “It was worse than murder in those days. It really was an appalling crime,” Bridget remembers. For unmarried mothers, renting a flat or holding down a job wasn’t an option. There were no state allowances for women raising children alone. And those children faced the stigma of being “illegitimate”, whispered about and judged by the community. There was one way out. Agencies like Miss Brophy’s International Bureau offered Irish girls live-in domestic jobs in the UK. All fares were paid. A girl could set off almost immediately. To Bridget, it seemed like the perfect solution. She would be gone before anyone figured out what was wrong. Within a few weeks she had a job with a family in Golders Green in north London. She hadn’t told her boyfriend yet, but she felt sure he would follow her to England. In the event, she never heard from him again. Bridget barely remembers what life was like with the family. But she felt anxious all the time. She had escaped Ireland but she hadn’t escaped her feelings of shame and guilt. She needed to speak to someone, she couldn’t keep this secret bottled up. “I was desperate, absolutely desperate,” she says. Bridget went to confession at a Catholic church and left feeling relieved. The priest had told there was a way she could get help. There were people she could talk to, who would understand her predicament. He gave her an address. Piccadilly Circus, London, circa 1960 Young pregnant women like Bridget had been escaping to London and other big English cities for years. There was still stigma in England around “illegitimate” children - and there were mother and baby homes, albeit with less punitive regimes. But Irish women could enjoy a level of anonymity in England that would have been impossible back home. But there was always disquiet. In 1936, the journalist Gertrude Gaffney wrote about the “dance hall evil”. “All concerned feel it unfair that they in England should be saddled with the expense and worry of them,” she wrote in the Irish Independent. By 1955, London County Council had so many Irish babies left in their care that a dedicated children’s officer was appointed to spend six months each year in Ireland to try to find homes for them. Social workers were said to have used the acronym PFI (pregnant from Ireland). But there were Catholic charities in England which had a solution. Bridget had been given the address of the Catholic Crusade of Rescue in west London. A repatriation scheme for women and girls in her situation had been set up in the 1930s by the Irish government, according to Lindsey Earner Byrne, lecturer in modern history at University College Dublin. One motive was to stop babies from being adopted by non-Catholic families. Catholic charities in the UK went to great lengths to persuade, and sometimes even coerce, young women to return home. With no money, no friends and no support, Bridget felt like she had no choice. In 1960, 113 Irish women were sent back, according to an Irish charity that collated figures in its annual reports. Bridget was one of them. She was told that a woman wearing a white armband would meet her on the boat, and men in a black car would meet her at the harbour when she arrived. “I didn’t suspect anything, what eventually happened. Not at all.” It was a sunny day in August and she was on her way to Bessborough. There were punishments at Bessborough. Bridget was made to stand in the corner for hours while heavily pregnant. Her baby came three weeks early. Her waters broke in the middle of the night and she was shivering with cold. It was dark. Another girl guided her down to the labour ward. There was no pain relief and no kind words. Bridget’s baby boy was born on the third day of labour. She was exhausted but loved him immediately. “I still see him. His eyes were looking around. Very inquisitive, beautiful, perfect baby, blonde, blue eyes and he sort of had hair as if it was combed beautifully.” Bridget knew she would not be able to keep her son. She wanted to call him William, a less common name in Ireland at the time. She thought it would be easier for her to trace him later. But the nuns said Gerard was a more appropriate Catholic name for would-be adoptive parents. In the end, Gerard William was what went on the birth certificate. For the first couple of days he was feeding well. But on the third day he had difficulty swallowing and started to get sick. So did Bridget. William’s health worsened and the other girls told her he had been put in the “dying room”. Bridget’s own health deteriorated too. She says she didn’t receive any medication. She begged the nuns to send for a doctor for William. They told her he had a congenital defect but Bridget has always believed this wasn’t the case. “Things stay in your memory that you cannot forget. He was a fighter - a good strong healthy baby, if he had got the proper treatment.” But she says it took a further 16 days for William to be sent to hospital. He died less than three weeks after that. Bridget didn’t get to see him. She says she wasn’t told where he was buried or anything more about what had happened. She left the home just a week after William’s death. With no baby to give up for adoption, the home would no longer receive state funding for her. Bridget remembers being very weak, and hampered by an abscess in her leg where she had been injected. But she knew she would have to find work quickly. “There was nobody you could talk to about this, absolutely nobody. You had to keep working.” Bridget didn’t want to admit to her family, who still thought she was in London, what had happened. She decided to return to London and quickly found another job. Emigrating, she says, was a lifeline after all she had been through. She went to the library and read all the books that were banned in Ireland. Bridget married and had three daughters, and got on with a new life. Bridget’s story is not an isolated tragedy. Her experience was repeated at at least 17 other homes, affecting thousands of women across the country. In recent years Ireland has confronted theseparate scandal of the Magdalene Laundries, institutions where women and girls were confined and used as forced labour. Now the spotlight has moved on to the mother and baby homes. Over the past two decades Irish investigative journalists have uncovered a string of allegations against the homes, and irregularities surrounding the adoption of thousands of Irish children to America in the 50s and 60s. The film Philomena, starring Judi Dench, intensified attention. In 2014, a local historian went public with her theory that almost 800 babies could be buried in a septic tank at a formermother and baby home in Tuamin Galway. The international outcry that followed forced the government to act, announcing a full-scale investigation into 18 homes across the country. The accusations against the homes include: • Burying babies in unmarked and unrecorded graves • Coercing women and girls to remain • Poor medical care • High mortality rates for babies • Overwhelming pressure on mothers to allow babies to be adopted • Emotional and physical abuse • Illicit adoption; that babies were effectively “sold” to families in the US and elsewhere without proper procedures or consent • Allowing medical trials without informed consent • Use of dead babies in anatomical research • Falsification of records So why did Ireland end up with a system of mother and baby homes? After independence from the UK in the 1920s, the new state had to decide how to deal  with people needing government assistance. The new government was also worried about sexual morality and unmarried mothers, says Lindsey Earner Byrne. The Catholic Church had an important role in providing social services for the cash-strapped Irish state. Officials called on religious orders to set up special homes to deal with unmarried mothers. These mother and baby homes received public funds and were inspected by the state. Bessborough was one of the first. The house and its grounds were taken over by the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in 1922. Nuns at Bessborough By the 1930s the order was running two other homes. Questions were occasionally asked about the regimes in these places. Bessborough was even shut down for a short period in the late 1940s by Ireland’s chief medical officer, after an investigation revealed that 100 babies out of 180 had died in a single year. There were never legal powers to detain women in the homes, according to Earner Byrne. But official documents made the girls sound like criminals. “First offenders” describes those pregnant outside marriage for the first time, often judged less harshly than “repeat offenders”, deemed to be “hardened sinners”. In 1930, the matron in charge of Bessborough said that “a number of the girls are weak willed and have to be maintained in the Home for a long period to safeguard them against a second lapse”. Many had been referred to the homes by priests or doctors, with the consent of their families, who banished them to institutions rather than risk the stigma of supporting them. Some entered of their own free will as they felt they had nowhere else to go. It is estimated that somewhere between 7,000-10,000 mothers gave birth in Bessborough, according to journalist Conall Ó Fátharta who has followed the scandal closely. Rights groups say that up to 90,000 unmarried women and girls had their babies forcibly taken from them since independence. The true figure will probably never be known. Tuam, the most notorious of the homes, closed in 1961. Bessborough remained open until the late 1990s. Carmel is Bridget’s eldest daughter. After growing up in London, she ended up marrying an Irishman and moving to Cork in the early 1990s. Their bungalow sits on a hilltop. As well as raising their own children, the couple have also fostered. Standing on the crest of the hill, Carmel could look down on the lough and a well-kept 60-acre estate of an 18th Century mansion. “I could have moved anywhere around the city in Cork… but I literally circle Bessborough about five, six times a day.” She heard rumours about this place. But she could never have imagined she was looking down at a place of immense significance for her. Growing up, Carmel remembers her mother’s life as a flurry of activity - meetings and visits and social events. But she always had a sense that there was something in the background, something bothering her. One morning in 1996, Bridget was visiting and, after being out all day, broke down in the kitchen. Carmel had never witnessed grief like it. “She couldn’t speak to me, she couldn’t actually get the words out of her mouth to tell me.” Carmel heard a secret family history. She had a brother who she never knew existed. But that brother was dead. Thirty-five years on, her mother was still struggling to find the courage to try to uncover the truth. “It was heartbreaking. She was helpless, she didn’t know what to do next.” That day, Bridget had gone back to Bessborough but she couldn’t face knocking on the door. A couple of days later, she tried again, knocked on the door and asked the questions she’d always wanted to ask. The sister, a short, stocky woman with cropped grey hair, took her into a small room lined with folders full of files. Eventually she found Bridget’s. Then she led her down the avenue, on to a small path, towards a walled off area beside an old stone tower. This was the Angels’ Plot - an area no more than 500 square feet. Small, plain metal crosses marked the graves of about two dozen nuns. The sister tapped her foot on a small, unmarked patch of grass, about three-quarters of the way down on the right-hand side. “Your baby is buried there,” she said confidently. The nun told Bridget she wouldn’t be allowed to put a marker there to remember William. Decades after Bridget left Bessborough, the home was still taking in young women. Deirdre Wadding always thought her family loved her unconditionally. But when she became pregnant as an 18-year-old university student in 1981, she couldn’t believe their reaction. Her mother, who had always been caring and approving, suddenly became cold and distant, a stranger to her. “That trauma has never quite left me. I was filled with shame and guilt.” Deirdre Wadding Her parents shipped Deirdre off to Bessborough. Arrangements were made so she could continue her teacher training studies while in the home. Conditions had improved by the 1980s. The food was OK and there was better antenatal care. In the evenings the girls would watch TV in the dayroom. There was no uniform. Deirdre says the girls could leave the grounds with permission - they could go for a walk to the local shop in the village if they liked. Some had private rooms. But Bessborough still felt like its own little universe, a house of secrets cut off from the world outside. Deirdre’s new name was Ciara. A cover story was concocted about her having been sent to hospital for tests. Letters were sent via forwarding addresses so no-one would find out where the residents really were. For a while, Deirdre shared a room with a 13-year-old girl who sobbed herself to sleep at night. Even in 1981 the social pressure exerted on girls like Deirdre was immense. It’s easy to understand why they would think there was no alternative but to stay there. Deirdre’s family made it clear she wouldn’t be able to stay in her family home. She says she didn’t want to give her baby up for adoption, but didn’t feel like she had any choice. “We believed we couldn’t leave there. If I had walked out that gate, there was nowhere I could have gone. “That was the level of indoctrination, that was how society worked.” When the cover story started to wear thin, Deirdre’s father rang the home to see if they could “speed things up”. Her baby was induced three weeks early. It was a difficult birth, a forceps delivery on a metal trolley. When it was all over, she was delighted to see her son. “He was utterly beautiful. I was just mesmerised, at the one time just besotted and in love and devastated and distraught.” That was the last time she would see him for 19 years. Unlike in Bridget’s time, women in the 1980s did not have to stay there until adoptive parents were found. Deirdre’s parents collected her just three days after the birth. They left through the big oak doors as if nothing had happened. She was inconsolable. “It was like my heart just broke open. I don’t think I’ve ever cried as much in my life since. It was just unbearable grief leaving my child behind.” A girl she was friends with inside the home pressed a handwritten note into her hand before she left. She still has it. It read: “A brave soldier never looks back.” Deirdre learned to shut away her emotions, dissociate from them. She has been reunited with her son but the contact is sporadic. It’s a loving relationship, but a complicated one. “I can never have him back. Adoption is a life sentence. It doesn’t stop. You are blood but you are not that person.” Catherine Coffey O’Brien spent most of her early life in and out of children’s homes. In 1989, a few months after she left care, she passed through Bessborough’s doors. Catherine was from a traveller background. Her dad was an alcoholic. She didn’t fit in at the care homes. The way she spoke, the way she wore her hair, her earrings, it all seemed to be unacceptable. Catherine Coffey O’Brien “I fought internally every day of my life in those institutions to keep my identity.” When she left at 16 there were gaps in her education and she felt abandoned. Sometimes she had to sleep rough. When she found out she was pregnant her partner didn’t want to know. After a chat with social services, she found herself on the train to Cork City, on her way to Bessborough. Attitudes hadn’t changed towards girls like her. “If you’d kept your legs closed you wouldn’t be in there. That was what was said.” Catherine had jobs to do too. Cleaning, helping out in the kitchen and laundry, decorating the prayer room. To this day, she still hates the smell of beeswax polish. The number of residents had shrunk by 1989, but still most women gave up their babies for adoption. It was expected that Catherine would do the same. The thought terrified her. But if her baby wasn’t adopted, her child could end up in care. “I wanted to do everything right by my child. I didn’t want him to have the same upbringing as me.” One of the nuns trusted Catherine because she worked hard. She started sending her on errands in a taxi to Cork city. A plan began to form in her head. One day, when she felt brave enough, she just wouldn’t return. Another girl - Angela (not her real name) - persuaded Catherine to take her along. They made their escape. Angela tried to go back to her parents’ house in Kerry but they couldn’t bear the scandal. They sent her back to Bessborough to have her son. Catherine was luckier, taken in by her child’s paternal grandmother. She had her son two months later in hospital in Kerry. In moments of dark humour she says she and Angela were the Thelma and Louise of Bessborough. But Catherine’s escape didn’t start a revolution at the home. There was no mass exodus. Numbers just slowly dwindled until the doors closed for good in 1998. Raising her son and three more children that followed was a battle for Catherine. She was strict with them. “I was trying to break the cycle… so that my children would never know the inside of a dormitory.” But her experiences of Bessborough left her with crippling doubts about her abilities as a mother. “I was constantly on my toes... constantly trying to be the great mother.” For a long time, she had nightmares that her children would be taken away. She couldn’t stop checking they were still in the cot. The scandal over the treatment of women like Bridget, Deirdre and Catherine has been brewing in Ireland for over 20 years. But the women say their experiences have never been officially recognised by the Irish state or by the Catholic Church. There have beenstrong words from politiciansbut there has never been a full state apology. No compensation has been paid. While visiting Ireland, Pope Francis made a general apology for the Church’s treatment of mothers and babies and senior Irish churchmen have also made expressions of regret. But there has been no comprehensive apology and redress from the Church in Ireland. All three women gave evidence to thestate inquiryopened in 2015 - the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation. On 17 Aprilit reported backon just one aspect of the scandal - burial practices. According to the commission, more than 900 children died at Bessborough - or at hospital having been transferred. But the burial places of only 64 are known. The Congregation of the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary - the order that ran Bessborough - said it did not know where the other 800 children who died at the home were buried. The commission said this was “difficult to comprehend”. The Angels’ Plot at Bessborough - the place Bridget was shown - only has one child buried there, the commission says. It is not thought to be William. The commission thinks it is likely that at least some of the children are buried in unmarked graves in the rest of the 60-acre Bessborough site, but does not consider it feasible to excavate the whole area. At least 14 women also died at Bessborough. Their burial places are also unknown. “I feel deeply for the families who may not get the answer they are seeking,” said Children's Minister Katherine Zappone. “In a lot of cases, the evidence is not there.” William may be buried at Cork District Cemetery, but the commission has been unable to get records from that cemetery. A couple of years ago, Bridget placed a plaque for William at Bessborough, but her search goes on. And the commission’s final report into Ireland’s system of mother and baby homes has been postponed until 2020, after a series of delays and extensions. Until it concludes, there will be no apology and no practical help for any of the people who spent time in these homes. Mothers and children who passed through Bessborough’s doors report difficulties and long delays obtaining documents when trying to trace their relatives or access health records to find out if they were part of vaccine trials carried out in the 1960s. Mari Steed, one of the Bessborough children that Bridget remembers, was adopted at 18 months by a Catholic family in Philadelphia. She eventually found her mother Josie in the UK and visited every year until her mother's death in 2013. When Mari was able to get her full file from Bessborough she found that she had been in a vaccine trial in the 1960s. Her mother Josie said she had not been consulted. Mari believes there will be no accountability for what went on at the home. Noelle Brown was adopted from Bessborough in 1967. She decided to trace her birth parents in 2002. Countless delays followed. Her mother had died in the 1990s. A few months ago she got her full file from Bessborough. But it has been heavily redacted and much of the rest is barely legible. She still can’t find out whether she was subject to the medical trials that were carried out there in the 1960s and 70s. She says the commission told her it is prohibited from disclosing any information related to the trials. Noelle Brown is now an actress “You come up against this all the time. Another bloody letter from someone going, ‘Disappear, we’re not going to help you’.” Under current Irish legislation, adopted people have no statutory right to their birth certificates or early life files. Bridget has struggled - with the help of Carmel - to get her documents. But she can’t get more evidence on the medical treatment that preceded William's death. A leaked memo from the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2012 stated that the infant mortality rate in Bessborough between 1935 and 1960 was about seven to eight times higher than the national rate at the time. But until all the records are forensically analysed, the history of what really happened inside Bessborough will remain unknown. With the state inquiry’s report taking so long to complete, women like Bridget, Deirdre and Catherine are losing hope of finding the truth. Bridget blames the Church. “If they told the truth, even now if they came out with the truth it would be something. But they’re still denying what happened.” The office of the Archbishop of Armagh, Catholic Primate of All Ireland, when contacted for this piece said it would not respond until the report was published. The Congregation of the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary refuses to discuss individual cases. “All records... were passed to Health Service Executive (HSE ) in 2011. We are co-operating fully with the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation.” The last time a representative gave an interview was in June 2014 to the now-defunct TV3. Sister Sarto denied claims that adoptions were forced and said nuns were providing a service to women cast aside by society with no other option. “We gave our lives to looking after the girls. And we’re certainly not appreciated for doing it.” Deirdre thinks the system she went through was the fault of both Church and state, but also of a wider society where people looked the other way. “We did nothing wrong and yet we suffered for it, we suffered loss, banishment, judgement, trauma, grief.” Even when the inquiry’s report is published, the women worry that the legislation underpinning it suggests the full archive will be sealed. Catherine Coffey O’Brien The evidence gathered by the inquiry cannot be used in criminal or civil proceedings. Nor will former residents be guaranteed access to their own personal information. Catherine can’t understand why. “It’s almost like they’re eradicating the past,” she says. “What more are they trying to hide?” Bridget still has such vivid memories of walking through the heavy wooden doors of Bessborough House. It’s as if it happened only yesterday. Now, she lives in a ground-floor flat in west London, and leaves the radio on all the time. Silence makes her dwell on things so much, she says. The street where she lives is just a short distance from Westminster Cathedral, where she goes from time to time, to hear the choir. She can sit there for hours. Sometimes she lights a candle for William. She has thought of him every day for 58 years. “It was complete loneliness,” she says. She has rarely spoken about the three suicide attempts and the spell in a psychiatric hospital when she returned to London in 1960. She has never fully recovered from the trauma of William’s death and her experiences of Bessborough. “I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll be like this until I die, that I cannot get better. I’ll never be able to forgive them,” she says. Over the past couple of years, she has sought support in a private Bessborough Facebook group. Speaking in a safe space brings some solace to her and others. But the shame she felt for all those years still makes her reticent to speak out publicly. She’s spoken to the BBC under a pseudonym. Bridget wants only one thing from the state inquiry - to know exactly where William is and to be buried with him. When he was born she couldn’t do anything to help him. By telling his story, and her own, she wants to honour the memory of the little boy she lost. Built with Shorthand"

Calls for MP to quit over Â£85k salary,"On top of his pay as an MP, Johnny Mercer receives Â£85,000 a year from Crucial Academy to do four hours work per week A company that marketed a failed bond scheme that lost savers Â£236m has been funding an MP's private salary. Johnny Mercer receives Â£85,000 from Crucial Academy, a company ultimately funded by Surge Financial Limited. Surge Financial Limited took 25% commission for marketing bonds by London Capital and Finance (LCF), which is now in administration. Mr Mercer - who is facing calls from investors to quit as an MP - said he had done nothing wrong. The Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View is a non-executive director of Crucial Academy, which trains military veterans and aims to find them employment. Mr Mercer, himself a former Army officer, is contracted to work 20 hours per month, a rate of more than Â£350 per hour. The basic annual salary,externalfor an MP is Â£79,468, and they also receive expenses to cover the costs of running an office. According to Mr Mercer's register of members' interests, his only other regular income is the Â£85,000 per year from Crucial Academy.

Currently, there are a number of lawyers, some doctors and nurses, and even a football referee in the Commons. But there are some rules they have to follow. All MPs have to declare any individual work payments to the Register of Members' Financial Interests if they are more than Â£100. If, over the course of the year, they earn more than Â£300 from one source, they then have to declare every payment from that employer, however big or small. Government ministers are subject to the same rules, plus they are not allowed to be paid for writing newspaper articles and can't write books about their jobs while in employment. Ministers are also meant to wait for three months after they leave the post before taking another job outside of the government.

She said she was never told Surge Financial Ltd was taking 25% commission and was angry some of that money had been funding Mr Mercer's salary.

Surge Group Limited and Surge Financial Limited are both owned by Paul Careless Surge Financial takes commission for acting for companies such as London Capital and Finance, which collapsed in February It takes commissions of up to 25% of the capital invested Surge Group is funded entirely by Surge Financial, and invests in various associated businesses including the Crucial Group, whose subsidiary company Crucial Academy employs Johnny Mercer MP Surge Group's independent auditors said Surge Group was reliant on funds from Surge Financial John Wright invested Â£36,000 of his wife's money into LCF after being enticed by the 8% interest rates - far higher than the 0.25% offered by their bank. ""[Mr Mercer is] involved with a company like Surge, which took a quarter of my money for putting adverts on the web recommending LCF as their top buy,"" he said. Mr Wright, a long-time Conservative supporter, said he had lost all faith in Parliament and called for Mr Mercer to stand down.

Surge Group then loaned Â£325,095 to the Crucial Group, which owns Crucial Academy. An industry expert told the BBC the cost of training 80 people on the courses provided by Crucial would be about Â£240,000.

LiveLook back on the FM's statement,"Nicola Sturgeon says a second independence referendum should take place ""within this parliamentary term"" The FM sets out an aim to have legislation on the statute books by the end of this year Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw says Scotland has had enough of constitutional politics Labour and the Lib Dems also criticise the first minister, while the Greens urge Ms Sturgeon to ""fire the starting gun"" on indyref2 Craig Hutchison and Louise Wilson This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon calls for indyref2 by 2021 Holyrood elections That's all from Holyrood Live on Wednesday 24 April 2019. Nicola Sturgeon said she wants to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the country is taken out of the EU. The first minister told Holyrood that she would introduce legislation soon to set the rules for another vote. But she indicated that she would need the agreement of the UK government before actually holding a referendum. Downing Street has previously said it will not grant a new Section 30 order, which underpinned the 2014 referendum. Ms Sturgeon claimed this position was ""unsustainable"" and challenged her party to increase support and demand for independence. But the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""As we have been repeatedly clear, Scotland has already had an independence referendum in 2014 and voted decisively to remain in the United Kingdom. This should be respected. Our position hasn't changed."" Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick says last night's reception at Holyrood showed the importance of investment in research. Mr Fitzpatrick praises the work of the MS Society to find a cure for MS. He says Stacey Adam made one demand last night that he tell the chamber he has found a cure. The minister apologises that he cannot do that, but he points to Â£500,000 for clinical research in neurological conditions and cites other funding streams.

Wanted: New Bank of England boss,"The government has launched the recruitment process for a new governor for the Bank of England. The current governor Mark Carney will step down on 31 January 2020 after more than six years in the post. For the first time the government has hired a recruitment firm - Sapphire Partners -  to help with the search. The job description,externalhas been placed on the public appointments website. The annual salary is Â£480,000 - unchanged since 2013. It states that candidates must be able to demonstrate the ability to lead ""a complex and powerful financial institution"". Interviews will be held over the summer and the appointment will be made by the government in the autumn. ""Finding a candidate with the right skills and experience to lead the Bank of England is vital for ensuring the continuing strength of our economy and for maintaining the UK's position as a leading global financial centre,"" the chancellor said in a statement. With the Bank of England governor's job being crucial when it comes to our financial wellbeing, it is likely that approaches to candidates are already being made behind closed doors. The chancellor has previously speculated that the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit might put off some applicants. But it's still a prime job - with a base salary of Â£480,000. There's no shortage of potential internal candidates - such as Bank Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent or Chief Economist Andy Haldane. Then there's former Deputy Governor Andrew Bailey, and former rate-setter Nemat Shafik. But the use of a firm of headhunters for the first time implies the chancellor is keen for this to be a wide sweep of talent in what is, after all, the world's financial capital - and he is under pressure to consider more female candidates. And, as with the incumbent, the search could go beyond our borders. Raghuram Rajan, a former head of India's central bank, is another name that's been touted. But given the current political situation, the next governor is almost certain not to hail from elsewhere in the EU. On its website,,externalthe recruitment firm Sapphire Partners, which been employed to carry out the search describes itself as ""advocates for women in business"", and it is run by five female partners. Sapphire's appointment could be seen as an attempt to quell criticism over gender diversity. Last May, the Bank's failure to appoint another woman to its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was described as ""truly staggering"". Currently the nine-strong MPC - which votes on interest rate decisions each month - has only one female member. The job description also emphases the ability to inspire confidence ""on the international stage"", and experience at a financial institution such as the Bank for International Settlements or the International Monetary Fund. The preference for international experience suggests the Bank could be looking for a foreign candidate. Last September, the Treasury confirmed that Mr Carney would extend his term until 2020, saying it would support a ""smooth exit"" from the European Union. Officially the post is for eight years, but Mr Carney agreed to a five-year term with the option of a further three. Mr Carney has ""helped steer the UK economy through a challenging period,"" Mr Hammond said. Mark Carney has been governor of the Bank of England for more than six years ""Under Mark's leadership the Bank of England has been at the forefront of reforms to make our financial system safer and more accountable,"" he added. The Bank of England governor wields immense power in the UK financial system, as they can influence the course of interest rates and also set priorities for the Bank in managing risks to the financial system. The Bank governor is the chair of the three central committees at the Bank of England: The Monetary Policy Committee which sets interest rates The Financial Policy Committee which monitors risks in the financial system The Prudential Regulation Authority which regulates financial firms Last year Mr Carney, who is Canadian, received total pay of Â£881,574. That included an accommodation allowance of Â£250,000, which the Bank says reflects the difference in the cost of living in London rather than Ottawa.

WHO: No 'passive' screen time for babies,"Babies and toddlers should not be left to passively watch TV or other screens, according to newWorld Health Organization guidelines,external. Sedentary screen time, including computer games, should not happen before a child is two, the WHO says. The limit for two- to four-year-olds is an hour a day and less is better. The UK has no plans to update its own advice on screen use, which sets no time limits, although it says children should avoid screens before bedtime. The UK's Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health insists there is little evidence screen use for children is harmful in itself. 'Worry less' about children's screen use Screen time may harm toddlers The new WHO advice focuses on passive viewing - youngsters being placed in front of a TV or computer screen or handed a tablet or mobile phone for entertainment - and is aimed at tackling child inactivity, a leading risk factor for global mortality and obesity-related ill health. It is the first time the WHO has made recommendations on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep for children under five. As well as warning against passive screen time, it says babies should not spend longer than an hour at a time strapped into a buggy, car seat or sling. The guidelines will be presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow on Sunday. For babies: Be physically active several times a day, including at least 30 minutes' ""tummy time"" - lying on their front No sedentary screen time 14-17 hours' sleep a day, including naps, for newborns - reducing to 12-16 by four to 11 months Should not be restrained (ie strapped into a recliner, seat or sling) for more than an hour at a time For one- and two-year-olds: At least three hours'  physical activity a day No sedentary screen time for one-year-olds and less than an hour for two-year-olds 11-14 hours' sleep a day, including naps Should not be restrained for more than an hour at a time or sit for extended periods of time For three- and four-year-olds: At least three hours' physical activity a day, including at least one of moderate or vigorous intensity Up to an hour of sedentary screen time - less is better 10-13 hours' sleep a day, which may include a nap Should not be restrained for more than an hour at a time or sit for extended periods of time The WHO advice is based on available evidence, but there is still a lack of definitive research into the harms and possible benefits of screen use. However, it was unlikely very young children gained from passive, sedentary viewing, said one of the guideline authors, Dr Juana Willumsen. ""Sedentary time should be made into quality time. Reading a book with your child, for example, can help them develop their language skills. ""A child who is given a tablet to keep them quiet while they are sitting in a pushchair is not getting the same [quality sedentary time].

"WHO: No 'passive' screen time for babiesChildren under two should not be given screens or TV to keep them quiet, new guidelines say.Health","Babies and toddlers should not be left to passively watch TV or other screens, according to newWorld Health Organization guidelines,external. Sedentary screen time, including computer games, should not happen before a child is two, the WHO says. The limit for two- to four-year-olds is an hour a day and less is better. The UK has no plans to update its own advice on screen use, which sets no time limits, although it says children should avoid screens before bedtime. The UK's Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health insists there is little evidence screen use for children is harmful in itself. 'Worry less' about children's screen use Screen time may harm toddlers The new WHO advice focuses on passive viewing - youngsters being placed in front of a TV or computer screen or handed a tablet or mobile phone for entertainment - and is aimed at tackling child inactivity, a leading risk factor for global mortality and obesity-related ill health. It is the first time the WHO has made recommendations on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep for children under five. As well as warning against passive screen time, it says babies should not spend longer than an hour at a time strapped into a buggy, car seat or sling. The guidelines will be presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow on Sunday. For babies: Be physically active several times a day, including at least 30 minutes' ""tummy time"" - lying on their front No sedentary screen time 14-17 hours' sleep a day, including naps, for newborns - reducing to 12-16 by four to 11 months Should not be restrained (ie strapped into a recliner, seat or sling) for more than an hour at a time For one- and two-year-olds: At least three hours'  physical activity a day No sedentary screen time for one-year-olds and less than an hour for two-year-olds 11-14 hours' sleep a day, including naps Should not be restrained for more than an hour at a time or sit for extended periods of time For three- and four-year-olds: At least three hours' physical activity a day, including at least one of moderate or vigorous intensity Up to an hour of sedentary screen time - less is better 10-13 hours' sleep a day, which may include a nap Should not be restrained for more than an hour at a time or sit for extended periods of time The WHO advice is based on available evidence, but there is still a lack of definitive research into the harms and possible benefits of screen use. However, it was unlikely very young children gained from passive, sedentary viewing, said one of the guideline authors, Dr Juana Willumsen. ""Sedentary time should be made into quality time. Reading a book with your child, for example, can help them develop their language skills. ""A child who is given a tablet to keep them quiet while they are sitting in a pushchair is not getting the same [quality sedentary time]. ""Children need to be given opportunities throughout the day to actively play and we should be reducing sedentary, passive screen time,"" she said. Some TV programmes that encouraged young children to move about while viewing might be OK, she added, particularly if the parent or caregiver was also present to explain and join in.

Lyra McKee 'was planning engagement',"This video can not be played ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" A priest received a standing ovation at Lyra McKee's funeral when he asked why it took her death to unite politicians. Politicians attended a vigil in Londonderry after her murder, and also her funeral in Belfast on Wednesday. Fr Martin Magill asked: ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" However, DUP MP Sammy Wilson said he was not convinced it marked a turning point to restore power-sharing. Profile: Lyra McKee In pictures: Mourners pay respects Call for Irish border fix after McKee death Leo Varadkar, Theresa May and Michael D Higgins sat at the front of St Anne's Cathedral Ms McKeewas shot dead on Thursdayas she observed rioting in the Creggan area of Derry. A dissident republican paramilitary group, the New IRA,said its members killed her. Prime Minister Theresa May, President of Ireland Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and other politicians were at the service. Irish President Michael D Higgins consoles Ms McKee's partner Sara Canning Ms McKee was an avid fan of Harry Potter A friend told mourners at her funeral that Ms McKee revealed her plans to propose to her partner Sara Canning just hours before she was murdered. Stephen Lusty said she showed him pictures of the engagement ring. ""She showed me pictures of the ring she had bought for Sara and told me of the fabulous plans she had of her proposal in May,"" said Mr Lusty. ""She made me put a date in my diary for the wedding in Donegal in 2022 and gave me strict instructions to wear my kilt, which she always wanted to borrow, adorn it with some Harry Potter."" DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn FÃ©in's Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI Political leaders from Belfast, Dublin and London, all under the one roof. The disagreements over Brexit and the return of the Stormont Assembly were put into context by matters of life and death. But those political disputes were not forgotten; quite the opposite. The message from the pulpit to political leaders in Northern Ireland was clear - sort out your differences now, don't wait. The funeral took two hours. Those involved in the service hope its impact will be long lasting and far reaching. Ms McKee's sister, Nichola Corner, told mourners: ""In the words of Lyra herself, we must change our own world, one piece at a time. Now let's get to work."" Hundreds gathered for the funeral of Ms McKee, who was from a Catholic background, at a Protestant cathedral. The congregation was led by Ms McKee's partner, mother Joan McKee, brothers Gary and David and sisters Joan, Nichola and Mary. Her family chose the location due to its reputation as a ""shared space"" in a divided city. Many friends of the journalist and campaigner for LGBT rights wore Harry Potter-themed T-shirts, scarves and badges to the service. Ms McKee was an avid fan of the series. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral in Belfast's St Anne's Cathedral Messages of condolence left by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Prime Minister Theresa May At the beginning of the service, the Anglican dean of Belfast, the Very Reverend Stephen Forde, said: ""Lyra was a person who broke down barriers and reached across boundaries, this was her hallmark in life, this is her legacy in death. ""She was a child of the Good Friday agreement. She was a primary school pupil in north Belfast when the agreement was signed. ""She grew up to champion its hope for a society that was free from the prejudices of the past."" Grief and outrage over Ms McKee's murder has sparked hopes there is now momentum to break the political deadlock in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government since January 2017,when the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. On Wednesday, NI Secretary Karen Bradley said she intended tohold talks with Stormont party leaders in a bid to make progress. This video can not be played Family, friends and political leaders mourn Lyra McKee The Democratic Unionist Party's Sammy Wilson told BBC News NI that his party had offered solutions, including a time-limited process running parallel alongside the running of the assembly. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald rejected Mr Wilson's criticisms. ""He knows that the issues that have held us back are issues of equality and recognition,"" she said. ""This stalemate is not acceptable and we need to act to resolve it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Three people have been arrested over the murder, and all have been released without charge. Speaking after her funeral, Northern Ireland's top police officer said Ms McKee ""cared passionately about issues and worked hard and with integrity"". ""Of course that is in complete contrast to those people who came out of the shadows last Thursday night, fired shots at police lines, hitting Lyra and fatally injuring her,"" said Chief Constable George Hamilton. ""I suppose the outpouring of condemnation from the communities of Derry, Creggan all standing together in Creggan last Friday, was something I think was quite unique and quite different."" Members of the public stood outside the church to pay their respects to Ms McKee Ms McKee had written for publications including Private Eye, the Atlantic, Mosaic Science and Mediagazer. She had also signed a two-book deal with the publisher Faber and Faber, with her forthcoming book The Lost Boys due out in 2020. The hashtag #IStandWithLyra has been trending on Twitter, which Ms McKee used prolifically. Comedian Patrick Kielty, who is from Northern Ireland,tweeted:,external""Today Lyra McKee is laid to rest. She believed in peace, tolerance and equality. The exact opposite of those responsible. They will never win because Lyra will always be the future. And her truth will continue to be told. #IStandWithLyra"" Fellow members of the National Union of Journalists formed a guard of honour at the cathedral. The union described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. There was also a gathering at Guildhall Square in Derry for those who could not attend the funeral.

GalleryIn pictures: Mourners pay respects,"Mourners at St Anne's cathedral in Belfast were asked to wear Hufflepuff, Harry Potter or Marvel related items to the funeral, in recognition of Ms McKee's favourite films. Crowds of mourners stood solemnly as the hearse carrying Ms McKee's coffin arrived at the Church of Ireland cathedral. Friends of Ms McKee arrived at the service wearing Harry Potter Hufflepuff T-shirts in tribute to her love of the books. Lyra relished difference and embodied an alternative vision of a Northern Ireland at peace, a friend told the thanksgiving service. Addressing the packed congregation, Fr Martin Magill urged the dissident republican group that murdered the journalist to walk away from violence. Reflecting on the way in which politicians had united in their condemnation of the murder, Fr Magill asked: ""Why does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" Members of the public who could not enter the packed cathedral followed proceedings outside on mobile phones. Lyra broke down barriers in a divided community in Northern Ireland, mourners were told, as politicians separated over identity issues were urged to get back to work. Prime Minister Theresa May, who flew into Belfast for the funeral, described Ms McKee as ""a journalist who died doing her job with great courage"". Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar, who sat beside Mrs May and Irish President Michael D Higgins, said: ""We cannot allow those who want to propagate violence, fear and hate to drag us back to the past."" Sinn FÃ©in vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, and Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, were among political leaders in St Anne's Cathedral for the funeral. Mrs Foster sat alongside the leader of DUP rival Sinn FÃ©in, Mary Lou McDonald, and the party's vice president, Michelle O'Neill. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said those responsible for Ms McKee's death ""have nothing to offer anyone in Northern Ireland"". Crowds attended a vigil organised by Mid Ulster Trade Union Council in Cookstown, holding photos of Ms McKee and the message: âWe Stand with Lyra.â Members of the public also gathered at the Guildhall in Londonderry to pay their respects.

Floral tributes to Lyra McKee have been left in the Creggan estate where she was shot Saoradh, which translates as liberation in Irish, has the support of the dissident republican group the New IRA. A protest by friends of Ms McKee took place on Monday outside an office in Derry used by dissident republican political groups. A number of women smeared red paint in hand prints on republican slogans outside the office. Police were present. They filmed, but did not make any immediate arrests. Bishop Donal McKeown said the ""small"" group of dissident republicans in Derry is a ""danger to all of us"". He told the BBC's Sunday Sequence programme that people in the Creggan estate were ""disgusted at what happened"".

Sturgeon wants indyref2 by 2021,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says a second independence referendum will need a transfer of power from Westminster Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the country is taken out of the EU. The first minister told Holyrood that she would introduce legislation soon to set the rules for another vote. But she indicated that she would need the agreement of the UK government before actually holding a referendum. Downing Street has previously said it will not grant a new Section 30 order, which underpinned the 2014 referendum. Ms Sturgeon claimed this position was ""unsustainable"" and challenged her party to increase support and demand for independence. But the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""As we have been repeatedly clear, Scotland has already had an independence referendum in 2014 and voted decisively to remain in the United Kingdom. This should be respected. Our position hasn't changed."" Will there be indyref2 before May 2021? UK government 'will say no indyref2' What is the SNP's Brexit policy? Ms Sturgeon has faced calls from some within the SNP - which will hold its conference at the weekend - and the wider independence movement to hold a referendum sooner rather than later. She told MSPs that to ""rush into an immediate decision before a Brexit path has been determined would not allow for an informed choice to be made"" about the future. However, the first minister added: ""If we are to safeguard Scotland's interests, we cannot wait indefinitely. ""That is why I consider that a choice between Brexit and a future for Scotland as an independent European nation should be offered in the lifetime of this parliament. ""I can confirm that the Scottish government will act to ensure that the option of giving people a choice on independence later in this term of parliament is progressed."" The next Scottish Parliament election is due to be held in May 2021. This video can not be played Brexit versus Scottish independence Ms Sturgeon believes she has a mandate to hold a second independence referendum as a result of the SNP's victory in the 2016 Holyrood elections - with the party's manifesto stating a vote should take place if there was a ""material change of circumstances"" such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will. The first minister said she hoped a ""framework Bill"" - legislation paving the way for a referendum - will be in place by the end of this year. She said: ""We do not need a transfer of power such as a Section 30 order to pass such a framework Bill, though we would need it to put beyond doubt or challenge our ability to apply the bill to an independence referendum."" The first minister insisted: ""If we are successful in further growing the support and the demand for independence, then no UK government will be able to stop the will of the people or stop that will being expressed."" The SNP conference will be held at the weekend - with Ms Sturgeon due to speak on Sunday The first minister extended an invitation to other parties, including those opposed to independence, to come forward for their own proposals for Scotland's constitutional future. She said: ""The immediate opportunity we now have is to help stop Brexit for the whole UK - and we should seize that opportunity. But if that cannot be achieved, dealing with the consequences of Brexit and facing up to its challenges will be unavoidable. ""I believe that the case for independence is stronger than ever. I will make that case, but I know others take a different view. ""So, as we take the necessary legislative steps over the next few months, I will also seek to open up space for us to come together and find areas of agreement as mature politicians should."" But she predicted that if the only alternative presented by opposition politicians was a ""failed and damaging status quo"", then ""the process of change will pass them by and support for independence will grow"". Analysis by Sarah Smith, Scotland editor Nicola Sturgeon knows that the Westminster government will almost certainly refuse to allow another referendum within the next two years - so she needs to find a way to keep the constitutional argument alive while there is little prospect of an imminent vote. The SNP know that by proposing another referendum they will be accused by those who do not support independence of introducing a divisive political issue at the worst possible time. So the first minister is challenging other parties who do not support Scottish independence to come forward with their own ideas for constitutional change, promising that the SNP will engage fully and in good faith. Ms Sturgeon is very deliberately talking of trying to find compromise and consensus amongst politicians - saying Scotland can do things differently from Westminster. It is an appeal that is clearly meant to reach beyond other party leaders and straight to voters who may not welcome independence, but might well appreciate the approach the first minister is proposing. The first minister also announced plans to establish a Citizens Assembly to consider Scotland's future, which she said had been done in Ireland to ""help find consensus on issues where people have sharply divided opinions"". She said this would bring together a representative cross-section of Scotland with an independent chair, and be tasked with considering: What kind of country are we seeking to build? How can we best overcome the challenges we face, including those arising from Brexit? What further work should be carried out to give people the detail they need to make informed choices about the future of the country? Scotland rejected independence by 55% to 45% in the 2014 referendum - with opinion polls suggesting support for independence remains largely unchanged five years later. Ms Sturgeon initially called for a second referendum after the Brexit vote in 2016, butput her plans on holdafter the SNP lost 21 seats in the general election the following year. Downing Street says the prime minister is still of the view that there should not be another independence referendum Speaking after Ms Sturgeon's statement, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said people in Scotland had ""voted decisively in 2014 to remain part of the UK, on a promise that the referendum would settle the issue for a generation"". He added: ""Instead of respecting that result, Nicola Sturgeon continues to press for divisive constitutional change when it is clear that most people in Scotland do not want another independence referendum. The UK government will stand up for them. ""Nicola Sturgeon needs to listen to the views of the Scottish people and concentrate on improving Scotland's economy and schools, not continually trying to orchestrate upheaval and division."" Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's statement to MSPs Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard accused Ms Sturgeon of ""using her office as first minister to put the interests of the SNP before the interests of our country"". He said: ""Her statement today is not about Brexit, this is about Nicola Sturgeon trying to pacify her party members and back benchers ahead of the SNP's conference"". The pro-independence Scottish Greens broadly welcomed the first minister's statement.

Saoradh social media accounts suspended,"Women smear red handprints on slogans outside the office of a political group linked to the New IRA Social media giant Twitter has suspended an account linked to the dissident republican party Saoradh. Saoradh, which translates as liberation in Irish, has the support of the New IRA. The paramilitary group carried out the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, whose funeral took place on Wednesday. Paddy Gallagher, spokesman for Saoradh, said that the party was aware the account had been suspended. 'New IRA' admits responsibility for killing 'Her commitment to truth was absolute' Timeline of Irish dissident activity He added that there would be ""no comment"". In a statement, a Twitter spokesperson said: ""We have clear Terms of Service in place which we enforce when violations are identified."" A Saoradh spokesperson said that the party would not comment on the suspension According to its terms of service, common reasons for suspending a Twitter account include spam, account security at risk and abusive tweets or behaviour. In January it emerged that Saoradh was taking legal action against Facebook for removing pages from its platform. Last week the group claimed that one of its accounts linked to a Belfast branch had been removed. On Monday friends of Ms McKee staged a protest outside the office of Saoradh in Derry. A message of condolence was added to the mural at Free Derry corner in the city A number of women smeared red paint in handprints on republican slogans outside the office. Police were present but no arrests were made. The prime minister attended the funeral of murdered journalist in Belfast on Wednesday. The President of Ireland, the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also attended the service at St Anne's Cathedral. Floral tributes to Lyra McKee have been left in the Creggan estate where she was shot Before the service, her family paid tribute to the ""gentle, innocent soul"" whose ""desire to bring people together made her totally apolitical"". Ms McKee was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle when she was shot after a masked gunman fired towards police and onlookers. A statement issued by Saoradh on Friday sought to justify the use of violence on Thursday night.

Ann Widdecombe to stand for Brexit Party,"This video can not be played Ann Widdecombe: 'Whole nation fed up to back teeth' Former Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe has announced she is set to return to politics - for the Brexit Party. Ms Widdecombe, 71, said she would still vote Conservative in the upcoming local elections but would stand as a candidate for Nigel Farage's new party in the European elections. She said she wanted to ""fire a very loud warning shot across the bows"" of the established parties. The former shadow home secretary has been retired since 2010. Ms Widdecombe told BBC News she was standing out of ""total frustration"" and to show Parliament to ""get on with it"" or see their seats ""in danger"". Calls for progress in Brexit deal talks Tories mull rule change to challenge Theresa May The life of MEPs in Brexit limbo Annunziata Rees-Mogg to stand for Brexit Party She added: ""Britain is an international laughing stock. Parliament is beyond parody, and the whole nation is fed up to the back teeth and just wants a resolution. ""I believe that if the Brexit Party can make enormous gains in the European elections and win overwhelmingly, that will send shockwaves - both in Labour heartlands and in Tory shires. ""It will make MPs rethink what they are doing as it will be a big reaffirmation of the people's vote."" Ann Widdecombe appeared in the 2010 series of Strictly Come Dancing 1987 - Elected as Conservative MP for Maidstone 1994 - Made a minister in the Department of Employment 1995 - Becomes a minister in the Home Office 1998 - Appointed shadow health secretary 1999 - Appointed shadow home secretary 2010 - Retires from politics but continues to write 2010 - Appears on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing 2018 - Finishes as the runner-up in Celebrity Big Brother 2019 - Announces decision to stand as an MEP candidate for the Brexit Party The UKhas been given an extension to the Brexit process until 31 October, meaning participation in the European elections on 23 May looks likely. In addition to Mr Farage's new venture,Change UK - formerly The Independent Group - launched its European election campaignin Bristol on Tuesday. Interim leader Heidi Allen said Change UK was ""the home of the Remain alliance"". Meanwhile, cross-party talks between the government and Labour, aimed at forging a common way forward on Brexit, are continuing amid recriminations at the slow pace of progress. Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said that while the discussions with Labour were ""serious"" they were proving ""difficult"" in some areas, and that progress was needed ""urgently"" to enable Britain to leave the EU as soon as possible. Labour, however, put the blame for lack of progress on the government's refusal to shift on its ""red lines"". The European Parliamentary elections are expected to take place in the UK on 23 May - if the UK has not left the EU by that date. The UK is divided into 11 regions and parties can put forward a list of candidates for each one.

Sinead Quinn said friends of Ms McKee would be wearing T-shirts like this one to the funeral They said they were thankful for the huge outpouring of sympathy in recent days, and that she should be remembered as ""someone who spoke to and made friends with anybody and everybody, no matter what their background"". That will be one of the themes of the funeral service, with Protestant and Catholic clergy taking part and politicians from across the political divide in attendance. The journalist and campaigner for LGBT rights is survived by her partner, mother, two brothers and three sisters. Her funeral is to be held at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast, and the service will be led jointly by the Anglican dean of Belfast, the Very Reverend Stephen Forde, and Fr Martin Magill at 13.00 BST. By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI In life and in death, Lyra McKee is bringing people together in Belfast. The funeral of this 29-year-old woman, from a Catholic background, is taking place in a Protestant cathedral. Her family chose the cathedral due to its reputation as a ""shared space"" in a divided city. It may be Church of Ireland in its status and governance, but it has strong ecumenical links and even has a chapel of unity. The death of Ms McKee was a horrific reminder of the old Northern Ireland. Many are hoping that her funeral will be a symbol of something new. Ms McKee's partner, Sara Canning, said the service would be a ""celebration of her life"". ""If people would like to wear Hufflepuff, Harry Potter or Marvel related T-shirts I know she would love it,"" Ms Canning said. Secretary of State Karen Bradley will be among the dignitaries attending the funeral, while the Irish government's representatives include the foreign minister, Simon Coveney. Dissident republican group the New IRAadmitted responsibility for the journalist's murder, according to the Irish News. Three people have been arrested over the shooting, but all have been released without charge. Fr Joe Gormley, who anointed Ms McKee after she was shot dead, told BBC News NI there was still a ""great deal of shock"" in Derry. Sara Canning (centre) was ""planning to grow old"" with her partner Lyra McKee ""But people are also reflecting and they know that we are faced with a choice in life,"" he said. ""We either go back to the dark days or move forward."" He said he was willing to ""sit down and talk"" to those responsible. Lyra McKee, who was also a campaigner for LGBT rights, gave a TED talk in 2017 Fellow members of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) are to form a guard of honour at the cathedral. The union described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. CiarÃ¡n Ã MaolÃ¡in, the union's Belfast secretary, described her as ""intelligent, determined and very witty"". There will be a gathering at Guildhall Square in Derry at 13:00 BST for those who cannot attend her funeral.

Sri Lanka bomber 'studied in UK',"This video can not be played Volunteers provide water, food and support to those mourning the bombing One of the attackers behind the Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka once studied in the UK, officials say, as further details on the bombers emerge. He visited south-east England in 2006-7 to study but did not complete a full university degree, a senior Whitehall official told the BBC. The attacker later did a course in Australia, Sri Lanka's deputy defence minister said. The death toll has risen to 359, with more than 500 people wounded. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said the Islamic State (IS) group may be linked to the blasts. IS has said it carried out the attacks, which targeted churches and high-end hotels, although it did not provide direct evidence of its involvement. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who were the victims? In another development, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena replaced Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando and took steps to sack the Inspector General of Police, Pujith Jayasundara. Police have identified eight out of nine attackers - one of whom was a woman - with no foreigners among them Most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and ""middle class"" The US envoy to Sri Lanka warned there were ""ongoing terrorist plots"" in the country Police have now detained around 60 people in connection with the attacks This video can not be played Hero Ramesh was killed in the blast in Batticaloa A Whitehall official confirmed the name of the bomber who had visited the UK as Abdul Latif Jamil Mohammed. Sri Lankan Deputy Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said the attacker had gone on to do ""his postgraduate in Australia before coming back to settle in Sri Lanka"". Confirmation that he studied in the UK in the mid-2000s would tend to cast doubt on the likelihood of his being radicalised so long ago, says the BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner. This video can not be played The footage shows a man wearing a large backpack calmly walking towards St Sebastian's church It also points to his being in his early to mid-30s at the time of the attacks, our correspondent adds. Mr Wijewardene added that most of the attackers had been ""well educated and come from... middle or upper middle class"" families. ""They are financially quite independent and their families are quite stable financially,"" he said. Two of the bombers are reportedly brothers and the sons of a wealthy Colombo spice trader. They detonated their explosives at the Shangri-La and the Cinnamon Grand hotels, police sources told the AFP news agency. Analysis by the BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner The announcement that most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and ""middle class"" is not as surprising as it sounds. Although poverty and lack of opportunities have steered many down a path to terrorism, there are also numerous examples of individuals abandoning a relatively comfortable lifestyle for a violent cause. Ziad Jarrah, one of the 9/11 attackers who hijacked United Airlines flight 93, came from a privileged Lebanese family. More recently, there have been cases of British jihadists who have worked for the NHS, including doctors. The late IS executioner Mohammed Emwazi, aka ""Jihadi John"", attended the University of Westminster in London.  And the original co-founder of al-Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, chose to leave behind a luxurious life in Jeddah to go and fight the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s. Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) but Mr Wickremesinghe said the attacks ""could not have been done just locally"". ""There had been training given and a co-ordination which we are not seeing earlier,"" he said. The worshipper who blocked a bomber The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? Police have now detained around 60 suspects in connection with the attack. A state of emergency remains in effect to prevent further attacks. The nearly simultaneous attacks targeted three churches packed for Easter services and three major hotels in the capital, Colombo. There were emotional scenes outside St Anthony's Shrine in Colombo An attack on a fourth hotel on Sunday was foiled, Mr Wickremesinghe said. He also warned that further militants and explosives could still be ""out there"" following the attack. One of the targeted hotels, the Kingsbury, has now reopened. The country remains tense with police still looking for suspects and possible further explosives. Two controlled explosions of suspect packages were carried out on Wednesday, including one near a popular cinema in Colombo. Cautioning about ""ongoing terrorist plots in the country"", US envoy to Sri Lanka Alaina Teplitz told reporters that terrorists could ""strike without warning"". IS said online that it had ""targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka"". It provided no evidence for the claim but shared an image on social media of eight men purported to be behind the attack. The group's last territory fell in March, but even then experts had warned it does not mean the end of IS or its ideology. Mr Wijewardene has also told parliament that NTJ was linked to another radical Islamist group he named as JMI. He gave no further details. 'I was praying - let that not be Monique' 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' Woman named as eighth UK Sri Lanka victim He also said ""preliminary investigations"" indicated thatthe bombings were in retaliation for deadly attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings. The Sri Lankan government is facing scrutiny after it emerged the authorities were warned about a possible attack. Security services had been monitoring the NTJ but the prime minister and the cabinet were not warned, ministers said. On Tuesday, President Sirisena promised ""stern action"" over the failure to pass on the warnings and said he would restructure the country's police and security services. The first mass funeral was held on Tuesday, as Sri Lanka marked an official day of mourning for the victims. Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services. Some 38 foreign nationals were among the dead, with another 14 unaccounted for. The death toll includes at least eight British citizens and at least 11 Indian nationals. The mass funeral for about 30 victims took place at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, north of Colombo, which was one of the places targeted in Sunday's blasts. Another funeral service was scheduled for later on Tuesday. A moment of silence was also observed at 08:30 on Tuesday, reflecting the time the first of six bombs detonated.

The worshipper who blocked a bomber,"Ramesh Raju stopped an attacker entering a church full of worshippers The family of one victim who died in Sunday's bomb blasts in Sri Lanka say his actions helped save lives. Ramesh Raju stopped a man with a backpack from entering the Zion church full of worshippers. If the attacker had entered there would have been many more casualties. A large white poster hangs outside Chrishanthini Ramesh's house in the town of Batticaloa on Sri Lanka's east coast. On the left is a photo of a man smiling into the camera. He's wearing a grey shirt and has a moustache. His name is Ramesh Raju. He was a father, a husband, a building contractor, and he was just 40 years old. As we approach the sandy driveway to his home, groups of people are seated on plastic chairs. Just as life is a shared experience among family and friends in these communities, so is death. Relatives from far and wide have gathered here to pay their respects - some play nervously with their phones, others are crying. One woman in a green sari is wailing uncontrollably. As we make our way through the gathered throng, we are introduced to Chrishanthini and her two children Rukshika and Niruban, who are 14 and 12 respectively. This video can not be played Ramesh was killed in the blast in Batticaloa Chrishanthini is a Sunday school teacher at the Zion church, and last Sunday - like any other - she went to teach her class. She and Ramesh took their children to worship every week, and he came to join them for prayers. After classes finished, Chrishantini and some of the children went outside to have snacks before the Easter service was to begin. Ramesh was also in the courtyard when he spotted a man he didn't recognise carrying a large backpack. The man told him it contained a video camera as he had come to film worshippers inside. ""My husband sensed something was wrong, and informed him he'd need to get permission first. ""He then forced him to leave,"" Chrishanthini told me. The aftermath of a bomb blast at the Zion church Mourners attend the funeral of a person killed in the Easter Sunday attack in Negombo As she headed into the church, which was packed with as many as 450 people on one of the most sacred days of the year, she heard a loud bang. As panic ensued, some of the congregation scaled the walls by the church to survey the ground below for their loved ones. Crowds ran in any direction they could, as some of the buildings caught fire. Chrishanthini and her family escaped and rushed to the nearby hospitals to find Ramesh. Hours later, they found his body. He had died instantly, at the spot she'd last seen him. Sri Lanka bomber 'studied in UK' What we know so far Who are the victims? The family were reunited once again, but for the very last time. Ramesh was buried on Monday. Members of the local police were among those who turned out to pay their respects. While his actions didn't save him, they did save the lives of many others. As I chatted to Chrishanthini she barely shed a tear, but then as she shared fond memories of her life partner whose life had been taken away, she broke down. ""I love my Jesus, I love my Jesus,"" she cried, as tears streamed down her face. For Chrishantini the pain of loss is all too familiar. At 40, she has lived most of her live as an orphan, after both her parents were murdered in Sri Lanka's bloody civil war. ""My mother was killed when I was very young, she had her throat cut,"" she told me. ""A few years later my father was also killed in suspicious circumstances,"" she adds. If that wasn't enough pain, Chrishantini also tells me her aunt died in the boxing day Tsunami in 2004, which claimed more than 2,000 lives in Batticaloa. This scenic stretch of the country's east coast has witnessed large-scale tragedy on so many occasions, and it's people like Chrishantini who live through the daily anguish. Nothing can bring back her dear Ramesh, but his heroic actions  - which spared other families pain - at least help comfort her own.

What led to Easter carnage?,"The ruthlessness of the suicide attacks has stunned Sri Lankans Sri Lanka is in a state of shock and confusion, trying to understand how a little-known Islamist group may have unleashed the wave of co-ordinated suicide bombings that resulted in the Easter Sunday carnage - the worst since the end of the civil war a decade ago. The South Asian island nation has experience of such attacks - suicide bombers were used by Tamil Tiger rebels during the civil war. But the ruthlessness of the new atrocities has stunned the nation anew. Eventually the government spokesman, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, came out and blamed National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ), a home-grown Islamist group, for the bombings. ""There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded,"" he told reporters on Monday. That might go some way to explaining how a group that has been blamed for promoting hate speech may now have been able to scale up its capacity so monumentally. Who are the victims of the Sri Lanka attacks? 'My heart shattered when I saw the bodies' On Tuesday, however, the Islamic State (IS) group said its militants had carried out the attacks. It published a video of eight men the group claimed were behind the attacks. The IS claim should be treated cautiously. It is not clear whether these men were trained by the group or simply inspired by IS ideology. The manner in which NTJ was identified was circuitous. The prime minister said there had been warnings made to officials that hadn't been shared with the cabinet. He said only the president would get such briefings, even though it is not clear if he personally did in this instance. This is not an insignificant statement from a prime minister who was at loggerheads with the president for much of the past year. Many are drawing a conclusion about how political discord can have serious consequences - as well as undermining trust in the messages being put out. If the suicide bombers were local Sri Lankan Muslims, as stated by the government, then it is a colossal failure by the intelligence agencies. Information is also now emerging in the US media that the Sri Lankan government may also have had warnings from US and Indian intelligence about a possible threat. ""Our understanding is that [the warning] was correctly circulated among security and police,"" Shiral Lakthilaka, a senior adviser to President Maithripala Sirisena, said. The Sri Lankan president, who oversees security forces, has now set up a committee to find out what went wrong. Sri Lankan intelligence was credited with foiling several suicide attacks by the Tamil Tiger rebels at the height of the civil war and for penetrating a well-knit and ruthless Tamil Tiger organisation. While this is clearly a security and political failure, there are also questions about the nature of communal strife in Sri Lanka's more recent history. During the civil war, Muslims were also targeted by Tamil Tiger rebels and suffered at their hands. But Muslim community leaders say successive Sri Lankan governments have failed to restore confidence among young Muslims following more recent attacks by some members of the majority Sinhalese Buddhist community. One of the worst incidents was in the town of Digana in central Sri Lanka where one person died when a Sinhalese mob attacked Muslim shops and mosques in March last year. Sri Lanka declared a state of emergency after attacks on mosques and Muslim-owned businesses in 2018 ""After Digana quite a few Muslims lost faith in the government to provide them security. Some of them got the idea that they can defend themselves,"" says Hilmy Ahamed, vice-president of the Sri Lanka Muslim Council. The attacks and what the youths perceived as the lack of action by the government may have led some of them towards groups like NTJ. Some of the radicals were blamed for damaging Buddhist statues in recent years and their leader was arrested last year for offending religious sentiments. He later apologised for offending the sentiments of the Buddhist Sinhalese. Now it is widely believed a new group emerged a few years ago under the leadership of Zaharan Hashim, a radical Muslim preacher from eastern Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka attacks: What we know Who are National Thowheed Jamath? Mr Hashim posted several videos on social media purportedly promoting hatred against non-Muslims. Most of his videos are in the Tamil language. His teachings are said to have attracted several Muslim youths. ""This man was preaching hate with lots of YouTube videos on social media posts. Some of us reported him to the national intelligence services. Once about three years ago and once in January this year,"" says Mr Ahamed. He added that  security services did not take any action against Mr Hashim. Reports say the preacher was one of the suicide bombers though it's yet to be confirmed. Like Muslims, Christians are a minority in Sri Lanka Muslim community leaders say a few youths went to Syria to join IS, and some of them were killed in fighting there. It's important not to overstate this, though, and a former senior military officer Maj Gen (Retired) GA Chandrasiri says ""we have very cordial relationship with the Muslims. Most Muslims are not with these people. They are peace loving people"". There are no reports so far of a high number of jihadists returning to Sri Lanka. But even if a select few jihadists are angry with the majority, why were Christians targeted? In the complex cocktail of Sri Lanka's religious and ethnic tensions, Christians are almost unique for not perpetrating any kind of violence on behalf of their community. After all, it is a religion that crosses ethnic lines. I covered the Sri Lankan civil war for years and reported on many Tamil Tiger suicide attacks. It took years for the group to be able to learn to detonate such devices. So it is intriguing that a lesser-known Islamist group, with a few home-grown radicals, could carry out six - some say even seven - suicide attacks with such pinpoint precision and devastation. None of them failed. Even though connections with global jihadist groups are unclear, the choice of major luxury hotels and Christians as a target - in addition to the sophistication of the operation - makes it plausible that local radicalism has come under the influence of global jihadist networks.  It would be a tried and tested pattern in global attacks. 'Church of miracles' is a symbol of hope 'I thought we left violence behind us' During the Sri Lankan civil war foreign tourists were spared and attacks on outsiders were rare. In the latest bombings, many foreigners were killed and this has raised the spectre of links with al-Qaeda or IS. ""For this type of operation you need lots of assistance from outside. You need finances, training and technique for this kind of work. You can't do these things alone. May be there was some help from outside,"" Gen Chandrasiri said. The number of tourists visiting Sri Lanka has soared after the end of the civil war Violence is not new to Sri Lanka. It went through turbulent times during a left-wing insurrection in the 1970s followed by a nearly three-decade bloody war with the Tamil Tiger rebels. Tens of thousands of people were killed. But the ruthlessness and sophistication of the latest atrocities indicate that it will be challenge for the Sri Lankan security forces to deal with those behind the bombings. The last thing the Sri Lankan public wants is more violence and recrimination.

Lyra McKee's funeral taking place,"This video can not be played ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" A priest received a standing ovation at Lyra McKee's funeral when he asked why it took her death to unite politicians. Politicians attended a vigil in Londonderry after her murder, and also her funeral in Belfast on Wednesday. Fr Martin Magill asked: ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" However, DUP MP Sammy Wilson said he was not convinced it marked a turning point to restore power-sharing. Profile: Lyra McKee In pictures: Mourners pay respects Call for Irish border fix after McKee death Leo Varadkar, Theresa May and Michael D Higgins sat at the front of St Anne's Cathedral Ms McKeewas shot dead on Thursdayas she observed rioting in the Creggan area of Derry. A dissident republican paramilitary group, the New IRA,said its members killed her. Prime Minister Theresa May, President of Ireland Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and other politicians were at the service. Irish President Michael D Higgins consoles Ms McKee's partner Sara Canning Ms McKee was an avid fan of Harry Potter A friend told mourners at her funeral that Ms McKee revealed her plans to propose to her partner Sara Canning just hours before she was murdered. Stephen Lusty said she showed him pictures of the engagement ring. ""She showed me pictures of the ring she had bought for Sara and told me of the fabulous plans she had of her proposal in May,"" said Mr Lusty. ""She made me put a date in my diary for the wedding in Donegal in 2022 and gave me strict instructions to wear my kilt, which she always wanted to borrow, adorn it with some Harry Potter."" DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn FÃ©in's Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI Political leaders from Belfast, Dublin and London, all under the one roof. The disagreements over Brexit and the return of the Stormont Assembly were put into context by matters of life and death. But those political disputes were not forgotten; quite the opposite. The message from the pulpit to political leaders in Northern Ireland was clear - sort out your differences now, don't wait. The funeral took two hours. Those involved in the service hope its impact will be long lasting and far reaching. Ms McKee's sister, Nichola Corner, told mourners: ""In the words of Lyra herself, we must change our own world, one piece at a time. Now let's get to work."" Hundreds gathered for the funeral of Ms McKee, who was from a Catholic background, at a Protestant cathedral. The congregation was led by Ms McKee's partner, mother Joan McKee, brothers Gary and David and sisters Joan, Nichola and Mary. Her family chose the location due to its reputation as a ""shared space"" in a divided city. Many friends of the journalist and campaigner for LGBT rights wore Harry Potter-themed T-shirts, scarves and badges to the service. Ms McKee was an avid fan of the series. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral in Belfast's St Anne's Cathedral Messages of condolence left by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Prime Minister Theresa May At the beginning of the service, the Anglican dean of Belfast, the Very Reverend Stephen Forde, said: ""Lyra was a person who broke down barriers and reached across boundaries, this was her hallmark in life, this is her legacy in death. ""She was a child of the Good Friday agreement. She was a primary school pupil in north Belfast when the agreement was signed. ""She grew up to champion its hope for a society that was free from the prejudices of the past."" Grief and outrage over Ms McKee's murder has sparked hopes there is now momentum to break the political deadlock in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government since January 2017,when the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. On Wednesday, NI Secretary Karen Bradley said she intended tohold talks with Stormont party leaders in a bid to make progress. This video can not be played Family, friends and political leaders mourn Lyra McKee The Democratic Unionist Party's Sammy Wilson told BBC News NI that his party had offered solutions, including a time-limited process running parallel alongside the running of the assembly. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald rejected Mr Wilson's criticisms. ""He knows that the issues that have held us back are issues of equality and recognition,"" she said. ""This stalemate is not acceptable and we need to act to resolve it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Three people have been arrested over the murder, and all have been released without charge. Speaking after her funeral, Northern Ireland's top police officer said Ms McKee ""cared passionately about issues and worked hard and with integrity"". ""Of course that is in complete contrast to those people who came out of the shadows last Thursday night, fired shots at police lines, hitting Lyra and fatally injuring her,"" said Chief Constable George Hamilton. ""I suppose the outpouring of condemnation from the communities of Derry, Creggan all standing together in Creggan last Friday, was something I think was quite unique and quite different."" Members of the public stood outside the church to pay their respects to Ms McKee Ms McKee had written for publications including Private Eye, the Atlantic, Mosaic Science and Mediagazer. She had also signed a two-book deal with the publisher Faber and Faber, with her forthcoming book The Lost Boys due out in 2020. The hashtag #IStandWithLyra has been trending on Twitter, which Ms McKee used prolifically. Comedian Patrick Kielty, who is from Northern Ireland,tweeted:,external""Today Lyra McKee is laid to rest. She believed in peace, tolerance and equality. The exact opposite of those responsible. They will never win because Lyra will always be the future. And her truth will continue to be told. #IStandWithLyra"" Fellow members of the National Union of Journalists formed a guard of honour at the cathedral. The union described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. There was also a gathering at Guildhall Square in Derry for those who could not attend the funeral.

LiveSturgeon gives update on indyref2Less than a minute ago,"Nicola Sturgeon says a second independence referendum should take place ""within this parliamentary term"" The FM sets out an aim to have legislation on the statute books by the end of this year Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw says Scotland has had enough of constitutional politics Labour and the Lib Dems also criticise the first minister, while the Greens urge Ms Sturgeon to ""fire the starting gun"" on indyref2 Craig Hutchison and Louise Wilson This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon calls for indyref2 by 2021 Holyrood elections That's all from Holyrood Live on Wednesday 24 April 2019. Nicola Sturgeon said she wants to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the country is taken out of the EU. The first minister told Holyrood that she would introduce legislation soon to set the rules for another vote. But she indicated that she would need the agreement of the UK government before actually holding a referendum. Downing Street has previously said it will not grant a new Section 30 order, which underpinned the 2014 referendum. Ms Sturgeon claimed this position was ""unsustainable"" and challenged her party to increase support and demand for independence. But the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""As we have been repeatedly clear, Scotland has already had an independence referendum in 2014 and voted decisively to remain in the United Kingdom. This should be respected. Our position hasn't changed."" Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick says last night's reception at Holyrood showed the importance of investment in research. Mr Fitzpatrick praises the work of the MS Society to find a cure for MS. He says Stacey Adam made one demand last night that he tell the chamber he has found a cure. The minister apologises that he cannot do that, but he points to Â£500,000 for clinical research in neurological conditions and cites other funding streams.

He praises the local MS community in Orkney for its activity and energy, which helps improve the lives of people with MS. Treatments are vital, but reaching out and reassuring people they are not alone is important too he adds. Green MSP John Finnie Green MSP John Finnie pays warm tribute to George Adam and his wife Stacey. Mr Finnie says MS Society Scotland have a research strategy and points out its work on empowerment. He urges MSPs to remember the carers who provide support to a lot of people. The Green MSP says pharma's obligation should be to take a patient centred approach not focus on profit for shareholders. He points to positive advancements in research. Labour MSP Neil Findlay Labour MSP Neil Findlay tells the chamber that his brother has been diagnosed with MS and it can be an exasperating condition because of its variability. People often battle on and do not shout loud about it, the Labour MSP says, but argues they should be shouting loud about it because there is a lack of MS nurses. We have no MS specialist social worker in the whole of the country, he adds. ""I pray every day for a cure but in the meantime we want the best treatment possible for MS patients in this country, and I'm afraid to say I don't think they're getting it."" Tory MSP Annie Wells Tory MSP Annie Wells gives a huge thank you to George Adam and his wife Stacey for securing this debate, as well as all the charities working to fight the disease. MS awareness week is the perfect opportunity to improve public understanding of the condition and highlight the need for more research, adds Ms Wells.

He describes his wife as a ""force of nature"" and suggests that is a common trait among people living with MS. Mr Adam goes on to highlights that three times more woman have MS than men, and that nobody with MS has the same symptoms as another person with the condition. There are various treatments in place and coming through, but profiteering of pharmaceutical companies is an issue, he warns.

Tory MSP Alexander Burnett raises a point of order beginning by pointing out last week the chief executive of the parliament made it clear parliament's resources should not be used for EU election campaigning. Mr Burnett says he quotes Nicola Sturgeon from her statement who he says said ""the Euro elections will also give people the chance to back a party like the SNP"". He asks if Nicola Sturgeon has kept to the spirit and letter of the advice given to MSPs. Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh tells Mr Burnett the guidance does not cover what is said in the chamber.

WW2 bomb blown up in Germany after evacuation,"The bomb - seen in the lower left - was uncovered during construction work A 250kg (550lb) World War Two bomb caused damage in a German city when it exploded on Wednesday under controlled circumstances. It was discovered in the southern city of Regensburg during construction work. The bomb could not be transported or defused, experts found. So they instead evacuated some 4,500 people in a 1.5km (one mile) radius. Despite the planned explosion, nearby buildings were damaged in the blast, their windows shattering. Unexploded bombs from the war are not uncommon in Germany, which was heavily bombed by Britain and, later, the US. Regional newspaper Mittelbayerische Zeitung reported that the Regensburg bomb was equipped with a particularly complicated detonator. It also presented a genuine threat, investigators decided - rather than being considered a dud - and had to be detonated on the spot as soon as possible. How dangerous are unexploded bombs? A bomb disposal robot was used to place an explosive charge next to the bomb, it reported. The resulting explosion, shortly before 05:00 local time (03:00 GMT) , could be heard kilometres away. Police then began a safety check of the area before allowing residents to return to their homes. A full inspection of the damage caused will be carried out on Wednesday. The bomb has not been identified - but British and US forces bombed the city multiple times during World War Two, dropping hundreds of bombs, many of which did not explode. A US-made bomb was discovered in the city in January, which was defused after a lengthy operation that resulted in the evacuation of more than 2,000 people. In June 2017, a similar discovery made headlines when more than 100 prisoners had to be evacuated when a bomb was found near a jail - along with 1,500 residents. Across Germany, evacuations for old bombs sometimes involve entire populations. About18,500 people were evacuated from Ludwigshafenin August last year,whileFrankfurt evacuated some 70,000over the threat from a 1.4 tonne British ""blockbuster"" bomb in 2017.

Sturgeon to update MSPs on indyref2 plans,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says a second independence referendum will need a transfer of power from Westminster Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the country is taken out of the EU. The first minister told Holyrood that she would introduce legislation soon to set the rules for another vote. But she indicated that she would need the agreement of the UK government before actually holding a referendum. Downing Street has previously said it will not grant a new Section 30 order, which underpinned the 2014 referendum. Ms Sturgeon claimed this position was ""unsustainable"" and challenged her party to increase support and demand for independence. But the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""As we have been repeatedly clear, Scotland has already had an independence referendum in 2014 and voted decisively to remain in the United Kingdom. This should be respected. Our position hasn't changed."" Will there be indyref2 before May 2021? UK government 'will say no indyref2' What is the SNP's Brexit policy? Ms Sturgeon has faced calls from some within the SNP - which will hold its conference at the weekend - and the wider independence movement to hold a referendum sooner rather than later. She told MSPs that to ""rush into an immediate decision before a Brexit path has been determined would not allow for an informed choice to be made"" about the future. However, the first minister added: ""If we are to safeguard Scotland's interests, we cannot wait indefinitely. ""That is why I consider that a choice between Brexit and a future for Scotland as an independent European nation should be offered in the lifetime of this parliament. ""I can confirm that the Scottish government will act to ensure that the option of giving people a choice on independence later in this term of parliament is progressed."" The next Scottish Parliament election is due to be held in May 2021. This video can not be played Brexit versus Scottish independence Ms Sturgeon believes she has a mandate to hold a second independence referendum as a result of the SNP's victory in the 2016 Holyrood elections - with the party's manifesto stating a vote should take place if there was a ""material change of circumstances"" such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will. The first minister said she hoped a ""framework Bill"" - legislation paving the way for a referendum - will be in place by the end of this year. She said: ""We do not need a transfer of power such as a Section 30 order to pass such a framework Bill, though we would need it to put beyond doubt or challenge our ability to apply the bill to an independence referendum."" The first minister insisted: ""If we are successful in further growing the support and the demand for independence, then no UK government will be able to stop the will of the people or stop that will being expressed."" The SNP conference will be held at the weekend - with Ms Sturgeon due to speak on Sunday The first minister extended an invitation to other parties, including those opposed to independence, to come forward for their own proposals for Scotland's constitutional future. She said: ""The immediate opportunity we now have is to help stop Brexit for the whole UK - and we should seize that opportunity. But if that cannot be achieved, dealing with the consequences of Brexit and facing up to its challenges will be unavoidable. ""I believe that the case for independence is stronger than ever. I will make that case, but I know others take a different view. ""So, as we take the necessary legislative steps over the next few months, I will also seek to open up space for us to come together and find areas of agreement as mature politicians should."" But she predicted that if the only alternative presented by opposition politicians was a ""failed and damaging status quo"", then ""the process of change will pass them by and support for independence will grow"". Analysis by Sarah Smith, Scotland editor Nicola Sturgeon knows that the Westminster government will almost certainly refuse to allow another referendum within the next two years - so she needs to find a way to keep the constitutional argument alive while there is little prospect of an imminent vote. The SNP know that by proposing another referendum they will be accused by those who do not support independence of introducing a divisive political issue at the worst possible time. So the first minister is challenging other parties who do not support Scottish independence to come forward with their own ideas for constitutional change, promising that the SNP will engage fully and in good faith. Ms Sturgeon is very deliberately talking of trying to find compromise and consensus amongst politicians - saying Scotland can do things differently from Westminster. It is an appeal that is clearly meant to reach beyond other party leaders and straight to voters who may not welcome independence, but might well appreciate the approach the first minister is proposing. The first minister also announced plans to establish a Citizens Assembly to consider Scotland's future, which she said had been done in Ireland to ""help find consensus on issues where people have sharply divided opinions"". She said this would bring together a representative cross-section of Scotland with an independent chair, and be tasked with considering: What kind of country are we seeking to build? How can we best overcome the challenges we face, including those arising from Brexit? What further work should be carried out to give people the detail they need to make informed choices about the future of the country? Scotland rejected independence by 55% to 45% in the 2014 referendum - with opinion polls suggesting support for independence remains largely unchanged five years later. Ms Sturgeon initially called for a second referendum after the Brexit vote in 2016, butput her plans on holdafter the SNP lost 21 seats in the general election the following year. Downing Street says the prime minister is still of the view that there should not be another independence referendum Speaking after Ms Sturgeon's statement, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said people in Scotland had ""voted decisively in 2014 to remain part of the UK, on a promise that the referendum would settle the issue for a generation"". He added: ""Instead of respecting that result, Nicola Sturgeon continues to press for divisive constitutional change when it is clear that most people in Scotland do not want another independence referendum. The UK government will stand up for them. ""Nicola Sturgeon needs to listen to the views of the Scottish people and concentrate on improving Scotland's economy and schools, not continually trying to orchestrate upheaval and division."" Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's statement to MSPs Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard accused Ms Sturgeon of ""using her office as first minister to put the interests of the SNP before the interests of our country"". He said: ""Her statement today is not about Brexit, this is about Nicola Sturgeon trying to pacify her party members and back benchers ahead of the SNP's conference"". The pro-independence Scottish Greens broadly welcomed the first minister's statement. But the party's Holyrood co-convener Alison Johnstone warned that the SNP's vision of independence ""looks more like the failed economic model of the UK, a vision which has led to cuts to public services and increasing child poverty, than the bold vision for independence the Greens campaigned for and believed in"".

"Ann Widdecombe to stand for Brexit PartyShe says she wants to help ""fire a very loud warning shot across the bows"" of the established parties.UK Politics","This video can not be played Ann Widdecombe: 'Whole nation fed up to back teeth' Former Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe has announced she is set to return to politics - for the Brexit Party. Ms Widdecombe, 71, said she would still vote Conservative in the upcoming local elections but would stand as a candidate for Nigel Farage's new party in the European elections. She said she wanted to ""fire a very loud warning shot across the bows"" of the established parties. The former shadow home secretary has been retired since 2010. Ms Widdecombe told BBC News she was standing out of ""total frustration"" and to show Parliament to ""get on with it"" or see their seats ""in danger"". Calls for progress in Brexit deal talks Tories mull rule change to challenge Theresa May The life of MEPs in Brexit limbo Annunziata Rees-Mogg to stand for Brexit Party She added: ""Britain is an international laughing stock. Parliament is beyond parody, and the whole nation is fed up to the back teeth and just wants a resolution. ""I believe that if the Brexit Party can make enormous gains in the European elections and win overwhelmingly, that will send shockwaves - both in Labour heartlands and in Tory shires. ""It will make MPs rethink what they are doing as it will be a big reaffirmation of the people's vote."" Ann Widdecombe appeared in the 2010 series of Strictly Come Dancing 1987 - Elected as Conservative MP for Maidstone 1994 - Made a minister in the Department of Employment 1995 - Becomes a minister in the Home Office 1998 - Appointed shadow health secretary 1999 - Appointed shadow home secretary 2010 - Retires from politics but continues to write 2010 - Appears on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing 2018 - Finishes as the runner-up in Celebrity Big Brother 2019 - Announces decision to stand as an MEP candidate for the Brexit Party The UKhas been given an extension to the Brexit process until 31 October, meaning participation in the European elections on 23 May looks likely. In addition to Mr Farage's new venture,Change UK - formerly The Independent Group - launched its European election campaignin Bristol on Tuesday. Interim leader Heidi Allen said Change UK was ""the home of the Remain alliance"". Meanwhile, cross-party talks between the government and Labour, aimed at forging a common way forward on Brexit, are continuing amid recriminations at the slow pace of progress. Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said that while the discussions with Labour were ""serious"" they were proving ""difficult"" in some areas, and that progress was needed ""urgently"" to enable Britain to leave the EU as soon as possible. Labour, however, put the blame for lack of progress on the government's refusal to shift on its ""red lines"".

LivePMQs: Lidington v Thornberry3 minutes ago,"Jeremy Wright responded to an urgent question on Huawei leak The culture secretary said a criminal investigation could not be excluded MPs held debate on the use of force to restrain children MPs also debated the registration process for EU citizens for European elections Andrea Leadsom announced next week's business in the Commons The government's Brexit legislation is on hold as the UK prepares for a general election. The Commons has now wrapped up for the week. The day began with questions to international trade and equalities ministers. This was followed by an urgent question on Huawei, after reports the government would use technology from the Chinese telecoms firm in the UK's new 5G network. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told MPs a criminal inquirycould not be excludedinto leaks from a National Security Council meeting. This was followed by urgent questions on EU citizens registering for the European elections and the publication of the government's mandate for NHS England. The afternoon was taken up by debates on school funding and the use of force on children. MPs are now debating the use of force to restrain children
in places such as hospitals, childrenâs homes and schools. Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, who proposed the debate on behalf of
the backbench business committee, said studies show the use of force is âendemic
in the systemâ. He said MPs are âstill waitingâ for the Department for
Education to issue guidance on the use of force on children, after guidance for
adults was issued in 2014. The government has not yet responded to a consultation in
this area launched by the Health and Education departments, which closed in
January last year. MPs have now started their debate on school funding, a topic chosen for the slot this afternoon by the backbench business committee. The Commons will debate a motion noting ""concern"" at the ""increasing financial pressures faced by schools"". It calls on the government to increase funding to cover the ""additional services schools now perform for pupils"". Debate on next weekâs
Commons timetable has come to an end. MPs will now hear short
speeches from the Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy Committee on itsreport on carbon capture and storage.,external After this there will be a backbench business debate on
school funding. BBC Assistant Political Editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, MPs will debate a number of Brexit-related statutory instruments. Tuesday afternoon will be set aside for debates chosen by the opposition, whilst on Thursday there will be a debate on World Immunisation Week. The Commons will not be sitting on Friday. NHS urgent question House of CommonsParliament The Commons has now moved on to an urgent question on the NHS. This has been tabled by shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth. The government is normally expected to publish a mandate for the NHS annually, but the current one has now expired. The mandate was introduced as part of the 2012 Health and Social Care Act changes to the NHS. Huawei leak: Minister says he cannot rule out a criminal investigation European elections urgent question House of CommonsParliament The Commons has finished the urgent question on Huawei, and is now on to a question asked by Labour's Catherine West on registration of European citizens for upcoming European elections. Catherine West represents Hornsey and Wood Green, in London, which is an area with a high proportion of EU citizens. Conservative Bob Blackman asks for guarantees that the procurement process for new wireless technology will be ""subject to open competition"". He says technology provided by Huawei is ""niche"" but not ""unique"". In reply, Jeremy Wright says it is ""obviously better to have a number of suppliers in the system"" from a security point of view. However he says there are ""essentially only three suppliers in this space"" - Huawei, Nokia and Ericsson. He adds that it is ""not a right assumption"" that excluding Huawei and using the other two would lead to a ""safe network"". BBC chief political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Huawei urgent question House of CommonsParliament Conservative Victoria Prentis asks if the National Security Council leak might become the subject of a criminal investigation. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright says the government ""cannot exclude the possibility"" of this happening. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Pat McFadden says the Huawei leak is ""symptomatic"" of a ""wider breakdown"" in collective responsibility in the government. He says the only two factors in the decision should be the UK's technological future and national security, not the ""political share price"" of cabinet members. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright says national security considerations will be ""pre-eminent"" in the ongoing review over wireless networks. Huawei urgent question House of CommonsParliament Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat raises concerns that there is less of a distinction between ""core and non-core"" equipment in a 5G network, so saying that Huawei equipment will only be used in non-core sections of the network is still a problem. He says that by putting Huawei equipment in, the UK could be eroding trust within the'Five Eyes' community. Mr Wright says ""there is no lack of respect"" for what the international community is saying on Huawei. The government is listening to what the advice is internationally and domestically on the telecoms company, he adds. Huawei urgent question House of CommonsParliament Jeremy Wright says he ""entirely agrees"" with what was said on leaks from the National Security Council, as there is ""good reason"" why these meetings are kept private. ""The government intends to treat it seriously,"" he says of the leak. He says there is an oversight board in place for equipment supplied by Huawei to the UK. ""Chinese equipment...is prevalent across the world"" and there is a ""good deal"" of Huawei equipment already used in existing mobile networks, he adds. Huawei urgent question Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Jo Platt says there should be a full inquiry into how discussions over Huawei were leaked. She adds that any person found to be responsible for the leak should resign or be sacked. It would be ""truly shocking"", she says, if a minister did so to gain an advantage in a forthcoming leadership contest. National security matters should be handled with the ""utmost care"", she says, not ""used as political ammunition in a Tory party civil war"". Huawei urgent question House of CommonsParliament Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright says the security of the UK's 5G infrastucture is of ""paramount importance"" but the UK's economy ""can only prosper"" when its ""world-class infrastructure is assured"". ""We have to strike a difficult balance between security and prosperity,"" he says, adding that the current review into 5G from Huawei is ""thorough"" and will report in due course. He says he will make a further statement later when decisions have been formally made. Huawei has denied there is any risk of espionage or sabotage Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright is now answering an urgent question on the row over Huawei's role in wireless internet infrastructure. It comes after reports that the government hasapproved the supply of equipmentby the Chinese telecoms firm for the UK's new 5G data network - despite warnings of a security risk. It is believed the decision was taken at a meeting of the government's National Security Council on Tuesday. Government ministers are calling for a ""full and proper"" investigation after details of the discussions were leaked to the Daily Telegraph. House of CommonsParliament Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the
Commons. The day has started with questions to ministers at the Department for International Trade, to be followed by Women and Equalities questions at 10.00 BST. At 10:30 BST, there will be an urgent question on the decision
to allow Huawei to provide aspects of the UKâs 5G infrastructure. This will be followed by two more urgent questions on registering EU citizens for the European elections, and the government's mandate for the NHS. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom will then outline next week's timetable in the House of Commons. This afternoon, MPs will debate school funding. Â© 2025 BBC.

Kim Jong-un visits Russia for summitThe North Korean leader will meet President Putin for the first time near the city of Vladivostok.,"This video can not be played North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrives in Vladivostok ahead of Putin summit North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has arrived in the far east of Russia for a summit with President Vladimir Putin. Mr Kim arrived by train in the Pacific Coast city of Vladivostok for his first talks with the Russian president, which are expected to start on Thursday. He was welcomed by officials with a traditional offering of bread and salt. Russia says they will discuss the Korean peninsula's ""nuclear problem"" but Mr Kim is also said to be seeking support after talks with the US failed. US President Donald Trump and Mr Kim met in Hanoi earlier this year to discuss North Korea's nuclear weapons programme but the summit - their second - ended without agreement. What to expect from Putin-Kim meeting What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? The North Korean leader greeted Russian officials warmly on his arrival in Vladivostok. After tasting traditional korovai bread and salt, Mr Kim was entertained by a brass band before he got inside a car flanked by bodyguards who - in now familiar scenes - jogged alongside the vehicle as it departed.

""I arrived in Russia bearing the warm feelings of our people, and as I already said, I hope this visit will be successful and useful,"" Mr Kim told Russian TV earlier, after crossing the border at Khasan. ""I hope that during the talks with respected President Putin, I will be able to discuss in a concrete manner issues relating to the settlement of the situation on the Korean peninsula, and to the development of our bilateral relations."" It is due to take place on Thursday afternoon at about 13:00 (03:00 GMT) on Russky island, just off Vladivostok, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Russian and North Korean national flags are already in place on the island, where the leaders are expected to meet on a university campus. Mr Kim travelled on his armoured train Mr Putin was expected to arrive for the summit later. According to his spokesman, the Kremlin believes the six-party talks on North Korea, which are currently stalled, are the only efficient way of addressing the issue of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. Those talks, which began in 2003, involve the two Koreas as well as China, Japan, Russia and the US. ""There are no other efficient international mechanisms at the moment,"" Mr Peskov told reporters. ""But, on the other hand, efforts are being made by other countries. Here all efforts merit support as long as they really aim at de-nuclearisation and resolving the problem of the two Koreas."" This visit is being widely viewed as an opportunity for North Korea to show it has powerful allies following the breakdown of nuclear talks with the US earlier this year, the BBC's Laura Bicker says. The country has blamed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the collapse of the Hanoi summit in February. Earlier this monthNorth Korea demanded that Mr Pompeo be removed from nuclear talks, accusing him of ""talking nonsense"" and asking for someone ""more careful"" to replace him. The summit is also an opportunity for Pyongyang to show that its economic future does not depend solely on the US, our correspondent adds. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea Mr Kim may also try to put pressure on Moscow to ease sanctions. Analysts believe this summit is a chance for Russia to show that it is an important player on the Korean peninsula. President Putin has been eager to meet the North Korean leader for quite some time. Yet amid the two Trump-Kim summits, the Kremlin has been somewhat sidelined. Russia, like the US and China, is uncomfortable with North Korea being a nuclear state. Senior officials say the Kremlin is hoping to see a reduction in tensions on the peninsula. Mr Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, said the situation there had ""stabilised somewhat"" in recent months. ""Russia intends to help in any way possible to cement that positive trend,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. A South Korean foreign ministry spokesman said Russia ""shares our viewpoints"" on denuclearisation and peace on the peninsula. Nuclear activity seems to be continuing in North Korea, and the country said it had tested a new ""tactical guided weapon"" - thought to be a short-range missile - earlier in April. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union (of which Russia is the main successor state) maintained close military and trade links with its communist ally, North Korea, for ideological and strategic reasons. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, trade links with post-communist Russia shrank and North Korea leaned towards China as its main ally. Under President Putin, Russia recovered economically and in 2014 he wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt in a major goodwill gesture. While it is arguable how much leverage Russia has with the North today, the communist state still regards it as one of the least hostile foreign powers.

World's most controversial firm," The African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa is a shiny spaceship-like structure that glistens in the afternoon sun. With its accompanying skyscraper, it stands out in the Ethiopian capital. Greetings in Mandarin welcome visitors as they enter the lifts, and the plastic palm trees bear the logos of the China Development Bank. African Union HQ, Addis Ababa Everywhere, there are small indications that the building was made possible through Chinese financial aid. In 2006, Beijing pledged $200m to build the headquarters. Completed in 2012, everything was custom-built by the Chinese - including a state-of-the-art computer system. For several years, the building stood as a proud testament to ever-closer ties between China and Africa. Trade has rocketed over the past two decades, growing by about 20% a year, according to international consultancy McKinsey. China is Africa’s largest economic partner. But in January 2018, French newspaper Le Monde Afrique dropped a bombshell. It reported that the AU’s computer system had been compromised. The newspaper, citing multiple sources, said that for five years, between the hours of midnight and 0200, data from the AU’s servers was transferred more than 8,000km away - to servers in Shanghai. This had allegedly continued for 1,825 days in a row. Le Monde Afrique reported that it had come to light in 2017, when a conscientious scientist working for the AU recorded an unusually high amount of computer activity on its servers during hours when the offices would have been deserted. It was also reported that microphones and listening devices had been discovered in the walls and desks of the building, following a sweep for bugs. The reaction was swift. Both AU and Chinese officials publicly condemned the report as false and sensationalist - an attempt by the Western media to damage relations between a more assertive China and an increasingly independent Africa. But Le Monde Afrique said that AU officials had privately expressed concerns about just how dependent they were on Chinese aid - and what the consequences of that could be. In the midst of all of this, one fact remained largely unreported. The main supplier of information and communication technology systems to the AU headquarters was China’s best-known telecoms equipment company - Huawei. “This doesn’t mean the company was complicit in any theft of data,” said Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in a review of the alleged incident. “But… it’s hard to see how - given Huawei’s role in providing equipment and key ICT services to the AU building and specifically to the AU’s data centre - the company could have remained completely unaware of the apparent theft of large amounts of data, every day, for five years.” Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, China A Huawei spokesman told the BBC: “If there was  a data leak from computers at the AU's headquarters in Addis that went on for an extended period of time, these data leaks did not originate in technology supplied by Huawei to the AU. What Huawei supplied for the AU project  included data centre facilities, but those facilities did not have any storage or data transfer functions.” There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei’s telecoms network equipment was ever used by the Chinese government - or anyone else - to gain access to the data of their customers. Huawei was one of a number of suppliers to the project. Indeed, no-one has ever gone on record to confirm that the AU system was compromised in the first place. But these reports played into years of suspicions about Huawei - that a large Chinese company might find itself unduly influenced by the Chinese government. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones. The only phones we had were those hand-cranked phones that you see in old World War II films. We were pretty undeveloped then.” Huawei’s founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei is reminiscing to the BBC about the origins of the world’s second-biggest smartphone firm, while sitting in the Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen - a symbol of the success that he’s worked his whole lifetime for. A long marbled staircase, covered in plush red carpet, greets you as you first walk in. At the top of the stairs, a giant painting depicts a traditional Chinese New Year scene. Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ A few kilometres away in Dongguan, Huawei’s latest campus is even more eye-catching. The site - designed to accommodate the company’s 25,000 R&D staff - comprises 12 “villages”, each of which recreates the architecture of a different European city, among them Paris, Bologna and Granada. It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones.

Not Italy... It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. ...but Huawei's Dongguan Campus It’s a world away from the environment that Mr Ren found himself in when he first started the company in 1987. “I founded Huawei when China began to implement its reform and opening up policy,” he says. “At that time, China was shifting from a planned economy to a market economy. Not only people like myself, but even the most senior government officials, did not have the vaguest idea of what a market economy was. It seemed it was hard to survive.” Ren was born in 1944 in Southern China - a tumultuous, chaotic place, one of the poorest regions in an already destitute country. For a long time, hardship was all he ever knew. He was from a family of seven children. “They were very poor,” says David De Cremer, who has co-written a book on Ren and Huawei. “I think hardship is something that you can see throughout his life, and which he keeps emphasising himself.” To escape that life of poverty and drudgery, Ren did what many young Chinese men of that era did. He joined the army. Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, 1972 “I was a very low-ranking officer in the People’s Liberation Army,” he says. “I served in an ordinary construction project, not a field unit. At the time, I was a technician of a company in the military, and then I became an engineer.” He left the military in 1983 when China began to downsize its forces, and went into the electronics business. By his own admission, he wasn’t a great businessman at first. “I was someone who had been in the military all my life at the time, used to doing what I was told,” he says. “Suddenly, I began to work in a market economy. I was at a total loss. So I too suffered losses, I too was deceived, and I was cheated.” But he was quick to learn, and was a keen student of Western business practices and European history. “I did research on what exactly a market economy was all about,” he says. “I read books on laws, including those about European and US laws. At that time, there were very few books on Chinese laws, and I had to read those on European and US laws.” Five years later, he founded Huawei  - the name can be translated as “splendid achievement” or “China is able” - to sell simple telecoms equipment to the rural Chinese market. Within a few years, Huawei was developing and producing the equipment itself. Sometime in the early 90s, Huawei won a government contract to provide telecoms equipment for the People’s Liberation Army. By 1995, the company was generating sales of around US$220m, mainly from selling to the rural market. The following year Huawei was given the status of a Chinese “national champion”. In practice, this meant the government closed the market to foreign competition. At a time when China’s economy was growing by an average of 10% per year, this was no small advantage. But it was only when Huawei started to expand overseas in 2000, that it really saw its sales soar. In 2002, Huawei made US$552m from its international market sales. By 2005 its international market contracts exceeded its domestic business for the first time. Ren’s early days in business instilled in him a desire to protect his company from the whims and fancies of the stock market. Huawei is privately held and employee-owned. This gave Ren the power to plough more money back into research and development. Each year, Huawei spends US$20bn on R&D – one of the biggest such budgets in the world. “Publicly listed companies have to pay a lot of attention to their balance sheets,” he says. “They can't invest too much, otherwise profits will drop and so will their share prices. At Huawei, we fight for our ideals. We know that if we fertilise our ‘soil’ it will become more bountiful. That's how we've managed to pull ahead and succeed.” One story from the early days of the company tells how Ren was cooking for his staff (he loves to cook, or so the story goes). Suddenly he rushed out of the kitchen and announced to the room: “Huawei will be a top three player in the global communications market 20 years from now!” And that’s exactly what happened. In fact, those ambitions were surpassed. Today, Huawei is the world’s biggest seller of network telecommunications equipment. From aspiring to be a company like Apple, it now sells more smartphones than Apple. But shadows have continued to loom over Huawei’s international success. Ren and Huawei’s links to the Chinese Communist Party have raised suspicions that the company owes its meteoric rise to its powerful political connections in China. The US has accused Huawei of being a tool of the Chinese government. It’s an accusation which Ren denies. “Please don't think that Huawei has become what it is today because we have special connections,” he says. “Even 100% state-owned companies have failed. Do good connections mean you will succeed then? Huawei’s success is still very much due to our hard work.” It was 1 December 2018. US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping were dining on grilled sirloin followed by caramel rolled pancakes at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. They had a lot to discuss. The US and China were in the middle of a trade war - imposing tariffs on each other’s goods - and growth forecasts for both countries had recently been cut as a result. This was adding to the fear of a slowing global economy. In the event, the two leaders agreed a truce in the trade war, with Donald Trumptweetingthat “Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward!” Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at dinner, December 2018 But thousands of kilometres north in Canada, an arrest was taking place that would throw doubt on this rapprochement. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and Ren Zhengfei’s eldest daughter, had been detained by Canadian officials while transferring between flights at Vancouver airport. The arrest had come at the request of the US, who accused her of breaking sanctions against Iran. “When she was detained, as her father, my heart broke,” says Ren, visibly emotional. “How could I watch my child suffer like this? But what happened, has happened. We can only depend on the law to solve this problem.” Meng Wanzhou being driven to court in Canada Huawei’s problems were just beginning. Nearly two months later, the US Department of Justice filed two indictments against Huawei and Ms Meng. Under the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng were charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran. The second indictment - against Huawei - involved criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets. Both Huawei and Ms Meng deny the charges. January 2019: Acting US attorney general Matthew Whittaker announces charges against Huawei and Meng Wanzhou The charge of stealing trade secrets centres on a robotic tool - developed by T-Mobile - known as Tappy. According to legal documents, Huawei had tried to buy Tappy, a device which mimicked human fingers by tapping mobile phone screens rapidly to test responsiveness. T-Mobile was in partnership with Huawei at the time, but it rebuffed the Chinese firm’s offers, fearing it would use the technology to make phones for T-Mobile’s competitors. It’s alleged that one of Huawei’s US employees then smuggled Tappy’s robotic arm into his satchel so that he could send its details to colleagues in China. After the alleged theft was discovered, the Huawei employee claimed that the arm had  mistakenly fallen into his bag. Huawei claimed that the employee had been acting alone, and the case was settled out of court in 2014. But the latest case is built on email trails between managers in China and the company’s US employees, linking Huawei management to the alleged theft. The indictment also details evidence of a bonus scheme from 2013, offering Huawei employees financial rewards for stealing confidential information from competitors. Huawei has denied any such scheme exists. Meng Wanzhou, photographed in 2014 This is not the first time that Huawei has been accused of stealing trade secrets. Over the years companies like Cisco, Nortel and Motorola have all pointed the finger at the Chinese firm. But US fears about Huawei are about much more than industrial espionage. For more than a decade, the US government has seen the company as little more than an arm of the Chinese Communist Party. These concerns have been brought to the fore with the advent of “fifth generation” or5G mobile internet, which promises download speeds 10 or 20 times faster than at present, and much greater connectivity between devices. As the world’s biggest telecoms infrastructure provider, Huawei is one of the companies best placed to build new 5G networks. But the US has warned its intelligence partners that awarding contracts to Huawei would be tantamount to allowing the Chinese spy on them. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently cautioned against Huawei, saying, “If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo The UK, Germany and Canada are reviewing whether Huawei's products pose a security threat. Australia went a step further last year, andbanned equipment suppliers“likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government”. Huawei was not mentioned by name, but Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says the company posed a national security risk because of its government links. She cites an article in Chinese law that makes it impossible for any company to refuse to help the Chinese Communist Party in intelligence gathering. “Admittedly, what is missing from this debate is the smoking gun,” she says. “For the average person who has a Huawei smartphone it’s not a big deal. But if you’re a Western government that has key national security to protect - why would you allow this access to a company that is in the political system that China is in?” For his part, Ren says that Huawei’s resources have never and would never be used to spy for the Chinese government. “The Chinese government has clearly said that it won’t ask companies to install backdoors,” he says. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe a secret entry point in software or a computer system that gives access to the person or entity who installed it to the inner workings of the system. “Huawei will not do it either,” he continues. “Our sales revenues are now hundreds of billions of dollars. We are not going to risk the disgust of our country and our customers all over the world because of something like that. We will lose all our business. I’m not going to take that risk.” Zhou Daiqi is Huawei’s chief ethics and compliance officer. He’s been with the company for nearly 25 years, in a number of different positions - chief engineer, director of the hardware department, head of the research centre in Xi’an, according to his biography on the company’s website. He is also understood to combine his high-ranking executive duties with another role - party secretary of Huawei’s Communist Party committee. All companies in China are required by law to have a Communist Party committee. Zhou Daiqi's profile on Huawei's website The official line is that they exist to ensure that employees uphold the country’s moral and social values. Representatives of the committee are also often tasked with helping workers with financial problems. But critics of China’s one-party system argue that they allow the state to exert control on corporate China. And they say the level of this control has increased in recent years. “[President] Xi Jinping is exerting greater control over the business community in China,” says Elliott Zaagman, who regularly advises Chinese companies on their PR strategy. “As these companies gain power and influence overseas, the party doesn’t want to lose control over them.” Ren, however, argues that the role of Huawei’s Communist Party committee is far less important than many in the West believe. “[It] serves only to educate its employees,” he says. “It is not involved in any business decisions.” In China, most chief executives are Communist Party members. Every year, they dutifully turn up to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) which happens in parallel to the National People's Congress (NPC). The NPC is attended by local and national party chiefs, officials and chief executives. But the CPCC is where the business community shows its commitment to the party. Being a member of the party is very much a networking opportunity - in the way one would join a business association. Elliott Zaagman argues that this is a system that demands loyalty. “There is no separation from the party and the state,” he says. “The system in China encourages the lack of transparency in companies like Huawei.” The worry is that these close links mean that if the Communist Party asked a company to do something, they would have no choice but to comply. And if that company is one that is involved in sensitive global telecoms infrastructure projects, it’s easy to see why Western observers would be worried. There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei is in any way under the orders of the Chinese government, or that Beijing has any plans to dictate business plans and strategy at Huawei - particularly when it comes to spying. But the way in which the Chinese Communist Party has robustly defended Huawei has raised questions about how independent the company is of its influence. For example, Beijing stated that Ms Meng’s detention wasa rights abuse. And while her extradition case to the US was moving forward, China detained two Canadian citizens andaccused them of stealing state secrets. Critics say the detentions are linked to Ms Meng’s arrest. December 2018: Chinese police patrol outside Canada's embassy in Beijing While not commenting on the arrest of the Canadians, Ren says China’s defence of Huawei is understandable. “It is the Chinese government’s duty to protect its people,” he says. “If the US attempts to gain competitive edge by undermining China’s most outstanding hi-tech talent, then it is understandable if the Chinese government, in turn, protects its hi-tech companies.” Over the past few years, there have been signs ofa bigger push by the governmentto get private companies, and in particular tech firms, to cooperate with party rules - even when they are firmly resistant. A Didi Chuxing logo adorns a building in Hangzhou, China China’s ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing’s troubles are an example of the struggles Chinese firms face when they try to uphold their independence in the face of government pressure. Chinese attitudes to data collection and data privacy are different to those in the West - many people don’t care if businesses have access to their data, arguing that it adds to the convenience of life and work. Government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside of China assume it to be So it wasn’t unusual when, after the murders of two of its passengers by Didi drivers, regulators used the scandal to force Didi toshare more corporate data with the government.But Didi resisted - citing customer privacy. Under Chinese law, it had no choice but to comply. When it did, it handed over “three boxes of data printed on paper, including 95 hard copies for authorities to review”. According to Samm Sacks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the case demonstrates that “government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside China assume it to be”. She says this indicates that there appears to be “a kind of tug of war between the government and companies over data”. How this plays out will determine how Chinese companies are viewed by foreign governments when they do business overseas. Companies like Huawei have grown up in a system where to survive and thrive they needed strong links to the Chinese government - there was and is no other choice. But these links could harm their reputation abroad. “It’s two different systems,” says Zaagman. “Think of it like an electrical outlet. China’s plug doesn’t fit in to the outlets we have in the West.” Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ “Basically you want to connect to everything that can be connected.” Zhu Peiying, head of Huawei’s 5G wireless labs, is showing off devices that can connect to the new technology. From a smart toothbrush that collects data about how well you brush your teeth, to a smart cup that reminds you when you should drink some water, this is a world where everything you can think of is being measured and analysed. At its most sophisticated, everything in entire cities would be connected - driverless cars, the temperature of buildings, the speed of public transport - the list is endless. Huawei is thought to be a year ahead of its competitors in terms of its technological expertise and what it can offer customers, according to industry sources. It’s also thought that the company can offer prices that are about 10% cheaper than its competitors, although critics claim this is because of state support. Ren dismisses this, saying that Huawei doesn’t receive government subsidies. He says the real reason behind the US resistance to Huawei is its superior technology. “There’s no way the US can crush us,” he says. “The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily we could just scale things down a bit.” Many analysts say that Huawei’s exclusion from US networks could actually cause the US to fall behind in its 5G capabilities. “It would mean we wouldn’t be able to participate in any blended network [using Huawei] in Europe or Asia,” says Samm Sacks of CSIS. “That would put us at a significant disadvantage.” What this would mean in reality is a world of two internets - or what analysts are calling a ""digital iron curtain"" - dividing the world into parts that do business with Chinese companies like Huawei, and those that don't. Because of US pressure on its allies, Huawei has been on an aggressive public relations campaign to win over customers and government stakeholders. In recent days, Vodafone’s boss Nick Read called on the US to share any evidence it has about Huawei, while Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s vice president for the digital single market, said in a tweet that he had met with Huawei’s rotating CEO to discuss the importance of being open and transparent, as they explored ways of working together. But suspicions about Huawei remain. One security firm reports a sharp rise in inquiries by Asian government clients about Huawei. ""Some have asked us how much they should worry about whether Huawei is really a liability,"" says an analyst who consults to Asian governments, on condition of anonymity. Ren is sanguine about such concerns. “For countries who believe in them [suspicions about Huawei] we will hold off,” he says.  “For countries who feel Huawei is trustworthy, we may move a little faster. The world is so big. We can't walk across every corner of it.” But this is about more than just one company or one CEO and his family. Increasingly, this is perceived as a battle between two world orders, and which one is the future. In the early days of China opening up, US presidents like George HW Bush espoused the merits of engagement. “No nation on Earth has discovered a way to import the world's goods and services while stopping foreign ideas at the border,”he said in a 1991 speech. “Just as the democratic idea has transformed nations on every continent, so, too, change will inevitably come to China.” 1989: George HW Bush in Beijing - he encouraged economic engagement with China Previous US administrations believed that economic engagement in China would lead to China following a freer, more “liberal” path. There’s no denying China has made remarkable strides in the past 40 years. The economy grew by an annual average of 10% for three decades, helping to lift 800 million people out of poverty. It is now the second-largest economy in the world, only surpassed by the US. Some estimates put China’s economy ahead of America’s by 2030. It achieved this while maintaining one-party rule and the supremacy of the Communist Party. But its success has raised concerns that it is only possible with a huge amount of government control over the country’s companies. The fear is that control could be used to achieve the Communist Party’s goals - which are at this point unclear. “It’s a double-edged sword for China,” says Danielle Cave. “[Because of its laws] the Chinese Communist Party has made it virtually impossible for Chinese companies to expand without attracting understandable and legitimate suspicion.” Added to this, China has become more authoritarian under Xi Jinping’s rule. President Xi Jinping “Xi is systematically undermining virtually every feature that made China so distinct and helped it work so well in the past,”writes Jonathan Tepperman, editor in chief of Foreign Policy. “His efforts may boost his own power and prestige in the short term and reduce some forms of corruption. On balance, however, Xi’s campaign will have disastrous long-term consequences for his country and the world.” But Ren dismisses this, insisting that China is more open than ever before. “If this meeting took place 30 years ago,” he says of our interview, “it would have been very dangerous for me. Today, I can be straightforward when answering difficult questions. This shows that China has a more open political environment.” Still, Ren is hopeful of the direction China will take in the future. “China has more or less tried to close itself off from the outside world for 5,000 years,” he says. “Yet we had found ourselves poor, lagging behind other nations. It was only in the past 30 years since Deng Xiaoping opened China's doors to the world that China has become more prosperous. Therefore, China must continue to move forward on the path of reform and opening-up.” In one of Huawei’s vast campus sites across Shenzen, lies a man-made lake. Swimming in these serene waters are two black swans. There is a story that Ren put the birds here to remind employees of “black swan” events - unpredictable and catastrophic financial eventualities that are impossible to prepare for. He dismisses this as an urban myth, but it’s hard not to read something into it. For Huawei, and Ren, these are highly uncertain times with no way of telling what lies ahead. Built with Shorthand"
Could Huawei threaten Five Eyes?,"In the shiny, optimistic vision of the future we will all be living in ""smart cities"" in which self-driving cars will check the best routes after being charged up on intelligent, connected power grids. Public services and safety will be carefully managed though data, while devices in our homes will talk to each other and the wider world as part of the ""internet-of-things"". Many of these services will be delivered over what is called 5G. It will be much more than just faster data on our phones, but potentially transformational for our lives - if you believe the hype. But there is a darker fear as well. What if it is also transformational for our security if we end up reliant on a Chinese company to deliver this future? That question risks causing a major divide in the Five Eyes - the intelligence alliance between the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The US is campaigning hard among allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from delivering 5G. ""We have serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere,"" Bill Evanina, head of America's National Counterintelligence and Security Center has said. ""Chinese company relationships with the Chinese government aren't like private sector company relationships with governments in the West."" Huawei has always denied being controlled by the Chinese government, or that its work poses any risks of espionage and sabotage. Its founder repeated these assertions in a recent interview with the BBC. This video can not be played Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou as politically motivated But Australia and New Zealand have sounded negative about Huawei's involvement in their 5G networks to varying degrees, and Canada is still deciding. All eyes are now on the UK. In a speech in Brussels on Wednesday, Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, set out the framework for considering the security of 5G based on its experience so far of working with the company. The current oversight regime was ""arguably the toughest and most rigorous"" in the world for Huawei, he said. His officials say they have found ''poor security and engineering"" by the company, but the indications are still that the UK may work with Huawei on 5G. The US cannot crush us, says Huawei founder UK is ""vulnerable to Chinese interference"" Huawei risk ""can be managed"" If that is the decision then other countries - not only in the Five Eyes but also the EU and Nato - may well be tempted to follow, using the UK as a reference point because of its track record of scrutiny. There could be consequences, former officials warn. Ciaran Martin said the UK would ""not compromise on the improvements we need to see from Huawei"" ""Worries about the security of UK networks following their exposure to Huawei may make the Five Eyes partners, and perhaps others such as France, Germany or Japan, less inclined to co-operate with the UK in the future,"" Charles Parton, a former British diplomat, argues in a new paper for the think tank Rusi. ""The maintenance of a 'Five Eyes standard' of cyber-security in telecommunications is a vital strategic and security interest, the loss of which would go far beyond a reduction in intelligence reports exchanged, and might lead to the UK being excluded from work on developing future technologies for intelligence collection."" The UK's special relationship with Huawei came about in the early 2000s, when BT was upgrading its networks and the Chinese firm came in much cheaper than the alternatives - by hundreds of millions of pounds. BT told the government it planned to use the company unless the government was willing to compensate it. Even though Huawei was kept out of the core of the network and sensitive systems, concerns over security and the growing use of Huawei by other companies led - a few years later - to the creation of a ""cell"" toevaluate the security of Huawei products coming into the UK. The cell's last oversight report downgraded the assurance about mitigating the risks associated with Huawei, because of serious problems with security and engineering processes. However, Mr Martin said in his speech, the report said that these were not indicators of hostile activity by China, . The company says it will invest money to deal with these concerns in the coming years, although UK officials say that so far they have not seen ""a credible plan"". Huawei's 5G antennas and masts are already being tested in the UK Despite that, the indications are that the UK wants to hold out against US pressure and continue to work with the company on 5G. A decision is expected in the next two months by ministers who will need to balance security with costs and the risks to wider relationships. ""Resilience is key,"" Mr Martin said in Brussels. ""There must be sustainable diversity in the supplier market."" That was one signal that even though the UK may work with Huawei, it is cautious about ending up with one dominant player on whom it is dependent. But critics fear that Huawei - possibly with Chinese state backing - is working its way into a dominant position in the long term, particularly by penetrating markets in the developing world and by setting standards for 5G. One of the biggest challenges with 5G is cost. In many countries, telecoms companies paid much more for the 5G spectrum than they had expected. They are now looking at the sums and indicating their strong preference for the cheapest vendor - Huawei. Telecoms operators in the UK say the way in which 5G can work in a highly integrated system alongside 4G means that excluding Huawei is not realistic without significant cost and delay, including potentially removing existing hardware, leading to the UK falling behind. Breaking the ties with the company could also have significant consequences for the UK-China relationship which poses challenges with Brexit approaching. But the question will be how the US and the Trump administration reacts if the UK does not follow its line - especially if other countries use the UK as cover to follow and work with Huawei. This at a time when the UK may be looking for a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. It potentially leaves the UK between a rock and a hard place and is one more reason why the Huawei decision is placing strain on the historically close Five Eyes intelligence relationship.

Ms McKee's sister, Nichola Corner, told mourners: ""In the words of Lyra herself, we must change our own world, one piece at a time. Now let's get to work."" Hundreds gathered for the funeral of Ms McKee, who was from a Catholic background, at a Protestant cathedral. The congregation was led by Ms McKee's partner, mother Joan McKee, brothers Gary and David and sisters Joan, Nichola and Mary. Her family chose the location due to its reputation as a ""shared space"" in a divided city. Many friends of the journalist and campaigner for LGBT rights wore Harry Potter-themed T-shirts, scarves and badges to the service. Ms McKee was an avid fan of the series. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral in Belfast's St Anne's Cathedral Messages of condolence left by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Prime Minister Theresa May At the beginning of the service, the Anglican dean of Belfast, the Very Reverend Stephen Forde, said: ""Lyra was a person who broke down barriers and reached across boundaries, this was her hallmark in life, this is her legacy in death. ""She was a child of the Good Friday agreement. She was a primary school pupil in north Belfast when the agreement was signed. ""She grew up to champion its hope for a society that was free from the prejudices of the past."" Grief and outrage over Ms McKee's murder has sparked hopes there is now momentum to break the political deadlock in Northern Ireland.

What is 5G?,"High-speed mobile could enable robots, sensors and other machines to communicate Superfast fifth generation, or 5G, mobile internet services are already on offer. You can't get it everywhere yet and handset choices remains limited. But that will change in the coming months, so what difference will 5G make to our lives? It's the next generation of mobile internet connection and offers much faster data download and upload speeds. Through greater use of the radio spectrum it will allow far more devices to access the mobile internet at the same time. ""Whatever we do now with our smartphones we'll be able to do faster and better,"" says Ian Fogg from OpenSignal, a mobile data analytics company. ""Think of smart glasses featuring augmented reality, mobile virtual reality, much higher quality video, the internet of things making cities smarter. ""But what's really exciting is all the new services that will be built that we can't foresee."" Driverless cars will be able to ""talk"" to each other and traffic management systems Imagine swarms of drones co-operating to carry out search and rescue missions, fire assessments and traffic monitoring, all communicating wirelessly with each other and ground base stations over 5G networks. Similarly, many think 5G will be crucial for autonomous vehicles to communicate with each other and read live map and traffic data. Mobile gamers should notice less delay - or latency - when pressing a button on a controller and seeing the effect on screen. Mobile videos should be near instantaneous and glitch-free. Video calls should become clearer and less jerky. Wearable fitness devices could monitor your health in real time, alerting doctors as soon as any emergency arises. It's a new radio technology, but you might not notice vastly higher speeds at first because 5G is likely to be used by network operators initially as a way to boost capacity on existing 4G core networks, to ensure a more consistent service for customers. The speed you get will depend on which spectrum band the operator runs the 5G technology on and how much your carrier has invested in new masts and transmitters. This video can not be played WATCH: What the superfast 5G connection will mean So we may see clusters of smaller phone masts closer to the ground transmitting so-called ""millimetre waves"" between much higher numbers of transmitters and receivers. This will enable higher density of usage. But it's expensive and companies could face challenges deploying lots of new masts. So how fast could it be? The fastest current 4G mobile networks offer about 45Mbps (megabits per second) on average, although the industry is still hopeful of achieving 1Gbps (gigabit per second = 1,000Mbps) Chipmaker Qualcomm reckons 5G could achieve browsing and download speeds about 10 to 20 times faster in real-world (as opposed to laboratory) conditions. That would allow you to download a high-definition film in a minute or so. This video can not be played Does Nokia's lightning-quick 5G demo give us a glimpse of the future? The big improvement in speed and latency will come when service providers roll out standalone 5G networks, where both the core and radio networks use 5G tech. They could easily achieve gigabit-plus browsing speeds as standard. But these aren't likely to come until next year in the UK. The world is going mobile and we're consuming more data every year, particularly as the popularity of video and music streaming increases. Existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns in service, particularly when lots of people in the same area are trying to access online mobile services at the same time. 5G is much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from mobiles to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Yes. But when 4G was introduced in 2009/10, compatible smart phones came onto the market before the infrastructure had been rolled out fully, leading to some frustration amongst consumers who felt they were paying more in subscriptions for a patchy service. Lack of signal and low data speeds in rural areas is a common complaint in the UK and many other countries. But 5G won't necessarily address this issue as it will operate on high-frequency bands - to start with at least - that have a lot of capacity but cover shorter distances. 5G will primarily be an urban service for densely populated areas. Lower-frequency bands (600-800Mhz typically) are better over longer distances, so network operators will concentrate on improving their 4G LTE coverage in parallel with 5G roll-out. But commercial reality means that for some people in very remote areas, connectivity will still be patchy at best without government subsidy making it worthwhile for network operators to go to these places.

Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government since January 2017,when the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. On Wednesday, NI Secretary Karen Bradley said she intended tohold talks with Stormont party leaders in a bid to make progress.

Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald rejected Mr Wilson's criticisms. ""He knows that the issues that have held us back are issues of equality and recognition,"" she said. ""This stalemate is not acceptable and we need to act to resolve it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Three people have been arrested over the murder, and all have been released without charge. Speaking after her funeral, Northern Ireland's top police officer said Ms McKee ""cared passionately about issues and worked hard and with integrity"". ""Of course that is in complete contrast to those people who came out of the shadows last Thursday night, fired shots at police lines, hitting Lyra and fatally injuring her,"" said Chief Constable George Hamilton. ""I suppose the outpouring of condemnation from the communities of Derry, Creggan all standing together in Creggan last Friday, was something I think was quite unique and quite different."" Members of the public stood outside the church to pay their respects to Ms McKee Ms McKee had written for publications including Private Eye, the Atlantic, Mosaic Science and Mediagazer. She had also signed a two-book deal with the publisher Faber and Faber, with her forthcoming book The Lost Boys due out in 2020. The hashtag #IStandWithLyra has been trending on Twitter, which Ms McKee used prolifically. Comedian Patrick Kielty, who is from Northern Ireland,tweeted:,external""Today Lyra McKee is laid to rest. She believed in peace, tolerance and equality. The exact opposite of those responsible. They will never win because Lyra will always be the future. And her truth will continue to be told. #IStandWithLyra"" Fellow members of the National Union of Journalists formed a guard of honour at the cathedral.

Third of NI young adults still at home,"The proportion of young adults still living with their parents is higher in Northern Ireland than any other part of the UK. Some 34% of 20-34 year olds there have not yet permanently moved out, according to the latest government research. In 2017, 26% of young adults in England were still living at home, while it was a quarter in Scotland and 23% in Wales. These young people have become known as the boomerang generation. A recent BBC report found one millionmore young people across the UK were back living with their mum or dad. Prof Paddy Gray, interim director of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said there were a number of reasons that might explain why the figure was higher in Northern Ireland. ""Ten, 20 years ago the lending criteria would not have been as strict and you would have had 5% deposits and in some cases 100% loans,"" he said. ""Money was easier to get access too and people did have long-term jobs. ""We have a gig economy now, particularly for young people who are working different part time jobs. ""They don't have the security of jobs for life. Lenders will look at that as well."" Rachel Crothers lives at home with her mother Rachel Crothers, 32, lives at home with her mother. ""I came back from university and I've lived here since then,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I work full time and I've decided to study again, which is taking a huge chunk out of my deposit money,"" she added. Ms Crothers said that living with a parent had its ""ups and downs"" but she got on well with her mother. ""The times it gets difficult is when I go on a night out and coming home, I have to be quiet, or if I'm in a relationship - that's a challenge because I don't want to encroach on my mum's territory,"" she said. Ms Crother's mother Carolyn Stewart said things were very difficult for first-time buyers like her daughter. ""Rachel is in quite a good job but it's the amount of savings you have to get,"" she said. ""When you check house prices out and then you look at the deposit, you think how in the world are they ever going to get that deposit?"" Prof Gray also said cultural and commuting differences were factors behind the higher proportion of boomerang kids in Northern Ireland. ""In other major cities in England in particular like London, Birmingham, Manchester, students would come in to the area and then stay there after because they're living there,"" he said. ""Whereas our students maybe only come down two nights a week and then go back home to living with their parents again."" 2017 Northern Ireland34% Great Britain25% Another factor was the legacy of the Troubles, he said. ""Particularly in areas where there are interfaces, people don't want to move because they want to stay in the safety of their communities,"" he said. ""Also there isn't the housing available because on one side of the wall there could be high waiting lists where people can't get access to other housing."" Gary McMahon commutes to Belfast every day Gary McMahon, 28, lives in Warrenpoint with his parents and commutes to Belfast every day. He said commitments to football training at home meant it made more sense to stay at home. ""One bedroom apartments in Belfast at the minute cost probably about Â£800 or Â£900 so it just didn't make sense if you're trying to get ahead to put some money away in the long run,"" he said. ""There are always times when you want your personal space but we're pretty close."" Mr McMahon said he was hoping to buy, preferably near home in the next two years.

Sinead Quinn said friends of Ms McKee would be wearing T-shirts like this one to the funeral They said they were thankful for the huge outpouring of sympathy in recent days, and that she should be remembered as ""someone who spoke to and made friends with anybody and everybody, no matter what their background"". That will be one of the themes of the funeral service, with Protestant and Catholic clergy taking part and politicians from across the political divide in attendance. The journalist and campaigner for LGBT rights is survived by her partner, mother, two brothers and three sisters. Her funeral is to be held at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast, and the service will be led jointly by the Anglican dean of Belfast, the Very Reverend Stephen Forde, and Fr Martin Magill at 13.00 BST. By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI In life and in death, Lyra McKee is bringing people together in Belfast. The funeral of this 29-year-old woman, from a Catholic background, is taking place in a Protestant cathedral. Her family chose the cathedral due to its reputation as a ""shared space"" in a divided city. It may be Church of Ireland in its status and governance, but it has strong ecumenical links and even has a chapel of unity. The death of Ms McKee was a horrific reminder of the old Northern Ireland. Many are hoping that her funeral will be a symbol of something new. Ms McKee's partner, Sara Canning, said the service would be a ""celebration of her life"". ""If people would like to wear Hufflepuff, Harry Potter or Marvel related T-shirts I know she would love it,"" Ms Canning said. Secretary of State Karen Bradley will be among the dignitaries attending the funeral, while the Irish government's representatives include the foreign minister, Simon Coveney. Dissident republican group the New IRAadmitted responsibility for the journalist's murder, according to the Irish News. Three people have been arrested over the shooting, but all have been released without charge. Fr Joe Gormley, who anointed Ms McKee after she was shot dead, told BBC News NI there was still a ""great deal of shock"" in Derry. Sara Canning (centre) was ""planning to grow old"" with her partner Lyra McKee ""But people are also reflecting and they know that we are faced with a choice in life,"" he said. ""We either go back to the dark days or move forward."" He said he was willing to ""sit down and talk"" to those responsible. Lyra McKee, who was also a campaigner for LGBT rights, gave a TED talk in 2017 Fellow members of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) are to form a guard of honour at the cathedral. The union described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. CiarÃ¡n Ã MaolÃ¡in, the union's Belfast secretary, described her as ""intelligent, determined and very witty"". There will be a gathering at Guildhall Square in Derry at 13:00 BST for those who cannot attend her funeral.

Wild salmon stocks 'at lowest ever level',"Wild salmon catches in Scotland are at their lowest level since records began, government figures have revealed. Fisheries Management Scotland said new data highlighted that stocks of the fish are at ""crisis point"". The total reported catch through rod fishing was 37,196 for 2018, which was just 67% of the previous five-year average total. The vast majority of these, 93%, were caught and then released back into the water. The alliance of salmon fishery boards said catches of the fish are at their lowest levels since 1952. 'Approaching crisis point' The Scottish government has set outa number of salmon conservation measures,externalin recent years. Environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ""The decline in wild salmon numbers is of great concern, and I'm determined that we safeguard the future of this important species."" But Alan Wells, chief executive of Fisheries Management Scotland, said more needed to be done. He said: ""Salmon catches in Scotland have reached the lowest levels ever recorded. ""Figures for 2018, taken together with those of recent years, confirm this iconic species is now approaching crisis point. Some of the factors impacting on wild salmon stocks may be beyond human control. ""But the regulatory authorities now have a historic opportunity to do everything in their power to safeguard the species in those areas where they can make a difference."" In the past campaigners have claimedfish farms are to blame for wild salmon deathsas a result of sea lice originating from the farms. And a Scottish Parliament inquiry has recommendednew farms be positioned away from established migratory routesfor wild salmon. The annual economic value of Scottish salmon passed the Â£1bn mark for the first time last year and the 226 active farms support 10,000 jobs, many of which are in rural communities. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency has previously said one in five salmon farms failed to meet environmental standards Andrew Graham-Stewart, director of Salmon and Trout Conservation Scotland, said: ""Continuing low salmon numbers underline the vital importance of mitigating those man-made negative impacts, which are within our grasp to tackle, as a matter of urgency. ""One of the most critical factors is the impact of open-net salmon farms, in particular the release into the wider environment of vast numbers of deadly parasitic sea lice, on wild salmon numbers."" The salmon farming industry has insisted it is working hard to find solutions to the problem of sea lice, and is making progress inrearing so-called cleaner fishwhich feed off the lice, avoiding the need for chemicals. The Scottish government will publish the official wild salmon population data later. Environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the fall in the salmon catch was down to a range of complex factors, ""many of which are outwith our control, including the unprecedented water shortages Scotland experienced last summer"". She added: ""We have identified 12 groups of high level pressures on the species, and we're working closely with key partners to address these. Last year, for example, we committed Â£500,000 to fund research so we can better understand the problem and mitigate against it. ""In addition, we are providing around Â£5m a year to the Water Environment Fund to allow Sepa to remove barriers to fish migration in rivers around Scotland.""

Oscars will not restrict streaming films,"Director Alfonso Cuaron's Roma won three Oscars for Netflix's Roma this year Film streaming services could see continued awards success after the body behind the Oscars voted down calls to tighten its submission process. Figures including Steven Spielberg have said films that are given only brief cinema runs shouldn't be nominated. Films are currently eligible if they are shown in one LA cinema for a week. But, two months after Netflix's Roma won three Oscars, the governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided against any changes. Spielberg is a governor of the Academy but wasn't at the meeting where the potential changes were discussed on Tuesday. He told the New York Times he wanted the cinema experience ""to remain relevant in our culture"". Netflix has previously said it should be easier for people who can't get to the cinema to see films. At Tuesday's meeting, the Academy decided that movies will remain eligible if they are released in at least one Los Angeles cinema for at least a week before or at the same time as they are made available to stream. Netflix hits back at Oscars backlash Helen Mirren gives Netflix short shrift Why the Oscars aren't all about Hollywood Academy president John Bailey said: ""We support the theatrical experience as integral to the art of motion pictures, and this weighed heavily in our discussions. ""Our rules currently require theatrical exhibition, and also allow for a broad selection of films to be submitted for Oscars consideration."" Noting ""profound changes"" in the film industry, Mr Bailey added that the board would ""continue discussions with our members about these issues"". In March, the US Justice Departmentwrote a letter warning the Academy,externalthat changes toeligibility rules,external- which might freeze out competition form streaming services - might violate antitrust laws. And earlier this month, Oscar-winning actress Dame Helen Mirrengave Netflix short shriftat an event for cinema exhibitors in Las Vegas. Spielberg has been a previous critic of the eligibility rules Last year,Spielberg said,external: ""I don't believe that films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theatres for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination."" In a new statement to the New York Times,external, he said: ""I want people to find their entertainment in any form or fashion that suits them. Big screen, small screen - what really matters to me is a great story and everyone should have access to great stories. ""However, I feel people need to have the opportunity to leave the safe and familiar of their lives and go to a place where they can sit in the company of others and have a shared experience."" 2019 Roma - best director, best foreign language film, best cinematography 2019 Period. End of Sentence - best documentary short subject 2018 Icarus - best documentary feature 2017 The White Helmets, best documentary short subject The other big decision made by the Academy governors was to change the title of the foreign language film category to international feature film. ""We have noted that the reference to 'foreign' is outdated within the global film-making community,"" said Larry Karaszewski and Diane Weyermann from the Academy's international feature film committee. The name change does not change eligibility rules that say the film should be made outside the US with mainly non-English dialogue.

in places such as hospitals, childrenâs homes and schools. Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, who proposed the debate on behalf of
the backbench business committee, said studies show the use of force is âendemic
in the systemâ. He said MPs are âstill waitingâ for the Department for
Education to issue guidance on the use of force on children, after guidance for
adults was issued in 2014. The government has not yet responded to a consultation in
this area launched by the Health and Education departments, which closed in
January last year. MPs have now started their debate on school funding, a topic chosen for the slot this afternoon by the backbench business committee.

Huawei leak: Minister says he cannot rule out a criminal investigation European elections urgent question House of CommonsParliament The Commons has finished the urgent question on Huawei, and is now on to a question asked by Labour's Catherine West on registration of European citizens for upcoming European elections. Catherine West represents Hornsey and Wood Green, in London, which is an area with a high proportion of EU citizens. Conservative Bob Blackman asks for guarantees that the procurement process for new wireless technology will be ""subject to open competition"". He says technology provided by Huawei is ""niche"" but not ""unique"". In reply, Jeremy Wright says it is ""obviously better to have a number of suppliers in the system"" from a security point of view. However he says there are ""essentially only three suppliers in this space"" - Huawei, Nokia and Ericsson. He adds that it is ""not a right assumption"" that excluding Huawei and using the other two would lead to a ""safe network"". BBC chief political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Huawei urgent question House of CommonsParliament Conservative Victoria Prentis asks if the National Security Council leak might become the subject of a criminal investigation. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright says the government ""cannot exclude the possibility"" of this happening. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Pat McFadden says the Huawei leak is ""symptomatic"" of a ""wider breakdown"" in collective responsibility in the government. He says the only two factors in the decision should be the UK's technological future and national security, not the ""political share price"" of cabinet members. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright says national security considerations will be ""pre-eminent"" in the ongoing review over wireless networks. Huawei urgent question House of CommonsParliament Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat raises concerns that there is less of a distinction between ""core and non-core"" equipment in a 5G network, so saying that Huawei equipment will only be used in non-core sections of the network is still a problem. He says that by putting Huawei equipment in, the UK could be eroding trust within the'Five Eyes' community. Mr Wright says ""there is no lack of respect"" for what the international community is saying on Huawei. The government is listening to what the advice is internationally and domestically on the telecoms company, he adds. Huawei urgent question House of CommonsParliament Jeremy Wright says he ""entirely agrees"" with what was said on leaks from the National Security Council, as there is ""good reason"" why these meetings are kept private. ""The government intends to treat it seriously,"" he says of the leak. He says there is an oversight board in place for equipment supplied by Huawei to the UK. ""Chinese equipment...is prevalent across the world"" and there is a ""good deal"" of Huawei equipment already used in existing mobile networks, he adds. Huawei urgent question Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Jo Platt says there should be a full inquiry into how discussions over Huawei were leaked. She adds that any person found to be responsible for the leak should resign or be sacked. It would be ""truly shocking"", she says, if a minister did so to gain an advantage in a forthcoming leadership contest. National security matters should be handled with the ""utmost care"", she says, not ""used as political ammunition in a Tory party civil war"". Huawei urgent question House of CommonsParliament Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright says the security of the UK's 5G infrastucture is of ""paramount importance"" but the UK's economy ""can only prosper"" when its ""world-class infrastructure is assured"". ""We have to strike a difficult balance between security and prosperity,"" he says, adding that the current review into 5G from Huawei is ""thorough"" and will report in due course. He says he will make a further statement later when decisions have been formally made. Huawei has denied there is any risk of espionage or sabotage Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright is now answering an urgent question on the row over Huawei's role in wireless internet infrastructure. It comes after reports that the government hasapproved the supply of equipmentby the Chinese telecoms firm for the UK's new 5G data network - despite warnings of a security risk. It is believed the decision was taken at a meeting of the government's National Security Council on Tuesday. Government ministers are calling for a ""full and proper"" investigation after details of the discussions were leaked to the Daily Telegraph. House of CommonsParliament Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the
Commons. The day has started with questions to ministers at the Department for International Trade, to be followed by Women and Equalities questions at 10.00 BST. At 10:30 BST, there will be an urgent question on the decision
to allow Huawei to provide aspects of the UKâs 5G infrastructure. This will be followed by two more urgent questions on registering EU citizens for the European elections, and the government's mandate for the NHS.

"Labour pledges to end 'slum' office housingIt says current planning rules allow developers in England to convert offices into ""rabbit hutch"" homes.BusinessComments","This video can not be played The families living in converted office blocks in Harlow Labour says it would scrap a government scheme that allows offices and industrial buildings to be converted into homes without planning permission. The party said changes to permitted development rules in England had led to the creation of ""slum housing and rabbit hutch flats"". It also said developers had been able to avoid building affordable homes. The Conservatives said the plans would ""cut house building and put a stop to people achieving home ownership"". In 2013, the government changed planning rules to allow developers to turn offices, warehouses and industrial buildings into residential blocks without getting permission from the local council, in a bid to boost house building. Barnet House in North London is being converted to 254 flats The rules have since been further relaxed, leading to 42,000 new dwellings being created from former offices in the last few years. However, permitted development schemes are exempt from official space standards and also from any requirement to provide affordable homes. 'I don't want my kids thinking this is normal' 'Micro-homes could solve' housing crisis Labour said the policy had seen the loss of more than 10,000 affordable homes, and meant that flats ""just a few feet wide"" were now counted in official statistics as new homes. It said its policy was still to build 250,000 new homes a year in England with 100,000 being ""genuinely affordable"". ""This Conservative housing free-for-all gives developers a free hand to build what they want but ignore what local communities need,"" said John Healey, Labour's shadow housing secretary. ""Labour will give local people control over the housing that gets built in their area and ensure developers build the low-cost, high-quality homes that the country needs."" Police figures show crime recorded at Terminus House, and the car park which sits beneath the housing, rose 45% in the first 10 months of it opening In one permitted development scheme at Newbury House in Ilford, an office block has been turned into 60 flats measuring as little as 13 sq metres each. According to national space standards, the minimum floor area for a new one-bedroom one-person home is 37 sq metres. Critics say the schemes can be damaging to residents' mental wellbeing, as well as being miles from amenities and conducive to crime. At Terminus House - a converted office block in Harlow -crime jumped 45% in the first 10 monthsafter people moved in and by 20% within that part of the town centre. But some developers warn that without permitted development many office to residential schemes would no longer be viable. The government says the rules are helping tackle the housing crisis and allowing people to get on the housing ladder. Of the 13,526 homes delivered under permitted development last year, more than three quarters were built outside of London Marcus Jones, Conservative vice-chair for Local Government, said: ""Labour's plans would cut house building and put a stop to people achieving homeownership. ""We are backing permitted development rights, which are converting dormant offices into places families can call home. ""Whilst Labour put politics before our families, the Conservatives are delivering the houses this country needs so every family has a place to call home.""

Brothers suing over Jussie Smollett case,"Jussie Smollett's legal team is being sued for defamation by two brothers who say they continue to be accused of carrying out a racist and homophobic attack against the actor. Police say the attack was staged, which Smollett denies. Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo say their reputations have been damaged as a result of the claims. Smollett's lawyers Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian described the lawsuit as ""comical"" and ""ridiculous"". The brothers, known as Ola and Abel, said in a statement: ""We have sat back and watched lie after lie being fabricated about us in the media only so one big lie can continue to have life. ""These lies are destroying our character and reputation in our personal and professional lives."" Smollett's legal team said: ""At first we thought this comical legal document was a parody. Pictures of Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo provided by their legal team ""Instead this so-called lawsuit by the brothers is more of their lawyer-driven nonsense, and a desperate attempt for them to stay relevant and further profit from an attack they admit they perpetrated. ""While we know this ridiculous lawsuit will soon be dismissed because it lacks any legal footing, we look forward to exposing the fraud the Osundairo brothers and their attorneys have committed on the public."" The Jussie Smollett case has been a complicated one to keep up with. How the Jussie Smollett drama unfolded In brief: it started on 29 January when Smollett was allegedly attacked by two masked men, who the actor said made reference to MAGA (make America great again) - the slogan often used by President Donald Trump and his supporters. On 14 February the Osundairo brothers were arrested by Chicago police and questioned. They had worked as extras on Empire, Smollett's show, sometimes going to the gym with the actor. A few days later the brothers were released by police without charge and, on 20 February, Jussie Smollett was charged with filing a false police report. Smollett was arrested and police say he paid the Osundairo brothers to stage the attack. On 1 March, the Osundairos said they ""regret"" their involvement in the incident. Two weeks later, Smollett pleaded not guilty to 16 counts of disorderly conduct - and 12 days after that all charges against him were controversially dropped. This video can not be played Watch the background to the bizarre Jussie Smollett case - this video was published in April 2019 This is when lawyers for the Osundairo brothers say Smollett's attorneys ""doubled down"" on ""untrue"" statements that the brothers were behind the ""criminally homophobic, racist, and violent attack"" against Smollett. They claim defamatory statements were made in interviews by one of Smollett's lawyers, Tina Glandian, the day after charges against him were dropped, and then repeated widely across the media. Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo are seeking financial compensation for the ""harm"" done to them as a result of the statements, which they say have caused ""irreparable financial damage"". Lawyers for the brothers say they've suffered ""significant emotional distress and feel unsafe and alienated in their local Chicago community"" as a result of the comments. ""Their lives have been forever changed and damaged by the words and acts of others,"" said lawyer Gloria Schmidt. ""Let me make one thing perfectly clear, the brothers have done nothing but tell the truth to CPD and to the Grand Jury.""

Single homelessness spending 'cut by ÃÂ£5bn',"Support services for single homeless people in England have lost Â£5bn since 2009, leaving people at risk with ""nowhere to turn"", charities say. Analysis for St Mungo's and Homeless Link found as councils faced central government funding cuts, such services lost an average of Â£590m a year. Rough sleeping, the most extreme form of homelessness, rose 165% over around the same period, the charities say. The government has set up more projects to tackle the issue since 2018. The charities acknowledge that the government has announced additional funding for local authorities for the coming years. But this is dwarfed by the money that has been lost over time, they said. Homeless deaths 'up 24%' over five years The city with no homeless on its streets Should homeless people be expected to live in a box? The charities commissioned researchers who looked at official spending data for all of England's local authorities. They cross-referred it with information on how many single person households and families were classed as homeless in different local authority areas. This enabled the team to arrive at a more accurate estimate of funds lost to services for homeless individuals. It found that if total expenditure on homelessness-related services had stayed constant from 2008-9, more than Â£5bn extra would have been spent. It also found that in 2017-18 local authorities spent Â£750m less on homelessness-related activity than they did in 2008-9, despite the rise in homelessness. Councils and service providers told the researchers of a worrying reduction in the services aimed at preventing homelessness - such as family mediation and tenancy support. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Howard Sinclair, chief executive of St Mungo's, said: ""The human cost of these cuts is all too real. ""The people we work with - many struggling with poor mental health, substance use or domestic violence - are often being left with no option but to sleep rough. ""With nearly 600 people dying on our streets or while homeless in a year, this really is a matter of life and death."" He urged the government to put the money back and to turn the tide of rising homelessness. Rick Henderson, chief executive of Homeless Link, a charity which represents those working in homelessness and housing sector, said: ""There are too many people sleeping rough and facing homelessness in this country - we can see it every day on our streets and it is unacceptable. ""Local authorities have a key role in supporting people who are homeless, or at risk of homelessness, but they can only do so if they have enough money to fund services properly."" Minister for Housing and Homelessness Heather Wheeler said: ""No-one should ever be without a home and the Government is committed to preventing and reducing all forms of homelessness, backed by Â£1.2bn of funding so far. ""We have also implemented the Homelessness Reduction Act, which helps more people get the support they need, and at an earlier stage. ""The Â£100m-backed Rough Sleeping Strategy was launched last year and sets out the government's blueprint for ending rough sleeping for good - including access to specialist support services and housing advice.""

US dilutes UN rape-in-conflict resolutionReferences to sexual and reproductive health were removed over US opposition to abortion.,"This video can not be played ""Justice is not inevitable"": Amal Clooney spoke at the UN Security Council meeting The Trump administration's opposition to abortion has led to the watering-down of a UN resolution on ending sexual violence in war. The US removed all references to sexual and reproductive health. The Security Council resolution, submitted by Germany, dropped all such references. The US, along with China and Russia, had threatened to veto it. The Trump administration opposed a phrase on the grounds that it implies support for abortion. The amended resolution passed 13-0, with Russia and China abstaining. French UN ambassador Francois Delattre was scathing of the decision to exclude the reference to sexual health, saying it undermined the dignity of women. ""It is intolerable and incomprehensible that the Security Council is incapable of acknowledging that women and girls who suffered from sexual violence in conflict, and who obviously didn't choose to become pregnant, should have the right to terminate their pregnancy,"" he said. The removed phrase read: ""Recognizing the importance of providing timely assistance to survivors of sexual violence, urges United Nations entities and donors to provide non-discriminatory and comprehensive health services, in line with Resolution 2106."" This line was thought to be a compromise from an earlier version, which included a more detailed description of the health services, ""including sexual and reproductive health, psychosocial, legal, and livelihood support"". This language had been used before in previous resolutions related to sexual violence, US media report. Sierra Leone declares rape emergency World powers condemn new Libya fighting Nobel Peace Prize for anti-rape activists The new resolution condemns the use of rape as a weapon of war and expresses the Security Council's concern at the slow progress in addressing sexual violence in conflict. Jonathan Cohen, acting US ambassador to the United Nations, at the Security Council meeting But while it urges improved justice for victims, the final version also removed a reference to a UN monitoring body that would report acts of sexual violence. The initial resolution had garnered widespread support. Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney attended Tuesday's Security Council meeting and urged members to vote in favour. ""This is your Nuremberg moment,"" Mrs Clooney said. ""Your chance to stand on the right side of history."" Ms Clooney was joined by two 2018 Nobel Peace Prize winners, both anti-rape activists: Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad, an Iraqi Yazidi who was tortured and raped by Islamic State militants. German foreign minister Heiko Maas also joined actress and activist Angelina Jolie in writing an article in the Washington Post on 22 April advocating the resolution. Nobel Peace Prize winners Nadia Murad and Denis Mukwege both supported the UN resolution International figures have denounced the US for weakening the resolution. UK Labour MP Emily Thornberry cited the resolution as cause for concern in light of President Donald Trump's recently announced visit to the UK. ""It beggars belief that on the very same day Donald Trump is threatening to veto a United Nations resolution against the use of rape as a weapon of war, Theresa May is pressing ahead with her plans to honour him with a state visit to the UK,"" Ms Thornberry, the opposition's spokesperson on foreign affairs said. The US was represented by acting ambassador to the UN, Jonathan Cohen. The ambassador post has remained vacant since the resignation of Nikki Haley last year.

The world's most controversial company," The African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa is a shiny spaceship-like structure that glistens in the afternoon sun. With its accompanying skyscraper, it stands out in the Ethiopian capital. Greetings in Mandarin welcome visitors as they enter the lifts, and the plastic palm trees bear the logos of the China Development Bank. African Union HQ, Addis Ababa Everywhere, there are small indications that the building was made possible through Chinese financial aid. In 2006, Beijing pledged $200m to build the headquarters. Completed in 2012, everything was custom-built by the Chinese - including a state-of-the-art computer system. For several years, the building stood as a proud testament to ever-closer ties between China and Africa. Trade has rocketed over the past two decades, growing by about 20% a year, according to international consultancy McKinsey. China is Africa’s largest economic partner. But in January 2018, French newspaper Le Monde Afrique dropped a bombshell. It reported that the AU’s computer system had been compromised. The newspaper, citing multiple sources, said that for five years, between the hours of midnight and 0200, data from the AU’s servers was transferred more than 8,000km away - to servers in Shanghai. This had allegedly continued for 1,825 days in a row. Le Monde Afrique reported that it had come to light in 2017, when a conscientious scientist working for the AU recorded an unusually high amount of computer activity on its servers during hours when the offices would have been deserted. It was also reported that microphones and listening devices had been discovered in the walls and desks of the building, following a sweep for bugs. The reaction was swift. Both AU and Chinese officials publicly condemned the report as false and sensationalist - an attempt by the Western media to damage relations between a more assertive China and an increasingly independent Africa. But Le Monde Afrique said that AU officials had privately expressed concerns about just how dependent they were on Chinese aid - and what the consequences of that could be. In the midst of all of this, one fact remained largely unreported. The main supplier of information and communication technology systems to the AU headquarters was China’s best-known telecoms equipment company - Huawei. “This doesn’t mean the company was complicit in any theft of data,” said Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in a review of the alleged incident. “But… it’s hard to see how - given Huawei’s role in providing equipment and key ICT services to the AU building and specifically to the AU’s data centre - the company could have remained completely unaware of the apparent theft of large amounts of data, every day, for five years.” Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, China A Huawei spokesman told the BBC: “If there was  a data leak from computers at the AU's headquarters in Addis that went on for an extended period of time, these data leaks did not originate in technology supplied by Huawei to the AU. What Huawei supplied for the AU project  included data centre facilities, but those facilities did not have any storage or data transfer functions.” There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei’s telecoms network equipment was ever used by the Chinese government - or anyone else - to gain access to the data of their customers. Huawei was one of a number of suppliers to the project. Indeed, no-one has ever gone on record to confirm that the AU system was compromised in the first place. But these reports played into years of suspicions about Huawei - that a large Chinese company might find itself unduly influenced by the Chinese government. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones. The only phones we had were those hand-cranked phones that you see in old World War II films. We were pretty undeveloped then.” Huawei’s founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei is reminiscing to the BBC about the origins of the world’s second-biggest smartphone firm, while sitting in the Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen - a symbol of the success that he’s worked his whole lifetime for. A long marbled staircase, covered in plush red carpet, greets you as you first walk in. At the top of the stairs, a giant painting depicts a traditional Chinese New Year scene. Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ A few kilometres away in Dongguan, Huawei’s latest campus is even more eye-catching. The site - designed to accommodate the company’s 25,000 R&D staff - comprises 12 “villages”, each of which recreates the architecture of a different European city, among them Paris, Bologna and Granada. It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones.

Not only people like myself, but even the most senior government officials, did not have the vaguest idea of what a market economy was. It seemed it was hard to survive.” Ren was born in 1944 in Southern China - a tumultuous, chaotic place, one of the poorest regions in an already destitute country. For a long time, hardship was all he ever knew. He was from a family of seven children. “They were very poor,” says David De Cremer, who has co-written a book on Ren and Huawei. “I think hardship is something that you can see throughout his life, and which he keeps emphasising himself.” To escape that life of poverty and drudgery, Ren did what many young Chinese men of that era did. He joined the army. Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, 1972 “I was a very low-ranking officer in the People’s Liberation Army,” he says. “I served in an ordinary construction project, not a field unit. At the time, I was a technician of a company in the military, and then I became an engineer.” He left the military in 1983 when China began to downsize its forces, and went into the electronics business. By his own admission, he wasn’t a great businessman at first. “I was someone who had been in the military all my life at the time, used to doing what I was told,” he says. “Suddenly, I began to work in a market economy. I was at a total loss. So I too suffered losses, I too was deceived, and I was cheated.” But he was quick to learn, and was a keen student of Western business practices and European history. “I did research on what exactly a market economy was all about,” he says. “I read books on laws, including those about European and US laws. At that time, there were very few books on Chinese laws, and I had to read those on European and US laws.” Five years later, he founded Huawei  - the name can be translated as “splendid achievement” or “China is able” - to sell simple telecoms equipment to the rural Chinese market. Within a few years, Huawei was developing and producing the equipment itself. Sometime in the early 90s, Huawei won a government contract to provide telecoms equipment for the People’s Liberation Army. By 1995, the company was generating sales of around US$220m, mainly from selling to the rural market. The following year Huawei was given the status of a Chinese “national champion”. In practice, this meant the government closed the market to foreign competition. At a time when China’s economy was growing by an average of 10% per year, this was no small advantage. But it was only when Huawei started to expand overseas in 2000, that it really saw its sales soar. In 2002, Huawei made US$552m from its international market sales. By 2005 its international market contracts exceeded its domestic business for the first time. Ren’s early days in business instilled in him a desire to protect his company from the whims and fancies of the stock market. Huawei is privately held and employee-owned. This gave Ren the power to plough more money back into research and development. Each year, Huawei spends US$20bn on R&D – one of the biggest such budgets in the world. “Publicly listed companies have to pay a lot of attention to their balance sheets,” he says. “They can't invest too much, otherwise profits will drop and so will their share prices. At Huawei, we fight for our ideals. We know that if we fertilise our ‘soil’ it will become more bountiful. That's how we've managed to pull ahead and succeed.” One story from the early days of the company tells how Ren was cooking for his staff (he loves to cook, or so the story goes). Suddenly he rushed out of the kitchen and announced to the room: “Huawei will be a top three player in the global communications market 20 years from now!” And that’s exactly what happened. In fact, those ambitions were surpassed. Today, Huawei is the world’s biggest seller of network telecommunications equipment. From aspiring to be a company like Apple, it now sells more smartphones than Apple. But shadows have continued to loom over Huawei’s international success. Ren and Huawei’s links to the Chinese Communist Party have raised suspicions that the company owes its meteoric rise to its powerful political connections in China. The US has accused Huawei of being a tool of the Chinese government. It’s an accusation which Ren denies. “Please don't think that Huawei has become what it is today because we have special connections,” he says. “Even 100% state-owned companies have failed. Do good connections mean you will succeed then? Huawei’s success is still very much due to our hard work.” It was 1 December 2018. US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping were dining on grilled sirloin followed by caramel rolled pancakes at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. They had a lot to discuss. The US and China were in the middle of a trade war - imposing tariffs on each other’s goods - and growth forecasts for both countries had recently been cut as a result. This was adding to the fear of a slowing global economy. In the event, the two leaders agreed a truce in the trade war, with Donald Trumptweetingthat “Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward!” Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at dinner, December 2018 But thousands of kilometres north in Canada, an arrest was taking place that would throw doubt on this rapprochement. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and Ren Zhengfei’s eldest daughter, had been detained by Canadian officials while transferring between flights at Vancouver airport. The arrest had come at the request of the US, who accused her of breaking sanctions against Iran. “When she was detained, as her father, my heart broke,” says Ren, visibly emotional. “How could I watch my child suffer like this? But what happened, has happened. We can only depend on the law to solve this problem.” Meng Wanzhou being driven to court in Canada Huawei’s problems were just beginning. Nearly two months later, the US Department of Justice filed two indictments against Huawei and Ms Meng. Under the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng were charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran. The second indictment - against Huawei - involved criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets. Both Huawei and Ms Meng deny the charges. January 2019: Acting US attorney general Matthew Whittaker announces charges against Huawei and Meng Wanzhou The charge of stealing trade secrets centres on a robotic tool - developed by T-Mobile - known as Tappy. According to legal documents, Huawei had tried to buy Tappy, a device which mimicked human fingers by tapping mobile phone screens rapidly to test responsiveness. T-Mobile was in partnership with Huawei at the time, but it rebuffed the Chinese firm’s offers, fearing it would use the technology to make phones for T-Mobile’s competitors. It’s alleged that one of Huawei’s US employees then smuggled Tappy’s robotic arm into his satchel so that he could send its details to colleagues in China. After the alleged theft was discovered, the Huawei employee claimed that the arm had  mistakenly fallen into his bag. Huawei claimed that the employee had been acting alone, and the case was settled out of court in 2014. But the latest case is built on email trails between managers in China and the company’s US employees, linking Huawei management to the alleged theft. The indictment also details evidence of a bonus scheme from 2013, offering Huawei employees financial rewards for stealing confidential information from competitors. Huawei has denied any such scheme exists. Meng Wanzhou, photographed in 2014 This is not the first time that Huawei has been accused of stealing trade secrets. Over the years companies like Cisco, Nortel and Motorola have all pointed the finger at the Chinese firm. But US fears about Huawei are about much more than industrial espionage. For more than a decade, the US government has seen the company as little more than an arm of the Chinese Communist Party. These concerns have been brought to the fore with the advent of “fifth generation” or5G mobile internet, which promises download speeds 10 or 20 times faster than at present, and much greater connectivity between devices. As the world’s biggest telecoms infrastructure provider, Huawei is one of the companies best placed to build new 5G networks. But the US has warned its intelligence partners that awarding contracts to Huawei would be tantamount to allowing the Chinese spy on them. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently cautioned against Huawei, saying, “If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo The UK, Germany and Canada are reviewing whether Huawei's products pose a security threat. Australia went a step further last year, andbanned equipment suppliers“likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government”. Huawei was not mentioned by name, but Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says the company posed a national security risk because of its government links. She cites an article in Chinese law that makes it impossible for any company to refuse to help the Chinese Communist Party in intelligence gathering. “Admittedly, what is missing from this debate is the smoking gun,” she says. “For the average person who has a Huawei smartphone it’s not a big deal. But if you’re a Western government that has key national security to protect - why would you allow this access to a company that is in the political system that China is in?” For his part, Ren says that Huawei’s resources have never and would never be used to spy for the Chinese government. “The Chinese government has clearly said that it won’t ask companies to install backdoors,” he says. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe a secret entry point in software or a computer system that gives access to the person or entity who installed it to the inner workings of the system. “Huawei will not do it either,” he continues. “Our sales revenues are now hundreds of billions of dollars. We are not going to risk the disgust of our country and our customers all over the world because of something like that. We will lose all our business. I’m not going to take that risk.” Zhou Daiqi is Huawei’s chief ethics and compliance officer. He’s been with the company for nearly 25 years, in a number of different positions - chief engineer, director of the hardware department, head of the research centre in Xi’an, according to his biography on the company’s website. He is also understood to combine his high-ranking executive duties with another role - party secretary of Huawei’s Communist Party committee. All companies in China are required by law to have a Communist Party committee. Zhou Daiqi's profile on Huawei's website The official line is that they exist to ensure that employees uphold the country’s moral and social values. Representatives of the committee are also often tasked with helping workers with financial problems. But critics of China’s one-party system argue that they allow the state to exert control on corporate China. And they say the level of this control has increased in recent years. “[President] Xi Jinping is exerting greater control over the business community in China,” says Elliott Zaagman, who regularly advises Chinese companies on their PR strategy. “As these companies gain power and influence overseas, the party doesn’t want to lose control over them.” Ren, however, argues that the role of Huawei’s Communist Party committee is far less important than many in the West believe. “[It] serves only to educate its employees,” he says. “It is not involved in any business decisions.” In China, most chief executives are Communist Party members. Every year, they dutifully turn up to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) which happens in parallel to the National People's Congress (NPC). The NPC is attended by local and national party chiefs, officials and chief executives. But the CPCC is where the business community shows its commitment to the party. Being a member of the party is very much a networking opportunity - in the way one would join a business association. Elliott Zaagman argues that this is a system that demands loyalty. “There is no separation from the party and the state,” he says. “The system in China encourages the lack of transparency in companies like Huawei.” The worry is that these close links mean that if the Communist Party asked a company to do something, they would have no choice but to comply. And if that company is one that is involved in sensitive global telecoms infrastructure projects, it’s easy to see why Western observers would be worried. There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei is in any way under the orders of the Chinese government, or that Beijing has any plans to dictate business plans and strategy at Huawei - particularly when it comes to spying. But the way in which the Chinese Communist Party has robustly defended Huawei has raised questions about how independent the company is of its influence. For example, Beijing stated that Ms Meng’s detention wasa rights abuse. And while her extradition case to the US was moving forward, China detained two Canadian citizens andaccused them of stealing state secrets. Critics say the detentions are linked to Ms Meng’s arrest. December 2018: Chinese police patrol outside Canada's embassy in Beijing While not commenting on the arrest of the Canadians, Ren says China’s defence of Huawei is understandable. “It is the Chinese government’s duty to protect its people,” he says. “If the US attempts to gain competitive edge by undermining China’s most outstanding hi-tech talent, then it is understandable if the Chinese government, in turn, protects its hi-tech companies.” Over the past few years, there have been signs ofa bigger push by the governmentto get private companies, and in particular tech firms, to cooperate with party rules - even when they are firmly resistant. A Didi Chuxing logo adorns a building in Hangzhou, China China’s ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing’s troubles are an example of the struggles Chinese firms face when they try to uphold their independence in the face of government pressure. Chinese attitudes to data collection and data privacy are different to those in the West - many people don’t care if businesses have access to their data, arguing that it adds to the convenience of life and work. Government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside of China assume it to be So it wasn’t unusual when, after the murders of two of its passengers by Didi drivers, regulators used the scandal to force Didi toshare more corporate data with the government.But Didi resisted - citing customer privacy. Under Chinese law, it had no choice but to comply. When it did, it handed over “three boxes of data printed on paper, including 95 hard copies for authorities to review”. According to Samm Sacks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the case demonstrates that “government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside China assume it to be”. She says this indicates that there appears to be “a kind of tug of war between the government and companies over data”. How this plays out will determine how Chinese companies are viewed by foreign governments when they do business overseas. Companies like Huawei have grown up in a system where to survive and thrive they needed strong links to the Chinese government - there was and is no other choice. But these links could harm their reputation abroad. “It’s two different systems,” says Zaagman. “Think of it like an electrical outlet. China’s plug doesn’t fit in to the outlets we have in the West.” Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ “Basically you want to connect to everything that can be connected.” Zhu Peiying, head of Huawei’s 5G wireless labs, is showing off devices that can connect to the new technology. From a smart toothbrush that collects data about how well you brush your teeth, to a smart cup that reminds you when you should drink some water, this is a world where everything you can think of is being measured and analysed. At its most sophisticated, everything in entire cities would be connected - driverless cars, the temperature of buildings, the speed of public transport - the list is endless. Huawei is thought to be a year ahead of its competitors in terms of its technological expertise and what it can offer customers, according to industry sources. It’s also thought that the company can offer prices that are about 10% cheaper than its competitors, although critics claim this is because of state support. Ren dismisses this, saying that Huawei doesn’t receive government subsidies. He says the real reason behind the US resistance to Huawei is its superior technology. “There’s no way the US can crush us,” he says. “The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily we could just scale things down a bit.” Many analysts say that Huawei’s exclusion from US networks could actually cause the US to fall behind in its 5G capabilities. “It would mean we wouldn’t be able to participate in any blended network [using Huawei] in Europe or Asia,” says Samm Sacks of CSIS. “That would put us at a significant disadvantage.” What this would mean in reality is a world of two internets - or what analysts are calling a ""digital iron curtain"" - dividing the world into parts that do business with Chinese companies like Huawei, and those that don't. Because of US pressure on its allies, Huawei has been on an aggressive public relations campaign to win over customers and government stakeholders. In recent days, Vodafone’s boss Nick Read called on the US to share any evidence it has about Huawei, while Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s vice president for the digital single market, said in a tweet that he had met with Huawei’s rotating CEO to discuss the importance of being open and transparent, as they explored ways of working together. But suspicions about Huawei remain. One security firm reports a sharp rise in inquiries by Asian government clients about Huawei. ""Some have asked us how much they should worry about whether Huawei is really a liability,"" says an analyst who consults to Asian governments, on condition of anonymity. Ren is sanguine about such concerns. “For countries who believe in them [suspicions about Huawei] we will hold off,” he says.  “For countries who feel Huawei is trustworthy, we may move a little faster. The world is so big. We can't walk across every corner of it.” But this is about more than just one company or one CEO and his family. Increasingly, this is perceived as a battle between two world orders, and which one is the future. In the early days of China opening up, US presidents like George HW Bush espoused the merits of engagement. “No nation on Earth has discovered a way to import the world's goods and services while stopping foreign ideas at the border,”he said in a 1991 speech. “Just as the democratic idea has transformed nations on every continent, so, too, change will inevitably come to China.” 1989: George HW Bush in Beijing - he encouraged economic engagement with China Previous US administrations believed that economic engagement in China would lead to China following a freer, more “liberal” path. There’s no denying China has made remarkable strides in the past 40 years. The economy grew by an annual average of 10% for three decades, helping to lift 800 million people out of poverty. It is now the second-largest economy in the world, only surpassed by the US. Some estimates put China’s economy ahead of America’s by 2030. It achieved this while maintaining one-party rule and the supremacy of the Communist Party. But its success has raised concerns that it is only possible with a huge amount of government control over the country’s companies. The fear is that control could be used to achieve the Communist Party’s goals - which are at this point unclear. “It’s a double-edged sword for China,” says Danielle Cave. “[Because of its laws] the Chinese Communist Party has made it virtually impossible for Chinese companies to expand without attracting understandable and legitimate suspicion.” Added to this, China has become more authoritarian under Xi Jinping’s rule. President Xi Jinping “Xi is systematically undermining virtually every feature that made China so distinct and helped it work so well in the past,”writes Jonathan Tepperman, editor in chief of Foreign Policy. “His efforts may boost his own power and prestige in the short term and reduce some forms of corruption. On balance, however, Xi’s campaign will have disastrous long-term consequences for his country and the world.” But Ren dismisses this, insisting that China is more open than ever before. “If this meeting took place 30 years ago,” he says of our interview, “it would have been very dangerous for me. Today, I can be straightforward when answering difficult questions. This shows that China has a more open political environment.” Still, Ren is hopeful of the direction China will take in the future. “China has more or less tried to close itself off from the outside world for 5,000 years,” he says. “Yet we had found ourselves poor, lagging behind other nations. It was only in the past 30 years since Deng Xiaoping opened China's doors to the world that China has become more prosperous. Therefore, China must continue to move forward on the path of reform and opening-up.” In one of Huawei’s vast campus sites across Shenzen, lies a man-made lake. Swimming in these serene waters are two black swans. There is a story that Ren put the birds here to remind employees of “black swan” events - unpredictable and catastrophic financial eventualities that are impossible to prepare for. He dismisses this as an urban myth, but it’s hard not to read something into it. For Huawei, and Ren, these are highly uncertain times with no way of telling what lies ahead. Built with Shorthand"
Labour pledges to end 'slum' office housing,"This video can not be played The families living in converted office blocks in Harlow Labour says it would scrap a government scheme that allows offices and industrial buildings to be converted into homes without planning permission. The party said changes to permitted development rules in England had led to the creation of ""slum housing and rabbit hutch flats"". It also said developers had been able to avoid building affordable homes. The Conservatives said the plans would ""cut house building and put a stop to people achieving home ownership"". In 2013, the government changed planning rules to allow developers to turn offices, warehouses and industrial buildings into residential blocks without getting permission from the local council, in a bid to boost house building. Barnet House in North London is being converted to 254 flats The rules have since been further relaxed, leading to 42,000 new dwellings being created from former offices in the last few years. However, permitted development schemes are exempt from official space standards and also from any requirement to provide affordable homes. 'I don't want my kids thinking this is normal' 'Micro-homes could solve' housing crisis Labour said the policy had seen the loss of more than 10,000 affordable homes, and meant that flats ""just a few feet wide"" were now counted in official statistics as new homes. It said its policy was still to build 250,000 new homes a year in England with 100,000 being ""genuinely affordable"". ""This Conservative housing free-for-all gives developers a free hand to build what they want but ignore what local communities need,"" said John Healey, Labour's shadow housing secretary. ""Labour will give local people control over the housing that gets built in their area and ensure developers build the low-cost, high-quality homes that the country needs."" Police figures show crime recorded at Terminus House, and the car park which sits beneath the housing, rose 45% in the first 10 months of it opening In one permitted development scheme at Newbury House in Ilford, an office block has been turned into 60 flats measuring as little as 13 sq metres each. According to national space standards, the minimum floor area for a new one-bedroom one-person home is 37 sq metres. Critics say the schemes can be damaging to residents' mental wellbeing, as well as being miles from amenities and conducive to crime. At Terminus House - a converted office block in Harlow -crime jumped 45% in the first 10 monthsafter people moved in and by 20% within that part of the town centre. But some developers warn that without permitted development many office to residential schemes would no longer be viable. The government says the rules are helping tackle the housing crisis and allowing people to get on the housing ladder. Of the 13,526 homes delivered under permitted development last year, more than three quarters were built outside of London Marcus Jones, Conservative vice-chair for Local Government, said: ""Labour's plans would cut house building and put a stop to people achieving homeownership. ""We are backing permitted development rights, which are converting dormant offices into places families can call home. ""Whilst Labour put politics before our families, the Conservatives are delivering the houses this country needs so every family has a place to call home.""

Joint executive secretary of the 1922 Nigel Evans was among them, insisting on Tuesday that the calls for her to quit had become ""a clamour"". Following a meeting of all Tory MPs, Sir Graham said colleagues concerned about Mrs May's leadership were free to express their concerns to him, which would be ""communicated"" to Downing Street. In light of the PM's commitment to stand down if Parliament approved a Brexit deal, he said MPs were seeking ""similar clarity from her"" about what would happen ""in other circumstances"". ""I think the 1922 executive is asking on behalf of the Conservative Party in Parliament that we should have a clear road map forward,"" he told the BBC.

Sir Graham said MPs were not giving the prime minister an ultimatum Former minister Robert Halfon said it would have been ""entirely wrong"" to have staged another vote right now given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. ""The rules are the rules,"" he told BBC News. ""We are the Conservative Party, not a Stalinist Party, where you suddenly rip up the rule book and change them if you don't like them."" ""It would have been behaving like a dictatorship, not the Conservative Party."" Speaking before Wednesday's meeting, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had given a commitment to stand down ""earlier than she would have liked"" and would not lead negotiations on the UK's future relations with the EU. But he said this did ""not necessarily mean"" she would quit straight away if Brexit happened on 31 October, the new deadline set by the EU for the UK's exit. The party's most senior backbenchers met twice behind closed doors but were split on whether to change its leadership rules. Sources suggest there was a slim majority in favour of the status quo. But while Conservative MPs decided not to change the rules, grandee Sir Graham Brady said they wanted more clarity from the PM on when she would stand down. Some MPs are keen that the PM signals a willingness to go soon after next month's unwanted European elections. So this could be a coup postponed - not a coup averted. Mrs May survived a vote of no confidence in her on 12 December 2018 by 200 to 117 votes. The ballot was triggered after 48 Tory MPs wrote to the 1922 committee's chair Sir Graham Brady to say they had lost faith in her, exceeding the threshold required. Some of those who wanted to change the Conservative rules argued another vote of confidence should be permitted after six months, rather than a year, if a relatively high number of MPs - 30% or 40% - call for it. But other members of 1922 Committee, who started discussing the issue on Tuesday, were sceptical of long-term rule changes to address a very specific circumstance. They were also worried about showing further party divisions ahead of local elections next week and the potential European elections on 23 May.

Some MPs are keen that the PM signals a willingness to go soon after next month's unwanted European elections. So this could be a coup postponed - not a coup averted. Mrs May survived a vote of no confidence in her on 12 December 2018 by 200 to 117 votes. The ballot was triggered after 48 Tory MPs wrote to the 1922 committee's chair Sir Graham Brady to say they had lost faith in her, exceeding the threshold required. Some of those who wanted to change the Conservative rules argued another vote of confidence should be permitted after six months, rather than a year, if a relatively high number of MPs - 30% or 40% - call for it. But other members of 1922 Committee, who started discussing the issue on Tuesday, were sceptical of long-term rule changes to address a very specific circumstance. They were also worried about showing further party divisions ahead of local elections next week and the potential European elections on 23 May.

Sinead Quinn said friends of Ms McKee would be wearing T-shirts like this one to the funeral They said they were thankful for the huge outpouring of sympathy in recent days, and that she should be remembered as ""someone who spoke to and made friends with anybody and everybody, no matter what their background"". That will be one of the themes of the funeral service, with Protestant and Catholic clergy taking part and politicians from across the political divide in attendance. The journalist and campaigner for LGBT rights is survived by her partner, mother, two brothers and three sisters. Her funeral is to be held at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast, and the service will be led jointly by the Anglican dean of Belfast, the Very Reverend Stephen Forde, and Fr Martin Magill at 13.00 BST. By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI In life and in death, Lyra McKee is bringing people together in Belfast. The funeral of this 29-year-old woman, from a Catholic background, is taking place in a Protestant cathedral. Her family chose the cathedral due to its reputation as a ""shared space"" in a divided city. It may be Church of Ireland in its status and governance, but it has strong ecumenical links and even has a chapel of unity. The death of Ms McKee was a horrific reminder of the old Northern Ireland. Many are hoping that her funeral will be a symbol of something new. Ms McKee's partner, Sara Canning, said the service would be a ""celebration of her life"". ""If people would like to wear Hufflepuff, Harry Potter or Marvel related T-shirts I know she would love it,"" Ms Canning said. Secretary of State Karen Bradley will be among the dignitaries attending the funeral, while the Irish government's representatives include the foreign minister, Simon Coveney. Dissident republican group the New IRAadmitted responsibility for the journalist's murder, according to the Irish News. Three people have been arrested over the shooting, but all have been released without charge. Fr Joe Gormley, who anointed Ms McKee after she was shot dead, told BBC News NI there was still a ""great deal of shock"" in Derry. Sara Canning (centre) was ""planning to grow old"" with her partner Lyra McKee ""But people are also reflecting and they know that we are faced with a choice in life,"" he said. ""We either go back to the dark days or move forward."" He said he was willing to ""sit down and talk"" to those responsible. Lyra McKee, who was also a campaigner for LGBT rights, gave a TED talk in 2017 Fellow members of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) are to form a guard of honour at the cathedral. The union described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. CiarÃ¡n Ã MaolÃ¡in, the union's Belfast secretary, described her as ""intelligent, determined and very witty"". There will be a gathering at Guildhall Square in Derry at 13:00 BST for those who cannot attend her funeral.

Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes?,"In the shiny, optimistic vision of the future we will all be living in ""smart cities"" in which self-driving cars will check the best routes after being charged up on intelligent, connected power grids. Public services and safety will be carefully managed though data, while devices in our homes will talk to each other and the wider world as part of the ""internet-of-things"". Many of these services will be delivered over what is called 5G. It will be much more than just faster data on our phones, but potentially transformational for our lives - if you believe the hype. But there is a darker fear as well. What if it is also transformational for our security if we end up reliant on a Chinese company to deliver this future? That question risks causing a major divide in the Five Eyes - the intelligence alliance between the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The US is campaigning hard among allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from delivering 5G. ""We have serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere,"" Bill Evanina, head of America's National Counterintelligence and Security Center has said. ""Chinese company relationships with the Chinese government aren't like private sector company relationships with governments in the West."" Huawei has always denied being controlled by the Chinese government, or that its work poses any risks of espionage and sabotage. Its founder repeated these assertions in a recent interview with the BBC. This video can not be played Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou as politically motivated But Australia and New Zealand have sounded negative about Huawei's involvement in their 5G networks to varying degrees, and Canada is still deciding. All eyes are now on the UK. In a speech in Brussels on Wednesday, Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, set out the framework for considering the security of 5G based on its experience so far of working with the company. The current oversight regime was ""arguably the toughest and most rigorous"" in the world for Huawei, he said. His officials say they have found ''poor security and engineering"" by the company, but the indications are still that the UK may work with Huawei on 5G. The US cannot crush us, says Huawei founder UK is ""vulnerable to Chinese interference"" Huawei risk ""can be managed"" If that is the decision then other countries - not only in the Five Eyes but also the EU and Nato - may well be tempted to follow, using the UK as a reference point because of its track record of scrutiny. There could be consequences, former officials warn. Ciaran Martin said the UK would ""not compromise on the improvements we need to see from Huawei"" ""Worries about the security of UK networks following their exposure to Huawei may make the Five Eyes partners, and perhaps others such as France, Germany or Japan, less inclined to co-operate with the UK in the future,"" Charles Parton, a former British diplomat, argues in a new paper for the think tank Rusi. ""The maintenance of a 'Five Eyes standard' of cyber-security in telecommunications is a vital strategic and security interest, the loss of which would go far beyond a reduction in intelligence reports exchanged, and might lead to the UK being excluded from work on developing future technologies for intelligence collection."" The UK's special relationship with Huawei came about in the early 2000s, when BT was upgrading its networks and the Chinese firm came in much cheaper than the alternatives - by hundreds of millions of pounds. BT told the government it planned to use the company unless the government was willing to compensate it. Even though Huawei was kept out of the core of the network and sensitive systems, concerns over security and the growing use of Huawei by other companies led - a few years later - to the creation of a ""cell"" toevaluate the security of Huawei products coming into the UK. The cell's last oversight report downgraded the assurance about mitigating the risks associated with Huawei, because of serious problems with security and engineering processes. However, Mr Martin said in his speech, the report said that these were not indicators of hostile activity by China, . The company says it will invest money to deal with these concerns in the coming years, although UK officials say that so far they have not seen ""a credible plan"". Huawei's 5G antennas and masts are already being tested in the UK Despite that, the indications are that the UK wants to hold out against US pressure and continue to work with the company on 5G. A decision is expected in the next two months by ministers who will need to balance security with costs and the risks to wider relationships. ""Resilience is key,"" Mr Martin said in Brussels. ""There must be sustainable diversity in the supplier market."" That was one signal that even though the UK may work with Huawei, it is cautious about ending up with one dominant player on whom it is dependent. But critics fear that Huawei - possibly with Chinese state backing - is working its way into a dominant position in the long term, particularly by penetrating markets in the developing world and by setting standards for 5G. One of the biggest challenges with 5G is cost. In many countries, telecoms companies paid much more for the 5G spectrum than they had expected. They are now looking at the sums and indicating their strong preference for the cheapest vendor - Huawei. Telecoms operators in the UK say the way in which 5G can work in a highly integrated system alongside 4G means that excluding Huawei is not realistic without significant cost and delay, including potentially removing existing hardware, leading to the UK falling behind. Breaking the ties with the company could also have significant consequences for the UK-China relationship which poses challenges with Brexit approaching. But the question will be how the US and the Trump administration reacts if the UK does not follow its line - especially if other countries use the UK as cover to follow and work with Huawei. This at a time when the UK may be looking for a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. It potentially leaves the UK between a rock and a hard place and is one more reason why the Huawei decision is placing strain on the historically close Five Eyes intelligence relationship.

Sri Lanka vows to overhaul state security,"This video can not be played Ramesh was killed in the blast in Batticaloa Sri Lanka's president has vowed to overhaul state security after several bomb blasts on Sunday killed 359 people and wounded about 500. On Tuesday, Maithripala Sirisena said warnings had not been shared with him and promised ""stern action"". The country's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the Islamic State (IS) group may be linked to the blasts. Funerals are continuing across the country as people try to process last Sunday's attacks. IS has claimed the attack, although it did not provide direct evidence of its involvement. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who were the victims? Police say they have identified eight out of nine attackers, with no foreigners among them. ""Most of them are well educated and come from maybe middle or upper middle class,"" Deputy Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said on Wednesday. ""They are financially quite independent and their families are quite stable financially. ""We believe that one of the suicide bombers studied in the UK and then later on did his post-graduate in Australia before coming back to settle in Sri Lanka."" This video can not be played Volunteers provide water, food and support to those mourning the bombing in Negombo, Sri Lanka In a televised address late on Tuesday, President Sirisena said he would completely restructure the police and security forces in coming weeks. ""The security officials who got the intelligence report from a foreign nation did not share it with me. I have decided to take stern action against these officials."" The BBC World Service's South Asia editor Ethirajan Anbarasan said it was an embarrassing admission by President Sirisena that security officials did not share with him the intelligence report warning about the attacks. With IS claiming responsibility for the attacks, Sri Lanka is now entering uncharted territory, our correspondent explains. Authorities say they are looking into possible links between the locals who carried out the suicide bombings and the global jihadist group. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News South Asia correspondent, reports from Batticaloa In the town of Batticaloa, the grief is all around you. Posters of those who died in Sunday's blast hang from every corner. Photos show the young children smiling in party dresses and smart shirts, and written next to their images are their birthdays, as well as the day they died. They'd been attending Sunday school at the Zion Church, as they did every week. After the service some of them went outside for snacks, a short while later a bomb exploded. A decade after the civil war ended this community is once again burying its dead. Wreaths of bright pink flowers were left at the freshly dug graves of some of the children. They'd barely been dug - just like the lives lost had barely been lived. This scenic stretch of the country's east coast has become accustomed to loss. Countless died in the country's civil war. The 2004 tsunami claimed thousands more. Now it's trying to process this latest wave of terror. Follow@BBCRajiniv,externalfor updates from Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ). But Mr Wickremesinghe said the attacks ""could not have been done just locally"". ""There had been training given and a coordination which we are not seeing earlier,"" he said. Police have now detained around 60 suspects in connection with the attack. A state of emergency remains in effect to prevent further attacks. This video can not be played The footage shows a man wearing a large backpack calmly walking towards St Sebastian's church The nearly simultaneous attacks targeted three churches packed for Easter services and three major hotels in the capital, Colombo. An attack on a fourth hotel on Sunday was foiled, Mr Wickremesinghe said. He also warned that further militants and explosives could still be ""out there"" following the attack. The country remains tense with police still looking for suspects and possible further explosives. IS said it had ""targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka"" via its Amaq news outlet. It provided no evidence for the claim but shared an image on social media of eight men purported to be behind the attack. The group's last territory fell in March but even then experts had warned it does not mean the end of IS or its ideology. There were emotional scenes outside St Anthony's Shrine in Colombo Earlier, the country's defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene told parliament that NTJ was linked to another radical Islamist group he named as JMI. He gave no further details. The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? He also said ""preliminary investigations"" indicated thatthe bombings were in retaliation for deadly attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings. The Sri Lankan government is facing scrutiny after it emerged the authorities were warned of about a possible attack. Security services had been monitoring the NTJ but the prime minister and the cabinet were not warned, ministers said. The first mass funeral was held on Tuesday, as Sri Lanka marked an official day of mourning for the victims. Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services. 'I was praying - let that not be Monique' 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' UK dad's tribute to family Sri Lankan officials said 38 foreign nationals were among the dead, with another 14 unaccounted for. The death toll includes at least eight British citizens and at least 11 Indian nationals. The mass funeral for about 30 victims took place at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, north of Colombo, which was one of the places targeted in Sunday's blasts. Another funeral service was scheduled for later on Tuesday. A moment of silence was also observed at 08:30 on Tuesday, reflecting the time the first of six bombs detonated. Flags were lowered to half-mast and people, many of them in tears, bowed their heads in respect.

"Labour pledges to end 'slum' office housingIt says current planning rules allow developers in England to convert offices into ""rabbit hutch"" homes.Business","This video can not be played The families living in converted office blocks in Harlow Labour says it would scrap a government scheme that allows offices and industrial buildings to be converted into homes without planning permission. The party said changes to permitted development rules in England had led to the creation of ""slum housing and rabbit hutch flats"". It also said developers had been able to avoid building affordable homes. The Conservatives said the plans would ""cut house building and put a stop to people achieving home ownership"". In 2013, the government changed planning rules to allow developers to turn offices, warehouses and industrial buildings into residential blocks without getting permission from the local council, in a bid to boost house building. Barnet House in North London is being converted to 254 flats The rules have since been further relaxed, leading to 42,000 new dwellings being created from former offices in the last few years. However, permitted development schemes are exempt from official space standards and also from any requirement to provide affordable homes. 'I don't want my kids thinking this is normal' 'Micro-homes could solve' housing crisis Labour said the policy had seen the loss of more than 10,000 affordable homes, and meant that flats ""just a few feet wide"" were now counted in official statistics as new homes. It said its policy was still to build 250,000 new homes a year in England with 100,000 being ""genuinely affordable"". ""This Conservative housing free-for-all gives developers a free hand to build what they want but ignore what local communities need,"" said John Healey, Labour's shadow housing secretary. ""Labour will give local people control over the housing that gets built in their area and ensure developers build the low-cost, high-quality homes that the country needs."" Police figures show crime recorded at Terminus House, and the car park which sits beneath the housing, rose 45% in the first 10 months of it opening In one permitted development scheme at Newbury House in Ilford, an office block has been turned into 60 flats measuring as little as 13 sq metres each. According to national space standards, the minimum floor area for a new one-bedroom one-person home is 37 sq metres. Critics say the schemes can be damaging to residents' mental wellbeing, as well as being miles from amenities and conducive to crime. At Terminus House - a converted office block in Harlow -crime jumped 45% in the first 10 monthsafter people moved in and by 20% within that part of the town centre. But some developers warn that without permitted development many office to residential schemes would no longer be viable. The government says the rules are helping tackle the housing crisis and allowing people to get on the housing ladder. Of the 13,526 homes delivered under permitted development last year, more than three quarters were built outside of London Marcus Jones, Conservative vice-chair for Local Government, said: ""Labour's plans would cut house building and put a stop to people achieving homeownership. ""We are backing permitted development rights, which are converting dormant offices into places families can call home.

Wild salmon levels 'at lowest ever level'Fishery boards say stocks of wild salmon are at their lowest level since records began in 1952.Scotland,"Wild salmon catches in Scotland are at their lowest level since records began, government figures have revealed. Fisheries Management Scotland said new data highlighted that stocks of the fish are at ""crisis point"". The total reported catch through rod fishing was 37,196 for 2018, which was just 67% of the previous five-year average total. The vast majority of these, 93%, were caught and then released back into the water. The alliance of salmon fishery boards said catches of the fish are at their lowest levels since 1952. 'Approaching crisis point' The Scottish government has set outa number of salmon conservation measures,externalin recent years. Environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ""The decline in wild salmon numbers is of great concern, and I'm determined that we safeguard the future of this important species."" But Alan Wells, chief executive of Fisheries Management Scotland, said more needed to be done. He said: ""Salmon catches in Scotland have reached the lowest levels ever recorded. ""Figures for 2018, taken together with those of recent years, confirm this iconic species is now approaching crisis point. Some of the factors impacting on wild salmon stocks may be beyond human control. ""But the regulatory authorities now have a historic opportunity to do everything in their power to safeguard the species in those areas where they can make a difference."" In the past campaigners have claimedfish farms are to blame for wild salmon deathsas a result of sea lice originating from the farms. And a Scottish Parliament inquiry has recommendednew farms be positioned away from established migratory routesfor wild salmon. The annual economic value of Scottish salmon passed the Â£1bn mark for the first time last year and the 226 active farms support 10,000 jobs, many of which are in rural communities. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency has previously said one in five salmon farms failed to meet environmental standards Andrew Graham-Stewart, director of Salmon and Trout Conservation Scotland, said: ""Continuing low salmon numbers underline the vital importance of mitigating those man-made negative impacts, which are within our grasp to tackle, as a matter of urgency. ""One of the most critical factors is the impact of open-net salmon farms, in particular the release into the wider environment of vast numbers of deadly parasitic sea lice, on wild salmon numbers."" The salmon farming industry has insisted it is working hard to find solutions to the problem of sea lice, and is making progress inrearing so-called cleaner fishwhich feed off the lice, avoiding the need for chemicals. The Scottish government will publish the official wild salmon population data later. Environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the fall in the salmon catch was down to a range of complex factors, ""many of which are outwith our control, including the unprecedented water shortages Scotland experienced last summer"". She added: ""We have identified 12 groups of high level pressures on the species, and we're working closely with key partners to address these. Last year, for example, we committed Â£500,000 to fund research so we can better understand the problem and mitigate against it. ""In addition, we are providing around Â£5m a year to the Water Environment Fund to allow Sepa to remove barriers to fish migration in rivers around Scotland.""

Single homelessness spending 'cut by ÃÂ£5bn'Analysis suggests councils have lost billions from their budgets for lone homeless people since 2009.Family & Education,"Support services for single homeless people in England have lost Â£5bn since 2009, leaving people at risk with ""nowhere to turn"", charities say. Analysis for St Mungo's and Homeless Link found as councils faced central government funding cuts, such services lost an average of Â£590m a year. Rough sleeping, the most extreme form of homelessness, rose 165% over around the same period, the charities say. The government has set up more projects to tackle the issue since 2018. The charities acknowledge that the government has announced additional funding for local authorities for the coming years. But this is dwarfed by the money that has been lost over time, they said. Homeless deaths 'up 24%' over five years The city with no homeless on its streets Should homeless people be expected to live in a box? The charities commissioned researchers who looked at official spending data for all of England's local authorities. They cross-referred it with information on how many single person households and families were classed as homeless in different local authority areas. This enabled the team to arrive at a more accurate estimate of funds lost to services for homeless individuals. It found that if total expenditure on homelessness-related services had stayed constant from 2008-9, more than Â£5bn extra would have been spent. It also found that in 2017-18 local authorities spent Â£750m less on homelessness-related activity than they did in 2008-9, despite the rise in homelessness. Councils and service providers told the researchers of a worrying reduction in the services aimed at preventing homelessness - such as family mediation and tenancy support. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Howard Sinclair, chief executive of St Mungo's, said: ""The human cost of these cuts is all too real. ""The people we work with - many struggling with poor mental health, substance use or domestic violence - are often being left with no option but to sleep rough. ""With nearly 600 people dying on our streets or while homeless in a year, this really is a matter of life and death."" He urged the government to put the money back and to turn the tide of rising homelessness. Rick Henderson, chief executive of Homeless Link, a charity which represents those working in homelessness and housing sector, said: ""There are too many people sleeping rough and facing homelessness in this country - we can see it every day on our streets and it is unacceptable. ""Local authorities have a key role in supporting people who are homeless, or at risk of homelessness, but they can only do so if they have enough money to fund services properly."" Minister for Housing and Homelessness Heather Wheeler said: ""No-one should ever be without a home and the Government is committed to preventing and reducing all forms of homelessness, backed by Â£1.2bn of funding so far. ""We have also implemented the Homelessness Reduction Act, which helps more people get the support they need, and at an earlier stage. ""The Â£100m-backed Rough Sleeping Strategy was launched last year and sets out the government's blueprint for ending rough sleeping for good - including access to specialist support services and housing advice.""

'Beast of Beddau' is new millipede findColliery tips are home to hundreds of rare species of bugs - including some unique finds - say scientists.Wales,"This video can not be played A walk with Liam Olds, who led the research, says there is plenty to see The Beast of Beddau has joined the Maerdy Monster as a new bug species found at old coal mine sites in the UK. The small, white millipede is one of more than 900 different species found during a three-year study which highlights the importance of colliery spoil sites in south Wales to wildlife. It was found at the old Cwm Colliery near Beddau, described as one of the most biodiverse in the region. Researchershad already discovered the 12mm-long Maerdy Monster. Entomologist Liam Olds, who led the research, says there is plenty to see on a walk around the old sites This was believed to have been the first millipede species found in the UK since 1993. But at only 5mm long, the Beast of Beddau - found about 13 miles (21km) from the earlier discovery - is half the size. It was found underneath stones by naturalist Christian Owen - who also found the Maerdy Monster. The ""Beast"" has seven or eight lenses in its eyes - unlike the six found in a similar species. Scientists in Canada examined its genes as part of the research. The Maerdy Monster is about twice the length of the Beast of Beddau Altogether,surveys were conducted across 15 colliery spoil sites,external- eight in Rhondda Cynon Taf and seven in Neath Port Talbot - between 2015 and 2018. Spoil from old coal mines is low in nutrients but researchers found the earth can be quite complex and allow lichen-heath and even wetland habitat to develop. But it is still widely seen as derelict land, suitable only for reclamation, re-development or tree-planting. Liam Olds, the insect expert behind the research, said colliery spoil sites were becoming an ""increasingly important refuge"" for species declining in the wider countryside. ""On a single colliery site you can have anything from woodland, to flower-rich grassland, lakes, ponds and reed beds - providing the variety needed for insects to complete their life cycle,"" he said. The tips had become ""little islands where biodiversity can thrive."" The study found nearly 200 different invertebrate species which were rare enough to be classed as conservation priorities. Ninety bee species were identified - including aptly-named mining bees - 13 dragonfly species and 28 types of butterfly. 'Many' British pollinators in decline Treasure trove of insects found Insects hitch a ride on imported plants World's biggest bee rediscovered Some of the colliery sites surveyed had been reclaimed, others had been left to grow wild. The research was supported by Neath Port Talbot and Rhondda Cynon Taf councils, the National Museum of Wales, the Wildlife Trusts of South and West Wales, and Buglife Cymru. Clare Dinham, Buglife Cymru's director, said a change in attitude towards the tips was now needed. ""Unfortunately the public, councils and Welsh Government don't necessarily have the greatest perception of brownfield sites,"" she said. ""They are seen as areas we should develop, saving greener areas that might be biodiversity deficient. ""So this report is going to be really important for us to highlight their importance across Wales and the UK."" Dingy skipper (Erynnis tages) is classed as an iconic species, a butterfly in decline but found on reclaimed and old spoil tips Red-backed mining bee (Andrena similis) - a scarce insect associated with gorse-clad slopes of old, re-vegetated tip sites This is Larinus carlinae - a weevil associated with thistles and a species never found in the south Wales area before Acompus rufipes - this is a ground bug, classed as a notable species and found in south Wales for the first time Small pearl-bordered fritillary - Boloria selene - is a species of butterfly in decline and likes marshy areas of tip sites where violets grow Green tiger beetle (Cicindela campestris) - is agile and quick and likes hunting other bugs on sparsely vegetated, sunny banks at colliery tips The drymus pumilo â a ground bug - is new to the region, while the Grayling butterfly (right) is in decline but is the most iconic species for colliery spoil habitats Loss of British bees threatens food security 'New millipede species' found at mine Treasure trove of new insects discovered New order of insects sets up home in UK Colliery Spoil Biodiversity Project Buglife Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

British siblings among Sri Lanka victimsStudents Daniel and Amelie Linsey were among eight Britons killed in Sunday's bombings.,"Daniel and Amelie Linsey were among eight Britons killed in Sunday's bombings Tributes are being paid to members of three British families who were among more than 300 people killed in Easter Sunday's bombings in Sri Lanka. The deaths of London siblings Daniel and Amelie Linsey have ""shocked"" their schools, staff said. Eight Britons are known to have died in the attacks, including Dr Sally Bradley and Bill Harrop, both from Manchester, who were described as ""soulmates"". Anita Nicholson and her two children also died in a blast at a hotel. The death toll from the wave of attacks on churches and hotels in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa has now risen to 321, with about 500 injured, police say. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the attack was ""complex, highly co-ordinated and designed to cause maximum chaos, damage and heartbreak"". A team of family liaison officers has been sent to Sri Lanka to support the families of British victims and help repatriate the deceased, Mr Hunt said. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who are the victims? The father of Amelie and Daniel Linsey has been describing his desperate attempt to save his two teenage children. In anemotional interview with CNN,,externalMatt Linsey, a London-based American investment banker, said the pair were returning from the hotel buffet when a bomb went off. He said his instinct was to get them out of there but as he tried to do so a second bomb exploded, leaving both unconscious. He said a woman offered to help his daughter, who appeared to be moving, to an ambulance. Meanwhile, Mr Linsey lost his voice yelling for help to get his son, who was not moving, to an ambulance. Mr Linsey accompanied Daniel, 19, in an ambulance to hospital. Amelie, 15, arrived separately at the same hospital but neither could be saved. Amelie's school - Godolphin and Latymer School in west London - issued a statement on behalf of staff and pupils which said: ""We're obviously devastated and shocked and digesting the news at the moment. ""Our priority is supporting her family and the students here,"" staff said. And Westminster Kingsway College, where her brother Daniel was studying business, said it was ""shocked and saddened"", adding that it was offering counselling and support to students and staff who knew him. Bill Harrop and Sally Bradley just lived for each other, said one colleague Dr Bradley and her husband Mr Harrop, a retired firefighter, were on holiday in Sri Lanka when they were killed. The couple, who had lived in Western Australia since Mr Harrop's retirement, were soulmates who ""just lived for each other"", a former colleague of Dr Bradley said. ""She absolutely loved living in Australia. She felt very at home here,"" executive director Kathleen Smith told 6PR radio. She said Dr Bradley, who was director of clinical services at Rockingham Peel Group in Perth, talked of Mr Harrop's two sons as if they were her own. A team from North Manchester General Hospital, where Sally had previously worked, said: ""Sally was a lovely, kind individual, extremely approachable and gave so much to the NHS in Manchester during her career."" Mr Harrop had been in the fire service for 30 years before retiring in 2012, said Assistant County Fire Officer Dave Keelan, of Greater Manchester Fire Service. ""He was a much-loved and respected colleague and friend. He will be greatly missed."" It is not currently known which explosion killed the couple. Anita and her children Alex and Annabel died in the Shangri-La hotel bombing Anita Nicholson and her children Annabel, 11, and Alex, 14, were visiting Sri Lanka on holiday from their home in Singapore where Mrs Nicholson worked as a lawyer. Her husband, Ben Nicholson, who survived the blast, said his family were killed as they ate breakfast in the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo. ""Mercifully all three of them died instantly and with no pain or suffering,"" said Mr Nicholson, who is a partner with law firm Kennedys. He paid tribute to his ""wonderful, perfect wife"", a lawyer for mining firm Anglo American. She was ""a brilliant, loving and inspirational mother to our two wonderful children"", he said. ""Alex and Annabel were the most amazing, intelligent, talented and thoughtful children, and Anita and I were immensely proud of them both and looking forward to seeing them develop into adulthood,"" he added. ""They shared with their mother the priceless ability to light up any room they entered and bring joy to the lives of all they came into contact with."" Chancellor Phillip Hammond said Anita Nicholson was a former legal adviser at the Treasury and would be remembered by colleagues there as ""a brilliant and dedicated lawyer"". Details of the eighth British victim have not yet emerged. The Foreign Office has updated itstravel advice,externalfor Sri Lanka. It warns tourists to avoid crowded public areas, plan any movements carefully and not to travel during the newly-implemented nationwide curfew.

According to BBC Sinhala's Azzam Ameen, the blast happened while ""security forces personnel... tried to defuse a newly discovered explosives in a vehicle"". As Sri Lanka held its first mass funeral for 30 victims on Tuesday, the Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack via its news outlet. A BBC correspondent in Sri Lanka, however, has said that claim should be treated with caution. Sri Lanka's government had earlier blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ). On Tuesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""An attack like this on a hotel or a church or any other place is an indiscriminate attack on all of us.""

What we know so far Who are the victims? The father of Amelie and Daniel Linsey has been describing his desperate attempt to save his two teenage children. In anemotional interview with CNN,,externalMatt Linsey, a London-based American investment banker, said the pair were returning from the hotel buffet when a bomb went off. He said his instinct was to get them out of there but as he tried to do so a second bomb exploded, leaving both unconscious. He said a woman offered to help his daughter, who appeared to be moving, to an ambulance. Meanwhile, Mr Linsey lost his voice yelling for help to get his son, who was not moving, to an ambulance. Mr Linsey accompanied Daniel, 19, in an ambulance to hospital. Amelie, 15, arrived separately at the same hospital but neither could be saved. Amelie's school - Godolphin and Latymer School in west London - issued a statement on behalf of staff and pupils which said: ""We're obviously devastated and shocked and digesting the news at the moment. ""Our priority is supporting her family and the students here,"" staff said. And Westminster Kingsway College, where her brother Daniel was studying business, said it was ""shocked and saddened"", adding that it was offering counselling and support to students and staff who knew him. Bill Harrop and Sally Bradley just lived for each other, said one colleague Dr Bradley and her husband Mr Harrop, a retired firefighter, were on holiday in Sri Lanka when they were killed. The couple, who had lived in Western Australia since Mr Harrop's retirement, were soulmates who ""just lived for each other"", a former colleague of Dr Bradley said. ""She absolutely loved living in Australia. She felt very at home here,"" executive director Kathleen Smith told 6PR radio. She said Dr Bradley, who was director of clinical services at Rockingham Peel Group in Perth, talked of Mr Harrop's two sons as if they were her own. A team from North Manchester General Hospital, where Sally had previously worked, said: ""Sally was a lovely, kind individual, extremely approachable and gave so much to the NHS in Manchester during her career."" Mr Harrop had been in the fire service for 30 years before retiring in 2012, said Assistant County Fire Officer Dave Keelan, of Greater Manchester Fire Service. ""He was a much-loved and respected colleague and friend. He will be greatly missed."" It is not currently known which explosion killed the couple. Anita and her children Alex and Annabel died in the Shangri-La hotel bombing Anita Nicholson and her children Annabel, 11, and Alex, 14, were visiting Sri Lanka on holiday from their home in Singapore where Mrs Nicholson worked as a lawyer. Her husband, Ben Nicholson, who survived the blast, said his family were killed as they ate breakfast in the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo. ""Mercifully all three of them died instantly and with no pain or suffering,"" said Mr Nicholson, who is a partner with law firm Kennedys. He paid tribute to his ""wonderful, perfect wife"", a lawyer for mining firm Anglo American. She was ""a brilliant, loving and inspirational mother to our two wonderful children"", he said. ""Alex and Annabel were the most amazing, intelligent, talented and thoughtful children, and Anita and I were immensely proud of them both and looking forward to seeing them develop into adulthood,"" he added. ""They shared with their mother the priceless ability to light up any room they entered and bring joy to the lives of all they came into contact with."" Chancellor Phillip Hammond said Anita Nicholson was a former legal adviser at the Treasury and would be remembered by colleagues there as ""a brilliant and dedicated lawyer"".

It warns tourists to avoid crowded public areas, plan any movements carefully and not to travel during the newly-implemented nationwide curfew.

Labour vows to end 'slum' office housing,"This video can not be played The families living in converted office blocks in Harlow Labour says it would scrap a government scheme that allows offices and industrial buildings to be converted into homes without planning permission. The party said changes to permitted development rules in England had led to the creation of ""slum housing and rabbit hutch flats"". It also said developers had been able to avoid building affordable homes. The Conservatives said the plans would ""cut house building and put a stop to people achieving home ownership"". In 2013, the government changed planning rules to allow developers to turn offices, warehouses and industrial buildings into residential blocks without getting permission from the local council, in a bid to boost house building. Barnet House in North London is being converted to 254 flats The rules have since been further relaxed, leading to 42,000 new dwellings being created from former offices in the last few years. However, permitted development schemes are exempt from official space standards and also from any requirement to provide affordable homes. 'I don't want my kids thinking this is normal' 'Micro-homes could solve' housing crisis Labour said the policy had seen the loss of more than 10,000 affordable homes, and meant that flats ""just a few feet wide"" were now counted in official statistics as new homes. It said its policy was still to build 250,000 new homes a year in England with 100,000 being ""genuinely affordable"". ""This Conservative housing free-for-all gives developers a free hand to build what they want but ignore what local communities need,"" said John Healey, Labour's shadow housing secretary. ""Labour will give local people control over the housing that gets built in their area and ensure developers build the low-cost, high-quality homes that the country needs."" Police figures show crime recorded at Terminus House, and the car park which sits beneath the housing, rose 45% in the first 10 months of it opening In one permitted development scheme at Newbury House in Ilford, an office block has been turned into 60 flats measuring as little as 13 sq metres each. According to national space standards, the minimum floor area for a new one-bedroom one-person home is 37 sq metres. Critics say the schemes can be damaging to residents' mental wellbeing, as well as being miles from amenities and conducive to crime. At Terminus House - a converted office block in Harlow -crime jumped 45% in the first 10 monthsafter people moved in and by 20% within that part of the town centre. But some developers warn that without permitted development many office to residential schemes would no longer be viable. The government says the rules are helping tackle the housing crisis and allowing people to get on the housing ladder. Of the 13,526 homes delivered under permitted development last year, more than three quarters were built outside of London Marcus Jones, Conservative vice-chair for Local Government, said: ""Labour's plans would cut house building and put a stop to people achieving homeownership. ""We are backing permitted development rights, which are converting dormant offices into places families can call home. ""Whilst Labour put politics before our families, the Conservatives are delivering the houses this country needs so every family has a place to call home.""

Quit calls for MP over ÃÂ£85k salary,"On top of his pay as an MP, Johnny Mercer receives Â£85,000 a year from Crucial Academy to do four hours work per week A company that marketed a failed bond scheme that lost savers Â£236m has been funding an MP's private salary. Johnny Mercer receives Â£85,000 from Crucial Academy, a company ultimately funded by Surge Financial Limited. Surge Financial Limited took 25% commission for marketing bonds by London Capital and Finance (LCF), which is now in administration. Mr Mercer - who is facing calls from investors to quit as an MP - said he had done nothing wrong. The Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View is a non-executive director of Crucial Academy, which trains military veterans and aims to find them employment. Mr Mercer, himself a former Army officer, is contracted to work 20 hours per month, a rate of more than Â£350 per hour. The basic annual salary,externalfor an MP is Â£79,468, and they also receive expenses to cover the costs of running an office.

All MPs have to declare any individual work payments to the Register of Members' Financial Interests if they are more than Â£100. If, over the course of the year, they earn more than Â£300 from one source, they then have to declare every payment from that employer, however big or small. Government ministers are subject to the same rules, plus they are not allowed to be paid for writing newspaper articles and can't write books about their jobs while in employment.

Single homelessness spending 'cut by Â£5bn',"Support services for single homeless people in England have lost Â£5bn since 2009, leaving people at risk with ""nowhere to turn"", charities say. Analysis for St Mungo's and Homeless Link found as councils faced central government funding cuts, such services lost an average of Â£590m a year. Rough sleeping, the most extreme form of homelessness, rose 165% over around the same period, the charities say. The government has set up more projects to tackle the issue since 2018. The charities acknowledge that the government has announced additional funding for local authorities for the coming years. But this is dwarfed by the money that has been lost over time, they said. Homeless deaths 'up 24%' over five years The city with no homeless on its streets Should homeless people be expected to live in a box? The charities commissioned researchers who looked at official spending data for all of England's local authorities. They cross-referred it with information on how many single person households and families were classed as homeless in different local authority areas. This enabled the team to arrive at a more accurate estimate of funds lost to services for homeless individuals. It found that if total expenditure on homelessness-related services had stayed constant from 2008-9, more than Â£5bn extra would have been spent. It also found that in 2017-18 local authorities spent Â£750m less on homelessness-related activity than they did in 2008-9, despite the rise in homelessness. Councils and service providers told the researchers of a worrying reduction in the services aimed at preventing homelessness - such as family mediation and tenancy support. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Howard Sinclair, chief executive of St Mungo's, said: ""The human cost of these cuts is all too real. ""The people we work with - many struggling with poor mental health, substance use or domestic violence - are often being left with no option but to sleep rough. ""With nearly 600 people dying on our streets or while homeless in a year, this really is a matter of life and death."" He urged the government to put the money back and to turn the tide of rising homelessness. Rick Henderson, chief executive of Homeless Link, a charity which represents those working in homelessness and housing sector, said: ""There are too many people sleeping rough and facing homelessness in this country - we can see it every day on our streets and it is unacceptable. ""Local authorities have a key role in supporting people who are homeless, or at risk of homelessness, but they can only do so if they have enough money to fund services properly."" Minister for Housing and Homelessness Heather Wheeler said: ""No-one should ever be without a home and the Government is committed to preventing and reducing all forms of homelessness, backed by Â£1.2bn of funding so far. ""We have also implemented the Homelessness Reduction Act, which helps more people get the support they need, and at an earlier stage. ""The Â£100m-backed Rough Sleeping Strategy was launched last year and sets out the government's blueprint for ending rough sleeping for good - including access to specialist support services and housing advice.""

'Five Eyes' spy chiefs discuss cyber threat,"The government has approved the supply of equipment by Chinese telecoms firm Huawei for the UK's new 5G data network despite warnings of a security risk. There is no formal confirmation but theDaily Telegraph says,externalHuawei will build ""non-core"" components such as antennas. The US wants its allies in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence grouping - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to exclude the company. Huawei has denied that its work poses any risks of espionage or sabotage. But Australia has already said it is siding with Washington - which has spoken of ""serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere"". UK at odds with cyber-allies over Huawei Huawei - The world's most controversial company Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes? 5G: 'A cyber-attack could stop the country' A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has said it is reviewing the supply of equipment for the 5G network and will report in due course. Digital minister Margot James responded to the reports bytweeting,external: ""In spite of Cabinet leaks to the contrary, final decision yet to be made on managing threats to telecoms infrastructure."" According to the Daily Telegraph, Huawei would be allowed to help build the ""non-core"" infrastructure of the 5G network. This would mean Huawei would not supply equipment for what is known as the ""core"" parts - where tasks such as checking device IDs and deciding how to route voice calls and data take place. Huawei, a private company which already supplies equipment for the UK's existing mobile networks, has always denied claims it is controlled by the Chinese government. It said it was awaiting a formal announcement, but was ""pleased that the UK is continuing to take an evidence-based approach to its work"", adding it would continue to work cooperatively with the government and the industry. Ciaran Martin, the head of the National Cyber Security Centre - which oversees Huawei's current UK work - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a framework would be put in place to ensure the 5G network was ""sufficiently safe"". Asked about the potential of a conflict in the position of Five Eyes members, he added: ""In the past decade there have been different approaches across the Five Eyes and across the allied wider Western alliance towards Huawei and towards other issues as well."" 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. The world is going mobile and existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns, particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G is also much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45Mbps (megabits per second) on average and experts say 5G - which is starting to be rolled out in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster. What is 5G and what will it mean for you? Six UK cities named as 5G pioneers BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says it is believed the decision to involve Huawei was taken by ministers at a meeting of the government'snational security council,externalon Tuesday, chaired by Prime Minister Theresa May. The home, defence and foreign secretaries were reported to have raised concerns during the discussions. In atweet,external, shadow Cabinet Office minister Jo Platt said using Huawei equipment would raise ""serious questions"" about the ""government's interests and how they will secure networks"". BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera The decision on Huawei is one of the most significant long-term national security decisions this government will make and was always going to be contentious. 5G will underpin our daily lives in ways that are hard to predict. So does allowing a Chinese company to build those networks put people at risk of being spied on or even switched off? That is the concern from Washington and other critics who wanted the company excluded. But deciding to ban Huawei entirely from the network would have risked slowing down the development of 5G and also upsetting China. The UK believes it has experience in managing the risks posed by Huawei and can continue to do so going forward. But one retired senior intelligence official recently told me his view on what to do about Huawei had changed. In the past, he said, he had believed the policy of managing the risk had been sufficient. But now he was less sure. The reason was not to do with any change in his view of what the company could do. Rather it was about the risks to relationships with close allies, namely those of the Five Eyes and US. Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tugendhattweeted,externalthat allowing Huawei to build some of the UK's 5G infrastructure would ""cause allies to doubt our ability to keep data secure and erode the trust essential to #FiveEyes cooperation"". This video can not be played We explain the controversy around Huawei's 5G tech â using castles Speaking on the Today programme, Mr Tugendhat said the proposals still raised concerns, as 5G involved an ""internet system that can genuinely connect everything, and therefore the distinction between non-core and core is much harder to make"". 'Shoddy' Huawei work risks Westminster ban Huawei sales top $100bn despite backlash Joyce Hakmeh, a research fellow at think tank Chatham House and co-editor of the Journal of Cyber Policy, said the UK's current mobile network needs to be transformed to the ""the next level... quicker, more stable 5G"". But she added the government would be hoping its decision on Huawei did not upset either China or the US. Limiting - but not barring - Huawei technology from the 5G networks would be a ""diplomatic way of managing a difficult situation"" for the UK, said Ms Hakmeh. Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes?

"Woman wakes after 27 years in a comaMunira Abdulla, from the United Arab Emirates, had been unconscious since 1991 after a car crash.Middle East","Prolonged disorders of consciousness are usually caused by a sudden brain injury A woman from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who was seriously injured in a traffic accident in 1991 has made a seemingly miraculous recovery after emerging from a 27-year-long coma. Munira Abdulla, who was aged 32 at the time of the accident, suffered a severe brain injury after the car she was travelling in collided with a bus on the way to pick up her son from school. Omar Webair, who was then just four years old, was sitting in the back of the vehicle with her, but was left unscathed as his mother cradled him in her arms moments before the accident. Ms Abdulla - who was being driven by her brother-in-law - was left seriously injured, but last year regained consciousness in a German hospital. Omar has opened up about the accident and about his mother's progress following years of treatment in an interview with the UAE-based newspaper The National. ""I never gave up on her because I always had a feeling that one day she would wake up,external,"" Omar told the newspaper on Monday. ""The reason I shared her story is to tell people not to lose hope on their loved ones; don't consider them dead when they are in such a state,"" he added. ""My mother was sitting with me in the back seat. When she saw the crash coming, she hugged me to protect me from the blow."" Fireman's recovery stuns doctors,external Pole wakes up from 19-year coma,external Von Bulow dies after 28-year coma,external He was unharmed, suffering just a bruise to the head, but his mother was left untreated for hours. Ms Abdulla was eventually taken to hospital, and later transferred to London. There, she was declared to be in a vegetative state - unresponsive, but able to sense pain - The National reports. She was then returned to Al Ain, a city in the UAE on the border with Oman where she lived, and moved to various medical facilities according to insurance requirements. She remained there for a few years, fed through a tube and kept alive. She underwent physiotherapy to ensure her muscles would not weaken through lack of movement. In 2017, the family was offered a grant by the Crown Prince Court, a government body in Abu Dhabi, for Ms Abdulla to be transferred to Germany. There, she underwent a number of surgeries to correct her severely shortened arm and leg muscles, and she was given medication to improve her state, including her wakefulness. A year later, her son was involved in an argument in her hospital room, which seemed to prompt his mother to stir. ""There was a misunderstanding in the hospital room and she sensed I was at risk, which caused her a shock,"" Omar said. ""She was making strange sounds and I kept calling the doctors to examine her, they said everything was normal. ""Then, three days later, I woke up to the sound of someone calling my name. ""It was her! She was calling my name, I was flying with joy; for years I have dreamt of this moment, and my name was the first word she said."" She became more responsive, and can now feel pain and have some conversations. She has returned to Abu Dhabi, where she is undergoing physiotherapy and further rehabilitation - mainly to improve her posture when sitting and prevent muscles from contracting. There are only a few cases of people recovering consciousness after several years - and even then, recovery can be protracted. It is impossible to predict the chances of someone in a state of impaired consciousness improving,external, says the UK's National Health Service. People who do regain consciousness often have severe disabilities caused by damage to their brain. One notable recovery case is that of Terry Wallis,an American man who was involved in a car accident when he was 19, and made a dramatic recovery after spending 19 years in a near-vegetative state,external. It was thought he had been able to re-grow brain tissue.

Netherlands 'hosts most child abuse images'About half of such images reported to the Internet Watch Foundation in 2018 were hosted in the Netherlands.,"Almost half of the child sexual abuse images reported to the Internet Watch Foundation last year were hosted in the Netherlands, the organisation says. It confirmed more than 105,000 web addresses were connected to illegal images in 2018, with 47% of the content hosted in the Netherlands. It warned that the country was becoming a ""safe haven for child sexual abuse"". The Dutch government has acknowledged an increase in reports of child abuse images and has pledged to tackle it. Such material should be ""expunged from the internet,"" itsaid in a report early in 2018,external. The IWF is an independent organisation that lets people report illegal child sex abuse images that they spot online. The organisation works with websites, social networks and law enforcement to have the images taken down and investigated. Since 1996, it has assessed more than a million reports. In its annual report, the IWF said 105,047 web addresses were hosting child sexual abuse images in 2018. That is a large increase compared with 2017. The IWF said that improvements in its technology had helped it detect more illegal images. Susan Hargreaves, chief executive of the IWF, said the UK had created a ""hostile environment"" for people wanting to share illegal images. Just 0.04% of the images reported in 2018 were hosted in the UK, the report said. But Ms Hargreaves said the Netherlands needed to ""stand up and do what's right"". A majority of the reported photographs - 82% - were found on image-hosting services, rather than on social networks or private websites. Some of these services are based in the Netherlands due to the low cost of web-hosting there. The IWF declined to name any of the image-sharing sites that had been found hosting child abuse images. It told the BBC it works with companies to make sure that content is removed. It said it had also offered its support to the Dutch organisation responsible for dealing with illegal images in the country. One of the reasons the number of images hosted in the United States was lower is because US tech giants such as Facebook are quick to remove them before reports reach the IWF.

Sinead Quinn said friends of Ms McKee would be wearing T-shirts like this one to the funeral They said they were thankful for the huge outpouring of sympathy in recent days, and that she should be remembered as ""someone who spoke to and made friends with anybody and everybody, no matter what their background"". That will be one of the themes of the funeral service, with Protestant and Catholic clergy taking part and politicians from across the political divide in attendance. The journalist and campaigner for LGBT rights is survived by her partner, mother, two brothers and three sisters. Her funeral is to be held at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast, and the service will be led jointly by the Anglican dean of Belfast, the Very Reverend Stephen Forde, and Fr Martin Magill at 13.00 BST. By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI In life and in death, Lyra McKee is bringing people together in Belfast. The funeral of this 29-year-old woman, from a Catholic background, is taking place in a Protestant cathedral. Her family chose the cathedral due to its reputation as a ""shared space"" in a divided city. It may be Church of Ireland in its status and governance, but it has strong ecumenical links and even has a chapel of unity. The death of Ms McKee was a horrific reminder of the old Northern Ireland. Many are hoping that her funeral will be a symbol of something new. Ms McKee's partner, Sara Canning, said the service would be a ""celebration of her life"". ""If people would like to wear Hufflepuff, Harry Potter or Marvel related T-shirts I know she would love it,"" Ms Canning said. Secretary of State Karen Bradley will be among the dignitaries attending the funeral, while the Irish government's representatives include the foreign minister, Simon Coveney. Dissident republican group the New IRAadmitted responsibility for the journalist's murder, according to the Irish News. Three people have been arrested over the shooting, but all have been released without charge. Fr Joe Gormley, who anointed Ms McKee after she was shot dead, told BBC News NI there was still a ""great deal of shock"" in Derry. Sara Canning (centre) was ""planning to grow old"" with her partner Lyra McKee ""But people are also reflecting and they know that we are faced with a choice in life,"" he said. ""We either go back to the dark days or move forward."" He said he was willing to ""sit down and talk"" to those responsible. Lyra McKee, who was also a campaigner for LGBT rights, gave a TED talk in 2017 Fellow members of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) are to form a guard of honour at the cathedral. The union described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. CiarÃ¡n Ã MaolÃ¡in, the union's Belfast secretary, described her as ""intelligent, determined and very witty"". There will be a gathering at Guildhall Square in Derry at 13:00 BST for those who cannot attend her funeral.
