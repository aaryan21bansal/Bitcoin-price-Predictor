Christmas 'in jeopardy' after ban on UK travellers,"Nicola Smith with her husband Steve who died in July this year After a particularly tough year, Nicola Smith was planning to spend Christmas abroad with her daughter and granddaughter to create ""new memories"". Her husband, Steve, died in a motorbike accident in July - and the toy shop she owns had to shut for huge parts of 2020 due to the Covid-19 lockdowns. Nicola, 60, from Morecambe, was due to fly to Canada on Monday to visit her daughter Philippa, and three-year-old granddaughter Martha. It would have been the first time she had seen Philippa since she suffered her own trauma: Philippa's partner, Tom, died in a white-water-rafting accident last year. But her hopes of seeing her family were dashed on Monday morning when Canada brought in a 72-hour ban on flights from the UK. ""I just wanted to go away where we could make new memories,"" said Nicola. ""I haven't seen Philippa since Tom drowned, and she's having such a hard time so far away from her family with a lockdown. ""She was trying to work from home with a three-year-old, with no family within thousands of miles. ""She was so looking forward to just having her mum there."" Numerous countries have introduced travel bans amid concerns over the new coronavirus variant Canada is one of several countries to havebanned arrivals from the UKbecause of concerns about the spread of a new variant of coronavirus. Nicola said this year had been ""horrendous"", and when she woke up to the news of the travel ban she was in ""disbelief"". Christmas Day will be exactly five months after Steve's death, so she was looking forward to getting away to somewhere she hadn't spent the festive season before. Nicola also hasn't seen her granddaughter since she was a baby - so the Christmas trip was going to be an extra special time for the family. ""I speak on Facebook Messenger to her but it's not the same,"" Nicola said. ""She doesn't really know who I am, but she's been getting excited for grandma coming."" It's not yet clear when the UK travel ban to Canada will be lifted - or whether Nicola will be able to rebook her flight. ""You come so far and then it's taken away again,"" she said. ""If there's a flight on Christmas Eve I'll go. But nobody knows what's going to happen"". Nick Kennedy and his family were looking forward to hosting his parents in France this Christmas Nicola is one of many people who have had their plans to go abroad for Christmas disrupted at the last minute. Canada, India, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, Italy and Austria aresome of the more than 40 countriesthat have blocked UK arrivals. British man Nick Kennedy, who lives in France, was looking forward to sharing Christmas with his parents who were due to travel there from Swindon on Tuesday. ""We don't get enough time together as a family, so we wanted to make the most of it."" he said. ""We want our son to spend as much time as possible with his English grandparents. ""It's a big disappointment as a family. All I can hope for is that the borders reopen very, very quickly. We've got to wait until Tuesday to see if there's any possibility of movement before Christmas. ""Many people, including my family, don't believe the borders will be open."" Les hasn't seen his family since August Les Banks Irvine was due to fly back to the UK from Monrovia in Liberia - where he works - to spend three weeks with his family this Christmas. But when he turned up at the airport on Sunday he was told at the check in-desk: ""Sorry, because you're going to the UK, you can't go."" ""I was hoping to be spending some time with my two children and three grandchildren in mid-Wales, but it now looks like I am stranded here in Monrovia,"" he said. ""I've been here for about nine months this year. I last saw my family at the end of August. ""I know its difficult times for everyone, but I do wish national air carriers would keep us informed."" Flights from the UK are being suspended to countries across the world including Italy, Slovakia and India Maria Kovacsova, who is from Slovakia but lives in London, is due to fly home to see her family on Christmas Eve - but her trip is looking unlikely now. ""I have spent so much money on a private Covid test in order to go home,"" she said. ""I haven't seen my family for a year. My heart is broken. ""I was last at home a year ago. I couldn't go after that because the big lockdown started in March. I had to work as well. ""I'm going to do nothing for Christmas. You can't do anything basically, you can't see your friends or family. ""I live in shared accommodation with five people in Tooting. We are basically five strangers living together; five professionals in one house and we're not able to leave the house."" Gary and Abigail own a pet transport company Gary Fearon and his partner Abigail Brown, who have lived in Spain since January, are facing the prospect of Christmas in a Northampton hotel. The couple own a pet transport company and had arrived in the UK on Friday to deliver pets from Spain. They were due to pick up other customers' pets from the UK and travel back with them to Spain on Tuesday. But their plans are now up in the air. ""We have no information as to when and how we will get to Spain,"" said Gary. ""Customers who are ready to fly to Spain are now having to decide what to do with their pets as we cannot guarantee when we can leave."" The couple are unable to stay with family as Gary's relatives live in Ireland and Abigail's family are in Covid high-risk groups. ""The hotel we're in at the minute doesn't know for definite if they're open on Christmas Day,"" said Gary. ""We have our own pets in Spain that are being minded by a neighbour. ""We've been lucky to get a hotel room. I feel sorry for the lorry drivers in Dover.""

Joe Biden gets Covid-19 vaccine live on TV,"This video can not be played Joe Biden receives Covid-19 vaccine President-elect Joe Biden has received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, saying he was getting the jab to show Americans it is ""safe to take"". Mr Biden joins a growing number of political leaders getting the jab, including Vice-President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. On Sunday, the roll-out began for a second vaccine, by Moderna, which was approved last week. More than 500,000 Americans are said to have now been vaccinated. Can pregnant women receive the vaccine? It depends US approves Moderna as second Covid-19 vaccine Trump's Covid vaccine chief admits delivery error ""I'm doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it's available to take the vaccine,"" Mr Biden said from Newark, Delaware, where he got the jab live on TV. ""There's nothing to worry about."" He said the Trump administration ""deserves some credit"" for launching the country's vaccine programme. Mr Biden's wife, Jill Biden, received her first dose earlier in the day, the president-elect said. Mr Biden's running mate, Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff are expected to receive their first shots next week. The Biden team has set a goal of 100 million Covid-19 vaccinations in the US during the administration's first 100 days in the White House. During the pandemic, the US has recorded more than 18 million cases and 319,000 deaths. This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered President Donald Trump, who spent three days in hospital with the coronavirus in October, has not said when he intends to get the vaccine. The president is now one of last of the country's top elected officials to have not received the first of the course of two jabs. ""I am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time,"" Mr Trump wrote in a 13 December tweet. Some of his advisers have defended the delay, saying he is still protected by the treatments he received to beat the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday released a new set of guidelines for the next groups of Americans to be eligible for vaccination. Phase 1A:US vaccine distribution has so far 21 million healthcare workers, as well as the three million elderly Americans living in long-term care facilities. Vaccinations for this group began last week. Phase 1B:Americans aged 75 and older, in addition to frontline workers will be next up. This broad category includes some 30 million workers ""who are in sectors essential to the functioning of society"" with high risk of exposure. First responders, corrections workers, US Postal Service employees, and those who work in education, public transit, grocery stores, manufacturing, food and agriculture will be eligible. This phase is expected to begin in January. Phase 1C:Americans aged 65 and older, those with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness from Covid-19, and other essential non-frontline workers. This category includes an estimated 129 million people. Roughly three million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been shipped and more than 500,000 Americans have been vaccinated so far, according to the CDC. And on Sunday, distribution of the Moderna vaccine began in the country too, with some six million vaccine doses available for immediate shipment. The army general in charge of distributing Covid vaccines in the US on Saturday apologised for a ""miscommunication"" with certain states over the number of doses to be delivered in the initial stages of distribution. More than a dozen states had expressed concern at a cut in the expected number. Boston health workers received shipments of the vaccine last week On Friday, more than 100 doctors at Stanford Medical Center protested against the university's plan for vaccine distribution. They say only seven of more than 1,300 residents - recent graduates of medical school - were selected to receive the vaccine in the first round of 5,000 doses. Hospital administrators and doctors working from home were given priority over those working directly with Covid-19 patients, according to the protesters. Stanford officials later apologised, saying the university was working ""to address the flaws in our plan"".

'Selfless' boy drowned trying to save brother,"The coroner said Anas had acted selflessly and his actions should be commended A ""selfless"" teenage boy drowned trying to save his brother who had got into difficulties during a river swim, an inquest has heard. Anas El-Rafai, 15, died on 17 August trying to help his brother in the River Tees at Darlington. The pair were among a group of friends who had gone to swim at a popular beauty spot known as Broken Scar. Assistant coroner James Thompson, sitting at Crook Coroner's Court, ruled Anas had accidentally drowned. The group had visited the river to take photographs and had apparently gone into the water to cool down, the hearing was told. Anas was swept away after managing to push his 13-year-old sibling, Jamal, to safety. Mr Thompson said the tragedy ""reinforced the dangers of playing in rivers and in open water"". He said ""People should take extreme care and need to understand the power of nature."" Flowers were attached to railings at the site of the accident The inquest was told recent heavy rain had left river levels high and that the undercurrent was strong and the water cold and fast-flowing. Mr Thomson said Anas had acted ""selflessly"" and his actions should be commended. He added: ""Anas had a few seconds to think and he simply acted - there was nothing more his friends or the emergency services could do."" Anas's family fled the civil war in Syria in 2011, initially going to Lebanon, then moving to the UK in 2018.

Lockerbie bomb suspect charged after 32 years,"A total of 270 people died in the Lockerbie bombing on 21 December 1988 The US has announced charges against a Libyan suspected of making the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. Abu Agila Mohammad Masud has been charged with terrorism-related crimes, Attorney General William Barr said on Monday, 32 years on from the atrocity. The deadly bomb attack on the Boeing 747 killed 270 people, including 190 American citizens. Prosecutors will seek the extradition of Mr Masud to stand trial in the US. The US claims Mr Masud is an ex-Libyan intelligence operative. He allegedly carried out the attack on the orders of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The bombing of the London to New York flight remains the deadliest terrorist incident ever to have taken place in the UK, and the second deadliest air attack in US history. Eleven people on the ground in Scotland were also killed. The victims included 35 study abroad US students who were returning home for Christmas. The town scarred by Pan Am flight 103 Wreaths laid to mark Lockerbie bombing 30th anniversary Timeline: Lockerbie bombing The new charges bring Mr Barr's role in this lengthy terrorism investigation full circle, as he was also US Attorney General when charges were first announced against two Libyan suspects in 1991. Back then, serving under President George HW Bush, Mr Barr tasked his criminal division head Robert Mueller to look into the bombing. Mr Mueller is now best known for leading the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Both Mr Barr and Mr Mueller have taken part in remembrance events with families over the years. Police Scotland's chief constable, Iain Livingstone, said the charges were a ""significant development"" and that they will ""continue to work closely"" with the US and other international authorities. He said it was ""inappropriate to comment further"" at this time. This video can not be played Lockerbie bombing suspect charged by US Justice Department Mr Barr said he was ""pleased to announce that the United States has filed criminal charges against the third conspirator Abu Agila Mohammad Masud for his role in the bombing"". ""Let there be no mistake, no amount of time or distance will stop the United States and our Scottish partners in pursuing justice in this case."" Mr Barr said the ""breakthrough"" that led to Monday's charges came when authorities learned he was being held in Libya. Mr Barr said Libyan authorities provided a copy of their interview with Mr Masud to US officials. He said Mr Masud allegedly built the bomb and worked with two other co-conspirators. He said Gaddafi had also personally thanked Mr Masud ""for the successful attack on the United States"". ""At long last this man responsible for killing Americans and many others will be subject to justice for his crimes,"" Mr Barr said. The attorney general added that he is ""optimistic"" that the Libyan government will hand Mr Masud over. Analysis by Paul Adams, BBCdiplomaticcorrespondent For Bill Barr, this has been a long time coming. Twenty-nine years ago, as acting Attorney General, he announced the first indictments of suspects in the Lockerbie case. Today, in one of his last acts as Donald Trump's top legal officer, he said events had come ""full circle,"" with the unsealing of charges against Abu Agila Mohammad Masud. ""Terrorists have to know that eventually we will get them,"" Barr told reporters. Over the years, the bombing has spawned any number of theories about who was responsible, with fingers pointing, at one time or another, at Iran, Syria, Palestinian militants and, finally, Libya. But US and British officials have long been convinced Lockerbie was the work of Libyan agents, working under orders from the country's former dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. Today's charges could, finally, lay other theories to rest. Mr Masud is alleged to have been a top bomb-maker for Mr Gaddafi. Journalist Ken Dornstein, whose brother David was on board the Pan Am plane, went to Libya to track down Mr Masud as part of a 2015 TV documentary by US network PBS called My Brother's Bomber. He told the BBC at the time that the Libyan national was ""a mystery figure"" who was named in the initial investigation and ""was said to have been a technical expert"". This video can not be played Ken Dornstein on how he tracked down new Lockerbie suspects The documentary alleged that Mr Masud had also been linked to a bombing at a disco in West Berlin in 1986, which killed three people. It also reported that he was imprisoned in Libya over his role in the 2011 uprising that ousted Gaddafi. Based on travel records and witness statements, US investigators allege in the criminal complaint that Mr Masud flew from Tripoli, Libya, to Malta in December 1988 but met with a Libyan intelligence official ahead of the flight. Six days later, two other co-conspirators also journeyed to Malta, and the three men allegedly worked together on the explosive device. The complaint alleges they concealed the cassette that held the bomb in clothing from a store in Malta. Mr Masud armed the device on 21 December, investigators allege. A suitcase containing the device was then placed on feeder flights from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany, and eventually to London's Heathrow airport, where it was loaded onto the Pan Am flight. That same day, Mr Masud reportedly returned to Tripoli. Several days later, he and another co-conspirator allegedly met with a senior intelligence official, who praised their work. Kara Weipz, whose brother was killed in the bombing, said at the news conference: ""We are justified, vindicated, our patience and persistence has proved fruitful with this decision today."" ""The motto of the family members over the last 32 years has been the truth must be known,"" she said. Kara Weipz (centre), representative on behalf of the Pan Am 103 families, delivers remarks beside US Attorney General William Barr (left) Ahead of the briefing, some UK families had criticised the timing of the charges to fall on the anniversary of the attack, accusing the US justice department of using the case for ""propaganda purposes"". John Mosey, whose 19-year-old daughter was killed in the bombing, said he would not accept the invitation to remotely attend the event. Mr Mosey wrote that he and his wife felt the timing was ""bizarre, disrespectful, insensitive and extremely ill considered"". ""Why would you use the anniversary of our daughter Helga's death along with 269 others to parade once more a highly suspect prosecution?"" Mr Mosey added that why the attack ""was allowed to happen is a far more important question to us than 'who did it?'"" Libyan national Abdelbaset al-Megrahi is the only man convicted, in 2001, over the bombing. Megrahi, who always proclaimed his innocence, launched two appeals against his 27-year sentence, one was unsuccessful and the other was abandoned. Megrahi was released from prison in Scotland and allowed to return to Libya on compassionate grounds in 2009 after it emerged that he had terminal cancer. He died three years later. A Scottish court is now considering a posthumous appealagainst his conviction by his family. According to the FBI, the alleged bomb-maker Mr Masud is said to have admitted in his jailhouse confession that he bought the clothes which investigators say were wrapped around the bomb in the Samsonsite suitcase. This would appear to contradict a key piece of evidence in the Scottish prosecution of Megrahi - that it was him who bought the clothing. However, Mr Masud also allegedly said in his Libyan jailhouse interview that his fellow intelligence operative Megrahi was his co-conspirator in the bomb plot.

Two found guilty of killing 39 migrants in lorry,"Gheorghe Nica and Eamonn Harrison were both found guilty of manslaughter Two men have been found guilty of the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese migrants found dead in a lorry trailer in Essex. The migrants suffocated in the sealed container en route from Zeebrugge to Purfleet in October 2019. Eamonn Harrison, 24, who dropped off the trailer at the Belgian port, and people-smuggler Gheorghe Nica, 43, were convicted by an Old Bailey jury. Two others were convicted of being part of a wider people-smuggling conspiracy. The 39 people who died in the back of a trailer as it crossed the North Sea between Zeebrugge and the UK The trial examined three smuggling attempts by the gang - two that were successful on 11 and 18 October, and the final trip on 23 October. Lorry driver Christopher Kennedy, 24, from County Armagh, collected the trailers from Purfleet on the earlier two runs, claiming he thought he was transporting cigarettes. But the jury found Kennedy and Valentin Calota, 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. During the trial, jurors were given a snapshot of the victims - who included a bricklayer, a university graduate and a nailbar technician - and their dreams of a better life. Many of their families borrowed heavily to fund their passage, relying on their potential future earnings once they got into the UK. The supposed 'VIP' journey that killed 39 people Irish smuggling connection to Essex lorry deaths Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten, from Essex Police, said: ""If you look at the method, the way they transported human beings... we wouldn't transport animals in that way."" Another two men - Irish haulage boss Ronan Hughes, 41, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, Ireland, and 26-year-old lorry driver Maurice Robinson - had previously admitted manslaughter. Home Secretary Priti Patel described the deaths as a ""truly tragic incident"". Christopher Kennedy was found guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration Prosecutors said in the fatal run, the container became a ""tomb"" as temperatures in the unit reached an ""unbearable"" 38.5C (101F). The migrants, aged 15 to 44, were sealed inside for at least 12 hours. They had used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof, but only managed to dent the interior. Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones said: ""There was no way out, and no-one to hear them; no-one to help them."" Both Maurice Robinson (l) and Ronan Hughes (r) admitted 39 counts of manslaughter in connection with the case Harrison, of Newry, County Down, towed the trailer to Zeebrugge, from where it was transported to Purfleet. During the 10-week trial, he claimed he did not know there were people in the trailer and that he watched ""a wee bit of Netflix"" in bed as they were loaded on. He also said he had no idea there were migrants in two other trailers that he had dropped off at the same port in the previous 12 days. Robinson, from County Armagh, collected the trailer when it arrived on UK shores just after midnight on 23 October. His boss, Hughes, had messaged him: ""Give them air quickly don't let them out."". Robinson gave a thumbs-up in reply. But when Robinson stopped on a nearby industrial estate, he found that the migrants were all dead. The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October last year There was a series of telephone conversations between him and Hughes and Nica, of Basildon, Essex, before Robinson eventually dialled 999. In his evidence, Nica said Robinson told him: ""I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer."" Det Ch Insp Stoten said that many of the police officers who attended ""were really young in service"" and it was possibly the first time some had ever seen a dead person. He said he believed the ""absolutely horrendous scene"" would stay with those officers ""for the rest of their career and, quite probably, the rest of lives"". On all three runs, Nica had arranged cars and a van to transport the migrants at the UK end. Jurors were shown CCTV footage of him carrying a holdall of cash to Hughes's room at the Ibis hotel, Thurrock, early on 19 October. Ronan Hughes (left) meeting Gheorghe Nica at a budget hotel Nica admitted to conspiring to assist illegal immigration in the first two runs, but he insisted that he believed the third run was all to do with smuggling cigarettes. The mechanic told jurors he had been roped into people-smuggling, and said: ""I never wanted to be involved in this kind of job."" The day after the bodies were found, Nica travelled to Romania, claiming he was ""scared"" of a ""big, big investigation"", but prosecutors said the defendant's version of events was ""ridiculous"". Det Ch Insp Stoten said the gang stood to make between Â£10,000 and Â£12,000 per person transported, ""the lion's share of which would have gone to Ronan Hughes and Gheorghe Nica"". CCTV footage from Orsett Golf Club of a lorry on 11 October 2019 The jury had heard that on 14 October, between the two successful runs, Kennedy was found at the French end of the Channel Tunnel with 20 Vietnamese migrants in his trailer. At least two of those people ended up dying in the fatal run. Police believe the smugglers had ""doubled-up"" the load on 23 October because of the problem on 14 October, and that was what led to the deaths. This gang had been smuggling people for months and months, the Old Bailey heard. On the first of several successful runs on the same route, a couple, Marie Andrews and Stewart Cox, saw people getting out of a van on a country lane in Orsett, Essex, and dialled 999. Police attended but did not seize CCTV footage from the nearby golf course, in which a lorry and other vehicles were seen on the lane. If, perhaps, Essex Police had managed to get to that footage, follow it up and identify some of the vehicles before the fatal run 12 days later, then this gang might possibly have been disrupted before these 39 people died. Asked about that, the force said it could only allocate the resources available at the time. But it says that now, if there are ever reports of people in the back of a lorry and the driver is present, the driver will be arrested. Dinh Dinh Binh - from Hai Phong - was one of two 15-year-olds to die in the container Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Hobart Road, Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Barclay Road, Tottenham, north London, had earlier admitted assisting unlawful immigration linked to the case. Mr Justice Sweeney adjourned sentencing of all the defendants to 7, 8 and 11 January. Ms Patel said her ""thoughts remain with those affected by this tragedy"". ""Today's convictions only strengthen my resolve to do all I can to go after the people-smugglers who prey on the vulnerable and trade in human misery,"" she added.

Supermarkets try to calm food shortage fears,"Retailers have played down fears of food shortages after France shut its borders to UK hauliers for 48 hours due to the UK's new coronavirus variant. But they warned of ""serious disruption"" without a resolution, with Tesco and Sainsbury's saying some fresh produce such as lettuce could run short. The prime minister's spokesman said the UK had a ""diverse"" food supply chain. France's transport minister has saidmeasures to ""ensure that movement from the UK can resume"" are close.,external The Channel is a vital trade route, with about 10,000 lorries a day travelling between Dover and Calais in peak periods such as Christmas, largely bringing in the freshest produce. The risk is European hauliers will avoid the UK for fear of getting stranded in the country. The head of the Food and Drink Federation (FDF), Ian Wright, said the border closure had the ""potential to cause serious disruption to UK Christmas fresh food supplies - and exports of UK food and drink"". Andrew Opie, director of food & sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers had stocked up well ahead of Christmas. But he added: ""The closure of France to UK traffic, including accompanied freight poses difficulties for UK capacity to import and export key goods during the busy Christmas period. ""While goods can enter from France, few haulage firms will be willing to send trucks and drivers across to the UK without a guarantee they can return to the EU in a timely manner."" There have been large queues of traffic outside the Port of Dover Tesco said it had plenty of food for Christmas and it was encouraging customers to ""shop as normal"". ""We've been building our stockholding of key products ahead of the Christmas peak and are working closely with our hauliers and suppliers to continue the supply of goods into our stores,"" it said. But it warned that ""there may be reduced supply on a few fresh items, such as lettuce, cauliflower and citrus fruit later this week, but we don't expect any problems with availability on these lines today or tomorrow"". A Sainsbury's spokesman said all of its Christmas lunch products were ""already in the country"" and it was looking at alternative ways of sourcing products from Europe. But he added: ""If nothing changes, we will start to see gaps over the coming days on lettuce, some salad leaves, cauliflowers, broccoli and citrus fruit - all of which are imported from the Continent at this time of year."" Currently freight lorries cannot enter France, but trucks coming in the opposite direction are still allowed. Unaccompanied freight, such as containers or lorry trailers on their own, can still be transported from the UK to France. On Sunday, the Port of Dover said it was closed to traffic leaving the UK ""until further notice"" due to the border restrictions. Phil Houlton is the operations director of a haulage firm in Stoke-on-Trent ""People focus on the goods, but in this country, we're doing nothing for those drivers,"" says Phil Houlton. The operations director at DWP & Sons, a haulage firm based in Stoke-on-Trent, says that it currently has three drivers who have been stuck in queues on the M20 for up to 14 hours. ""Guess what? If they want to go to the toilet, they've got to dig a hole at the side of the road. It's 2020, that's so undignified. If it wasn't for the fact they have self-sufficient cabs - microwaves, coffee machines - they'd have nothing."" Other drivers have been diverted so freight can be transported unaccompanied, while others are stuck on the other side of the Channel. And with uncertainty surrounding a Brexit trade deal, ""the French have seen this as a good opportunity to make this even worse"", Phil believes. ""These are people we've worked hand-in-glove with for years, and now they're trying to make us pay for [an exit from the European Union]."" While the firm has been preparing for a potential ""no-deal"" Brexit for months, Phil's primary concern is now ensuring the wellbeing of the drivers who are stuck. ""All of them want to get home and spend time with their families. It's only a couple of times a year where truck drivers want to be home and Christmas is one of them,"" he says. UK ministers discussed the French ban at a Cobra emergency committee after urging the public and hauliers not to travel to ports in Kent such as Dover. The prime minister's official spokesman said people should ""shop normally"" while the travel ban was in place and ""continue to be considerate in the way they shop"". He added that the ""majority of food doesn't come into the UK from the short strait"" between Dover and Calais and the UK has ""diverse and resilient supply chains"". Tonnes of Scottish fish exports 'stuck at Dover' More than 30 countries ban UK arrivals over Covid New coronavirus variant: What do we know? On Thursday morning, France's Mr Djebbari tweeted: ""In the next few hours, at European level, we're going to establish a solid health protocol to ensure that movement from the UK can resume. ""Our priority: to protect our nationals and our fellow citizens."" Kent Police have mobilised Operation Stack - a system to park lorries on the M20 motorway in Kent- to handle the build-up of traffic caused by the disruption. The Department for Transport has also said that Manston Airport in Kent is being readied to take up to 4,000 lorries to ease congestion in the county. Richard Burnett, head of the Road Haulage Association, told the BBC's Today programme that consumers should not ""worry about panic buying at this point in time"". He also said retailers would be doing all they could to ensure their fresh food supplies. Another freight industry lobby group, Logistics UK, said it was concerned about the welfare of drivers going from the UK to France, and said they should have access to regular testing. It appealed for calm from shoppers, and said it was ""maintaining close contact with UK government to ensure that supplies of fresh produce are available throughout Christmas and the new year"". The government does not think the restrictions will affect the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines to the UK, the transport secretary has told the BBC. Despite assurances that plenty of food will be available, some shoppers found empty shelves late on Monday Grant Shapps also refused to delay the end of the Brexit transition process, following calls from Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to extend it as the UK dealt with the new coronavirus variant. Mr Shapps said the date had been known about for a ""long time"" and changing it would ""add fuel to the fire"". ""The important thing is that businesses continue to prepare, that individuals are prepared,"" he said. However, Labour's Rachel Reeves, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, called the latest developments ""deeply worrying"". ""The country needs to hear credible plans and reassurance that essential supplies will be safeguarded, including our NHS, supermarkets and manufacturers with crucial supply chains,"" she said. The current transition period is due to expire at the end of the year and the EU and UK are still negotiating a trade deal. Without it both sides will have to collect expensive tariffs that the Office for Budget Responsibility says could harm the UK's economy.

NI Executive meeting over GB-NI travel ban,"A NI Executive meeting is under way to consider a paper on whether to impose a travel ban from GB. Earlier, the deputy first minister said the executive must meet to agree a ban as ""we are facing a grave situation"". The health minister took advice from the Attorney General and set out that in a paper to the executive. It is understood Robin Swann has recommended issuing guidance advising against non-essential travel between NI and GB, and NI and the Irish Republic. The minister has also advised that people arriving into Northern Ireland should self-isolate for 10 days. It is understood Sinn FÃ©in Finance Minister Conor Murphy has now written to Mr Swann expressing ""dismay and astonishment"" that he is not moving immediately to instigate a ban on travel between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. He has called on Mr Swann to reconsider his approach. Mr Swann's paper also makes the case for progressing work regarding any changes in the law needed to impose a ban - Mr Murphy has called on the minister to ""move urgently"" to complete this, in order to introduce a ban. More than 40 countries, including the Republic of Ireland, havebanned UK arrivals because of concerns about the spread of a new variant of coronavirus. Earlier the first minister said it is ""probable""the variantis already in NI. Arlene Foster said four cases in NI were being tested to determine if they are the new highly infectious variant. The executive was already scheduled to meet on Tuesday morning to discuss the end of the EU exit transition period on 31 December. On Sunday, the executive agreed so-called Christmas bubbles should be limited to one day. The move followed action inEngland, Scotland and Wales on Saturday, cutting the previously agreed five days to just one.. Another seven coronavirus-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland on Monday. TheDepartment of Health's death toll is 1,203,external. There were also a further 555 cases of Covid-19 diagnosed. There are 446 people with Covid-19 in hospital. Thirty are in intensive care, with 24 on ventilators. A new six-week lockdown for Northern Ireland comesinto force at 00:01 GMT on 26 December. Ministers met remotely on Sunday night to discussthe impact of the variant on Christmas rules. The executivesaid there would be flexibility on which day between 23 and 27 December people come together,external, to accommodate those working on Christmas Day. That meeting also discussed travel from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but nothing was agreed. Irish Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said the ban on travel from Britain to the Republic of Ireland was initially for 48 hours, but added he did not want to give anyone ""false hope that there is likely to be any major change"". No border controls would be set up on the Irish border, he added. European nations have begun to impose travel bans on the UK after it reported a more-infectious and ""out of control"" coronavirus variant Mr Ryan said his government would be making concerns about the lack of a GB-NI travel ban known, although it would be up to Stormont to decide what to do. On Monday, the Irish government said there would be at least two consular flights departing on Tuesday evening to bring Irish residents home. BBC News NI has asked if this would include people in Northern Ireland who have an Irish passport. In a statement, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said ""two specific and limited categories of people"" were included. These are international travellers to Ireland who are transiting through Great Britain and Irish people ""currently on short trips to Great Britain"" or who have travelled to Great Britain for ""emergency medical treatment"". In the Republic of Ireland, there were 727 new cases reported on Monday. The number of deaths linked to the virus is unchanged at 2,158. At Sunday's executive meeting, Sinn FÃ©in had proposed prohibiting travel from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, and said this should be a priority. The party wants the health minister to use powers from the 1967 Public Health Act to impose a ban on people entering from Great Britain. But Mrs Foster said such a blanket ban was not a simple matter, would have ""downside consequences"" and that the executive would take legal advice from the attorney general on it. She also said those living inthe most infected areas are already prohibited from travelling, although she recognised some would try to ""game"" the regulations. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? How Northern Ireland's new restrictions affect you Who can you have in your bubble? ""There is a travel ban in place - it covers about 17m people in England, those people can't come to Northern Ireland,"" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. Mrs Foster said the new bubble rules would be placed in law, but added that she did not expect police to be ""knocking on people's doors on Christmas Day or Boxing Day to check they are abiding by the law"". She said the four possible cases of the new variant under examination had ""different sequencing"" from other cases. If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of theBBC websiteto submit your question on this topic. On Sunday, four of the five main Stormont parties asked for an urgent executive meeting. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance sent a joint letter to the first and deputy first ministers asking to meet. In the letter, the parties said they must satisfy themselves that the Christmas restrictions and the six-week lockdown from 26 December were sufficiently robust to safeguard public health. It is understood health minister and UUP member Robin Swann sent a separate letter with similar concerns.

Agent 'tricked into detailing Navalny murder bid',"Mr Navalny is recovering after weeks in intensive care Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny duped a Russian FSB state agent into revealing details of an attack on him with the nerve agent Novichok, the investigative group Bellingcat reports. Mr Navalny reportedly impersonated a security official to call the agent. The agent, Konstantin Kudryavtsev, told him the Novichok had been placed in a pair of Mr Navalny's underpants. Mr Navalny, who is still recovering in Berlin, posteda recording of the long conversation on his YouTube channel,external. He collapsed on board a Russian airliner in August in the attack, which nearly proved fatal. As part of Mr Navalny's ruse to elicit more details of the assassination attempt,Bellingcat says the call,externalto Mr Kudryavtsev was set up to indicate it was coming from a Federal Security Service (FSB) landline. In the conversation, Mr Navalny posed as a senior official seeking details for a report on the FSB operation. Mr Kudryavtsev told him the swift response of the airline pilot and the emergency medical team in Omsk, Siberia - where Mr Navalny was first treated - could have been the reason for the failure to kill him. Two hours that saved Russian opposition leader's life Mr Kudryavtsev said he had been sent to Omsk later to seize Mr Navalny's clothes and remove all traces of Novichok from them. The BBC's Steven Rosenberg, in Moscow, says publication of the recording will be a huge embarrassment for the Kremlin, which continues to deny any link between the Russian state and poisoning of President Putin's most vocal critic. Last week Mr Putin told a huge TV audience that the Bellingcat investigation - carried out with other Western media partners - was a ""trick"" invented by US intelligence. But he added that it was right for the FSB to be shadowing Mr Navalny. The Bellingcat report last week named several FSB agents - chemical weapons specialists - who, it alleged, had been tailing him for years before the attempt on his life. Report names 'Russian agents' in Navalny poisoning Putin calls Navalny poisoning inquiry 'a trick' Mr Navalny has millions of followers on social media, where he denounces Mr Putin's United Russia party as deeply corrupt and full of ""crooks and thieves"". He says Mr Putin runs a ""feudal"" system of patronage ""sucking the blood out of Russia"". In the summer, before the August poisoning, Mr Navalny campaigned to get several of his supporters elected to councils in Siberia.

British backpacker's killer guilty of more attacks,"Grace Millane's family described her as ""our sunshine"" The man who murdered British backpacker Grace Millane in New Zealand has been convicted of sex attacks on two more women. Jesse Kempson, 28, can now be named after acourt order banning his identification was lifted,external. In February, he was jailed for a minimum of 17 years for murdering Miss Millane in his hotel room in Auckland in December 2018. The Millane family said they ""do not think about him or speak his name"". In October, Kempson was convicted of eight charges relating to various attacks including using a knife against a woman between November 2016 and April 2017. The woman said ""something inside of him snapped"" when he ""got angry"" and said he had held a knife ""to my throat"". In November, Kempson was convicted by a separate judge sitting alone of raping another woman on their first and only date in April 2018. She told the court: ""I was just frozen and I let him do what he needed to do so I could try and go to sleep or go home as soon as possible."" Jesse Kempson was seen buying a suitcase he used to conceal Miss Millane's body Kempson, who had worked in various sales jobs, met both of the women through the dating app Tinder, as he had Miss Millane. The 11-year jail term for these nine offences - all committed while he was living in Auckland - will be served concurrently with his sentence for Miss Millane's murder. On Friday,Kempson's appeal against his conviction and sentencefor Miss Millane's murder was dismissed Now those cases are complete, the Court of Appeal has been able to lift an order banning Kempson from being identified. Kempson can now be identified after a court order was lifted Concern had grown for the welfare of Miss Millane, from Wickford in Essex, in December 2018 when she failed to respond to friends and family wishing her a happy 22nd birthday. Within days of her disappearance, police had identified Kempson as the prime suspect and managed to track his movements by trawling through CCTV. Miss Millane's body was discovered in the mountainous WaitÄkere Ranges, having been stuffed into a suitcase by Kempson and buried. 'I went on a date with Grace Millane's killer' The murder trial that gripped a nation Backpacker's family welcome 'rough sex' defence ban The killing prompted New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to apologise to Ms Millane's parents David and Gillian, saying: ""Your daughter should have been safe here; she wasn't and I'm sorry for that."" During the murder trial in Auckland in 2019, the 12-person jury was shown footage of Miss Millane and Kempson seemingly enjoying each others' company around the city on a date. They were seen on CCTV returning to his hotel, CityLife, where Kempson later strangled Miss Millane in his room. When Miss Millane did not respond to birthday messages, her family issued an appeal on social media In a statement, the Millane family said the suppression of Kempson's name had ""allowed people to remember Grace - a young, vibrant girl who set out to see the world, instead of the man who took her life"". ""To use his name shows we care and gives him the notoriety he seeks,"" they added. ""We instead choose to speak Grace's name."" Miss Millane's murder prompted an outpouring of grief in New Zealand For much of his three-week trial for the murder of Grace Millane, Jesse Kempson looked stony-faced, occasionally glancing down at the court papers in the dock and turning a page. At times, when the evidence was particularly graphic, he would hold his head in his hands. When the verdict was delivered, Kempson stared straight ahead, before being sent out of the courtroom for a few minutes. He returned, red-faced and rubbing his eyes as if he had been crying - a rare glimpse of emotion, perhaps. But part of you could not help feel it was all a performance. In his police interviews he had reeled off a litany of lies, about not just about his own actions but those of Miss Millane, until he was confronted with evidence to the contrary. The jury's verdict was the rejection of his ultimate lie - one he had hoped to get away with. New Zealand law expert Chris Gallavin said ""name suppression"" was more often used to protect victims or the families of defendants. ""In this circumstance, it's actually name suppression to protect the fair trial rights of the accused,"" he said. The order remained in place because of the further accusations faced by Kempson, and was only lifted after his appeal was rejected.

Visitors from tier 4 and Wales 'must self-isolate',"The new rules apply to people travelling from Wales and tier-four areas People travelling from tier-four areas to other parts of England are being asked to ""assume"" they have the new coronavirus variant and self-isolate. Health officials said anyone who has come from a tier-four area or Wales to parts of the West Midlands and North West should stay at home for 10 days. No visitors are allowed to a house where someone is isolating, even on Christmas Day, the statement said. People who test negative are also being told to self-isolate. Statements were issued by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and the West Midlands Conurbation Local Resilience Forum, the latter of which said it applied to people travelling to the region on or since 18 December. They said the new advice followed the emergence of the new variant of coronavirus, which had seen a ""very rapid increase in cases in London and parts of the South East and East of England"". ""Although our region is not in tier four, rates are increasing and it is highly likely that the new variant is circulating,"" the West Midlands statement said. It also told people to change Christmas plans as much as possible and only to meet with those in their bubble. ""Other people who live in the house do not need to self-isolate unless they get symptoms but no visitors should be allowed in that house at all, even on Christmas Day."" What is tier four and who is in it? What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Dominic Harrison, director of public health for the Lancashire authority of Blackburn with Darwen, told BBC Lancashire that anyone who had travelled from a tier-four area since Wednesday should self-isolate for at least five days. The guidance also calls on those who have symptoms to get tested and self-isolate for 10 days, without waiting for results. Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, the director of public health in Tameside, Greater Manchester, said the variant's spread was ""extremely worrying"". Other parts of England, including Doncaster and Telford, have issued similar guidance. Wales entered lockdown on Sunday, with new restrictions covering the Christmas period. Hundreds of people are thought to have contracted the new variant, First Minister Mark Drakeford said. Kathryn Stanczyszyn, BBC Midlands Anyone who has arrived from tier four or Wales since Friday is being asked to self-isolate immediately The rate of coronavirus hospital admissions in the West Midlands has been among the highest in the country - and the last thing the region needs is a more transmissible strain on the rampage. Public health bosses admit, though, it's already here. Today's message is about trying to mitigate the impact of that. That message is basically that if you've come from a tier-four area in recent days, act like you've got the virus. And stay at home. How far people will follow this is another matter. It's not a legal requirement, but it's been described to me as ""the strongest possible advice"". Of course Christmas plans are already in the balance for many. This is another blow, but one that it's felt is entirely necessary as this Covid winter really kicks in. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, said public health directors in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands ""need to make decisions"" as they have a ""role to make sure their local population is looked after"" and they're ""doing a fantastic job."" He also warned it was ""likely measures will need to be increased in some places in due course."" Much of the West Midlands and North West is in tier three, with Burnley in Lancashire having the highest rate of infection in the two areas, with 437.5 new cases per 100,000 people in the week up to 17 December. Stoke-on-Trent has the highest rate of infection in the West Midlands, with 340.5 new infections. Birmingham Bolton Bury Coventry Doncaster Dudley Manchester Oldham Rochdale Salford Sandwell Sheffield Shropshire Solihull Staffordshire Stockport Stoke-on-Trent Tameside Telford and Wrekin Trafford Walsall Warwickshire Wigan Wolverhampton Worcestershire Anyone arriving in the Liverpool city region has been told to get a coronavirus test, which is available in all six local authority areas. A deserted Oxford street in London, which is currently subject to tier-four restrictions If you live in a tier-four area, you must not leave or be outside of the place you are living unless you have a reasonable excuse. You cannot meet other people indoors, including over the Christmas period, unless you live with them, or they are part of your support bubble. Outdoors, you can only meet one person from another household. These rules will not be relaxed for Christmas for tier four - you cannot form a Christmas bubble in tier four.

NHS in Wales 'stretched to limit' by Covid,"This video can not be played Ministers ""not slow"" to act on Christmas changes NHS staff are ""stretched to their limit"" as hospitals try to cope with more than 2,300 Covid patients, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said critical care units were ""operating far beyond their normal capacity"". A Welsh Government briefing revealed there were more than 100 deaths with Covid-19 reported over the weekend. It comes asthe new variant of the virus as been found ""all over Wales""- with at least 600 cases. ""Unless we can regain some control of the spread of coronavirus, I am sorry to say we will see more deaths,"" said Mr Drakeford. Figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest 28% of sample swabs taken in the second week of December were the new variant of the virus. Wales' deputy chief medical officer Dr Chris Jones said public health colleagues ""feel this new strain could be causing up to 60%"" of Covid infections in Wales. ""This new variant looks very likely to be the significant driver of the huge growth in cases we've seen in Wales in recent weeks,"" he said. Public Health Wales said there had been 2,563 further cases of coronavirus recorded in Wales on Sunday, with 10 deaths with Covid-19 confirmed. It means 3,125 have now died with the virus. Dr Jones added: ""It is clear that the public health situation has been a cause for concern for some weeks. ""But the issue of the new virus variant is very, very recent indeed. ""We only need to know about such variants when they take off, and that only became clear at the end of last week."" New coronavirus variant: what does it mean? New rules for Wales at Christmas - what they are How does Wales compare with the rest of UK? The highest numbers of patients yet with coronavirus in hospitals - 2,310 across Wales, a 16% rise on the week before More than 620 are patients recovering, but too sick to be discharged The average for daily admissions is at a level not seen since early June There were 93 Covid patients on ventilation or in critical care on Sunday, according to NHS Wales. This is down from the end of last week, when it was the highest level since the end of April, but it is still above the usual capacity The proportion of patients consulting their GP about Covid symptoms is at its highest level since April Addressing the briefing, the First Minister Mark Drakeford defended imposing stricter restrictions on Wales at the weekend. Mr Drakeford said new knowledge had emerged, which required action. Wales was placedin the new alert level four on Saturday, effectively locking down Wales over Christmas. ""I don't think it would be a fair thing to say at all that we have been slow to act, we have acted in response to the views of clinicians in response to the rising cases,"" said the first minister. ""What was different this weekend was that we had a new explanation for why we are seeing the rate of increase here in Wales - this new variant with its transmissibility, the speed with which it spreads. ""And that's why we had to bring forward our plans for a tier four set of restrictions across Wales."" This video can not be played Covid: Watch how case rates have changed in Wales He also said talks were being held with trade unions in a bid to ensure those working on Christmas Day will still get to see their family. If follows a letter from Rhondda Senedd member Leanne Wood urging key workers to be allowed to meet loved ones on the following day. Under the new restrictions, you are only able to travel to meet one other household - and a single person household - on Christmas Day anywhere in Wales. ""Of course there will be people who will be working on Christmas Day to allow the rest of us to be able to have that day to be with a small number of other members of our family,"" said Mr Drakeford. ""We are discussing with the TUC and others whether it would be possible to offer those people who are working on that day any compensatory arrangements."" Following what was the final coronavirus briefing from the Welsh Government before Christmas, officials confirmed the first minister has developed a cold, but had a precautionary Covid-19 test, which was negative for the virus. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Paul Davies, has called on Mr Drakeford to recall the parliament. ""I've had numerous emails over the last few days - bewildered a little bit why these restrictions were introduced very, very quickly,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iowerth said: ""It struck us last week, if things were so serious, that the Welsh Government were saying we needed to move into level four, why wait 10 days in order to bring in that level four? ""We can look back at this and ask whether this could have been done quicker.""

Covid outbreak declared at DVLA centre,"The Swansea contact centre has seen more than 300 Covid cases since September A coronavirus outbreak has been declared at the UK vehicle licensing agency's contact centre in Swansea. Public Health Wales says there have been 352 cases of Covid-19 at the DVLA centre at Swansea Vale in Llansamlet since September. Sixty-two cases have been identified at the call centre since the beginning of December. Staff are being asked to get tested for the virus at the site over the next two days. Health officials said it was ""inevitable"" to see spread in the workplace as cases of Covid in the community increased. But the level of infections at the centre has prompted intervention. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? New rules for Wales at Christmas - what they are How does Wales compare with the rest of UK? The Swansea Bay University Health Board has set up a testing facility at the Sandringham Park site, and is continuing to work with the DVLA to manage the outbreak.

More than 40 countries ban UK arrivals over Covid,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""British supermarkets say supply chain is strong and robust"". More than 40 countries have banned UK arrivals because of concerns about the spread of a new variant of coronavirus. Flights from the UK are beingsuspendedto territories across the world including Spain, India and Hong Kong. France shut its border with the UK for 48 hours, meaning no lorries or ferries can leave from the port of Dover. Boris Johnson said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron and both sides wanted to resolve ""these problems as fast as possible"". The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference: ""We had a very good call and we both understand each other's positions."" Mr Johnson, who earlier chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee, added: ""We are working with our friends across the Channel to unblock the flow of trade."" And French Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune said they would announce on Tuesday what measures were being introduced ""after this phase of emergency and harsh precaution that we had to take"". He said they would come into effect from Wednesday. European Union member states met earlier in Brussels to discuss a co-ordinated response, with officials suggesting a requirement for tests could be imposed on all people arriving from the UK. It came as the Northern Ireland Executive met on Monday night to considerwhether to impose a travel ban between NI and England, Scotland and Wales.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned that the new variant of the virus -which may be up to 70% more transmissible- is ""getting out of control"". The new variant has spread quickly in London and south-east England, but health officials say there is no evidence that it is more deadly or would react differently to vaccines. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the situation as a ""real emergency"",saying: ""The news over the last 24 hours has been deeply disturbing. The number of coronavirus cases has nearly doubled in the last week. ""We can have no more over-promising and false hope, confused messages and slow decision-making.

New variant: What do we know?,"The rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus has been blamed for the introduction of strict tier four mixing rules for millions of people, harsher restrictions on mixing at Christmas in England, Scotland and Wales, and other countries placing the UK on a travel ban. So how has it gone from being non-existent to the most common form of the virus in parts of England in a matter of months? The government's advisers on new infections now say they have ""high"" confidence that it is more able to transmit than other variants. All the work is at an early stage, contains huge uncertainties and a long list of unanswered questions. As I've written before,viruses mutate all the time and it's vital to keep a laser focuson whether the virus' behaviour is changing. Three things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London, which had only tier two restrictions until recently. But already the justification for tier four restrictions is in part to reduce the spread of the variant. ""Laboratory experiments are required, but do you want to wait weeks or months [to see the results and take action to limit the spread]? Probably not in these circumstances,"" Prof Nick Loman, from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, told me. It was first detected in September. In November around a quarter of cases in London were the new variant. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December. You can see how the variant has come to dominate the results of testing in some centres such as the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Laboratory. Allow Twitter content?

Mathematicians have been running the numbers on the spread of different variants in an attempt to calculate how much of an edge this one might have. But teasing apart what is due to people's behaviour and what is due to the virus is hard. The figure mentioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnson was that the variant may be up to 70% more transmissible. He said this may be increasing the R number - which indicates if an epidemic is growing or shrinking - by 0.4. That 70% number appearedin a presentation by Dr Erik Volz, from Imperial College London,external, on Friday. During the talk he said: ""It is really too early to tellâ¦ but from what we see so far it is growing very quickly, it is growing faster than [a previous variant] ever grew, but it is important to keep an eye on this."" There is no ""nailed on"" figure for how much more infectious the variant may be. Scientists, whose work is not yet public, have told me figures both much higher and much lower than 70%. But there remain questions about whether it is any more infectious at all. ""The amount of evidence in the public domain is woefully inadequate to draw strong or firm opinions on whether the virus has truly increased transmission,"" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham. It is thought the variant either emerged in a patient in the UK or has been imported from a country with a lower ability to monitor coronavirus mutations. The variant can be found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, the South East and eastern England. Cases elsewhere in the country do not seem to have taken off. Data from Nextstrain, which has been monitoring the genetic codes of the viral samples around the world, suggest cases in Denmark and Australia have come from the UK. The Netherlands has also reported cases. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A similar variant that has emerged in South Africa shares some of the same mutations, but appears to be unrelated to this one. Yes. The virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, is not the same one you will find in most corners of the world. TheD614G mutation emerged in Europe in February,externaland became the globally dominant form of the virus. Another, called A222V, spread across Europe andwas linked to people's summer holidays in Spain,external. An initial analysis of the new variant has been published andidentifies 17 potentially important alterations,external. There have been changes to the spike protein - this is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway to our body's cells. One mutation called N501Y alters the most important part of the spike, known as the ""receptor-binding domain"". This is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge. ""It looks and smells like an important adaptation,"" said Prof Loman. The other mutation - a H69/V70 deletion, in which a small part of the spike is removed - has emerged several times before, including famously in infected mink. Work by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge has suggested this mutation increases infectivity two-fold in lab experiments. Studies by the same group suggest the deletionmakes antibodies from the blood of survivors less effective at attacking the virus,external. Prof Gupta told me: ""It is rapidly increasing, that's what's worried government, we are worried, most scientists are worried."" The variant is unusually highly mutated. The most likely explanation is the variant has emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus. Instead their body became a breeding ground for the virus to mutate. There is no evidence to suggest that it does, although this will need to be monitored. However, just increasing transmission would be enough to cause problems for hospitals. If the new variant means more people are infected more quickly, that would in turn lead to more people needing hospital treatment. Almost certainly yes, or at least for now. All three leading vaccines develop an immune response against the existing spike, which is why the question comes up. Vaccines train the immune system to attack several different parts of the virus, so even though part of the spike has mutated, the vaccines should still work. ""But if we let it add more mutations, then you start worrying,"" said Prof Gupta. ""This virus is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape, it has taken the first couple of steps towards that."" Vaccine escape happens when the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine and continues to infect people. This may be the most concerning element of what is happening with the virus. This variant is just the latest to show the virus is continuing to adapt as it infects more and more of us. A presentation by Prof David Robertson, from the University of Glasgow on Friday, concluded: ""The virus will probably be able to generate vaccine escape mutants,external."" That would put us in a position similar to flu, where the vaccines need to be regularly updated. Fortunately the vaccines we have are very easy to tweak.

Passengers stranded as countries ban UK travel,"This video can not be played Only freight traffic is being allowed to cross the Irish Sea from Wales Passengers have been left stranded attempting to get in and out of Wales after several countries banned most UK travel over a new coronavirus variant. Bukola Sokunbi-Walton, from Galway, was travelling from London to spend Christmas with her children when her ferry from Holyhead was cancelled. Meanwhile, another man has been unable to return to mid Wales from the Liberian capital Monrovia. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonchaired an emergency meetingon Monday. After it finished, the Welsh Government said: ""On the impact of the travel bans imposed by European partners, the first minister updated the meeting on the current situation at Welsh ports. ""While traffic management plans are not needed at this point, the first minister made clear that arrangements with the Irish Republic were very important in sustaining that position."" EU mulls options as travel bans on UK expand New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Meanwhile, Toyota said it would close its engine factory in Deeside, Flintshire, two days earlier than planned for Christmas. It will now shut on Tuesday with bosses anticipating parts shortages because of disruption caused at ports. European Union member states are due to meet in Brusselsto discuss a co-ordinated response to the new coronavirus variant in the UK. The Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, France and Canada, have all suspended flights from the UK. Stena Line and Irish Ferries, which run routes from Wales to Ireland, have both banned passengers on Monday and Tuesday due to the Irish government's ban, with only freight and essential workers allowed to cross. Ms Sokunbi-Walton said she only found out about the ban when she arrived at Holyhead ferry terminal on Monday morning and said she was ""utterly gutted"" that she cannot get home for at least two days. Ferries have been running from Holyhead on Monday morning - but for freight and essential workers only She said: ""I just expected to get on the ferry as usual and go home because I have three children at home waiting for me, but it's very upsetting and disappointing that I can't do that right now. ""They [the Irish government] should have given us ample time to prepare for that, at least given us information so that we would know what to do. If we had found out earlier we wouldn't have driven all the way [from London] - we would've waited for the 48 hours before coming here. ""It's very tiring. We don't have any accommodation here, we're sitting out in the car, it's coldâ¦ it's really a tough time."" While Ms Sokunbi-Walton is trying to leave Wales, others are struggling to get back as a result of the new restrictions. Les Banks Irvine, who lives in Monrovia, Liberia, was trying to get back to mid Wales where his two children and three grandchildren live. But he said he was told he could not board his flight to Belgium, as his connecting flight was taking him to the UK. Les Banks Irvine has been unable to return to Wales to see his family He said: ""There's a great deal of not-knowing. I'm sure it is for everybody. ""I was hoping to be spending some time with my two children and three grandchildren in mid Wales, but it now looks like I am stranded here in Monrovia. ""I'm working for a company who bottle Coca-Cola. I've been here for about nine months this year. I last saw my family at the end of August."" Stena Vinga arrived at Fishguard on Monday morning Irish Ferries, which has passenger routes between Holyhead and Dublin, and Pembroke Dock and Rosslare, said essential travel ""is permitted"", but travellers are ""advised to keep all necessary stops to a minimum and minimise contact with people as much as possible"". Stena Line has imposed similar rules on its crossings between Holyhead and Dublin, as well as Fishguard to Rosslare. A spokesman said that the company had managed to contact almost all passengers since the travel restrictions were imposed, meaning very few had turned up at the ports. ""The ferries are still operating and freight isn't affected by the restrictions.  We're in close contact with any affected passengers,"" he said. The Irish government said: ""Arrangements are being put in place to facilitate the repatriation of Irish residents on short trips to Great Britain and planning to return in the coming days, as well as international travellers to Ireland who are transiting through Great Britain.""

Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check With some of the most populous countries across Africa seeing increases in Covid-19 cases, there've been concerns that the continent is facing another spike in infections. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has talked of a ""second wave"" arriving. And there's evidence that a new variant of coronavirus in South Africa may be driving increases there. The country now accounts for more than 60% of daily new cases detected in sub-Saharan Africa. But there are significant variations across the continent, with some countries seeing small or localised spikes, others witnessing more sustained increases and some not yet past an initial rise in cases. Find out morehere. Coronavirus cases are now rising fast again in the UK, driven by a new variant of the virus thought to be much more easily transmissible than other strains. As we heard earlier, a further 33,364 confirmed cases have been announced by the government today. You can see how many cases there are in your areahere. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The Swiss government has said all UK citizens who arrived in
Switzerland after 14 December must immediately quarantine. Entry
for UK citizens by air or land is now prohibited, following a suspension of all
air connections at midnight last night. The government says the measures are
intended to prevent, as much as possible, the spread of the new strain of Covid-19. Thousands of UK citizens have arrived in Switzerland over
the last few days, primarily to take advantage of the open ski slopes over the
holiday season. Geneva airport registered 10,000 UK arrivals this last weekend
alone. The prime minister hosted a press conference a short time ago, alongside Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the key points: Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent The quick approval of the vaccine was a real historic achievement, EMA CEO Emer Cooke said The
European Medicines Agency (EMA) has given the green light for the
Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine to be rolled out within the EU. The
Amsterdam-based regulator brought the decision forward by eight days under
pressure from EU states, after the UK and the US approved the jab more
quickly. This is not a silver bullet, EMA Director Emer Cooke
conceded, but she said recommending the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use across
the EU was ""a step in the right direction... providing citizens have
enough confidence to get vaccinated"". With millions of people's health at stake, the EMA described the
approval of a vaccine within 11 weeks rather than a year as an historic
achievement. Some 43,000 people were involved in one of
the largest trials ever conducted; the EMA's human medicines committee
concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks. With regards to the effectiveness against mutated strains of the
virus, EMA scientists say it is very likely the vaccine will
retain protection against the new variant detected in England. The decision paves the way for EU countries to start
rolling out their mass vaccination programmes within days. Pakistanhas joined dozens of countries in introducing UK travel restrictions following the idenitification of a new strain of coronavirus. The week-long ban on travel to or from the UK begins on Wednesday and applies to all travellers coming from the UK or who have been in the country over the past 10 days. Some exceptions do apply, however, with Pakistani nationals in the UK on visitor or temporary visas permitted to return if they provide a negative test 72 hours before travel, undergo another test upon arrival and quarantine at home for seven days afterwards. Other countries that have introduced UK travel restrictions include:  Find out more about the restrictionshere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is clear the
new variant will lead to tougher restrictions being introduced. The UK's chief
scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, admitted so in the TV briefing. There
is now a high degree of confidence it is leading to faster transmission - although
there is no evidence it causes more serious illness or would disrupt the
effectiveness of the vaccine. But with
infection rates rising rapidly, there is already talk
behind the scenes of more areas in the southern England going into tier four. But with the new variant seeded across the country it
only seems a matter of time before other regions follow suit. Questions are
also being asked about schools. The prime minister said he wanted to keep them
open ""if we possibly can"". The race to vaccinate the vulnerable just got even
more pressing. Greater Manchester's directors of public health are asking anyone who has travelled to the region from any tier four area or Wales to act as if they have the new variant of Covid-19 and self-isolate for at least 10 days when they arrive ""even if they have no symptoms"". The 10 days should start from 19 December and those self-isolating should remain inside the place where theyâre staying for the entire period. ""Other people in the house do not need to self isolate but no visitors should be allowed in that house at all, even on Christmas Day,"" said Jeanelle de Gruchy, who is director of Public Health in Tameside. ""If, during that time, anyone in the house gets symptoms, they must all isolate and the person with symptoms get a test straight away."" Dr de Gruchy described the new coronavirus variant as ""extremely worrying"" because of its ""incredibly infectious"" nature. ""Itâs more important than ever that we all put in that extra effort to keep our friends and families safe in the coming weeks.â  David Hughes of PA asks the PM if he believes ""morale takes a hit"" when he ""overpromises but under-delivers"". He also asks what proportion of the 500,000 vaccines have gone to those in hospital hubs and those in care homes. Johnson replies that it is ""important to be realistic"". He adds that the UK ""is the first country to distribute a clinically approved vaccine"". ""I find that a reason for hope and confidence, I think you should too,"" he said. He also says the ""vast bulk of doses are going to the over-80s and the clinically vulnerable"" but promises to provide an update when there is more data. That is the final question and ends the press conference. Helen CattPolitical correspondent As expected, the prime minister and the transport secretary were keen to try to reassure people that they have things under control. Plans that have been worked on to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit are now being rolled out to deal with disruption caused by European reactions to the coronavirus variant in the UK. Although, as we were reminded in the questioning, the trade negotiations rumble on and those plans could be deployed again for their post-Brexit purpose in just a couple of weeks' time. In terms of solving the immediate issue and resuming usual service across the Channel, the prime minister appeared quite upbeat - even putting a timescale of ""the next few hours"" on resolving the situation. What will now be key is seeing if the reality can match that optimism. The PM is asked if ""lateral flow tests"" - using saliva swabs - should be self-administered by the public. He replies that it is up to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to decide. Sir Patrick Vallance says work has been done to look at the new coronavirus variant. The view that it's transmitting more readily has been ""reinforced"", he adds, meaning the tiering system is vital. There will be ""inevitable"" increases in cases over the next few weeks, as people mix more over Christmas, he says. Pippa Crerar of the Mirror asks why the whole country isn't in lockdown. She also asks why the PM keeps ""over promising and under delivering"". Sir Patrick Vallance says it is the case that the virus will spread more and adds that ""measures are going to need to be increased in due course not reduced"". Boris Johnson says keeping the country in perpetual lockdown would have been disastrous. ""We can look forward to a very different world from Easter onwards,"" he adds. The PM is asked whether he can guarantee schools in England will restart as planned next term. He says the government wants, ""if we possibly can"", to get term under way in a staggered way, as promised. Sir Patrick Vallance says measures to reduce contact between people are ""even more important"" now there is a new variant that spreads more rapidly. ITV's Robert Peston asks if the UK will get a trade deal with the EU. He also asks if tier three will be enough to keep the new variant in check outside London and the South East. Boris Johnson says the position on Brexit talks is ""unchanged"". He adds that if a deal isn't agreed, then trading on World Trade Organization rules ""would be more than satisfactory"". On the second question, Patrick Vallance says it is important take action on tiers on the basis of evidence and urges people to follow the rules whichever tier they are in. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asks how confident the PM is about getting delays through Dover and elsewhere under control. Boris Johnson says he had an ""excellent"" conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, who was keen to get the situation sorted out ""in a few hours"" if possible. The PM says both sides want to resolve ""these problems as fast as possible"". Sir Patrick Vallance says the new coronavirus variant exists, to some extent, in all parts of the country. But people should ""stay local"" to prevent its spread, he argues. Rachel from Kent asks if the PM will consider rolling out the vaccine more widely and to more age groups - given the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant. Boris Johnson says it is ""sensible"" to stick to the plan of beginning vaccinations with those who are particularly vulnerable. Asked why the whole South East of England is not under the strictest tier 4 conditions, the PM says the government ""has to act"" on information about where the new coronavirus is most common and spreading. The situation will be kept under review, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Two found guilty of killing 39 migrants in lorryProsecutors said the victims died in ""unbearable"" heat in a lorry container in October 2019.Essex","Gheorghe Nica and Eamonn Harrison were both found guilty of manslaughter Two men have been found guilty of the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese migrants found dead in a lorry trailer in Essex. The migrants suffocated in the sealed container en route from Zeebrugge to Purfleet in October 2019. Eamonn Harrison, 24, who dropped off the trailer at the Belgian port, and people-smuggler Gheorghe Nica, 43, were convicted by an Old Bailey jury. Two others were convicted of being part of a wider people-smuggling conspiracy. The 39 people who died in the back of a trailer as it crossed the North Sea between Zeebrugge and the UK The trial examined three smuggling attempts by the gang - two that were successful on 11 and 18 October, and the final trip on 23 October. Lorry driver Christopher Kennedy, 24, from County Armagh, collected the trailers from Purfleet on the earlier two runs, claiming he thought he was transporting cigarettes. But the jury found Kennedy and Valentin Calota, 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. During the trial, jurors were given a snapshot of the victims - who included a bricklayer, a university graduate and a nailbar technician - and their dreams of a better life. Many of their families borrowed heavily to fund their passage, relying on their potential future earnings once they got into the UK. The supposed 'VIP' journey that killed 39 people Irish smuggling connection to Essex lorry deaths Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten, from Essex Police, said: ""If you look at the method, the way they transported human beings... we wouldn't transport animals in that way."" Another two men - Irish haulage boss Ronan Hughes, 41, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, Ireland, and 26-year-old lorry driver Maurice Robinson - had previously admitted manslaughter. Home Secretary Priti Patel described the deaths as a ""truly tragic incident"". Christopher Kennedy was found guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration Prosecutors said in the fatal run, the container became a ""tomb"" as temperatures in the unit reached an ""unbearable"" 38.5C (101F). The migrants, aged 15 to 44, were sealed inside for at least 12 hours. They had used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof, but only managed to dent the interior. Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones said: ""There was no way out, and no-one to hear them; no-one to help them."" Both Maurice Robinson (l) and Ronan Hughes (r) admitted 39 counts of manslaughter in connection with the case Harrison, of Newry, County Down, towed the trailer to Zeebrugge, from where it was transported to Purfleet. During the 10-week trial, he claimed he did not know there were people in the trailer and that he watched ""a wee bit of Netflix"" in bed as they were loaded on. He also said he had no idea there were migrants in two other trailers that he had dropped off at the same port in the previous 12 days. Robinson, from County Armagh, collected the trailer when it arrived on UK shores just after midnight on 23 October. His boss, Hughes, had messaged him: ""Give them air quickly don't let them out."". Robinson gave a thumbs-up in reply. But when Robinson stopped on a nearby industrial estate, he found that the migrants were all dead. The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October last year There was a series of telephone conversations between him and Hughes and Nica, of Basildon, Essex, before Robinson eventually dialled 999. In his evidence, Nica said Robinson told him: ""I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer."" Det Ch Insp Stoten said that many of the police officers who attended ""were really young in service"" and it was possibly the first time some had ever seen a dead person. He said he believed the ""absolutely horrendous scene"" would stay with those officers ""for the rest of their career and, quite probably, the rest of lives"". On all three runs, Nica had arranged cars and a van to transport the migrants at the UK end. Jurors were shown CCTV footage of him carrying a holdall of cash to Hughes's room at the Ibis hotel, Thurrock, early on 19 October. Ronan Hughes (left) meeting Gheorghe Nica at a budget hotel Nica admitted to conspiring to assist illegal immigration in the first two runs, but he insisted that he believed the third run was all to do with smuggling cigarettes. The mechanic told jurors he had been roped into people-smuggling, and said: ""I never wanted to be involved in this kind of job."" The day after the bodies were found, Nica travelled to Romania, claiming he was ""scared"" of a ""big, big investigation"", but prosecutors said the defendant's version of events was ""ridiculous"". Det Ch Insp Stoten said the gang stood to make between Â£10,000 and Â£12,000 per person transported, ""the lion's share of which would have gone to Ronan Hughes and Gheorghe Nica"". CCTV footage from Orsett Golf Club of a lorry on 11 October 2019 The jury had heard that on 14 October, between the two successful runs, Kennedy was found at the French end of the Channel Tunnel with 20 Vietnamese migrants in his trailer. At least two of those people ended up dying in the fatal run. Police believe the smugglers had ""doubled-up"" the load on 23 October because of the problem on 14 October, and that was what led to the deaths. This gang had been smuggling people for months and months, the Old Bailey heard. On the first of several successful runs on the same route, a couple, Marie Andrews and Stewart Cox, saw people getting out of a van on a country lane in Orsett, Essex, and dialled 999. Police attended but did not seize CCTV footage from the nearby golf course, in which a lorry and other vehicles were seen on the lane. If, perhaps, Essex Police had managed to get to that footage, follow it up and identify some of the vehicles before the fatal run 12 days later, then this gang might possibly have been disrupted before these 39 people died. Asked about that, the force said it could only allocate the resources available at the time. But it says that now, if there are ever reports of people in the back of a lorry and the driver is present, the driver will be arrested. Dinh Dinh Binh - from Hai Phong - was one of two 15-year-olds to die in the container Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Hobart Road, Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Barclay Road, Tottenham, north London, had earlier admitted assisting unlawful immigration linked to the case. Mr Justice Sweeney adjourned sentencing of all the defendants to 7, 8 and 11 January. Ms Patel said her ""thoughts remain with those affected by this tragedy"". ""Today's convictions only strengthen my resolve to do all I can to go after the people-smugglers who prey on the vulnerable and trade in human misery,"" she added.

Greater Manchester's directors of public health are asking anyone who has travelled to the region from any tier four area or Wales to act as if they have the new variant of Covid-19 and self-isolate for at least 10 days when they arrive ""even if they have no symptoms"". The 10 days should start from 19 December and those self-isolating should remain inside the place where theyâre staying for the entire period. ""Other people in the house do not need to self isolate but no visitors should be allowed in that house at all, even on Christmas Day,"" said Jeanelle de Gruchy, who is director of Public Health in Tameside. ""If, during that time, anyone in the house gets symptoms, they must all isolate and the person with symptoms get a test straight away."" Dr de Gruchy described the new coronavirus variant as ""extremely worrying"" because of its ""incredibly infectious"" nature. ""Itâs more important than ever that we all put in that extra effort to keep our friends and families safe in the coming weeks.â  David Hughes of PA asks the PM if he believes ""morale takes a hit"" when he ""overpromises but under-delivers"". He also asks what proportion of the 500,000 vaccines have gone to those in hospital hubs and those in care homes. Johnson replies that it is ""important to be realistic"". He adds that the UK ""is the first country to distribute a clinically approved vaccine"". ""I find that a reason for hope and confidence, I think you should too,"" he said. He also says the ""vast bulk of doses are going to the over-80s and the clinically vulnerable"" but promises to provide an update when there is more data. That is the final question and ends the press conference. Helen CattPolitical correspondent As expected, the prime minister and the transport secretary were keen to try to reassure people that they have things under control. Plans that have been worked on to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit are now being rolled out to deal with disruption caused by European reactions to the coronavirus variant in the UK. Although, as we were reminded in the questioning, the trade negotiations rumble on and those plans could be deployed again for their post-Brexit purpose in just a couple of weeks' time. In terms of solving the immediate issue and resuming usual service across the Channel, the prime minister appeared quite upbeat - even putting a timescale of ""the next few hours"" on resolving the situation. What will now be key is seeing if the reality can match that optimism. The PM is asked if ""lateral flow tests"" - using saliva swabs - should be self-administered by the public. He replies that it is up to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to decide. Sir Patrick Vallance says work has been done to look at the new coronavirus variant. The view that it's transmitting more readily has been ""reinforced"", he adds, meaning the tiering system is vital. There will be ""inevitable"" increases in cases over the next few weeks, as people mix more over Christmas, he says. Pippa Crerar of the Mirror asks why the whole country isn't in lockdown. She also asks why the PM keeps ""over promising and under delivering"". Sir Patrick Vallance says it is the case that the virus will spread more and adds that ""measures are going to need to be increased in due course not reduced"". Boris Johnson says keeping the country in perpetual lockdown would have been disastrous. ""We can look forward to a very different world from Easter onwards,"" he adds. The PM is asked whether he can guarantee schools in England will restart as planned next term. He says the government wants, ""if we possibly can"", to get term under way in a staggered way, as promised. Sir Patrick Vallance says measures to reduce contact between people are ""even more important"" now there is a new variant that spreads more rapidly. ITV's Robert Peston asks if the UK will get a trade deal with the EU. He also asks if tier three will be enough to keep the new variant in check outside London and the South East. Boris Johnson says the position on Brexit talks is ""unchanged"". He adds that if a deal isn't agreed, then trading on World Trade Organization rules ""would be more than satisfactory"". On the second question, Patrick Vallance says it is important take action on tiers on the basis of evidence and urges people to follow the rules whichever tier they are in. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asks how confident the PM is about getting delays through Dover and elsewhere under control. Boris Johnson says he had an ""excellent"" conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, who was keen to get the situation sorted out ""in a few hours"" if possible. The PM says both sides want to resolve ""these problems as fast as possible"". Sir Patrick Vallance says the new coronavirus variant exists, to some extent, in all parts of the country. But people should ""stay local"" to prevent its spread, he argues. Rachel from Kent asks if the PM will consider rolling out the vaccine more widely and to more age groups - given the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant. Boris Johnson says it is ""sensible"" to stick to the plan of beginning vaccinations with those who are particularly vulnerable. Asked why the whole South East of England is not under the strictest tier 4 conditions, the PM says the government ""has to act"" on information about where the new coronavirus is most common and spreading. The situation will be kept under review, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Agent 'tricked into detailing Navalny murder bid'A new recording purports to reveal how Russian state agents poisoned Putin critic Alexei Navalny.Europe,"Mr Navalny is recovering after weeks in intensive care Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny duped a Russian FSB state agent into revealing details of an attack on him with the nerve agent Novichok, the investigative group Bellingcat reports. Mr Navalny reportedly impersonated a security official to call the agent. The agent, Konstantin Kudryavtsev, told him the Novichok had been placed in a pair of Mr Navalny's underpants. Mr Navalny, who is still recovering in Berlin, posteda recording of the long conversation on his YouTube channel,external. He collapsed on board a Russian airliner in August in the attack, which nearly proved fatal. As part of Mr Navalny's ruse to elicit more details of the assassination attempt,Bellingcat says the call,externalto Mr Kudryavtsev was set up to indicate it was coming from a Federal Security Service (FSB) landline. In the conversation, Mr Navalny posed as a senior official seeking details for a report on the FSB operation. Mr Kudryavtsev told him the swift response of the airline pilot and the emergency medical team in Omsk, Siberia - where Mr Navalny was first treated - could have been the reason for the failure to kill him. Two hours that saved Russian opposition leader's life Mr Kudryavtsev said he had been sent to Omsk later to seize Mr Navalny's clothes and remove all traces of Novichok from them. The BBC's Steven Rosenberg, in Moscow, says publication of the recording will be a huge embarrassment for the Kremlin, which continues to deny any link between the Russian state and poisoning of President Putin's most vocal critic. Last week Mr Putin told a huge TV audience that the Bellingcat investigation - carried out with other Western media partners - was a ""trick"" invented by US intelligence. But he added that it was right for the FSB to be shadowing Mr Navalny. The Bellingcat report last week named several FSB agents - chemical weapons specialists - who, it alleged, had been tailing him for years before the attempt on his life. Report names 'Russian agents' in Navalny poisoning Putin calls Navalny poisoning inquiry 'a trick' Mr Navalny has millions of followers on social media, where he denounces Mr Putin's United Russia party as deeply corrupt and full of ""crooks and thieves"". He says Mr Putin runs a ""feudal"" system of patronage ""sucking the blood out of Russia"". In the summer, before the August poisoning, Mr Navalny campaigned to get several of his supporters elected to councils in Siberia.

Travel bans on UK expand,"Numerous countries have introduced travel bans amid concerns over the new coronavirus variant EU officials are discussing a joint response to a new, more infectious Covid-19 variant in the UK, which has sparked travel bans by many countries. Canada and India joined European states in blocking flights from the UK while Europe-bound train services via the Channel Tunnel have been halted. The new variant is said to be up to 70% more transmissible, but there is no evidence that it is more deadly. There is also no proof to suggest that it reacts differently to vaccines. Live updates Two meetings are taking place in Brussels on Monday - one involving health ministers and another with the EU's crisis response team. But no decision is expected until Tuesday, when EU ambassadors meet. A French official told the BBC's Gavin Lee that they were desperate to reopen the borders ""as soon as safely possible"", with one option discussed being the requirement that UK travellers - including lorry drivers - prove they have had a recent negative Covid-19 test. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""British supermarkets say supply chain is strong and robust"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had an ""excellent"" conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron and was keen to find a solution ""in a few hours"". ""I want to stress we in the UK fully understand our friends' anxieties about the new variant. But it's also true that the risks of transmission sitting alone in the cab is very low. So we hope to make progress,"" he said. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier said the new variant was ""out of control"", while Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands announced they had already detected it. Following the discovery of case in Denmark, neighbouring Sweden banned all foreign travellers from there. Christmas 'in jeopardy' after ban on UK travellers Pound slides lower as European borders close to UK New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Also on Monday, the EU's medicines regulator approved the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccinefor use in all 27 member states. The vaccine is already being administered in the UK and in the US, and some European countries plan to begin administering doses from 27 December. Francesuspended all travel links, including freight lorries, with the UK for 48 hours from midnight (23:00 GMT) on Sunday. Thousands of lorries move between the countries every day.

The ferry terminal at Dover is now closed for all accompanied traffic leaving the UK until further noticebecause of the French restrictions. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson chaired a meeting of the emergency committee Cobra to discuss the issue on Monday. Other countries took different action in response to the new virus variant: Germany, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Bulgaria, Romania,Malta, Croatia, Lithuania, LatviaandEstoniaall suspended flights from the UK One of the most popular holiday destinations for UK citizens,Spain, also suspended flights Italyblocked all flights from the UK until 6 January, while theNetherlandsbanned all passenger flights from the UK until 1 January ""at the latest"".

In November it made up around a quarter of cases in London. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December. Three things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London. This variant is unusually highly mutated. The most likely explanation is it emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus. There is no evidence yet to suggest the variant makes the infection more deadly, and at least for now the developed vaccines will almost certainly work against it. However, if the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine, then ""vaccine escape"" happens, and this may be the most concerning element.

Can I meet family on Boxing Day? And other questions,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

Harrods mega-spender loses Supreme Court challengeSupreme Court says jailed banker's wife Zamira Hajiyeva can't appeal against Unexplained Wealth Order.UK,"The Supreme Court has rejected an attempt by a woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods to overturn the UK's first Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO). Zamira Hajiyeva, wife of a jailed banker, may now lose her Â£12m London home - and a separate golf course - if she can't explain her riches. The court said her challenge to the UWO raised no arguable point of law. Mrs Hajieyva's husband is in jail in Azerbaijan for embezzling millions of pounds from a state bank. Woman in Â£16m Harrods spend fights wealth seizure How to spend Â£16m in Harrods Offshore companies connected to the family own Mrs Hajiyeva's home on an exclusive street in Knightsbridge, as well as the Mill Ride golf course in Berkshire. Together they were worth more than Â£22m when the legal battle began in February 2018. Over the course of a decade, Mrs Hajiyeva spent Â£16m in Harrods - spending that formed part of the NCA's investigation into the sources of her wealth. Under a UWO, if a person cannot explain how they became legitimately rich, the courts can fast-track the seizure of their property, without investigators having even proven a crime. Mrs Hajiyeva has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with an offence in the UK. Last year a court blocked her potential extradition to Azerbaijan, saying she would not get a fair trial. Mrs Hajiyeva's home in Knightsbridge, a short walk from Harrods Her lawyers had petitioned the Supreme Court to consider her case, saying she had not been lawfully targeted by the NCA. That application has now been rejected without the court hearing the case at all - meaning that all her rights of appeal are now exhausted. Graeme Biggar, head of the National Economic Crime Centre at the NCA, said: ""This is a significant result which is important in establishing Unexplained Wealth Orders as a powerful tool for financial investigations. ""There are no further routes for Mrs Hajiyeva to appeal against the order. She will now be required to provide the NCA with the information we are seeking in connection with these assets."" Zamira Hajiyeva: Denies wrongdoing The NCA would have set a strict timetable for Mrs Hajiyeva to comply with that demand - but the Christmas period and the pandemic mean she may have until the end of the winter to provide full answers. Unexplained Wealth Orders, created in 2017, were trumpeted by the government as a major new tool in the fight against corrupt cash in the UK. One of the targets - a man believed to be money laundering fora major drugs gang- gave up fighting the NCA and handed over his property empire. Another family, part of Kazakhstan's ruling elite,won their caseagainst the NCA.

New coronavirus variant: What do we know?,"The rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus has been blamed for the introduction of strict tier four mixing rules for millions of people, harsher restrictions on mixing at Christmas in England, Scotland and Wales, and other countries placing the UK on a travel ban. So how has it gone from being non-existent to the most common form of the virus in parts of England in a matter of months? The government's advisers on new infections now say they have ""high"" confidence that it is more able to transmit than other variants. All the work is at an early stage, contains huge uncertainties and a long list of unanswered questions. As I've written before,viruses mutate all the time and it's vital to keep a laser focuson whether the virus' behaviour is changing. Three things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London, which had only tier two restrictions until recently. But already the justification for tier four restrictions is in part to reduce the spread of the variant. ""Laboratory experiments are required, but do you want to wait weeks or months [to see the results and take action to limit the spread]? Probably not in these circumstances,"" Prof Nick Loman, from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, told me. It was first detected in September. In November around a quarter of cases in London were the new variant. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December. You can see how the variant has come to dominate the results of testing in some centres such as the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Laboratory. Allow Twitter content?

Mathematicians have been running the numbers on the spread of different variants in an attempt to calculate how much of an edge this one might have. But teasing apart what is due to people's behaviour and what is due to the virus is hard. The figure mentioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnson was that the variant may be up to 70% more transmissible. He said this may be increasing the R number - which indicates if an epidemic is growing or shrinking - by 0.4. That 70% number appearedin a presentation by Dr Erik Volz, from Imperial College London,external, on Friday. During the talk he said: ""It is really too early to tellâ¦ but from what we see so far it is growing very quickly, it is growing faster than [a previous variant] ever grew, but it is important to keep an eye on this."" There is no ""nailed on"" figure for how much more infectious the variant may be. Scientists, whose work is not yet public, have told me figures both much higher and much lower than 70%. But there remain questions about whether it is any more infectious at all. ""The amount of evidence in the public domain is woefully inadequate to draw strong or firm opinions on whether the virus has truly increased transmission,"" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham. It is thought the variant either emerged in a patient in the UK or has been imported from a country with a lower ability to monitor coronavirus mutations. The variant can be found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, the South East and eastern England. Cases elsewhere in the country do not seem to have taken off. Data from Nextstrain, which has been monitoring the genetic codes of the viral samples around the world, suggest cases in Denmark and Australia have come from the UK. The Netherlands has also reported cases. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A similar variant that has emerged in South Africa shares some of the same mutations, but appears to be unrelated to this one. Yes. The virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, is not the same one you will find in most corners of the world. TheD614G mutation emerged in Europe in February,externaland became the globally dominant form of the virus. Another, called A222V, spread across Europe andwas linked to people's summer holidays in Spain,external. An initial analysis of the new variant has been published andidentifies 17 potentially important alterations,external. There have been changes to the spike protein - this is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway to our body's cells. One mutation called N501Y alters the most important part of the spike, known as the ""receptor-binding domain"". This is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge. ""It looks and smells like an important adaptation,"" said Prof Loman. The other mutation - a H69/V70 deletion, in which a small part of the spike is removed - has emerged several times before, including famously in infected mink. Work by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge has suggested this mutation increases infectivity two-fold in lab experiments. Studies by the same group suggest the deletionmakes antibodies from the blood of survivors less effective at attacking the virus,external. Prof Gupta told me: ""It is rapidly increasing, that's what's worried government, we are worried, most scientists are worried."" The variant is unusually highly mutated. The most likely explanation is the variant has emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus. Instead their body became a breeding ground for the virus to mutate. There is no evidence to suggest that it does, although this will need to be monitored. However, just increasing transmission would be enough to cause problems for hospitals. If the new variant means more people are infected more quickly, that would in turn lead to more people needing hospital treatment. Almost certainly yes, or at least for now. All three leading vaccines develop an immune response against the existing spike, which is why the question comes up. Vaccines train the immune system to attack several different parts of the virus, so even though part of the spike has mutated, the vaccines should still work. ""But if we let it add more mutations, then you start worrying,"" said Prof Gupta. ""This virus is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape, it has taken the first couple of steps towards that."" Vaccine escape happens when the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine and continues to infect people. This may be the most concerning element of what is happening with the virus. This variant is just the latest to show the virus is continuing to adapt as it infects more and more of us. A presentation by Prof David Robertson, from the University of Glasgow on Friday, concluded: ""The virus will probably be able to generate vaccine escape mutants,external.""

Visitors from tier 4 and Wales 'must self-isolate'Areas of England outside the south east say the new variant of Covid-19 is likely to be circulating.England,"The new rules apply to people travelling from Wales and tier-four areas People travelling from tier-four areas to other parts of England are being asked to ""assume"" they have the new coronavirus variant and self-isolate. Health officials said anyone who has come from a tier-four area or Wales to parts of the West Midlands and North West should stay at home for 10 days. No visitors are allowed to a house where someone is isolating, even on Christmas Day, the statement said. People who test negative are also being told to self-isolate. Statements were issued by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and the West Midlands Conurbation Local Resilience Forum, the latter of which said it applied to people travelling to the region on or since 18 December. They said the new advice followed the emergence of the new variant of coronavirus, which had seen a ""very rapid increase in cases in London and parts of the South East and East of England"". ""Although our region is not in tier four, rates are increasing and it is highly likely that the new variant is circulating,"" the West Midlands statement said. It also told people to change Christmas plans as much as possible and only to meet with those in their bubble. ""Other people who live in the house do not need to self-isolate unless they get symptoms but no visitors should be allowed in that house at all, even on Christmas Day."" What is tier four and who is in it? What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Dominic Harrison, director of public health for the Lancashire authority of Blackburn with Darwen, told BBC Lancashire that anyone who had travelled from a tier-four area since Wednesday should self-isolate for at least five days. The guidance also calls on those who have symptoms to get tested and self-isolate for 10 days, without waiting for results. Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, the director of public health in Tameside, Greater Manchester, said the variant's spread was ""extremely worrying"". Other parts of England, including Doncaster and Telford, have issued similar guidance. Wales entered lockdown on Sunday, with new restrictions covering the Christmas period. Hundreds of people are thought to have contracted the new variant, First Minister Mark Drakeford said. Kathryn Stanczyszyn, BBC Midlands Anyone who has arrived from tier four or Wales since Friday is being asked to self-isolate immediately The rate of coronavirus hospital admissions in the West Midlands has been among the highest in the country - and the last thing the region needs is a more transmissible strain on the rampage. Public health bosses admit, though, it's already here. Today's message is about trying to mitigate the impact of that. That message is basically that if you've come from a tier-four area in recent days, act like you've got the virus. And stay at home. How far people will follow this is another matter. It's not a legal requirement, but it's been described to me as ""the strongest possible advice"". Of course Christmas plans are already in the balance for many. This is another blow, but one that it's felt is entirely necessary as this Covid winter really kicks in. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, said public health directors in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands ""need to make decisions"" as they have a ""role to make sure their local population is looked after"" and they're ""doing a fantastic job."" He also warned it was ""likely measures will need to be increased in some places in due course."" Much of the West Midlands and North West is in tier three, with Burnley in Lancashire having the highest rate of infection in the two areas, with 437.5 new cases per 100,000 people in the week up to 17 December. Stoke-on-Trent has the highest rate of infection in the West Midlands, with 340.5 new infections. Birmingham Bolton Bury Coventry Doncaster Dudley Manchester Oldham Rochdale Salford Sandwell Sheffield Shropshire Solihull Staffordshire Stockport Stoke-on-Trent Tameside Telford and Wrekin Trafford Walsall Warwickshire Wigan Wolverhampton Worcestershire Anyone arriving in the Liverpool city region has been told to get a coronavirus test, which is available in all six local authority areas. A deserted Oxford street in London, which is currently subject to tier-four restrictions If you live in a tier-four area, you must not leave or be outside of the place you are living unless you have a reasonable excuse. You cannot meet other people indoors, including over the Christmas period, unless you live with them, or they are part of your support bubble. Outdoors, you can only meet one person from another household. These rules will not be relaxed for Christmas for tier four - you cannot form a Christmas bubble in tier four.

Refunds pledge for scrapped Christmas travel plans,"Everyone who has had to cancel a rail or coach journey in England between 23 and 27 December will be able to get a refund, the government has announced. It comes after the planned easing of Covid rules for Christmas was scrapped for large parts of south-east England. For the rest of the UK, the relaxation of the rules now applies only to Christmas Day. ""Passengers will not be left out of pocket for complying with the new Christmas rules,"" the government said. The policy was announced by the Department for Transport followingPrime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement on Saturdayof new Covid rules for Christmas. Christmas rules tightened for millions What is tier four and who is in it? What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""It is imperative that we all follow the new measures and play our part in tackling this virus, protecting others and safeguarding our NHS. ""If you booked a coach or rail journey between 23 and 27 December, you are entitled to a cash refund. This ensures no one is left out of pocket for doing the right thing - staying home in tier four, and elsewhere staying local and only meeting your Christmas bubble on Christmas day."" The government will provide cash refunds for domestic rail and coach tickets. This will apply to journeys in England booked on or after 24 November, when the now-scrapped Christmas travel window was announced. Operators will be able to issue refunds immediately and passengers are advised to check the website of their operator for how to claim. The government urged people to ""be patient"", as rail and coach operators will be processing high numbers of refunds over the coming weeks. ""This is the right call for rail and coach passengers - they will be relieved that they will not be penalised financially for following the rules,"" said Anthony Smith, chief executive of independent watchdog Transport Focus. ""Operators now need to make sure that their websites are crystal clear on how passengers can claim refunds, travel vouchers or make fee-free changes, depending on when they were due to travel.""

Harrods mega-spender loses Supreme Court challenge,"The Supreme Court has rejected an attempt by a woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods to overturn the UK's first Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO). Zamira Hajiyeva, wife of a jailed banker, may now lose her Â£12m London home - and a separate golf course - if she can't explain her riches. The court said her challenge to the UWO raised no arguable point of law. Mrs Hajieyva's husband is in jail in Azerbaijan for embezzling millions of pounds from a state bank. Woman in Â£16m Harrods spend fights wealth seizure How to spend Â£16m in Harrods Offshore companies connected to the family own Mrs Hajiyeva's home on an exclusive street in Knightsbridge, as well as the Mill Ride golf course in Berkshire. Together they were worth more than Â£22m when the legal battle began in February 2018. Over the course of a decade, Mrs Hajiyeva spent Â£16m in Harrods - spending that formed part of the NCA's investigation into the sources of her wealth. Under a UWO, if a person cannot explain how they became legitimately rich, the courts can fast-track the seizure of their property, without investigators having even proven a crime. Mrs Hajiyeva has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with an offence in the UK. Last year a court blocked her potential extradition to Azerbaijan, saying she would not get a fair trial. Mrs Hajiyeva's home in Knightsbridge, a short walk from Harrods Her lawyers had petitioned the Supreme Court to consider her case, saying she had not been lawfully targeted by the NCA. That application has now been rejected without the court hearing the case at all - meaning that all her rights of appeal are now exhausted. Graeme Biggar, head of the National Economic Crime Centre at the NCA, said: ""This is a significant result which is important in establishing Unexplained Wealth Orders as a powerful tool for financial investigations. ""There are no further routes for Mrs Hajiyeva to appeal against the order. She will now be required to provide the NCA with the information we are seeking in connection with these assets."" Zamira Hajiyeva: Denies wrongdoing The NCA would have set a strict timetable for Mrs Hajiyeva to comply with that demand - but the Christmas period and the pandemic mean she may have until the end of the winter to provide full answers. Unexplained Wealth Orders, created in 2017, were trumpeted by the government as a major new tool in the fight against corrupt cash in the UK. One of the targets - a man believed to be money laundering fora major drugs gang- gave up fighting the NCA and handed over his property empire. Another family, part of Kazakhstan's ruling elite,won their caseagainst the NCA.

Case for MP recall over Covid emergency - Starmer,"Boris Johnson should consider recalling MPs to debate the Covid ""emergency"" facing the UK, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said. But he added that it was more important for the prime minister to give the public daily updates on measures to limit the spread of infection. MPs from across the parties have urged the government to reopen Parliament so they can debate new Covid restrictions. The government says MPs will return if a Brexit trade deal is agreed. But it has ruled out recalling Parliament to debate the Covid situation - and tier 4 restrictions, which were introduced two days after Parliament had gone into Christmas recess, meaning a vote could not take place. A government spokesperson said: ""Whenever possible we have committed to allowing Parliament to vote on matters of national significance but we cannot hold up urgent regulations needed to control the virus and save lives."" Sainsbury's warns of shortages as France shuts border Brexit trade talks to continue at 'crucial moment' Brexit: Can the talks be extended? Sir Keir has backed the recall of Parliament to ratify any Brexit deal. Asked at a press conference in London, where he wasmaking a speech about Labour's devolution policies, if he would also back a recall to debate Covid, he said: ""I think there is a case to look at whether we should recall Parliament"". But he said it was more important that the prime minister gives daily updates on the crisis, as ""people need to know the way forward"". ""We cannot be in any doubt the virus is now out of control"" he added. ""Make no mistake, this is now a real emergency. Parliament closed for the Christmas break on Thursday, but events over the weekend have prompted MPs from across the parties to demand a return to Westminster. On Saturday, Mr Johnson announced that areas in London, Kent, Essex and Bedfordshire would be put into a new set of tier four restrictions - meaning people can not mix indoors with anyone not from their household. He also scrapped a planned relaxation of the rules over Christmas in the south-east of England, while restrictions were toughened up elsewhere in the UK. Some MPs want to debate the border situation, particularly in Kent, and others may want to call for an extension of the Brexit transition period; but wishes don't recall Parliament, ministers do. Specifically, a minister of the Crown must request the Speaker to recall MPs. The Speaker then considers whether this would be in the public interest (it's hard to imagine a situation where a minister would ask for a recall and the Speaker denied them). But the gaping hole in this process is that there is no mechanism for anybody but the government to bring Parliament back from a recess early. Read Mark's full blog Conservative MP Mark Harper - chair of the Covid Recovery Group, which is made up of around 50 Tory backbenchers - said the changes in England should ""be put to a vote in the Commons at the earliest opportunity, even if that means a recall of the House"". A number of other Conservatives called for a recall including Steve Baker, Tim Loughton and John Redwood, although others have not backed the idea. Writing on the Conservative Home website,,externalConservative William Wragg said ""The plain fact is this: Parliament debated and voted on the original rules that were to be in place to govern Christmas, along with the revamped tier system. Parliament should do the same for these new rules and additional tier."" This would mean the changes carried ""greater legitimacy among the public"", he added. People at St Pancras station in London, waiting to board the last train to Paris on Sunday Recall demands have also been driven by France's decision to close its border with the UK for 48 hours over fears of the spread of a new coronavirus variant No lorries or ferry passengers have been able to sail from the port of Dover, causing long queues. It comes as EU and UK negotiators struggle to agree a post-Brexit trade deal, with 10 days to go before the UK leaves EU trading rules. The government has repeatedly said it will not extend Brexit trade negotiations beyond the current 31 December deadline. In 2016 MPs were recalled to Parliament following the murder of Jo Cox, whose empty seat was marked with two roses Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and Plaid Cymru's leader at Westminster Liz Saville Roberts both said Parliament should be recalled following these developments - and that the Brexit talks should be extended beyond 31 December deadline. Responding to demands to recall Parliament, Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect - the union which represents parliamentary staff - expressed concern that his members' safety would be put at risk if large numbers of MPs returned to Parliament amid rising coronavirus cases. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is understood to have been pushing for more use of remote working for MPs, to combat the spread of infection and keep staff safe. Mr Rees-Mogg confirmed on Monday that, when Parliament returns, the government would introduce measures allowing all MPs to contribute to ""substantive"" Commons debates via video link. At the moment, they are only allowed to take part in question times, statements and urgent questions from home, not debates on legislation. Writing to the Procedure Committee, Mr Rees-Mogg said the change to the rules had been taken with the ""aim of reducing physical attendance"" at Westminster, which is under tier four restrictions following the emergence of a new variant of the Covid virus. Many MPs have urged the government to allow online voting, but Mr Rees-Mogg said the system of proxy votes - with MPs present in the chamber voting on behalf ones that that can't be there - would continue in its current form.

Lorry drivers urged not to travel,"All outbound traffic from Dover has been halted for 48 hours Lorry drivers have been urged not to travel to ports in Kent, East Sussex and Hampshire after France closed its border with the UK for 48 hours. In a bid to ease congestion towards Dover, Operation Stack has been activated on the coast-bound M20. Passenger ferries and lorry freight bound for France have been suspended from Dover, Portsmouth and Newhaven. However, speaking to BBC Radio 4, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said goods were still moving. ""Most of freight is not accompanied and that can still flow, of course,"" he said. Inbound freight is also coming into Dover on Monday, the port said. John Keefe, from Eurotunnel, said all travel from the UK to France had been suspended but it was still open for travel and goods coming in the other direction. Operation Brock, which uses a concrete barrier system, will be put in place overnight to replace Operation Stack, Highways England confirmed. The port of Dover was deserted on Monday morning A decision whether UK travellers will face the same set of restrictions no matter where they travel to in the EU is expected on Tuesday, the BBC understands. Currently there is a hotchpotch of travel restrictions in place, with different rules in 17 European countries. Meetings in Brussels between health officials and the EU's crisis response team will try to co-ordinate a single set of restrictions. One French official told BBC Europe correspondent Gavin Lee they were ""desperate"" to reopen the borders ""as soon as safely possible"", with one option being allowing people who have had a negative test within the previous 24 hours to travel. Late on Sunday night, Mr Shappsasked the public and hauliers not to travel,externalto ports in Kent or other routes to France. He said he was working urgently with his department ""to minimise traffic disruption in the area"". Passengers and accompanied freight vehicles have been told not to travel to Portsmouth's port In Portsmouth, Brittany Ferries said it was unable to carry passengers and accompanied freight (being transported by a driver) to Caen as expected. It said the border closure would affect about 1,000 passengers and 400 freight vehicles planning to travel to France on Monday and Tuesday. However, the Hampshire port said services to and from Spain and the Channel Islands were operating as normal. Live: Dover traffic halted due to new Covid strain Former BBC reporter Carole Madge boarded a ferry late on Sunday to travel to France with her family. She said: ""We were really excited. But sadly, once we got onboard and into our cabin, the announcement came out that we wouldn't be going anywhere. ""We had to stay on the ship overnight and they turfed us all off this morning."" Sailings from Newhaven Port for accompanied freight and tourist traffic have also been suspended but are continuing for unaccompanied freight trailers. The Sussex Resilience Forum said the port had not reported any congestion, and traffic on roads in Sussex was at normal levels. About 170 lorries remain parked on the M20 as part of Operation Stack, Kent Police said Stack is an emergency measure designed to prevent gridlock in Kent. Police work with Highways England and the county council to put it in place. Freight is separated into two queues on either side of the coast-bound carriageway between junctions 8 and 9. One lane is used for traffic heading to the Eurotunnel terminal and one lane is for port traffic. The middle lanes are kept clear for emergency vehicles. Non-freight traffic is diverted off the motorway and on to the A20. Stack is an ""initial measure"", according to Highways England, while Brock is more permanent. Operation Brock,which was recently tested ahead of Brexit, is to be installed on the M20, between 20:00 GMT and 08:00 on Tuesday. The motorway barrier system creates a contraflow on the M20 London-bound, between junctions nine and eight. It means more of the road network can stay open and will remain in place until further notice. The freight currently being held by Stack - about 170 lorries -  will be moved to Manston airport. Machines, seen here testing the system at Manston, are used to install the Brock concrete barrier About 10,000 lorries a day travel between Dover and Calais during peak periods such as Christmas. But thedecision by France to close its bordersmeans no accompanied freight can leave and long queues are expected. The leader of Kent County Council, Roger Gough, said: ""National government has urged vehicles not to come to Kent because we are anticipating some 17,000 vehicles coming into the county to make the crossing over the next couple of days."" Manston Airport in Kent is being prepared to take up to 4,000 lorries, the Department for Transport has confirmed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lorry driver Rick Mayo, who is stuck at Medway Services, told the BBC he thought the situation was ""ridiculous"". He said: ""Truck drivers don't come into contact with people; we're in the truck on our own, we self-isolate for three or four days at a time. ""Then, when we do [come into contact with other people], it's limited with masks and with gloves on."" Vehicles were being turned away from the port of Dover early on Monday Sainsbury's has warned it could face shortages of some fresh food supplies within days if the situation is not resolved. But a spokesman said all of its Christmas lunch products were ""already in the country"" and it was ""looking into alternative transport for products sourced from Europe"". Mr Shapps said: ""The shops are well stocked. In the short term this is not an issue in terms of supply but we are very keen to get it resolved."" Alex Veitch from Logistics UK, whose members transport goods in and out of the UK, said: ""Freight moves in a variety of ways to and from this country and that's why we're reassuring people there's no need to panic buy.

LiveLiveCountries around the world stop travel from UKLess than a minute ago,"More than 40 countries ban UK arrivals because of concerns over the spread of a new variant of coronavirus Spain, India, Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland and Germany are the latest to suspend UK flights France has closed its border with the UK for 48 hours, with no lorries or ferry passengers able to sail from the port of Dover UK PM Boris Johnson says he and French President Emmanuel Macron are working to unblock the border ""as fast as possible"" A further 33,364 positive cases have been recorded in the UK, as well as a further 215 deaths within 28 days of a positive test EU member states meet in Brussels to discuss a co-ordinated response on travel bans for UK - but no decision is expected today European Medicines Agency recommends use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, paving the way for vaccinations to start in the EU within days UK supermarket Sainsbury's says items could be missing from its shelves as a result of the French-UK border closure But retailers have played down fears of immediate food shortages Edited by Sarah Fowler and Sarah Collerton We're finishing our live coverage for the day now.

It plans to inoculate its population of 5.7 million within weeks, starting with health
workers, the elderly and the medically vulnerable.

Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check With some of the most populous countries across Africa seeing increases in Covid-19 cases, there've been concerns that the continent is facing another spike in infections. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has talked of a ""second wave"" arriving. And there's evidence that a new variant of coronavirus in South Africa may be driving increases there. The country now accounts for more than 60% of daily new cases detected in sub-Saharan Africa. But there are significant variations across the continent, with some countries seeing small or localised spikes, others witnessing more sustained increases and some not yet past an initial rise in cases. Find out morehere. Coronavirus cases are now rising fast again in the UK, driven by a new variant of the virus thought to be much more easily transmissible than other strains. As we heard earlier, a further 33,364 confirmed cases have been announced by the government today. You can see how many cases there are in your areahere. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The Swiss government has said all UK citizens who arrived in
Switzerland after 14 December must immediately quarantine. Entry
for UK citizens by air or land is now prohibited, following a suspension of all
air connections at midnight last night. The government says the measures are
intended to prevent, as much as possible, the spread of the new strain of Covid-19. Thousands of UK citizens have arrived in Switzerland over
the last few days, primarily to take advantage of the open ski slopes over the
holiday season. Geneva airport registered 10,000 UK arrivals this last weekend
alone. The prime minister hosted a press conference a short time ago, alongside Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the key points: Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent The quick approval of the vaccine was a real historic achievement, EMA CEO Emer Cooke said The
European Medicines Agency (EMA) has given the green light for the
Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine to be rolled out within the EU. The
Amsterdam-based regulator brought the decision forward by eight days under
pressure from EU states, after the UK and the US approved the jab more
quickly. This is not a silver bullet, EMA Director Emer Cooke
conceded, but she said recommending the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use across
the EU was ""a step in the right direction... providing citizens have
enough confidence to get vaccinated"". With millions of people's health at stake, the EMA described the
approval of a vaccine within 11 weeks rather than a year as an historic
achievement. Some 43,000 people were involved in one of
the largest trials ever conducted; the EMA's human medicines committee
concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks. With regards to the effectiveness against mutated strains of the
virus, EMA scientists say it is very likely the vaccine will
retain protection against the new variant detected in England. The decision paves the way for EU countries to start
rolling out their mass vaccination programmes within days. Pakistanhas joined dozens of countries in introducing UK travel restrictions following the idenitification of a new strain of coronavirus. The week-long ban on travel to or from the UK begins on Wednesday and applies to all travellers coming from the UK or who have been in the country over the past 10 days. Some exceptions do apply, however, with Pakistani nationals in the UK on visitor or temporary visas permitted to return if they provide a negative test 72 hours before travel, undergo another test upon arrival and quarantine at home for seven days afterwards. Other countries that have introduced UK travel restrictions include:  Find out more about the restrictionshere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is clear the
new variant will lead to tougher restrictions being introduced. The UK's chief
scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, admitted so in the TV briefing. There
is now a high degree of confidence it is leading to faster transmission - although
there is no evidence it causes more serious illness or would disrupt the
effectiveness of the vaccine. But with
infection rates rising rapidly, there is already talk
behind the scenes of more areas in the southern England going into tier four. But with the new variant seeded across the country it
only seems a matter of time before other regions follow suit. Questions are
also being asked about schools. The prime minister said he wanted to keep them
open ""if we possibly can"". The race to vaccinate the vulnerable just got even
more pressing. Greater Manchester's directors of public health are asking anyone who has travelled to the region from any tier four area or Wales to act as if they have the new variant of Covid-19 and self-isolate for at least 10 days when they arrive ""even if they have no symptoms"". The 10 days should start from 19 December and those self-isolating should remain inside the place where theyâre staying for the entire period. ""Other people in the house do not need to self isolate but no visitors should be allowed in that house at all, even on Christmas Day,"" said Jeanelle de Gruchy, who is director of Public Health in Tameside. ""If, during that time, anyone in the house gets symptoms, they must all isolate and the person with symptoms get a test straight away."" Dr de Gruchy described the new coronavirus variant as ""extremely worrying"" because of its ""incredibly infectious"" nature. ""Itâs more important than ever that we all put in that extra effort to keep our friends and families safe in the coming weeks.â  David Hughes of PA asks the PM if he believes ""morale takes a hit"" when he ""overpromises but under-delivers"". He also asks what proportion of the 500,000 vaccines have gone to those in hospital hubs and those in care homes. Johnson replies that it is ""important to be realistic"". He adds that the UK ""is the first country to distribute a clinically approved vaccine"". ""I find that a reason for hope and confidence, I think you should too,"" he said. He also says the ""vast bulk of doses are going to the over-80s and the clinically vulnerable"" but promises to provide an update when there is more data. That is the final question and ends the press conference. Helen CattPolitical correspondent As expected, the prime minister and the transport secretary were keen to try to reassure people that they have things under control. Plans that have been worked on to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit are now being rolled out to deal with disruption caused by European reactions to the coronavirus variant in the UK. Although, as we were reminded in the questioning, the trade negotiations rumble on and those plans could be deployed again for their post-Brexit purpose in just a couple of weeks' time. In terms of solving the immediate issue and resuming usual service across the Channel, the prime minister appeared quite upbeat - even putting a timescale of ""the next few hours"" on resolving the situation. What will now be key is seeing if the reality can match that optimism. The PM is asked if ""lateral flow tests"" - using saliva swabs - should be self-administered by the public. He replies that it is up to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to decide. Sir Patrick Vallance says work has been done to look at the new coronavirus variant. The view that it's transmitting more readily has been ""reinforced"", he adds, meaning the tiering system is vital. There will be ""inevitable"" increases in cases over the next few weeks, as people mix more over Christmas, he says. Pippa Crerar of the Mirror asks why the whole country isn't in lockdown. She also asks why the PM keeps ""over promising and under delivering"". Sir Patrick Vallance says it is the case that the virus will spread more and adds that ""measures are going to need to be increased in due course not reduced"". Boris Johnson says keeping the country in perpetual lockdown would have been disastrous. ""We can look forward to a very different world from Easter onwards,"" he adds. The PM is asked whether he can guarantee schools in England will restart as planned next term. He says the government wants, ""if we possibly can"", to get term under way in a staggered way, as promised. Sir Patrick Vallance says measures to reduce contact between people are ""even more important"" now there is a new variant that spreads more rapidly. ITV's Robert Peston asks if the UK will get a trade deal with the EU. He also asks if tier three will be enough to keep the new variant in check outside London and the South East. Boris Johnson says the position on Brexit talks is ""unchanged"". He adds that if a deal isn't agreed, then trading on World Trade Organization rules ""would be more than satisfactory"". On the second question, Patrick Vallance says it is important take action on tiers on the basis of evidence and urges people to follow the rules whichever tier they are in. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asks how confident the PM is about getting delays through Dover and elsewhere under control. Boris Johnson says he had an ""excellent"" conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, who was keen to get the situation sorted out ""in a few hours"" if possible. The PM says both sides want to resolve ""these problems as fast as possible"". Sir Patrick Vallance says the new coronavirus variant exists, to some extent, in all parts of the country. But people should ""stay local"" to prevent its spread, he argues. Rachel from Kent asks if the PM will consider rolling out the vaccine more widely and to more age groups - given the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant. Boris Johnson says it is ""sensible"" to stick to the plan of beginning vaccinations with those who are particularly vulnerable. Asked why the whole South East of England is not under the strictest tier 4 conditions, the PM says the government ""has to act"" on information about where the new coronavirus is most common and spreading. The situation will be kept under review, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
More than 40 countries ban UK arrivals over CovidSpain and India are among the nations to suspend flights amid concern over spread of new variant.,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""British supermarkets say supply chain is strong and robust"". More than 40 countries have banned UK arrivals because of concerns about the spread of a new variant of coronavirus. Flights from the UK are beingsuspendedto territories across the world including Spain, India and Hong Kong. France shut its border with the UK for 48 hours, meaning no lorries or ferries can leave from the port of Dover. Boris Johnson said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron and both sides wanted to resolve ""these problems as fast as possible"". The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference: ""We had a very good call and we both understand each other's positions."" Mr Johnson, who earlier chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee, added: ""We are working with our friends across the Channel to unblock the flow of trade."" And French Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune said they would announce on Tuesday what measures were being introduced ""after this phase of emergency and harsh precaution that we had to take"". He said they would come into effect from Wednesday. European Union member states met earlier in Brussels to discuss a co-ordinated response, with officials suggesting a requirement for tests could be imposed on all people arriving from the UK. It came as the Northern Ireland Executive met on Monday night to considerwhether to impose a travel ban between NI and England, Scotland and Wales. Christmas 'in jeopardy' after ban on UK travellers Laura Kuenssberg: The battle to control a sprawling crisis Flights shut down as EU discusses UK virus threat New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Countries to impose a ban on UK arrivals include Belgium, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Russia, and Switzerland. Some of the bans are already in force while others are to begin on Tuesday. Eurotunnel services to France are also suspended and Eurostar trains to Belgium are not operating. However, Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said he hoped travel from the UK could begin on Wednesday or Thursday. This video can not be played Isabella Hussell was on board the ferry when it was cancelled Meanwhile, Royal Mail says it has temporarily suspended all mail services to Europe, with the exception of the Republic of Ireland, due to the ""current restrictions around air, road, ferry and train movements from the UK"". The latest figures released on Monday reveal that another 33,364 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus. There were also a further 215 deaths within 28 days of testing positive, bringing the nation's total to 67,616. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned that the new variant of the virus -which may be up to 70% more transmissible- is ""getting out of control"". The new variant has spread quickly in London and south-east England, but health officials say there is no evidence that it is more deadly or would react differently to vaccines. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the situation as a ""real emergency"",saying: ""The news over the last 24 hours has been deeply disturbing. The number of coronavirus cases has nearly doubled in the last week. ""We can have no more over-promising and false hope, confused messages and slow decision-making. We need strong, clear and decisive leadership."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government had plans for coping with port disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit and should now activate the measures. As the day has gone it, it seems the frustration of some hauliers has grown. Many have been sounding their horns - after being refused entry to the Port of Dover. A few have been brandishing paperwork at the officials keeping them out. The reality is, whatever documentation they may have, they aren't being allowed to leave the UK today. The only journey they're being told to make is to the back of the ever-growing queue that makes up Operation Stack. That will mean spending tonight, and all day tomorrow in their cabs - when all they want to do is get back home. It's a depressing situation in the run-up to Christmas.  And if France does insist that all drivers need to be tested before being allowed to cross the Channel, it's likely some won't make it back before the big day. The coast-bound carriageway of the M20 motorway has been shut between Junctions 7 and 12 and Junction 9 and 8 London-bound, according to Highways England. It said all European freight destined for Dover Port and Eurotunnel Terminals ""will be no longer stacked on the M20 coastbound between junctions 8 and 12 and is being directed to Manston Airfield"". Manston had been readied to take up to 4,000 lorries. On Monday morning, Mr Shapps said the situation in Kent was ""not too disrupted"" saying ""it's mostly European and French hauliers getting caught up in this"" and that about 20% of the overall 32,000 units of freight shipped today were affected by the restrictions. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast that Covid-19 vaccine supplies - which come from Belgium - would not be affected by travel bans, as they come to the UK via unaccompanied containers. Unaccompanied freight, such as containers or lorry trailers on their own, can still be transported. This video can not be played France border closure: 'In the short term this won't have an impact' Iain Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, told BBC Breakfast there was ""no need"" for shoppers to panic-buy as a result of the border restrictions. But he added there was ""concern"" around food supplies in the longer term, particularly after Christmas. About 10,000 lorries travel between Dover and Calais every day during peak periods such as Christmas. But Downing Street has urged people to ""shop normally"" in the run up to Christmas, adding the UK has ""diverse and resilient supply chains"" and the majority of food does not enter the UK via Calais.

PM resists calls to extend Brexit deadline,"Boris Johnson has ruled out extending the deadline for reaching a post-Brexit trade deal into 2021, amid a deadlock in talks and a growing Covid crisis. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and London mayor Sadiq Khan want the UK to follow EU trading rules beyond 31 December to allow more time for an agreement. But the prime minister said his stance was ""unchanged"" and the UK would ""cope with any difficulties"" encountered. UK-EU talks continue, with nine days left to reach and ratify any agreement. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier is expected to update diplomats from the bloc's 27 member states later on Tuesday, although there is no sign of an imminent breakthrough. EU sources said sticking points remained over member states' access to UK fishing waters, competition rules and how any agreement would be enforced and disputes resolved. Brexit: Can the talks be extended? Pound slides lower as European borders close to UK The UK has continued following EU regulations since it left the bloc on 31 January, but it will exit its internal market and customs union when this ""transition"" period finishes at the end of the year. Without a trade deal, both sides could place import taxes on each other's goods, potentially affecting prices. Fishing rights are a major point of contention in UK-EU trade talks On Monday, Ms Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, said the spread of a new Covid variant - which has led tomore than 40 countries banning people travellingfrom the UK - ""demands our 100% attention"". It would be ""unconscionable"" to compound the UK's problems by not leaving more time to agree a trade deal, she added. And Labour's Mr Khan urged Mr Johnson to extend the deadline, saying the UK ""should be concentrating on... fighting the virus"". Fishing rights are a major point of contention in UK-EU trade talks, with France in particular raising concerns about its fleets being denied access to UK waters. Mr Johnson, who has promised a return of sovereignty over territorial waters, said on Monday he had had a ""great conversation"" with French President Emmanuel about restarting travel from the UK to France, following the Covid-related ban imposed by Paris. Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? But he added that they had ""vowed to stick off Brexit because that negotiation is being conducted via the European Commission, and that's quite proper"". ""And the position is unchanged,"" Mr Johnson said. ""There are problems. It's vital that everyone understands that the UK has got to be able to control its own laws completely, and also that we have got to be able to control our own fisheries."" He predicted the UK would ""prosper mightily"", whatever the outcome of the UK-EU talks, in Brussels. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has rejected calls to extend the transition period, saying ""further dithering"" would not help. ""I think that it would be far better for the government to get a deal over the line, either today, tomorrow or certainly next week,"" he said. Members of the European Parliament met on Monday to discuss the situation, after warning time had run out for it to ratify a deal by 31 December. One potential option, should the two sides reach agreement soon, would be for the European Parliament to approve it in principle by 31 December and complete formal ratification early next year. If this happened, short-term measures could potentially be put in place to minimise disruption to cross-Channel trade before new legally binding rules come into force.

Online retailers suspend some NI deliveries,"The issue is that, from January, commercial goods entering NI from GB will need a customs declaration Some online retailers are suspending delivery to Northern Ireland. The move is to give them time to adapt their systems to the new Irish Sea border, which begins operating in January. Zalando, a clothes retailer, stopped delivering on Friday. It said this was ""in preparation for new requirements from our carrier partner in the region."" Fashion brand Hugo Boss said delivery to NI would be temporarily unavailable It said this was ""due to system upgrades"" and there would be no deliveries from 23 December until 7 February. The issue facing companies is that, from January, commercial goods entering NI from GB will need a customs declaration. In theory, that means every parcel will need its own declaration though the government is working with delivery firms to find a way to minimise the impact of these changes. On Monday the furniture and homeware firm made.com told customers it would no longer be shipping to Northern Ireland. It said it had been ""working hard"" to find a way to continue deliveries but had been unable find a solution. Last week, Amazon warned Northern Ireland customers they could face delays and unavailability of some products when the Irish Sea border starts operating. Retailers want time to adapt their systems to the new Irish Sea border which begins operating in January The delivery firm,DPD Ireland, says it will be temporarily suspendingits collection service from Great Britain into Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland from 23 December. The company said it would only affect a small part of their business and not parcels travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. Parcels to the EU will be routed directly ""avoiding congestion we are already seeing at Dover and Calais"". Another firm, Parcel Motel, which uses a ""virtual address"" in County Antrim allowing shoppers in the Republic of Ireland to avoid added costs through international shipping restrictions, is also suspending that service. In a statement it said: ""As of 31 December, our virtual address services in the UK will be temporarily suspended, until such time as a final Brexit decision has been implemented and our services have been adapted to meet the new requirements. Why a no-deal Brexit would be different in NI Does a Brexit Irish Sea border undermine the union? Contractors race to finish Border Control Posts ""As a result, all parcels crossing the new border between Britain and Ireland will be subject to customs formalities affecting the cost and transit time of your shipment."" Parcel Motel said it was working on a new offering to meet post-Brexit requirements and will consider the reintroduction of the service. Online plant retailers face particular difficulties from the sea border as they face new certification requirements for their products as well as customs declarations. Last week Sienna Hosta, a specialist plant nursery in Surrey, told customers it would no longer sell to Northern Ireland by mail order. On Twitter it said this was because: ""New rules would mean Northern Ireland is essentially treated as an EU country so would require the same plant health checks etc., which for large orders are possible but small orders make it too expensive. We wish this wasn't the case."" The UK and European Union had previouslyannounced a formal agreement on how the new Irish Sea border would operate in January. Separate negotiations to reach a post-Brexit trade deal are still taking place. A special deal for Northern Ireland, known as the protocol, formed part of the Withdrawal Agreement which took the UK out of the EU earlier this year. The protocol will keep Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods even as the rest of the UK leaves it at the end of this month. The two sides had been negotiating on how the protocol should be implemented.

Travel shut down as EU discusses UK virus threat,"Numerous countries have introduced travel bans amid concerns over the new coronavirus variant EU officials are discussing a joint response to a new, more infectious Covid-19 variant in the UK, which has sparked travel bans by many countries. Canada and India joined European states in blocking flights from the UK while Europe-bound train services via the Channel Tunnel have been halted. The new variant is said to be up to 70% more transmissible, but there is no evidence that it is more deadly. There is also no proof to suggest that it reacts differently to vaccines. Live updates Two meetings are taking place in Brussels on Monday - one involving health ministers and another with the EU's crisis response team. But no decision is expected until Tuesday, when EU ambassadors meet. A French official told the BBC's Gavin Lee that they were desperate to reopen the borders ""as soon as safely possible"", with one option discussed being the requirement that UK travellers - including lorry drivers - prove they have had a recent negative Covid-19 test. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""British supermarkets say supply chain is strong and robust"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had an ""excellent"" conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron and was keen to find a solution ""in a few hours"". ""I want to stress we in the UK fully understand our friends' anxieties about the new variant. But it's also true that the risks of transmission sitting alone in the cab is very low. So we hope to make progress,"" he said. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier said the new variant was ""out of control"", while Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands announced they had already detected it. Following the discovery of case in Denmark, neighbouring Sweden banned all foreign travellers from there. Christmas 'in jeopardy' after ban on UK travellers Pound slides lower as European borders close to UK New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Also on Monday, the EU's medicines regulator approved the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccinefor use in all 27 member states. The vaccine is already being administered in the UK and in the US, and some European countries plan to begin administering doses from 27 December. Francesuspended all travel links, including freight lorries, with the UK for 48 hours from midnight (23:00 GMT) on Sunday. Thousands of lorries move between the countries every day. Eurotunnelsaid it would suspend access to its Folkestone terminal for traffic heading to Calais. People booked to travel on Monday can get a refund. Trains will still run from Calais to Folkestone. The ferry terminal at Dover is now closed for all accompanied traffic leaving the UK until further noticebecause of the French restrictions. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson chaired a meeting of the emergency committee Cobra to discuss the issue on Monday. Other countries took different action in response to the new virus variant: Germany, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Bulgaria, Romania,Malta, Croatia, Lithuania, LatviaandEstoniaall suspended flights from the UK One of the most popular holiday destinations for UK citizens,Spain, also suspended flights Italyblocked all flights from the UK until 6 January, while theNetherlandsbanned all passenger flights from the UK until 1 January ""at the latest"".

Russiais suspending flights from the UK for one week Indiais suspending flights from the UK from 23:59 (18:29 GMT) on Tuesday until 31 December Hong Kong, Israel,Iran, Croatia, MoroccoandKuwaitbrought in restrictions on UK travel In Latin America,Argentina,Chile,Colombia,Ecuador,El SalvadorandPeruall banned flights from the UK Saudi Arabia,OmanandKuwaitwent even further, closing their borders completely for a week The new variant was first detected in September. In November it made up around a quarter of cases in London. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December. Three things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London. This variant is unusually highly mutated. The most likely explanation is it emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus. There is no evidence yet to suggest the variant makes the infection more deadly, and at least for now the developed vaccines will almost certainly work against it. However, if the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine, then ""vaccine escape"" happens, and this may be the most concerning element.

Suspect charged over Lockerbie bombing 32 years on,"A total of 270 people died in the Lockerbie bombing on 21 December 1988 The US has announced charges against a Libyan suspected of making the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. Abu Agila Mohammad Masud has been charged with terrorism-related crimes, Attorney General William Barr said on Monday, 32 years on from the atrocity. The deadly bomb attack on the Boeing 747 killed 270 people, including 190 American citizens. Prosecutors will seek the extradition of Mr Masud to stand trial in the US. The US claims Mr Masud is an ex-Libyan intelligence operative. He allegedly carried out the attack on the orders of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The bombing of the London to New York flight remains the deadliest terrorist incident ever to have taken place in the UK, and the second deadliest air attack in US history. Eleven people on the ground in Scotland were also killed. The victims included 35 study abroad US students who were returning home for Christmas. The town scarred by Pan Am flight 103 Wreaths laid to mark Lockerbie bombing 30th anniversary Timeline: Lockerbie bombing The new charges bring Mr Barr's role in this lengthy terrorism investigation full circle, as he was also US Attorney General when charges were first announced against two Libyan suspects in 1991. Back then, serving under President George HW Bush, Mr Barr tasked his criminal division head Robert Mueller to look into the bombing. Mr Mueller is now best known for leading the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Both Mr Barr and Mr Mueller have taken part in remembrance events with families over the years. Police Scotland's chief constable, Iain Livingstone, said the charges were a ""significant development"" and that they will ""continue to work closely"" with the US and other international authorities. He said it was ""inappropriate to comment further"" at this time. This video can not be played Lockerbie bombing suspect charged by US Justice Department Mr Barr said he was ""pleased to announce that the United States has filed criminal charges against the third conspirator Abu Agila Mohammad Masud for his role in the bombing"". ""Let there be no mistake, no amount of time or distance will stop the United States and our Scottish partners in pursuing justice in this case."" Mr Barr said the ""breakthrough"" that led to Monday's charges came when authorities learned he was being held in Libya. Mr Barr said Libyan authorities provided a copy of their interview with Mr Masud to US officials. He said Mr Masud allegedly built the bomb and worked with two other co-conspirators. He said Gaddafi had also personally thanked Mr Masud ""for the successful attack on the United States"". ""At long last this man responsible for killing Americans and many others will be subject to justice for his crimes,"" Mr Barr said. The attorney general added that he is ""optimistic"" that the Libyan government will hand Mr Masud over. Analysis by Paul Adams, BBCdiplomaticcorrespondent For Bill Barr, this has been a long time coming. Twenty-nine years ago, as acting Attorney General, he announced the first indictments of suspects in the Lockerbie case. Today, in one of his last acts as Donald Trump's top legal officer, he said events had come ""full circle,"" with the unsealing of charges against Abu Agila Mohammad Masud. ""Terrorists have to know that eventually we will get them,"" Barr told reporters. Over the years, the bombing has spawned any number of theories about who was responsible, with fingers pointing, at one time or another, at Iran, Syria, Palestinian militants and, finally, Libya. But US and British officials have long been convinced Lockerbie was the work of Libyan agents, working under orders from the country's former dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. Today's charges could, finally, lay other theories to rest. Mr Masud is alleged to have been a top bomb-maker for Mr Gaddafi. Journalist Ken Dornstein, whose brother David was on board the Pan Am plane, went to Libya to track down Mr Masud as part of a 2015 TV documentary by US network PBS called My Brother's Bomber. He told the BBC at the time that the Libyan national was ""a mystery figure"" who was named in the initial investigation and ""was said to have been a technical expert"". This video can not be played Ken Dornstein on how he tracked down new Lockerbie suspects The documentary alleged that Mr Masud had also been linked to a bombing at a disco in West Berlin in 1986, which killed three people. It also reported that he was imprisoned in Libya over his role in the 2011 uprising that ousted Gaddafi. Based on travel records and witness statements, US investigators allege in the criminal complaint that Mr Masud flew from Tripoli, Libya, to Malta in December 1988 but met with a Libyan intelligence official ahead of the flight. Six days later, two other co-conspirators also journeyed to Malta, and the three men allegedly worked together on the explosive device. The complaint alleges they concealed the cassette that held the bomb in clothing from a store in Malta. Mr Masud armed the device on 21 December, investigators allege. A suitcase containing the device was then placed on feeder flights from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany, and eventually to London's Heathrow airport, where it was loaded onto the Pan Am flight. That same day, Mr Masud reportedly returned to Tripoli. Several days later, he and another co-conspirator allegedly met with a senior intelligence official, who praised their work. Kara Weipz, whose brother was killed in the bombing, said at the news conference: ""We are justified, vindicated, our patience and persistence has proved fruitful with this decision today."" ""The motto of the family members over the last 32 years has been the truth must be known,"" she said. Kara Weipz (centre), representative on behalf of the Pan Am 103 families, delivers remarks beside US Attorney General William Barr (left) Ahead of the briefing, some UK families had criticised the timing of the charges to fall on the anniversary of the attack, accusing the US justice department of using the case for ""propaganda purposes"". John Mosey, whose 19-year-old daughter was killed in the bombing, said he would not accept the invitation to remotely attend the event. Mr Mosey wrote that he and his wife felt the timing was ""bizarre, disrespectful, insensitive and extremely ill considered"". ""Why would you use the anniversary of our daughter Helga's death along with 269 others to parade once more a highly suspect prosecution?"" Mr Mosey added that why the attack ""was allowed to happen is a far more important question to us than 'who did it?'"" Libyan national Abdelbaset al-Megrahi is the only man convicted, in 2001, over the bombing. Megrahi, who always proclaimed his innocence, launched two appeals against his 27-year sentence, one was unsuccessful and the other was abandoned. Megrahi was released from prison in Scotland and allowed to return to Libya on compassionate grounds in 2009 after it emerged that he had terminal cancer. He died three years later. A Scottish court is now considering a posthumous appealagainst his conviction by his family. According to the FBI, the alleged bomb-maker Mr Masud is said to have admitted in his jailhouse confession that he bought the clothes which investigators say were wrapped around the bomb in the Samsonsite suitcase. This would appear to contradict a key piece of evidence in the Scottish prosecution of Megrahi - that it was him who bought the clothing. However, Mr Masud also allegedly said in his Libyan jailhouse interview that his fellow intelligence operative Megrahi was his co-conspirator in the bomb plot.

Breaking|Breaking newsTwo found guilty of manslaughter in migrant lorry deathsTwo men found guilty of the manslaughter of all 39 Vietnamese migrants found dead in a lorry.England,"Gheorghe Nica and Eamonn Harrison were both found guilty of manslaughter Two men have been found guilty of the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese migrants found dead in a lorry trailer in Essex. The migrants suffocated in the sealed container en route from Zeebrugge to Purfleet in October 2019. Eamonn Harrison, 24, who dropped off the trailer at the Belgian port, and people-smuggler Gheorghe Nica, 43, were convicted by an Old Bailey jury. Two others were convicted of being part of a wider people-smuggling conspiracy. The 39 people who died in the back of a trailer as it crossed the North Sea between Zeebrugge and the UK The trial examined three smuggling attempts by the gang - two that were successful on 11 and 18 October, and the final trip on 23 October. Lorry driver Christopher Kennedy, 24, from County Armagh, collected the trailers from Purfleet on the earlier two runs, claiming he thought he was transporting cigarettes. But the jury found Kennedy and Valentin Calota, 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. During the trial, jurors were given a snapshot of the victims - who included a bricklayer, a university graduate and a nailbar technician - and their dreams of a better life. Many of their families borrowed heavily to fund their passage, relying on their potential future earnings once they got into the UK. The supposed 'VIP' journey that killed 39 people Irish smuggling connection to Essex lorry deaths Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten, from Essex Police, said: ""If you look at the method, the way they transported human beings... we wouldn't transport animals in that way."" Another two men - Irish haulage boss Ronan Hughes, 41, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, Ireland, and 26-year-old lorry driver Maurice Robinson - had previously admitted manslaughter. Home Secretary Priti Patel described the deaths as a ""truly tragic incident"". Christopher Kennedy was found guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration Prosecutors said in the fatal run, the container became a ""tomb"" as temperatures in the unit reached an ""unbearable"" 38.5C (101F). The migrants, aged 15 to 44, were sealed inside for at least 12 hours. They had used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof, but only managed to dent the interior. Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones said: ""There was no way out, and no-one to hear them; no-one to help them."" Both Maurice Robinson (l) and Ronan Hughes (r) admitted 39 counts of manslaughter in connection with the case Harrison, of Newry, County Down, towed the trailer to Zeebrugge, from where it was transported to Purfleet. During the 10-week trial, he claimed he did not know there were people in the trailer and that he watched ""a wee bit of Netflix"" in bed as they were loaded on. He also said he had no idea there were migrants in two other trailers that he had dropped off at the same port in the previous 12 days. Robinson, from County Armagh, collected the trailer when it arrived on UK shores just after midnight on 23 October. His boss, Hughes, had messaged him: ""Give them air quickly don't let them out."". Robinson gave a thumbs-up in reply. But when Robinson stopped on a nearby industrial estate, he found that the migrants were all dead. The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October last year There was a series of telephone conversations between him and Hughes and Nica, of Basildon, Essex, before Robinson eventually dialled 999. In his evidence, Nica said Robinson told him: ""I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer."" Det Ch Insp Stoten said that many of the police officers who attended ""were really young in service"" and it was possibly the first time some had ever seen a dead person. He said he believed the ""absolutely horrendous scene"" would stay with those officers ""for the rest of their career and, quite probably, the rest of lives"". On all three runs, Nica had arranged cars and a van to transport the migrants at the UK end. Jurors were shown CCTV footage of him carrying a holdall of cash to Hughes's room at the Ibis hotel, Thurrock, early on 19 October. Ronan Hughes (left) meeting Gheorghe Nica at a budget hotel Nica admitted to conspiring to assist illegal immigration in the first two runs, but he insisted that he believed the third run was all to do with smuggling cigarettes. The mechanic told jurors he had been roped into people-smuggling, and said: ""I never wanted to be involved in this kind of job."" The day after the bodies were found, Nica travelled to Romania, claiming he was ""scared"" of a ""big, big investigation"", but prosecutors said the defendant's version of events was ""ridiculous"". Det Ch Insp Stoten said the gang stood to make between Â£10,000 and Â£12,000 per person transported, ""the lion's share of which would have gone to Ronan Hughes and Gheorghe Nica"". CCTV footage from Orsett Golf Club of a lorry on 11 October 2019 The jury had heard that on 14 October, between the two successful runs, Kennedy was found at the French end of the Channel Tunnel with 20 Vietnamese migrants in his trailer. At least two of those people ended up dying in the fatal run. Police believe the smugglers had ""doubled-up"" the load on 23 October because of the problem on 14 October, and that was what led to the deaths. This gang had been smuggling people for months and months, the Old Bailey heard. On the first of several successful runs on the same route, a couple, Marie Andrews and Stewart Cox, saw people getting out of a van on a country lane in Orsett, Essex, and dialled 999. Police attended but did not seize CCTV footage from the nearby golf course, in which a lorry and other vehicles were seen on the lane. If, perhaps, Essex Police had managed to get to that footage, follow it up and identify some of the vehicles before the fatal run 12 days later, then this gang might possibly have been disrupted before these 39 people died. Asked about that, the force said it could only allocate the resources available at the time. But it says that now, if there are ever reports of people in the back of a lorry and the driver is present, the driver will be arrested. Dinh Dinh Binh - from Hai Phong - was one of two 15-year-olds to die in the container Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Hobart Road, Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Barclay Road, Tottenham, north London, had earlier admitted assisting unlawful immigration linked to the case. Mr Justice Sweeney adjourned sentencing of all the defendants to 7, 8 and 11 January. Ms Patel said her ""thoughts remain with those affected by this tragedy"". ""Today's convictions only strengthen my resolve to do all I can to go after the people-smugglers who prey on the vulnerable and trade in human misery,"" she added.

"Sydney cut off from rest of Australia amid outbreakAll states and territories have begun enforcing travel bans, upending Christmas plans for many people.","Authorities at state borders are now checking that no Sydney residents are allowed in Australian states and territories have begun enforcing entry bans on Sydney residents amid a growing coronavirus outbreak in the nation's largest city. The border closures outside New South Wales (NSW) have dashed Christmas plans and family reunions for many people. Airlines cancelled several flights leaving Sydney Airport on Monday, following a midnight deadline. The city has recorded 83 cases so far in this outbreak, all linked to Sydney's Northern Beaches region. Speaking from Canberra on Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: ""2020 is not done with us yet."" ""The events of the past few days... are incredibly frustrating and disappointing for people all around the country who had plans in place to get together and move in between states."" However, he and others welcomed the dip in new case numbers reported on Monday. NSW state authorities recorded 15 new infections - half the previous day's numbers - out of a record 38,000 tests conducted in 24 hours. Many viewed the numbers as encouraging that the virus had not spread further beyond the Northern Beaches, which is subject to a local lockdown. But authorities warned that one day's results were not enough to determine a trend. ""Obviously, we have halved the number of cases overnight, but in a pandemic, there is a level of volatility, so we'll closely monitor what happens,"" said NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian. Sydney's Northern Beaches - including Manly Beach - are closed amid the lockdown She said it was too early to tell whether wider restrictions for the city's five million residents would ease in time for Christmas. Australia - currently seeing all but no cases outside Sydney - has become known for its swift and aggressive response to outbreaks this year. In Sydney, indoor gatherings have been limited to 10 guests, and all residents have been told to minimise their social activity and to wear a mask in public spaces. Those living in the Northern Beaches will remain in lockdown until at least Wednesday. On Sunday, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory announced bans on Sydney residents entering their state, adding to bans in other places. Those states' residents were told to return within a 12-hour window or face 14 days in quarantine upon arriving home. Anticipation of these orders prompted an exodus from Sydney on the weekend, with many residents leaving the city before the border shutdowns. Australia so far has recorded 908 deaths and 28,200 cases in the pandemic - a level far lower than seen in many other nations. Sydneysiders scrambled to leave the city for other states on Sunday The country took early decisions to close the nation's borders and mandate hotel quarantine for returning travellers from overseas. But experts have also credited its success on states acting quickly to lock down hotspot areas and conduct rapid contact tracing and testing processes.

But the state government has also faced criticism from some experts, who say it should make mask-wearing mandatory in public. Scrutiny has again fallen on the hotel quarantine system - which is believed to be the source of Sydney's new outbreak, as it was with previous outbreaks in Melbourne and Adelaide.

Gunman jailed for life for German synagogue attackThe attacker tried to shoot Jewish worshippers - then killed two people outside a synagogue in Halle.Europe,"Stephan Balliet (C) also fired at police during the attack in Halle A German court has jailed a far-right gunman for life for his deadly attack on a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle last year. Stephan Balliet, 28, shot and killed a female passer-by and a man at a kebab shop after failing to break into the synagogue on 9 October 2019. Only a heavy, bolted door kept him from firing at 52 Jewish worshippers marking the Yom Kippur festival inside. It nearly became Germany's worst anti-Semitic atrocity since the Nazi era. Balliet expressed no remorse for the attack on the synagogue. During his five-month trial, Balliet denied the Holocaust in open court - a criminal offence in Germany. He laughed when the Holocaust was mentioned in court. He said that ""attacking the synagogue was not a mistake, they are my enemies"". He espoused a racist, misogynist ideology. He wore combat fatigues on the day of the attack and filmed the shooting, broadcasting it for 35 minutes on the internet. His home-made gun repeatedly jammed. Police pictured at the kebab shop after the shootings The cantor who was leading prayer in the synagogue saw the gunman on a surveillance TV and quickly moved the congregation out of the main hall. During the trial in Magdeburg, near Halle, American rabbi Jeremy Borovitz said ""we are not afraid, we stand together"". Based in Berlin, he was visiting Halle for Yom Kippur - Judaism's holiest day - and was among dozens of Jewish witnesses who gave testimony at the trial. Survivors relive terror of attack on synagogue Horror of Germans targeted in anti-Semitic attack Judges said Balliet was ""seriously culpable"", effectively barring him from early release. He was convicted of two counts of murder and multiple counts of attempted murder.

Sydney cut off from rest of Australia amid outbreak,"Authorities at state borders are now checking that no Sydney residents are allowed in Australian states and territories have begun enforcing entry bans on Sydney residents amid a growing coronavirus outbreak in the nation's largest city. The border closures outside New South Wales (NSW) have dashed Christmas plans and family reunions for many people. Airlines cancelled several flights leaving Sydney Airport on Monday, following a midnight deadline. The city has recorded 83 cases so far in this outbreak, all linked to Sydney's Northern Beaches region. Speaking from Canberra on Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: ""2020 is not done with us yet."" ""The events of the past few days... are incredibly frustrating and disappointing for people all around the country who had plans in place to get together and move in between states.""

Anti-Semitic tweets target Miss France runner-up,"Miss Provence April Benayoum revealed her Israeli origins during the Miss France 2021 final on Saturday The runner-up of the Miss France 2021 competition has been subjected to a torrent of anti-Semitic abuse on social media, prompting outrage and a police investigation. April Benayoum, 21, was awarded second place in the pageant during a televised ceremony on Saturday. She revealed her Israeli origins in an interview at the event, leading to anti-Semitic attacks on Twitter. The tweets were widely condemned by French politicians and Jewish groups. In an interview with the Var-Matin newspaper,external, Ms Benayoum said she heard about the anti-Jewish insults from her relatives. ""It is sad to witness such behaviour in 2020,"" said Ms Benayoum, who represented the south-eastern region of Provence in the contest. ""I obviously condemn these comments, but it does not affect me at all."" Macron announces anti-Semitism crackdown Anti-Semitism 'pervades European life' France's Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said he was ""deeply shocked by the rain of anti-Semitic insults"" against Ms Benayoum. ""We must not let anything go,""he wrote in a tweet,external, adding that police were looking into the abusive tweets. Miss Normandie Amandine Petit (R) took the Miss France 2021 crown with Miss Provence April Benayoum (L) finishing second The organisers of the competition denounced the ""hate speech"" against Ms Benayoum, saying it was ""totally contrary to the values ââof the channel, the production and the show"". Miss France 2021 was celebrated as the centenary edition of the pageant, which was founded in 1920 by the journalist Maurice de Waleffe. Amandine Petit, or Miss Normandy, was crowned this year's winner, beating a field of 29 contestants to win a cash prize, use of a Paris apartment and a monthly salary for one year. She told France's BFM TV the ""inappropriate remarks"" were ""extremely disappointing"" to see. Politicians expressed solidarity too.Minister of Citizenship MarlÃ¨ne Schiappa tweeted,externalthat the beauty competition was ""not a contest of anti-Semitism"". Renaud Muselier, a former French member of the European Parliament from the Provence region,called the attacks an ""abomination"",external. He emphasised that Ms Benayoum was ""French, of Italian and Israeli origin, from Provence, from the south"", which means she ""perfectly represents our region and our country"". Ms Benayoum said it was ""sad to witness such behaviour in 2020"" There was a strong reaction from Jewish groups as well.The International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism (Licra) said,externalthe Miss France competition had ""turned Twitter into an anti-Semitic cesspool against Miss Provence"". France, which has Europe's biggest Jewish population of around half a million, has seen a number of anti-Semitic attacks in recent years. The French government has faced pressure to respond to violence against and harassment of Jews in the country. One survey of EU countries in 2018 found that 95% of French Jews see anti-Semitism as either a fairly or very big problem. In the same year, former French Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe said there had been a 69% increase in anti-Semitic incidents.

EU mulls options as travel bans on UK expand,"Numerous countries have introduced travel bans amid concerns over the new coronavirus variant EU officials are discussing a joint response to a new, more infectious Covid-19 variant in the UK, which has sparked travel bans by many countries. Canada and India joined European states in blocking flights from the UK while Europe-bound train services via the Channel Tunnel have been halted. The new variant is said to be up to 70% more transmissible, but there is no evidence that it is more deadly. There is also no proof to suggest that it reacts differently to vaccines. Live updates Two meetings are taking place in Brussels on Monday - one involving health ministers and another with the EU's crisis response team. But no decision is expected until Tuesday, when EU ambassadors meet. A French official told the BBC's Gavin Lee that they were desperate to reopen the borders ""as soon as safely possible"", with one option discussed being the requirement that UK travellers - including lorry drivers - prove they have had a recent negative Covid-19 test. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""British supermarkets say supply chain is strong and robust"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had an ""excellent"" conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron and was keen to find a solution ""in a few hours"". ""I want to stress we in the UK fully understand our friends' anxieties about the new variant. But it's also true that the risks of transmission sitting alone in the cab is very low. So we hope to make progress,"" he said. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier said the new variant was ""out of control"", while Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands announced they had already detected it. Following the discovery of case in Denmark, neighbouring Sweden banned all foreign travellers from there. Christmas 'in jeopardy' after ban on UK travellers Pound slides lower as European borders close to UK New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Also on Monday, the EU's medicines regulator approved the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccinefor use in all 27 member states. The vaccine is already being administered in the UK and in the US, and some European countries plan to begin administering doses from 27 December. Francesuspended all travel links, including freight lorries, with the UK for 48 hours from midnight (23:00 GMT) on Sunday. Thousands of lorries move between the countries every day. Eurotunnelsaid it would suspend access to its Folkestone terminal for traffic heading to Calais. People booked to travel on Monday can get a refund. Trains will still run from Calais to Folkestone. The ferry terminal at Dover is now closed for all accompanied traffic leaving the UK until further noticebecause of the French restrictions. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson chaired a meeting of the emergency committee Cobra to discuss the issue on Monday. Other countries took different action in response to the new virus variant: Germany, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Bulgaria, Romania,Malta, Croatia, Lithuania, LatviaandEstoniaall suspended flights from the UK One of the most popular holiday destinations for UK citizens,Spain, also suspended flights Italyblocked all flights from the UK until 6 January, while theNetherlandsbanned all passenger flights from the UK until 1 January ""at the latest"". Ferry passengers are also barred from arriving in the Netherlands from the UK, although freight can continue Belgiumhalted flights and trains from the UK until the end of Tuesday Greeceextended its quarantine period for travellers from the UK from three days to seven Outbound train services through the Channel Tunnel - including the Eurostar - have been halted In theRepublic of Ireland, flights arriving from Britain are banned for 48 hours at least from midnight on Sunday and people have been asked not to ""travel to Ireland, by air or sea"".

Turkeyhas temporarily banned all flights from the UK, as haveNorwayandSwitzerland Canadahas suspended entry of all passenger flights from the UK for 72 hours, effective from midnight (05:00 GMT). Passengers who arrived in Canada from the UK on Sunday would be ""subject to secondary screening and enhanced measures, including increased scrutiny of quarantine plans"", it said. Russiais suspending flights from the UK for one week Indiais suspending flights from the UK from 23:59 (18:29 GMT) on Tuesday until 31 December Hong Kong, Israel,Iran, Croatia, MoroccoandKuwaitbrought in restrictions on UK travel In Latin America,Argentina,Chile,Colombia,Ecuador,El SalvadorandPeruall banned flights from the UK Saudi Arabia,OmanandKuwaitwent even further, closing their borders completely for a week The new variant was first detected in September. In November it made up around a quarter of cases in London. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December. Three things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London. This variant is unusually highly mutated. The most likely explanation is it emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus. There is no evidence yet to suggest the variant makes the infection more deadly, and at least for now the developed vaccines will almost certainly work against it. However, if the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine, then ""vaccine escape"" happens, and this may be the most concerning element.

Shares and pound fall as Covid border chaos hits,"Shares in London dropped and the pound lost ground after several EU countries closed their borders to the UK, which has reported a new variant of coronavirus. London's FTSE 100 index fell as much as 3%, before recovering slightly and ending 1.7% lower, as travel firms and others saw big declines. The main German market fell 2.8%, while in France the key bourse dropped 2.4%. US markets were more mixed, amid relief over progress on a virus aid package. After falling in opening trade, the Dow ended the day up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.4%. The Nasdaq fell 0.1%. Earlier, the pound fell more than 1% against the euro and dropped 1.6% against the dollar. Travel curbs hit airline stocks, with British Airways' owner IAG sinking nearly 8% and EasyJet tumbling 7.2%.Aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce was also badly hit, falling more than 3%. The rout was replicated on other European markets. Air France-KLM shares dropped 4%, while planemaker Airbus was down roughly 3%. ""Investors' rosy expectations for 2021 have suddenly vanished,"" said Kazuhiko Saito, chief analyst at commodities broker Fujitomi Co. As well as renewed concern about Covid-19 cases, UK investors were reacting to another missed deadline in trade talks with the EU. London and Brussels are trying to reach a trade deal before the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The talks are set to continue on Monday between negotiators. UK calls emergency meeting as Europe shuts doors Brexit trade talks to continue at 'crucial moment' The stalled negotiations have been partly responsible for the pound fluctuating over recent weeks. Optimism that a deal would be struck had triggered a four-day winning streak for sterling, pushing it back up to just under $1.36 before it reversed course again. Earlier on Monday, the pound fell towards $1.32, with the dollar also being buoyed aftera $900bn (Â£660bn) plan to help the US economyweather the coronavirus pandemic was agreed. However, the pound later regained some of those losses, rising above $1.33. ""The US got its stimulus package through, but it seems that was largely priced in and investors are more concerned with the new strain of Covid-19,"" said Craig Erlam, analyst at Oanda trading group. This video can not be played Barnier: Negotiations have ""just a few hours"" European nations have begun to impose travel bans on the UK after it reported a more-infectious and ""out of control"" coronavirus variant over the weekend. Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium are all halting flights. On Saturday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced a new tier four level of restrictions for London and South East England. ""The lockdown news and the stalemate on Brexit is keeping the market nervous,"" National Australia Bank's senior currency strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters. The prime minister will chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee laterafter France closed its border with the UK for 48 hours. One major sticking point in the Brexit talks is access to the UK's water for fishing. While the fishing industry accounts for just 0.1% of gross domestic product, (GDP)  it is of high political significance. If a trade agreement is not reached by the end of the month, British firms will revert to trading with the EU under rules established by the World Trade Organization (WTO). This will mean imports and exports to the EU would be subject to WTO-negotiated tariffs, essentially a tax on goods.

Brexit trade talks to continue at 'crucial moment',"Boris Johnson has ruled out extending the deadline for reaching a post-Brexit trade deal into 2021, amid a deadlock in talks and a growing Covid crisis. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and London mayor Sadiq Khan want the UK to follow EU trading rules beyond 31 December to allow more time for an agreement. But the prime minister said his stance was ""unchanged"" and the UK would ""cope with any difficulties"" encountered. UK-EU talks continue, with nine days left to reach and ratify any agreement. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier is expected to update diplomats from the bloc's 27 member states later on Tuesday, although there is no sign of an imminent breakthrough. EU sources said sticking points remained over member states' access to UK fishing waters, competition rules and how any agreement would be enforced and disputes resolved. Brexit: Can the talks be extended? Pound slides lower as European borders close to UK The UK has continued following EU regulations since it left the bloc on 31 January, but it will exit its internal market and customs union when this ""transition"" period finishes at the end of the year. Without a trade deal, both sides could place import taxes on each other's goods, potentially affecting prices. Fishing rights are a major point of contention in UK-EU trade talks On Monday, Ms Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, said the spread of a new Covid variant - which has led tomore than 40 countries banning people travellingfrom the UK - ""demands our 100% attention"". It would be ""unconscionable"" to compound the UK's problems by not leaving more time to agree a trade deal, she added. And Labour's Mr Khan urged Mr Johnson to extend the deadline, saying the UK ""should be concentrating on... fighting the virus"". Fishing rights are a major point of contention in UK-EU trade talks, with France in particular raising concerns about its fleets being denied access to UK waters. Mr Johnson, who has promised a return of sovereignty over territorial waters, said on Monday he had had a ""great conversation"" with French President Emmanuel about restarting travel from the UK to France, following the Covid-related ban imposed by Paris. Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? But he added that they had ""vowed to stick off Brexit because that negotiation is being conducted via the European Commission, and that's quite proper"". ""And the position is unchanged,"" Mr Johnson said. ""There are problems. It's vital that everyone understands that the UK has got to be able to control its own laws completely, and also that we have got to be able to control our own fisheries."" He predicted the UK would ""prosper mightily"", whatever the outcome of the UK-EU talks, in Brussels. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has rejected calls to extend the transition period, saying ""further dithering"" would not help. ""I think that it would be far better for the government to get a deal over the line, either today, tomorrow or certainly next week,"" he said. Members of the European Parliament met on Monday to discuss the situation, after warning time had run out for it to ratify a deal by 31 December. One potential option, should the two sides reach agreement soon, would be for the European Parliament to approve it in principle by 31 December and complete formal ratification early next year. If this happened, short-term measures could potentially be put in place to minimise disruption to cross-Channel trade before new legally binding rules come into force.

New coronavirus variant 'probably' in NI,"A NI Executive meeting is under way to consider a paper on whether to impose a travel ban from GB. Earlier, the deputy first minister said the executive must meet to agree a ban as ""we are facing a grave situation"". The health minister took advice from the Attorney General and set out that in a paper to the executive. It is understood Robin Swann has recommended issuing guidance advising against non-essential travel between NI and GB, and NI and the Irish Republic. The minister has also advised that people arriving into Northern Ireland should self-isolate for 10 days. It is understood Sinn FÃ©in Finance Minister Conor Murphy has now written to Mr Swann expressing ""dismay and astonishment"" that he is not moving immediately to instigate a ban on travel between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. He has called on Mr Swann to reconsider his approach. Mr Swann's paper also makes the case for progressing work regarding any changes in the law needed to impose a ban - Mr Murphy has called on the minister to ""move urgently"" to complete this, in order to introduce a ban. More than 40 countries, including the Republic of Ireland, havebanned UK arrivals because of concerns about the spread of a new variant of coronavirus. Earlier the first minister said it is ""probable""the variantis already in NI. Arlene Foster said four cases in NI were being tested to determine if they are the new highly infectious variant. The executive was already scheduled to meet on Tuesday morning to discuss the end of the EU exit transition period on 31 December. On Sunday, the executive agreed so-called Christmas bubbles should be limited to one day. The move followed action inEngland, Scotland and Wales on Saturday, cutting the previously agreed five days to just one.. Another seven coronavirus-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland on Monday. TheDepartment of Health's death toll is 1,203,external. There were also a further 555 cases of Covid-19 diagnosed. There are 446 people with Covid-19 in hospital. Thirty are in intensive care, with 24 on ventilators. A new six-week lockdown for Northern Ireland comesinto force at 00:01 GMT on 26 December. Ministers met remotely on Sunday night to discussthe impact of the variant on Christmas rules. The executivesaid there would be flexibility on which day between 23 and 27 December people come together,external, to accommodate those working on Christmas Day. That meeting also discussed travel from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but nothing was agreed. Irish Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said the ban on travel from Britain to the Republic of Ireland was initially for 48 hours, but added he did not want to give anyone ""false hope that there is likely to be any major change"". No border controls would be set up on the Irish border, he added. European nations have begun to impose travel bans on the UK after it reported a more-infectious and ""out of control"" coronavirus variant Mr Ryan said his government would be making concerns about the lack of a GB-NI travel ban known, although it would be up to Stormont to decide what to do. On Monday, the Irish government said there would be at least two consular flights departing on Tuesday evening to bring Irish residents home. BBC News NI has asked if this would include people in Northern Ireland who have an Irish passport. In a statement, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said ""two specific and limited categories of people"" were included. These are international travellers to Ireland who are transiting through Great Britain and Irish people ""currently on short trips to Great Britain"" or who have travelled to Great Britain for ""emergency medical treatment"". In the Republic of Ireland, there were 727 new cases reported on Monday. The number of deaths linked to the virus is unchanged at 2,158. At Sunday's executive meeting, Sinn FÃ©in had proposed prohibiting travel from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, and said this should be a priority. The party wants the health minister to use powers from the 1967 Public Health Act to impose a ban on people entering from Great Britain. But Mrs Foster said such a blanket ban was not a simple matter, would have ""downside consequences"" and that the executive would take legal advice from the attorney general on it. She also said those living inthe most infected areas are already prohibited from travelling, although she recognised some would try to ""game"" the regulations. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? How Northern Ireland's new restrictions affect you Who can you have in your bubble? ""There is a travel ban in place - it covers about 17m people in England, those people can't come to Northern Ireland,"" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. Mrs Foster said the new bubble rules would be placed in law, but added that she did not expect police to be ""knocking on people's doors on Christmas Day or Boxing Day to check they are abiding by the law"". She said the four possible cases of the new variant under examination had ""different sequencing"" from other cases.

On Sunday, four of the five main Stormont parties asked for an urgent executive meeting. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance sent a joint letter to the first and deputy first ministers asking to meet. In the letter, the parties said they must satisfy themselves that the Christmas restrictions and the six-week lockdown from 26 December were sufficiently robust to safeguard public health.

Pound slides lower as European borders close to UK,"Shares in London dropped and the pound lost ground after several EU countries closed their borders to the UK, which has reported a new variant of coronavirus. London's FTSE 100 index fell as much as 3%, before recovering slightly and ending 1.7% lower, as travel firms and others saw big declines. The main German market fell 2.8%, while in France the key bourse dropped 2.4%. US markets were more mixed, amid relief over progress on a virus aid package. After falling in opening trade, the Dow ended the day up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.4%. The Nasdaq fell 0.1%. Earlier, the pound fell more than 1% against the euro and dropped 1.6% against the dollar. Travel curbs hit airline stocks, with British Airways' owner IAG sinking nearly 8% and EasyJet tumbling 7.2%.Aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce was also badly hit, falling more than 3%. The rout was replicated on other European markets. Air France-KLM shares dropped 4%, while planemaker Airbus was down roughly 3%. ""Investors' rosy expectations for 2021 have suddenly vanished,"" said Kazuhiko Saito, chief analyst at commodities broker Fujitomi Co. As well as renewed concern about Covid-19 cases, UK investors were reacting to another missed deadline in trade talks with the EU. London and Brussels are trying to reach a trade deal before the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The talks are set to continue on Monday between negotiators. UK calls emergency meeting as Europe shuts doors Brexit trade talks to continue at 'crucial moment' The stalled negotiations have been partly responsible for the pound fluctuating over recent weeks. Optimism that a deal would be struck had triggered a four-day winning streak for sterling, pushing it back up to just under $1.36 before it reversed course again. Earlier on Monday, the pound fell towards $1.32, with the dollar also being buoyed aftera $900bn (Â£660bn) plan to help the US economyweather the coronavirus pandemic was agreed. However, the pound later regained some of those losses, rising above $1.33. ""The US got its stimulus package through, but it seems that was largely priced in and investors are more concerned with the new strain of Covid-19,"" said Craig Erlam, analyst at Oanda trading group. This video can not be played Barnier: Negotiations have ""just a few hours"" European nations have begun to impose travel bans on the UK after it reported a more-infectious and ""out of control"" coronavirus variant over the weekend. Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium are all halting flights. On Saturday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced a new tier four level of restrictions for London and South East England. ""The lockdown news and the stalemate on Brexit is keeping the market nervous,"" National Australia Bank's senior currency strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters. The prime minister will chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee laterafter France closed its border with the UK for 48 hours. One major sticking point in the Brexit talks is access to the UK's water for fishing. While the fishing industry accounts for just 0.1% of gross domestic product, (GDP)  it is of high political significance. If a trade agreement is not reached by the end of the month, British firms will revert to trading with the EU under rules established by the World Trade Organization (WTO). This will mean imports and exports to the EU would be subject to WTO-negotiated tariffs, essentially a tax on goods. Currency experts have warned that the pound could fall to $1.25 by the middle of next year if no trade agreement is agreed.

Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check With some of the most populous countries across Africa seeing increases in Covid-19 cases, there've been concerns that the continent is facing another spike in infections. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has talked of a ""second wave"" arriving. And there's evidence that a new variant of coronavirus in South Africa may be driving increases there. The country now accounts for more than 60% of daily new cases detected in sub-Saharan Africa. But there are significant variations across the continent, with some countries seeing small or localised spikes, others witnessing more sustained increases and some not yet past an initial rise in cases. Find out morehere. Coronavirus cases are now rising fast again in the UK, driven by a new variant of the virus thought to be much more easily transmissible than other strains. As we heard earlier, a further 33,364 confirmed cases have been announced by the government today. You can see how many cases there are in your areahere. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The Swiss government has said all UK citizens who arrived in
Switzerland after 14 December must immediately quarantine. Entry
for UK citizens by air or land is now prohibited, following a suspension of all
air connections at midnight last night. The government says the measures are
intended to prevent, as much as possible, the spread of the new strain of Covid-19. Thousands of UK citizens have arrived in Switzerland over
the last few days, primarily to take advantage of the open ski slopes over the
holiday season. Geneva airport registered 10,000 UK arrivals this last weekend
alone. The prime minister hosted a press conference a short time ago, alongside Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the key points: Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent The quick approval of the vaccine was a real historic achievement, EMA CEO Emer Cooke said The
European Medicines Agency (EMA) has given the green light for the
Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine to be rolled out within the EU. The
Amsterdam-based regulator brought the decision forward by eight days under
pressure from EU states, after the UK and the US approved the jab more
quickly. This is not a silver bullet, EMA Director Emer Cooke
conceded, but she said recommending the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use across
the EU was ""a step in the right direction... providing citizens have
enough confidence to get vaccinated"". With millions of people's health at stake, the EMA described the
approval of a vaccine within 11 weeks rather than a year as an historic
achievement. Some 43,000 people were involved in one of
the largest trials ever conducted; the EMA's human medicines committee
concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks. With regards to the effectiveness against mutated strains of the
virus, EMA scientists say it is very likely the vaccine will
retain protection against the new variant detected in England. The decision paves the way for EU countries to start
rolling out their mass vaccination programmes within days. Pakistanhas joined dozens of countries in introducing UK travel restrictions following the idenitification of a new strain of coronavirus. The week-long ban on travel to or from the UK begins on Wednesday and applies to all travellers coming from the UK or who have been in the country over the past 10 days. Some exceptions do apply, however, with Pakistani nationals in the UK on visitor or temporary visas permitted to return if they provide a negative test 72 hours before travel, undergo another test upon arrival and quarantine at home for seven days afterwards. Other countries that have introduced UK travel restrictions include:  Find out more about the restrictionshere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is clear the
new variant will lead to tougher restrictions being introduced. The UK's chief
scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, admitted so in the TV briefing. There
is now a high degree of confidence it is leading to faster transmission - although
there is no evidence it causes more serious illness or would disrupt the
effectiveness of the vaccine. But with
infection rates rising rapidly, there is already talk
behind the scenes of more areas in the southern England going into tier four. But with the new variant seeded across the country it
only seems a matter of time before other regions follow suit. Questions are
also being asked about schools. The prime minister said he wanted to keep them
open ""if we possibly can"". The race to vaccinate the vulnerable just got even
more pressing. Greater Manchester's directors of public health are asking anyone who has travelled to the region from any tier four area or Wales to act as if they have the new variant of Covid-19 and self-isolate for at least 10 days when they arrive ""even if they have no symptoms"". The 10 days should start from 19 December and those self-isolating should remain inside the place where theyâre staying for the entire period. ""Other people in the house do not need to self isolate but no visitors should be allowed in that house at all, even on Christmas Day,"" said Jeanelle de Gruchy, who is director of Public Health in Tameside. ""If, during that time, anyone in the house gets symptoms, they must all isolate and the person with symptoms get a test straight away."" Dr de Gruchy described the new coronavirus variant as ""extremely worrying"" because of its ""incredibly infectious"" nature. ""Itâs more important than ever that we all put in that extra effort to keep our friends and families safe in the coming weeks.â  David Hughes of PA asks the PM if he believes ""morale takes a hit"" when he ""overpromises but under-delivers"". He also asks what proportion of the 500,000 vaccines have gone to those in hospital hubs and those in care homes. Johnson replies that it is ""important to be realistic"". He adds that the UK ""is the first country to distribute a clinically approved vaccine"". ""I find that a reason for hope and confidence, I think you should too,"" he said. He also says the ""vast bulk of doses are going to the over-80s and the clinically vulnerable"" but promises to provide an update when there is more data. That is the final question and ends the press conference. Helen CattPolitical correspondent As expected, the prime minister and the transport secretary were keen to try to reassure people that they have things under control. Plans that have been worked on to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit are now being rolled out to deal with disruption caused by European reactions to the coronavirus variant in the UK. Although, as we were reminded in the questioning, the trade negotiations rumble on and those plans could be deployed again for their post-Brexit purpose in just a couple of weeks' time. In terms of solving the immediate issue and resuming usual service across the Channel, the prime minister appeared quite upbeat - even putting a timescale of ""the next few hours"" on resolving the situation. What will now be key is seeing if the reality can match that optimism. The PM is asked if ""lateral flow tests"" - using saliva swabs - should be self-administered by the public. He replies that it is up to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to decide. Sir Patrick Vallance says work has been done to look at the new coronavirus variant. The view that it's transmitting more readily has been ""reinforced"", he adds, meaning the tiering system is vital. There will be ""inevitable"" increases in cases over the next few weeks, as people mix more over Christmas, he says. Pippa Crerar of the Mirror asks why the whole country isn't in lockdown. She also asks why the PM keeps ""over promising and under delivering"". Sir Patrick Vallance says it is the case that the virus will spread more and adds that ""measures are going to need to be increased in due course not reduced"". Boris Johnson says keeping the country in perpetual lockdown would have been disastrous. ""We can look forward to a very different world from Easter onwards,"" he adds. The PM is asked whether he can guarantee schools in England will restart as planned next term. He says the government wants, ""if we possibly can"", to get term under way in a staggered way, as promised. Sir Patrick Vallance says measures to reduce contact between people are ""even more important"" now there is a new variant that spreads more rapidly. ITV's Robert Peston asks if the UK will get a trade deal with the EU. He also asks if tier three will be enough to keep the new variant in check outside London and the South East. Boris Johnson says the position on Brexit talks is ""unchanged"". He adds that if a deal isn't agreed, then trading on World Trade Organization rules ""would be more than satisfactory"". On the second question, Patrick Vallance says it is important take action on tiers on the basis of evidence and urges people to follow the rules whichever tier they are in. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asks how confident the PM is about getting delays through Dover and elsewhere under control. Boris Johnson says he had an ""excellent"" conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, who was keen to get the situation sorted out ""in a few hours"" if possible. The PM says both sides want to resolve ""these problems as fast as possible"". Sir Patrick Vallance says the new coronavirus variant exists, to some extent, in all parts of the country. But people should ""stay local"" to prevent its spread, he argues. Rachel from Kent asks if the PM will consider rolling out the vaccine more widely and to more age groups - given the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant. Boris Johnson says it is ""sensible"" to stick to the plan of beginning vaccinations with those who are particularly vulnerable. Asked why the whole South East of England is not under the strictest tier 4 conditions, the PM says the government ""has to act"" on information about where the new coronavirus is most common and spreading. The situation will be kept under review, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
US reaches long-awaited deal for Covid-19 aidThe deal on the $900bn package comes as millions are jobless or in poverty because of the pandemic.US & Canada,"Economic fallout from the pandemic has left many Americans reliant on food aid The US Congress has passed a long-awaited $900bn (Â£660bn) package of coronavirus pandemic aid after months of political wrangling. Senators approved the bill late on Monday, hours after it was passed by the House of Representatives. The aid includes direct payments for many Americans and support for businesses and unemployment programmes. The money is to accompany a bigger, $1.4tn spending bill to fund government operations over the next nine months. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the package into law quickly. President-elect Joe Biden welcomed the relief package but said Congress needed to get to work to support his Covid-19 relief plan in the new year. Allow Twitter content?

In the House, the bill passed by a vote of 359 to 53 and in the Senate it passed by 92-6. Many Covid-19 relief programmes were set to expire at the end of the month and about 12 million Americans were at risk of losing access to unemployment benefits. But some lawmakers said they felt blind-sided by being asked to vote on a mammoth bill without even having a chance to read it. At nearly 5,600 pages, the legislation was described by the Associated Press news agency as ""the longest bill in memory and probably ever"". The stimulus includes one-off $600 payments to most Americans, and will boost unemployment payments by $300 per week, extending expiration dates for the jobless programmes until the spring. It also contains more than $300bn in support for businesses, and money for vaccine distribution, schools and tenants facing eviction. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home The package includes an extension of an eviction moratorium that was due to expire at the end of this month, leaving tens of millions of Americans at risk of being thrown out of their homes. It contains $25bn in rental aid. The bill also has a provision to end surprise medical billing - where hospital patients get slapped with fees because they were treated by a doctor who was not covered by their health insurer. President Trump has championed calls to end these stealth fees, which are one of the most unpopular pitfalls of the US healthcare system. The deal was announced on Sunday by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican. Speaking on Monday ahead of the vote, he said: ""None of us think this legislation is perfect, but a big bipartisan majority of us recognise the incredible amount of good it will do when we send it to the president's desk. The American people have waited long enough."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, both Democrats, said the package delivered ""urgently needed funds to save the lives and livelihoods of the American people as the virus accelerates"". This video can not be played 'We used to donate to this food bank, now we rely on it' Lawmakers said the bill would send $600 per adult or child for individuals earning up to $75,000 or married couples earning up to $150,000, with families earning more receiving less. The first cheques could arrive as soon as next week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. The payment is half the amount that Congress approved for direct payments during the first round of pandemic relief last spring. The bill does not include substantial aid to local governments, which had been a top priority for many Democrats. In exchange, Republicans agreed to accept a deal without legal protections for businesses from Covid-related lawsuits. Mr Schumer said the package would ""establish a floor, not a ceiling, for coronavirus relief in 2021"", and that Democrats would push for more aid after President-elect Joe Biden took office on 20 January. Congress had been expected to pass the bill by Friday, but negotiations continued through the weekend. The delays led to concerns over whether the government would shut down without a spending bill. Washington has been operating on temporary funding since October, the start of the federal government's financial year. Economic analysts welcomed the deal, but have warned that it is probably too small and arrives too late to avert a slowdown in the recovery. They have also expressed concerns that money devoted to the stimulus cheques - which some families are likely to save - takes away from other, more targeted programmes that might provide a more effective boost to the economy. ""Any Covid relief bill is better than no Covid relief bill, but the measures set to be passed by Congress... do not represent the most efficient use of the $900bn total cost,"" wrote Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. However, on social media, many said the cheque should have been larger, saying $600 per person wasn't large enough to help meaningfully. ""$600 will hopefully save some lives but we all know it's just barely scraping by,"" wrote one social media user in California. Allow Twitter content?

Some also noted that many pandemic relief schemes have been plagued by fraud or delays in spending the money. In March the US approved more than $2.4tn in economic relief, including one-off $1,200 stimulus payments, funds for businesses and money to boost weekly unemployment payments by $600. The package was credited with cushioning the economic hit of the pandemic, which cast more than 20 million Americans out of work this spring and drove the unemployment rate up to 14.7% in April. The US has regained about half of the jobs lost, but economists and businesses have been pushing Congress to approve further economic relief, as programmes expired and money ran out, prompting recovery to slow. Nearly eight million more Americans are now living in poverty. This year has seen the biggest single year increase since poverty tracking began 60 years ago.

Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check With some of the most populous countries across Africa seeing increases in Covid-19 cases, there've been concerns that the continent is facing another spike in infections. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has talked of a ""second wave"" arriving. And there's evidence that a new variant of coronavirus in South Africa may be driving increases there. The country now accounts for more than 60% of daily new cases detected in sub-Saharan Africa. But there are significant variations across the continent, with some countries seeing small or localised spikes, others witnessing more sustained increases and some not yet past an initial rise in cases. Find out morehere. Coronavirus cases are now rising fast again in the UK, driven by a new variant of the virus thought to be much more easily transmissible than other strains. As we heard earlier, a further 33,364 confirmed cases have been announced by the government today. You can see how many cases there are in your areahere. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The Swiss government has said all UK citizens who arrived in
Switzerland after 14 December must immediately quarantine. Entry
for UK citizens by air or land is now prohibited, following a suspension of all
air connections at midnight last night. The government says the measures are
intended to prevent, as much as possible, the spread of the new strain of Covid-19. Thousands of UK citizens have arrived in Switzerland over
the last few days, primarily to take advantage of the open ski slopes over the
holiday season. Geneva airport registered 10,000 UK arrivals this last weekend
alone. The prime minister hosted a press conference a short time ago, alongside Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the key points: Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent The quick approval of the vaccine was a real historic achievement, EMA CEO Emer Cooke said The
European Medicines Agency (EMA) has given the green light for the
Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine to be rolled out within the EU. The
Amsterdam-based regulator brought the decision forward by eight days under
pressure from EU states, after the UK and the US approved the jab more
quickly. This is not a silver bullet, EMA Director Emer Cooke
conceded, but she said recommending the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use across
the EU was ""a step in the right direction... providing citizens have
enough confidence to get vaccinated"". With millions of people's health at stake, the EMA described the
approval of a vaccine within 11 weeks rather than a year as an historic
achievement. Some 43,000 people were involved in one of
the largest trials ever conducted; the EMA's human medicines committee
concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks. With regards to the effectiveness against mutated strains of the
virus, EMA scientists say it is very likely the vaccine will
retain protection against the new variant detected in England. The decision paves the way for EU countries to start
rolling out their mass vaccination programmes within days. Pakistanhas joined dozens of countries in introducing UK travel restrictions following the idenitification of a new strain of coronavirus. The week-long ban on travel to or from the UK begins on Wednesday and applies to all travellers coming from the UK or who have been in the country over the past 10 days. Some exceptions do apply, however, with Pakistani nationals in the UK on visitor or temporary visas permitted to return if they provide a negative test 72 hours before travel, undergo another test upon arrival and quarantine at home for seven days afterwards. Other countries that have introduced UK travel restrictions include:  Find out more about the restrictionshere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is clear the
new variant will lead to tougher restrictions being introduced. The UK's chief
scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, admitted so in the TV briefing. There
is now a high degree of confidence it is leading to faster transmission - although
there is no evidence it causes more serious illness or would disrupt the
effectiveness of the vaccine. But with
infection rates rising rapidly, there is already talk
behind the scenes of more areas in the southern England going into tier four. But with the new variant seeded across the country it
only seems a matter of time before other regions follow suit. Questions are
also being asked about schools. The prime minister said he wanted to keep them
open ""if we possibly can"". The race to vaccinate the vulnerable just got even
more pressing. Greater Manchester's directors of public health are asking anyone who has travelled to the region from any tier four area or Wales to act as if they have the new variant of Covid-19 and self-isolate for at least 10 days when they arrive ""even if they have no symptoms"". The 10 days should start from 19 December and those self-isolating should remain inside the place where theyâre staying for the entire period. ""Other people in the house do not need to self isolate but no visitors should be allowed in that house at all, even on Christmas Day,"" said Jeanelle de Gruchy, who is director of Public Health in Tameside. ""If, during that time, anyone in the house gets symptoms, they must all isolate and the person with symptoms get a test straight away."" Dr de Gruchy described the new coronavirus variant as ""extremely worrying"" because of its ""incredibly infectious"" nature. ""Itâs more important than ever that we all put in that extra effort to keep our friends and families safe in the coming weeks.â  David Hughes of PA asks the PM if he believes ""morale takes a hit"" when he ""overpromises but under-delivers"". He also asks what proportion of the 500,000 vaccines have gone to those in hospital hubs and those in care homes. Johnson replies that it is ""important to be realistic"". He adds that the UK ""is the first country to distribute a clinically approved vaccine"". ""I find that a reason for hope and confidence, I think you should too,"" he said. He also says the ""vast bulk of doses are going to the over-80s and the clinically vulnerable"" but promises to provide an update when there is more data.

EU mulls options as travel bans on UK expandEuropean officials will discuss a co-ordinated travel response to a new coronavirus variant in the UK.,"Numerous countries have introduced travel bans amid concerns over the new coronavirus variant EU officials are discussing a joint response to a new, more infectious Covid-19 variant in the UK, which has sparked travel bans by many countries. Canada and India joined European states in blocking flights from the UK while Europe-bound train services via the Channel Tunnel have been halted. The new variant is said to be up to 70% more transmissible, but there is no evidence that it is more deadly. There is also no proof to suggest that it reacts differently to vaccines. Live updates Two meetings are taking place in Brussels on Monday - one involving health ministers and another with the EU's crisis response team. But no decision is expected until Tuesday, when EU ambassadors meet. A French official told the BBC's Gavin Lee that they were desperate to reopen the borders ""as soon as safely possible"", with one option discussed being the requirement that UK travellers - including lorry drivers - prove they have had a recent negative Covid-19 test.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had an ""excellent"" conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron and was keen to find a solution ""in a few hours"". ""I want to stress we in the UK fully understand our friends' anxieties about the new variant. But it's also true that the risks of transmission sitting alone in the cab is very low. So we hope to make progress,"" he said. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier said the new variant was ""out of control"", while Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands announced they had already detected it. Following the discovery of case in Denmark, neighbouring Sweden banned all foreign travellers from there.

In November it made up around a quarter of cases in London. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December. Three things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London. This variant is unusually highly mutated. The most likely explanation is it emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus. There is no evidence yet to suggest the variant makes the infection more deadly, and at least for now the developed vaccines will almost certainly work against it. However, if the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine, then ""vaccine escape"" happens, and this may be the most concerning element.

Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home The package includes an extension of an eviction moratorium that was due to expire at the end of this month, leaving tens of millions of Americans at risk of being thrown out of their homes. It contains $25bn in rental aid. The bill also has a provision to end surprise medical billing - where hospital patients get slapped with fees because they were treated by a doctor who was not covered by their health insurer. President Trump has championed calls to end these stealth fees, which are one of the most unpopular pitfalls of the US healthcare system. The deal was announced on Sunday by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican. Speaking on Monday ahead of the vote, he said: ""None of us think this legislation is perfect, but a big bipartisan majority of us recognise the incredible amount of good it will do when we send it to the president's desk. The American people have waited long enough."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, both Democrats, said the package delivered ""urgently needed funds to save the lives and livelihoods of the American people as the virus accelerates"". This video can not be played 'We used to donate to this food bank, now we rely on it' Lawmakers said the bill would send $600 per adult or child for individuals earning up to $75,000 or married couples earning up to $150,000, with families earning more receiving less. The first cheques could arrive as soon as next week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. The payment is half the amount that Congress approved for direct payments during the first round of pandemic relief last spring. The bill does not include substantial aid to local governments, which had been a top priority for many Democrats. In exchange, Republicans agreed to accept a deal without legal protections for businesses from Covid-related lawsuits. Mr Schumer said the package would ""establish a floor, not a ceiling, for coronavirus relief in 2021"", and that Democrats would push for more aid after President-elect Joe Biden took office on 20 January. Congress had been expected to pass the bill by Friday, but negotiations continued through the weekend. The delays led to concerns over whether the government would shut down without a spending bill. Washington has been operating on temporary funding since October, the start of the federal government's financial year. Economic analysts welcomed the deal, but have warned that it is probably too small and arrives too late to avert a slowdown in the recovery. They have also expressed concerns that money devoted to the stimulus cheques - which some families are likely to save - takes away from other, more targeted programmes that might provide a more effective boost to the economy. ""Any Covid relief bill is better than no Covid relief bill, but the measures set to be passed by Congress... do not represent the most efficient use of the $900bn total cost,"" wrote Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. However, on social media, many said the cheque should have been larger, saying $600 per person wasn't large enough to help meaningfully. ""$600 will hopefully save some lives but we all know it's just barely scraping by,"" wrote one social media user in California. Allow Twitter content?

Some also noted that many pandemic relief schemes have been plagued by fraud or delays in spending the money. In March the US approved more than $2.4tn in economic relief, including one-off $1,200 stimulus payments, funds for businesses and money to boost weekly unemployment payments by $600. The package was credited with cushioning the economic hit of the pandemic, which cast more than 20 million Americans out of work this spring and drove the unemployment rate up to 14.7% in April. The US has regained about half of the jobs lost, but economists and businesses have been pushing Congress to approve further economic relief, as programmes expired and money ran out, prompting recovery to slow. Nearly eight million more Americans are now living in poverty. This year has seen the biggest single year increase since poverty tracking began 60 years ago.

Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check With some of the most populous countries across Africa seeing increases in Covid-19 cases, there've been concerns that the continent is facing another spike in infections. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has talked of a ""second wave"" arriving. And there's evidence that a new variant of coronavirus in South Africa may be driving increases there. The country now accounts for more than 60% of daily new cases detected in sub-Saharan Africa. But there are significant variations across the continent, with some countries seeing small or localised spikes, others witnessing more sustained increases and some not yet past an initial rise in cases. Find out morehere. Coronavirus cases are now rising fast again in the UK, driven by a new variant of the virus thought to be much more easily transmissible than other strains. As we heard earlier, a further 33,364 confirmed cases have been announced by the government today. You can see how many cases there are in your areahere. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The Swiss government has said all UK citizens who arrived in
Switzerland after 14 December must immediately quarantine. Entry
for UK citizens by air or land is now prohibited, following a suspension of all
air connections at midnight last night. The government says the measures are
intended to prevent, as much as possible, the spread of the new strain of Covid-19. Thousands of UK citizens have arrived in Switzerland over
the last few days, primarily to take advantage of the open ski slopes over the
holiday season. Geneva airport registered 10,000 UK arrivals this last weekend
alone. The prime minister hosted a press conference a short time ago, alongside Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the key points: Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent The quick approval of the vaccine was a real historic achievement, EMA CEO Emer Cooke said The
European Medicines Agency (EMA) has given the green light for the
Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine to be rolled out within the EU. The
Amsterdam-based regulator brought the decision forward by eight days under
pressure from EU states, after the UK and the US approved the jab more
quickly. This is not a silver bullet, EMA Director Emer Cooke
conceded, but she said recommending the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use across
the EU was ""a step in the right direction... providing citizens have
enough confidence to get vaccinated"". With millions of people's health at stake, the EMA described the
approval of a vaccine within 11 weeks rather than a year as an historic
achievement. Some 43,000 people were involved in one of
the largest trials ever conducted; the EMA's human medicines committee
concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks. With regards to the effectiveness against mutated strains of the
virus, EMA scientists say it is very likely the vaccine will
retain protection against the new variant detected in England. The decision paves the way for EU countries to start
rolling out their mass vaccination programmes within days. Pakistanhas joined dozens of countries in introducing UK travel restrictions following the idenitification of a new strain of coronavirus. The week-long ban on travel to or from the UK begins on Wednesday and applies to all travellers coming from the UK or who have been in the country over the past 10 days. Some exceptions do apply, however, with Pakistani nationals in the UK on visitor or temporary visas permitted to return if they provide a negative test 72 hours before travel, undergo another test upon arrival and quarantine at home for seven days afterwards. Other countries that have introduced UK travel restrictions include:  Find out more about the restrictionshere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is clear the
new variant will lead to tougher restrictions being introduced. The UK's chief
scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, admitted so in the TV briefing. There
is now a high degree of confidence it is leading to faster transmission - although
there is no evidence it causes more serious illness or would disrupt the
effectiveness of the vaccine. But with
infection rates rising rapidly, there is already talk
behind the scenes of more areas in the southern England going into tier four. But with the new variant seeded across the country it
only seems a matter of time before other regions follow suit. Questions are
also being asked about schools. The prime minister said he wanted to keep them
open ""if we possibly can"". The race to vaccinate the vulnerable just got even
more pressing. Greater Manchester's directors of public health are asking anyone who has travelled to the region from any tier four area or Wales to act as if they have the new variant of Covid-19 and self-isolate for at least 10 days when they arrive ""even if they have no symptoms"". The 10 days should start from 19 December and those self-isolating should remain inside the place where theyâre staying for the entire period. ""Other people in the house do not need to self isolate but no visitors should be allowed in that house at all, even on Christmas Day,"" said Jeanelle de Gruchy, who is director of Public Health in Tameside. ""If, during that time, anyone in the house gets symptoms, they must all isolate and the person with symptoms get a test straight away."" Dr de Gruchy described the new coronavirus variant as ""extremely worrying"" because of its ""incredibly infectious"" nature. ""Itâs more important than ever that we all put in that extra effort to keep our friends and families safe in the coming weeks.â  David Hughes of PA asks the PM if he believes ""morale takes a hit"" when he ""overpromises but under-delivers"". He also asks what proportion of the 500,000 vaccines have gone to those in hospital hubs and those in care homes. Johnson replies that it is ""important to be realistic"". He adds that the UK ""is the first country to distribute a clinically approved vaccine"". ""I find that a reason for hope and confidence, I think you should too,"" he said. He also says the ""vast bulk of doses are going to the over-80s and the clinically vulnerable"" but promises to provide an update when there is more data. That is the final question and ends the press conference. Helen CattPolitical correspondent As expected, the prime minister and the transport secretary were keen to try to reassure people that they have things under control. Plans that have been worked on to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit are now being rolled out to deal with disruption caused by European reactions to the coronavirus variant in the UK. Although, as we were reminded in the questioning, the trade negotiations rumble on and those plans could be deployed again for their post-Brexit purpose in just a couple of weeks' time. In terms of solving the immediate issue and resuming usual service across the Channel, the prime minister appeared quite upbeat - even putting a timescale of ""the next few hours"" on resolving the situation. What will now be key is seeing if the reality can match that optimism. The PM is asked if ""lateral flow tests"" - using saliva swabs - should be self-administered by the public. He replies that it is up to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to decide. Sir Patrick Vallance says work has been done to look at the new coronavirus variant. The view that it's transmitting more readily has been ""reinforced"", he adds, meaning the tiering system is vital. There will be ""inevitable"" increases in cases over the next few weeks, as people mix more over Christmas, he says. Pippa Crerar of the Mirror asks why the whole country isn't in lockdown. She also asks why the PM keeps ""over promising and under delivering"". Sir Patrick Vallance says it is the case that the virus will spread more and adds that ""measures are going to need to be increased in due course not reduced"". Boris Johnson says keeping the country in perpetual lockdown would have been disastrous. ""We can look forward to a very different world from Easter onwards,"" he adds. The PM is asked whether he can guarantee schools in England will restart as planned next term. He says the government wants, ""if we possibly can"", to get term under way in a staggered way, as promised. Sir Patrick Vallance says measures to reduce contact between people are ""even more important"" now there is a new variant that spreads more rapidly. ITV's Robert Peston asks if the UK will get a trade deal with the EU. He also asks if tier three will be enough to keep the new variant in check outside London and the South East. Boris Johnson says the position on Brexit talks is ""unchanged"". He adds that if a deal isn't agreed, then trading on World Trade Organization rules ""would be more than satisfactory"". On the second question, Patrick Vallance says it is important take action on tiers on the basis of evidence and urges people to follow the rules whichever tier they are in. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asks how confident the PM is about getting delays through Dover and elsewhere under control. Boris Johnson says he had an ""excellent"" conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, who was keen to get the situation sorted out ""in a few hours"" if possible. The PM says both sides want to resolve ""these problems as fast as possible"". Sir Patrick Vallance says the new coronavirus variant exists, to some extent, in all parts of the country. But people should ""stay local"" to prevent its spread, he argues. Rachel from Kent asks if the PM will consider rolling out the vaccine more widely and to more age groups - given the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant. Boris Johnson says it is ""sensible"" to stick to the plan of beginning vaccinations with those who are particularly vulnerable. Asked why the whole South East of England is not under the strictest tier 4 conditions, the PM says the government ""has to act"" on information about where the new coronavirus is most common and spreading. The situation will be kept under review, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Urgent talks sought over travel bans,"This video can not be played Only freight traffic is being allowed to cross the Irish Sea from Wales Passengers have been left stranded attempting to get in and out of Wales after several countries banned most UK travel over a new coronavirus variant. Bukola Sokunbi-Walton, from Galway, was travelling from London to spend Christmas with her children when her ferry from Holyhead was cancelled. Meanwhile, another man has been unable to return to mid Wales from the Liberian capital Monrovia. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonchaired an emergency meetingon Monday. After it finished, the Welsh Government said: ""On the impact of the travel bans imposed by European partners, the first minister updated the meeting on the current situation at Welsh ports. ""While traffic management plans are not needed at this point, the first minister made clear that arrangements with the Irish Republic were very important in sustaining that position."" EU mulls options as travel bans on UK expand New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Meanwhile, Toyota said it would close its engine factory in Deeside, Flintshire, two days earlier than planned for Christmas. It will now shut on Tuesday with bosses anticipating parts shortages because of disruption caused at ports. European Union member states are due to meet in Brusselsto discuss a co-ordinated response to the new coronavirus variant in the UK. The Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, France and Canada, have all suspended flights from the UK. Stena Line and Irish Ferries, which run routes from Wales to Ireland, have both banned passengers on Monday and Tuesday due to the Irish government's ban, with only freight and essential workers allowed to cross. Ms Sokunbi-Walton said she only found out about the ban when she arrived at Holyhead ferry terminal on Monday morning and said she was ""utterly gutted"" that she cannot get home for at least two days. Ferries have been running from Holyhead on Monday morning - but for freight and essential workers only She said: ""I just expected to get on the ferry as usual and go home because I have three children at home waiting for me, but it's very upsetting and disappointing that I can't do that right now. ""They [the Irish government] should have given us ample time to prepare for that, at least given us information so that we would know what to do. If we had found out earlier we wouldn't have driven all the way [from London] - we would've waited for the 48 hours before coming here. ""It's very tiring. We don't have any accommodation here, we're sitting out in the car, it's coldâ¦ it's really a tough time."" While Ms Sokunbi-Walton is trying to leave Wales, others are struggling to get back as a result of the new restrictions. Les Banks Irvine, who lives in Monrovia, Liberia, was trying to get back to mid Wales where his two children and three grandchildren live. But he said he was told he could not board his flight to Belgium, as his connecting flight was taking him to the UK. Les Banks Irvine has been unable to return to Wales to see his family He said: ""There's a great deal of not-knowing. I'm sure it is for everybody. ""I was hoping to be spending some time with my two children and three grandchildren in mid Wales, but it now looks like I am stranded here in Monrovia. ""I'm working for a company who bottle Coca-Cola. I've been here for about nine months this year. I last saw my family at the end of August."" Stena Vinga arrived at Fishguard on Monday morning Irish Ferries, which has passenger routes between Holyhead and Dublin, and Pembroke Dock and Rosslare, said essential travel ""is permitted"", but travellers are ""advised to keep all necessary stops to a minimum and minimise contact with people as much as possible"". Stena Line has imposed similar rules on its crossings between Holyhead and Dublin, as well as Fishguard to Rosslare. A spokesman said that the company had managed to contact almost all passengers since the travel restrictions were imposed, meaning very few had turned up at the ports. ""The ferries are still operating and freight isn't affected by the restrictions.  We're in close contact with any affected passengers,"" he said. The Irish government said: ""Arrangements are being put in place to facilitate the repatriation of Irish residents on short trips to Great Britain and planning to return in the coming days, as well as international travellers to Ireland who are transiting through Great Britain.""

Policing Christmas rule-breakers 'difficult',"From Sunday people are being warned to ""stay-at-home"" with it being illegal to leave unless for essential reasons Trying to enforce lockdown laws over Christmas could put police at risk of harm and in ""difficult"" situations, the Welsh Police Federation has warned. Wales entered the highest level of coronavirus restrictions on Sunday, with two households only allowed to meet on Christmas Day. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said he wants to see an ""enforcement-first approach"" to rule-breakers. But the body representing police said officers were ""under immense pressure"". Mark Jones, of the North Wales Police Federation, said passions would be high at Christmas and officers were trying to balance compassion and enforce laws, while putting themselves at risk of abuse and catching the virus themselves. Coronavirus laws on travel and meeting othershad been due to be relaxed from 23 to 27 December, to allow people to celebrate the festive period with loved ones. Officers coughed at and spat on policing coronavirus But after concern over a new variant of the virus, Wales was placed in a level four""stay-at-home"" lockdown at midnight on Sunday, and festivities cut to just one day - Christmas Day. Under the law, people will only be able to travel on 25 December to see one other household - plus a single person household - and must return on the same day. Those in breach of rules face being told to go home or be returned home by officers, and issued with a Â£60 fine, which rises to Â£120 for a second breach. On Sunday, Mr Gething said there was ""growing unhappiness and anger"" towards people who were ""flagrant rule-breakers"" during recent months. Until now, Welsh police forces had focussed on engaging and educating first time offenders, with fines only happening ifpeople were found in breach of ruleson multiple occasions. But Mr Gething said the Welsh Government had spoken to councils and the police, and he wanted to now see an enforcement-first approach. He told BBC Wales catching people who break the two household limit would be difficult unless they made a lot of noise or neighbours spied on them. ""Where it comes to house parties and more egregious breaches, yes I do expect enforcement to take place. I do expect people to get fined,"" he said. ""If you go into a house party with 20 different people you know damn well that you're breaking the rules."" What are the Christmas rules in Wales? What's the advice on travelling over Christmas? How does Wales compare to the other UK nations? Mr Jones, general secretary for the Police Federation in north Wales, said enforcing the rules would be ""difficult"" as there were no extra officers to deal with new laws under a time of ""immense pressure"". He said officers were responding to serious crimes and increased pressures over the festive period - such as a rise in domestic violence - and many officers were already working on rest days and holidays to cover for sick colleagues. Mr Jones said the majority of the public were supportive of the rules and co-operated with police, but a small minority were ""flouting"" the law, putting themselves and officers who had to intervene at risk. ""By virtue of the fact they are already disregarding the regulations they are invariably not very happy or compliant with police when being dealt with,"" he said,adding officers had been deliberately coughed on and spat at. ""These police officers are people, and they are having to get up close and personal and deal with these individuals."" Police in Wales have been called on to enforce sometimes ""unpopular"" Covid rules, say front-line officers He added that the Christmas rules meant officers would be put ""in very difficult"" positions as they also wanted to see their loved ones and so understood people's desperation. ""Police don't create the law, they just have to enforce them, which puts them in a no-win situation,"" he said. ""Officers are human beings, they are doing their very best to walk that tightrope of enforcing the laws of the land, but also trying to balance human compassion and people's feelings, and strong views on the regulations. ""I speak to officers who are really, really worried about bringing this silent killer back into their homes, but they understand they have a duty as a police officer. ""Suddenly it's a police officer who will have no choice but to deal with those people in the most appropriate way, and that will inevitably involve them putting themselves at risk of being assaulted or being attacked."" Dyfed-Powys Police officers pulled over motorists on the A477 between Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire during Wales' firebreak lockdown Chief Constable Pam Kelly, of Gwent Police, told BBC Radio Wales that officers would not be ""knocking on people's doors asking how many people are in a house"", but would be enforcing the laws. She said: ""Police officers have had to be going in and out of people's houses throughout this entire pandemic, dealing with assaults, domestic abuse and of course investigating crime, and then they go home to their families. ""So let's reduce the pressure on all services by being really careful over Christmas, let's respect agencies, respect each other so that we reduce the spread of the virus over Christmas. ""If they don't, and they flout the law, of course we will have to enforce the law, but we'd rather not do that."" Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn said trying to keep an eye on people's movements would be ""difficult"" over the Christmas break. Mr Llywelyn said police would not be going ""house to house to check"" how many people were celebrating together, and emergency and high-risk calls would be a priority over any calls concerning rules being broken. He told BBC Wales police would be visible in communities and on roads, to provide reassurance, and would be able to stop cars, but this was like any other year, where officers would be focussing on preventing speeding and drink driving. ""The key message here is for people to take personal responsibility in relation to their movements... the guidance is there for a reason, it's to stop the spread of coronavirus,"" he said. ""Where we do get information that people are flouting the rules, maybe house parties are taking place, the police will be there to respond.""

EU mulls UK travel ban options,"Numerous countries have introduced travel bans amid concerns over the new coronavirus variant EU officials are discussing a joint response to a new, more infectious Covid-19 variant in the UK, which has sparked travel bans by many countries. Canada and India joined European states in blocking flights from the UK while Europe-bound train services via the Channel Tunnel have been halted. The new variant is said to be up to 70% more transmissible, but there is no evidence that it is more deadly. There is also no proof to suggest that it reacts differently to vaccines. Live updates Two meetings are taking place in Brussels on Monday - one involving health ministers and another with the EU's crisis response team. But no decision is expected until Tuesday, when EU ambassadors meet. A French official told the BBC's Gavin Lee that they were desperate to reopen the borders ""as soon as safely possible"", with one option discussed being the requirement that UK travellers - including lorry drivers - prove they have had a recent negative Covid-19 test. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""British supermarkets say supply chain is strong and robust"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had an ""excellent"" conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron and was keen to find a solution ""in a few hours"". ""I want to stress we in the UK fully understand our friends' anxieties about the new variant. But it's also true that the risks of transmission sitting alone in the cab is very low. So we hope to make progress,"" he said. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier said the new variant was ""out of control"", while Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands announced they had already detected it. Following the discovery of case in Denmark, neighbouring Sweden banned all foreign travellers from there. Christmas 'in jeopardy' after ban on UK travellers Pound slides lower as European borders close to UK New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Also on Monday, the EU's medicines regulator approved the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccinefor use in all 27 member states. The vaccine is already being administered in the UK and in the US, and some European countries plan to begin administering doses from 27 December. Francesuspended all travel links, including freight lorries, with the UK for 48 hours from midnight (23:00 GMT) on Sunday. Thousands of lorries move between the countries every day. Eurotunnelsaid it would suspend access to its Folkestone terminal for traffic heading to Calais. People booked to travel on Monday can get a refund. Trains will still run from Calais to Folkestone. The ferry terminal at Dover is now closed for all accompanied traffic leaving the UK until further noticebecause of the French restrictions. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson chaired a meeting of the emergency committee Cobra to discuss the issue on Monday. Other countries took different action in response to the new virus variant: Germany, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Bulgaria, Romania,Malta, Croatia, Lithuania, LatviaandEstoniaall suspended flights from the UK One of the most popular holiday destinations for UK citizens,Spain, also suspended flights Italyblocked all flights from the UK until 6 January, while theNetherlandsbanned all passenger flights from the UK until 1 January ""at the latest"".

Turkeyhas temporarily banned all flights from the UK, as haveNorwayandSwitzerland Canadahas suspended entry of all passenger flights from the UK for 72 hours, effective from midnight (05:00 GMT). Passengers who arrived in Canada from the UK on Sunday would be ""subject to secondary screening and enhanced measures, including increased scrutiny of quarantine plans"", it said. Russiais suspending flights from the UK for one week Indiais suspending flights from the UK from 23:59 (18:29 GMT) on Tuesday until 31 December Hong Kong, Israel,Iran, Croatia, MoroccoandKuwaitbrought in restrictions on UK travel In Latin America,Argentina,Chile,Colombia,Ecuador,El SalvadorandPeruall banned flights from the UK Saudi Arabia,OmanandKuwaitwent even further, closing their borders completely for a week The new variant was first detected in September. In November it made up around a quarter of cases in London. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December. Three things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London. This variant is unusually highly mutated. The most likely explanation is it emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus. There is no evidence yet to suggest the variant makes the infection more deadly, and at least for now the developed vaccines will almost certainly work against it. However, if the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine, then ""vaccine escape"" happens, and this may be the most concerning element.

European regulator says Boeing's 737 Max is safe,"The head of Europe's aviation safety agency, EASA, has told the BBC he is ""certain"" Boeing's 737 Max is now safe to fly. Executive Director Patrick Ky said his organisation had ""left no stone unturned"" in its review of the aircraft and its analysis of design changes made by the manufacturer. The plane was grounded in March 2019. That was after it was involved in two catastrophic accidents, in which a total of 346 people died. It has already been cleared to resume flights in the US and Brazil. EASA expects to give permission for it to return to service in Europe in mid-January. The plane's first accident occurred in October 2018, when a Lion Air jet came down in the sea off Indonesia. The second involved an Ethiopian Airlines version that crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, just four months later. Both have been attributed to flawed flight control software, which became active at the wrong time and prompted the aircraft to go into a catastrophic dive. Since the Ethiopian crash, EASA has been carrying out a root-and-branch review of the 737 Max's design, independently from a similar process undertaken by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The review, says Mr Ky, went well beyond the immediate causes of the two accidents and the modifications proposed by Boeing. The Boeing 737 Max was grounded in March 2019 following two deadly crashes ""We went further and reviewed all the flight controls, all the machinery of the aircraft"", he explains. The aim, he says, was to look at anything which could cause a critical failure. In order to return to service, existing planes will now have to be equipped with new computer software, as well as undergoing changes to their wiring and cockpit instrumentation. Pilots will need to undergo mandatory training, and each plane will have to undergo a test flight to ensure the changes have been carried out correctly. US regulators have set out similar conditions. As a result, Mr Ky insists, ""We are very confident that it is now a very safe aircraft."" Most of the initial safety certification work on the 737 Max was carried out by the FAA, and simply endorsed by EASA under the terms of a long-standing international agreement. This video can not be played Zipporah Kuria's father Joseph Waithaka was one of 157 people killed when a Boeing 737 Max crashed in March 2019 But with the FAA now facing intense criticism for allowing an apparently flawed aircraft into service, Mr Ky says in future, things will be done differently. ""What is certain is that there were lessons learned from this, which will trigger new actions from our side"", he explains. In particular, where EASA is not the primary authority carrying out safety work, it will examine other people's decisions much more closely. ""We will perform our own safety assessment, which is going to be much more comprehensive than it used to be"", he says. But have regulators lost credibility and public confidence since the disasters? ""I hope not"", says Mr Ky. ""I think we have made a lot of progress in assessing what went wrong and what can be made better ""I hope the public trusts in us when we say we think, we are certain, that the aircraft is safe to fly"".

"Family left 4,000 miles apart after 'visa bungle'","Rosie Brown's two youngest children are stranded with her in the UK A family face Christmas separated by the Atlantic Ocean in what their lawyer says is a terrible bureaucratic bungle. Rosie Brown and her two youngest children are stranded in the UK while her US-born husband and four other children are 4,000 miles away in Ohio. They ended the lease on their Cardiff home expecting to move to the US. But her permanent residency card to live there is out of date, and a new one cannot be sent because she needs to provide her fingerprints - in the US. The Department of Homeland Security and the US Citizenship and Immigration Service said they could not discuss individual cases. Joshua Brown is in the US with the pair's four eldest children Joshua, 37, and Rosie, 35, married 16 years ago in Texas but returned to the UK six years ago for Joshua's postgraduate studies with their four children, and had two more in Wales. But when Joshua's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year, the family decided to return to the US. ""Rosie applied for permanent residency when we got married, but it's just been pending, we've been waiting for her to be approved for her green card,"" Joshua said. After being told she would be allowed back into the US, Rosie booked a flight for herself and her two youngest children. But she was told at the airport she was not allowed on the flight as her green card was out of date - but the only way to update it is to provide her fingerprints in the US. ""I just feel so heartbroken and defeated right now,"" Rosie said. ""I miss my children so much, and my husband."" Joshua, who was waiting for her at the airport, had to drive home and tell the four eldest children their mother and sisters were not allowed to fly. Joshua's mother's breast cancer is now stage four and terminal, meaning the family longed to be together over Christmas. ""For her this has been especially terrible. She very much wanted us all to be together this Christmas, that was really important for her,"" Joshua said. The family, expecting to be leaving for the US, ended the lease on their Cardiff house, packed up their belongings to be shipped to the US and gave away toys and books. Rosie and the two girls were left with just a few bags, but four months later they are still in the UK. ""I keep hoping for a miracle,"" Rosie said. ""I can't think that I won't be with my children and my husband for Christmas. ""There are days when I burst into tears a lot, I'm sobbing, looking at Christmas decorations thinking I don't know how I'm going to get through today. I just miss the kids so much."" Visa rules creating 'price on love' 'Inhumane' to deny two-year-old girl a UK visa Visa U-turn for stroke survivor's wife She says trying to be a mother to four children thousands of miles away is difficult, even with video conferencing. ""I've got daughters who are teenagers with complex emotions who are struggling,"" she said. ""I've missed birthdays, Thanksgiving, they've had Covid. As a mum you just want to be there for that. ""I want to wake up and my children be there. I want to watch Christmas films with them and sing Christmas carols. Rosie described how she longs to clean up her children's messes again ""I want to clean up their messes, I want to wash their dishes. That would be the biggest Christmas present for them this year, to be together."" The family's friends in Cardiff and around the UK have donated to a campaign fund to help the Browns pay for a US lawyer to fight their case. Lawyer Margaret Wong, who specialises in immigration cases, described the situation as ""terrible"". ""This is very cruel, but they are not the only family being denied entry,"" she said.

Thailand hit by worst Covid surge yet,"The outbreak has largely impacted the Myanmar migrant workers who toil in Thailand's seafood industry After months of avoiding the surge in cases seen by its neighbours, Thailand has been hit by its worst Covid-19 outbreak yet. Tens of thousands of people are being tested after hundreds of cases linked to its biggest seafood market. It has locked down Samut Sakhon, the coastal province near the capital Bangkok, home to the market which employs mostly migrant workers from neighbouring Myanmar. Workers have been ordered to stay home. Thailand was the first country outside China to register cases of Covid-19. But it has recorded a relatively low virus caseload since, with just over 4,000 cases and 60 deaths before this latest outbreak. It started with a 67-year-old Thai female prawn seller testing positive on Thursday. Her case at Mahachai market - the heart of Thailand's multi-billion-dollar seafood industry - set the mass testing in motion. Four cases were reported the next day and by Sunday that number had jumped to 689 - most of them Myanmar migrants, the public health ministry said. It added that the woman had no history of leaving the country and authorities were searching for the source of the infection. Along with stepping up testing, Myanmar workers who live around the market have been ordered not to leave their residences, according to AFP news agency. ""We are locking and banning them from moving,"" the health ministry's permanent secretary Kietphgum Wongit said, adding that the workers were being provided with food and water. Lines of migrant workers - mostly from Myanmar - were seen waiting for their coronavirus swab in the market on Sunday, alongside some Thais. Health officials said most of the cases identified so far have been asymptomatic, reported Reuters news agency. A further 360 migrant workers tested positive on Monday - the largest daily infection numbers for Covid-19 ever recorded in Thailand. Tens of thousands of people are set to be tested after this outbreak - Thailand's biggest yet Taweesin Visanuyothin, a spokesman for Thailand's Covid-19 taskforce, said authorities would also be conducting ""active tracing in several communities of about 10,300 people"", AFP said. Samut Sakhon will stay under lockdown and night-time curfew until 3 January. Authorities have said up to 40,000 people will be tested there and in nearby provinces. Thailand had largely appeared to have kept Covid-19 in check, recording a low death toll for a nation of 70 million people that shares porous borders with four countries, including Myanmar. ""We will have to cut the epidemic cycle quickly. We already have experience in handling it,"" Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha posted on his Facebook account over the weekend. A Myanmar worker who has helped coordinate testing in Samut Sakhon told AFP that anti-migrant sentiment had been shared on social media - with Thais accusing the workers of importing Covid-19. In Myanmar the nation's already fragile healthcare system has been overwhelmed by a spike in coronavirus cases after a big second wave hit the country in mid-August - with daily cases rising above 1,000 in recent months. Authorities in Bangkok have urged people to intensify preventative measures against the coronavirus by avoiding gatherings and observing social distancing. They have also asked public and private sector organisations to cancel their annual new year countdown parties. The latest outbreak comes as Thailand attempts to revive a tourist industry hit hard by the pandemic. On Thursday it had eased restrictions to permit more foreigners to visit the kingdom.

Dover halts traffic to France over virus fears,"The government and trade groups have warned of ""serious disruption"" after France blocked arrivals of UK passengers for 48 hours over concerns about the new coronavirus variant. Freight lorries cannot cross by sea or through the Eurotunnel and the Port of Dover has closed to outbound traffic. About 10,000 lorries a day travel between Dover and Calais during peak periods such as Christmas. UK ministers will discuss the move at a Cobra emergency committee on Monday. On Sunday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps urged the public and hauliers not to travel to ports in Kent, saying ""significant disruption"" was likely in the area. Kent Police have mobilised Operation Stack - a system to park lorries on the M20 motorway in Kent at times of disruption - to deal with the build-up of traffic. Richard Burnett, head of the Road Haulage Association, told the BBC's Today programme that the ban could deter EU hauliers from coming to the UK over fears they will end up being stranded. ""The retailers have done a good job of stocking up on ambient products [for Christmas] - there will be plenty of stock,"" he added. ""But the fresh food supply, where it's short shelf life and there will be product on its way now, that's where the challenge comes from. ""The retailers will absolutely be assessing their inbound flows this morning and understanding whether or not those flows are on their way into the retail distribution centres around the country and I'm sure there will be further reassurance given today that those things are in control."" Kent Police said it had implemented the closure of the coast-bound carriageway of the motorway between Junctions 8 and 11 as a ""contingency measure"". The Department for Transport has said that Manston Airport in Kent is being readied to take up to 4,000 lorries to ease congestion in the county. The Port of Dover is closed to traffic leaving the UK ""until further notice"" due to border restrictions in France,port authorities said in a statement,external. ""Both accompanied freight and passenger customers are asked not to travel to the port,"" it said. ""We understand that the restrictions will be in place for 48 hours from midnight."" Freight coming to Britain from France will be allowed, but there are fears lorry drivers will not travel to avoid being stuck in the UK. Unaccompanied freight, such as containers or lorry trailers on their own can still be transported, but outbound vans, lorries and trucks are banned. Hauliers are advised to find other routes into the continent. Cases rise as Christmas rules come into force Nations impose UK travel bans over new variant New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Border restrictions could mean disruption to food supplies, as well as difficulties in meeting orders of British goods in continental Europe. ""Tonight's suspension of accompanied freight traffic from the UK to France has the potential to cause serious disruption to UK Christmas fresh food supplies - and exports of UK food and drink,"" Food and Drink Federation (FDF) chief executive Ian Wright warned on Sunday. ""The government must very urgently persuade the French government to exempt accompanied freight from its ban."" Freight industry lobby group Logistics UK said it was concerned about the welfare of drivers going from the UK to France, and said they should have access to regular testing. It appealed for calm from shoppers, and said it was ""maintaining close contact with UK government to ensure that supplies of fresh produce are available throughout Christmas and the new year"". The British Retail Consortium (BRC) joined the FDF in appealing to the government to find a solution, but also added that there should be no immediate shortages. ""Retailers have stocked up on goods ahead of Christmas which should prevent immediate problems,"" the BRC said. The government does not think the restrictions will affect the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines to the UK, according to BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called on the government to extend the Brexit transition period as it deals with the new coronavirus variant, saying it was a ""profoundly serious situation"" which ""demands our 100% attention"". The current transition period is due to expire at the end of the year and the EU and UK are still negotiating a trade deal. Without it both sides will have to collect expensive tariffs that the Office for Budget Responsibility says could harm the UK's economy. Labour's Rachel Reeves, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, called the development ""deeply worrying"". ""The country needs to hear credible plans and reassurance that essential supplies will be safeguarded, including our NHS, supermarkets and manufacturers with crucial supply chains,"" she said. The block on freight traffic into France came as a number of European countries banned flights and other travel from the UK  over fears about VUI - a mutation of the coronavirus that is spreading rapidly in the UK. France, Italy, Ireland, Germany, Belgium the Netherlands and Turkey are among those to have banned flights from the UKwhile other nations are considering the move.

PM to chair emergency meeting amid travel bans,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""British supermarkets say supply chain is strong and robust"". More than 40 countries have banned UK arrivals because of concerns about the spread of a new variant of coronavirus. Flights from the UK are beingsuspendedto territories across the world including Spain, India and Hong Kong. France shut its border with the UK for 48 hours, meaning no lorries or ferries can leave from the port of Dover. Boris Johnson said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron and both sides wanted to resolve ""these problems as fast as possible"". The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference: ""We had a very good call and we both understand each other's positions."" Mr Johnson, who earlier chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee, added: ""We are working with our friends across the Channel to unblock the flow of trade."" And French Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune said they would announce on Tuesday what measures were being introduced ""after this phase of emergency and harsh precaution that we had to take"". He said they would come into effect from Wednesday. European Union member states met earlier in Brussels to discuss a co-ordinated response, with officials suggesting a requirement for tests could be imposed on all people arriving from the UK. It came as the Northern Ireland Executive met on Monday night to considerwhether to impose a travel ban between NI and England, Scotland and Wales. Christmas 'in jeopardy' after ban on UK travellers Laura Kuenssberg: The battle to control a sprawling crisis Flights shut down as EU discusses UK virus threat New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Countries to impose a ban on UK arrivals include Belgium, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Russia, and Switzerland. Some of the bans are already in force while others are to begin on Tuesday. Eurotunnel services to France are also suspended and Eurostar trains to Belgium are not operating. However, Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said he hoped travel from the UK could begin on Wednesday or Thursday. This video can not be played Isabella Hussell was on board the ferry when it was cancelled Meanwhile, Royal Mail says it has temporarily suspended all mail services to Europe, with the exception of the Republic of Ireland, due to the ""current restrictions around air, road, ferry and train movements from the UK"". The latest figures released on Monday reveal that another 33,364 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus. There were also a further 215 deaths within 28 days of testing positive, bringing the nation's total to 67,616. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned that the new variant of the virus -which may be up to 70% more transmissible- is ""getting out of control"". The new variant has spread quickly in London and south-east England, but health officials say there is no evidence that it is more deadly or would react differently to vaccines. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the situation as a ""real emergency"",saying: ""The news over the last 24 hours has been deeply disturbing. The number of coronavirus cases has nearly doubled in the last week. ""We can have no more over-promising and false hope, confused messages and slow decision-making. We need strong, clear and decisive leadership."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government had plans for coping with port disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit and should now activate the measures. As the day has gone it, it seems the frustration of some hauliers has grown. Many have been sounding their horns - after being refused entry to the Port of Dover. A few have been brandishing paperwork at the officials keeping them out. The reality is, whatever documentation they may have, they aren't being allowed to leave the UK today. The only journey they're being told to make is to the back of the ever-growing queue that makes up Operation Stack. That will mean spending tonight, and all day tomorrow in their cabs - when all they want to do is get back home. It's a depressing situation in the run-up to Christmas.  And if France does insist that all drivers need to be tested before being allowed to cross the Channel, it's likely some won't make it back before the big day. The coast-bound carriageway of the M20 motorway has been shut between Junctions 7 and 12 and Junction 9 and 8 London-bound, according to Highways England. It said all European freight destined for Dover Port and Eurotunnel Terminals ""will be no longer stacked on the M20 coastbound between junctions 8 and 12 and is being directed to Manston Airfield"". Manston had been readied to take up to 4,000 lorries. On Monday morning, Mr Shapps said the situation in Kent was ""not too disrupted"" saying ""it's mostly European and French hauliers getting caught up in this"" and that about 20% of the overall 32,000 units of freight shipped today were affected by the restrictions. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast that Covid-19 vaccine supplies - which come from Belgium - would not be affected by travel bans, as they come to the UK via unaccompanied containers. Unaccompanied freight, such as containers or lorry trailers on their own, can still be transported. This video can not be played France border closure: 'In the short term this won't have an impact' Iain Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, told BBC Breakfast there was ""no need"" for shoppers to panic-buy as a result of the border restrictions. But he added there was ""concern"" around food supplies in the longer term, particularly after Christmas. About 10,000 lorries travel between Dover and Calais every day during peak periods such as Christmas. But Downing Street has urged people to ""shop normally"" in the run up to Christmas, adding the UK has ""diverse and resilient supply chains"" and the majority of food does not enter the UK via Calais. In other key developments: Supermarkets have played down fears of immediate food shortages after the French border restrictions, butwarned of ""serious disruption"" if the blockade is prolonged UK-EU talks to agree a post-Brexit trade deal are set to continueafter the two sides missed a deadline for terms set by the European parliament The government has pledged to providerefunds for rail and coach ticketsbought for the Christmas travel window between 23 - 27 December, after millions of people across the UK saw their festive plans severely restricted orscrapped Shares in London havefallen sharplyand the pound has lost ground since several countries closed their borders to the UK SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug?

Is there light at end of Covid tunnel?,"The roll out of the biggest vaccination programme in the history of the UK is under way. This week, some GP practices in England will join the major hospitals in starting to offer the jab. The plan is to immunise all over-50s plus younger adults with underlying health conditions. The rest of the population could then follow suit. But how long will all this take? Vaccinating 55 million people - children are not being considered for the jab at this stage - is a mammoth task. It will take many months, perhaps the best part of a year. There is currently one vaccine approved for use - made by Pfizer and BioNTech. The UK has managed to order 40 million doses of the vaccine, enough to cover 20 million people given that two doses are needed. So - in the short term at least - the UK will require another vaccine to be approved for use. Fortunately, the regulators are assessing the merits of two more, including one made by US firm Moderna. But the problem with that one is the UK has been able to order only seven million doses - and the earliest they can be supplied is spring. That is why so much hope is pinned on a vaccine produced by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. There are already between five million and 10 million doses waiting go to with a total of 100 million on order - again two doses are needed so that's enough for 50 million people, which combined with the Pfizer jab means there should be enough for the whole population next year. Will it be approved? It will be a surprise if it isn't. The team behind it are confident, stressing they had met all the criteria for approval when the full data behind the clinical trials was published in the Lancet this week. Much was made of the fact that it does not appear to be as effective at stopping infection as the Pfizer vaccine - 70% v 95% effective - but what both do at close to 100% levels is stop serious illness. If people are not dying from Covid or being left with long-term problems, the most dire consequences of the pandemic are over. What is more, roll out will be easier with the Oxford vaccine. That's because it does not need to be kept in ultra-cold storage like the Pfizer one, which has resulted in strict rules around its movement. For example, the NHS is still not able to take it into care homes, despite residents and staff being the top priority for vaccination, while GPs have only three and a half days to use up doses when they get delivered. It is, says one GP, ""a logistical nightmare"" to work with. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Vaccine manufacture is notorious for not always going smoothly. Indeed, Pfizer has already had to reduce the amount it is expected to deliver to the UK - it is being shipped in from Belgium. Originally 10 million doses were forecast by the end of 2020, but now the government has been told to expect only five million - and only 800,000 of that is currently in the country, making Health Secretary Matt Hancock's aim of vaccinating ""millions by Christmas"" looking like a stretch. The Oxford vaccine is made in the UK, so from that point of view supply should be more reliable. However, production will still depend on the right ingredients being available, and with a global race to produce vaccines now well under way, it would be amazing if that did not mean a few hiccups along the way. Another potential hurdle is Brexit. A no-deal Brexit could cause problems importing all sorts of goods, especially through the Calais-to-Dover shipping route. The government says it has identified secure routes to get essential goods into the country. But concerns obviously remain. All this combined is why Dr Richard Vautrey, who is the British Medical Association's GP leader, says supply is probably the biggest ""risk factor"" to roll out. He says if there is enough vaccine, he is ""confident"" GPs and their practice nurses could vaccinate millions of people a week. Vaccination on a mass scale is dependent on people coming forward. Many fear achieving good uptake is not a given because people may refuse to be vaccinated - it will not be compulsory. Ipsos Mori and King's College Londonlooked at this over the summer,external. Their survey of more than 2,000 adults was reported to have found just half of people were planning to get vaccinated. The truth though is somewhat more nuanced. If you add in those who said they were fairly likely, the numbers jumped to nearly three-quarters. What is more, the older age groups were the least likely to say they would shun the vaccine. Understandably so, as they are the most at risk. More than nine in 10 deaths are among the over-65s - and this is really the crucial issue when it comes to the vaccine programme, and how quickly it will return life to normal. There are 12 million over-65s. Once significant numbers are vaccinated, the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed disappears and the high number of excess deaths being seen across the population dwindles. How long will that take? Well, GPs managed to vaccinate the over-65 population against flu in a little over two months this autumn - 77% came forward for the jab. The flu jab is given in only one dose, but doctors believe it should be perfectly possible to finish immunisation for every person over 65 who is willing to have the vaccine by the end of March, availability permitting. That would then trigger - or at least give the option of triggering - a major relaxation of restrictions. It is what the UK government's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty referred to as ""de-risking"" this week, when he appeared before MPs at the Health Select Committee. His point was that we could quickly reach a situation at which the level of death and illness caused by Covid was at a level society could ""tolerate"" - just as we tolerate 7,000 to 20,000 people dying from flu every year. That would allow a gradual move away from the most severe restrictions, he says, perhaps just requiring a bit of continued social distancing and the wearing of face-coverings in some settings. Spring may not be the end of the pandemic, but it certainly should be the beginning of the end.
