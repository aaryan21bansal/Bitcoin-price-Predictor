Trump says his choice for Pentagon chief is out,"US President Donald Trump has announced his choice for defence secretary has withdrawn, shaking up the Pentagon at a time of rising Middle East tensions. He tweeted that Patrick Shanahan has pulled out of consideration ""so that he can devote more time to his family"". Mr Shanahan, who will be replaced by Army Secretary Mark Esper, had not yet been nominated for the cabinet post. It comes as Mr Shanahan publicly addressed allegations of domestic violence. Mr Trump told reporters Mr Shanahan submitted his withdrawal on Tuesday morning. ""I didn't ask him to withdraw, but he walked in this morning and said it was going to be a rough time for him,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he first heard of the ""unfortunate"" allegations on Monday. Earlier on Tuesday, USA Today reported the FBI was investigating a 2010 incident in which Mr Shanahan and his ex-wife accused each other of assault. Minutes after Mr Trump's announcement, the Washington Post published an interview with Mr Shanahan in which he discussed a 2011 incident when his son, then 17, reportedly beat his mother with a baseball bat, fracturing her skull.

In a statement announcing his resignation, Mr Shanahan called it ""unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up and painted in an incomplete and therefore misleading way"". He said he did not want his three children ""to relive a traumatic chapter in our family's life and reopen wounds we have worked years to heal"". Mr Shanahan added: ""I would welcome the opportunity to be secretary of defense, but not at the expense of being a good father."" On Monday,he told the Washington Post,externalthat he regretted a legal memo he penned shortly after the alleged attack on his ex-wife. He wrote that the ""use of a baseball bat in self-defence will likely be viewed as an imbalance of force"" and that ""Will's mother harassed him for nearly three hours before the incident"". Before joining the Trump White House, Mr Shanahan had worked as an executive at Boeing, the US aerospace company which holds many US defence department contracts. He took over six months ago after the resignation of former Defence Secretary James Mattis. Patrick Shanahan's decision will extend what is already the longest period of time the US has been without a confirmed secretary of defence. Under his watch, the Pentagon has begun a build-up of troops in the Middle East in response to tensions with Iran. That will play out as planned, executed by the chain of military command, but still without the political weight of a senior cabinet defence official to guide developing policy and argue the Pentagon's corner at the White House. Mr Shanahan's critics grumbled that he had ceded too much authority to the White House, that it was the hawkish National Security Advisor John Bolton who was driving policy. His successor as acting chief of the Pentagon is the Army Secretary Mark Esper. A military analyst, Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, told the BBC that Mr Esper was a West Point classmate of the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and may share the hardline views of Mr Pompeo and Mr Bolton. Whatever the case, the administration has made clear that President Trump does not want a war in the Middle East, and the troop deployments so far have been relatively small, aimed at protecting US forces and sending a message of deterrence to Iran. Mr Shanahan's tenure saw the longest ever period that the US has been without a permanent secretary of defence. Mark Esper, the current Army secretary, is due to take over in an acting capacity until a new Pentagon chief is nominated. He was Mr Trump's third choice for the role of Army secretary, after the president's first two nominees - Wall Street billionaire Vincent Viola and Tennessee state Senator Mark Green - withdrew following scrutiny over business ties and controversial comments, respectively. Mr Esper, a 56-year-old Harvard graduate and retired Army infantry officer who served during the US war with Iraq, has been Army secretary since 2017. He also previously worked as the former vice president of government relations at Raytheon, one of the world's largest arms manufacturers. Mr Trump had previously voiced his intention to nominate Mr Shanahan to the post, leading to many questions about who his next choice will be. The defence secretary must be confirmed by the US Senate. What we know about Gulf of Oman tanker attacks Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday Mr Esper was ""a good choice for acting"" secretary, but that it would be ""better to have a confirmed secretary of defence"". His Democratic counterpart Chuck Schumer meanwhile said it was ""appalling"" to have no confirmed defence secretary at this time. ""They have so many empty positions, rotating-revolving doors in the most sensitive of security positions."" The Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee concurred, saying in a statement: ""For the sake of our national security, we need a confirmed Secretary of Defence - not just an acting. I hope we can get to that point as quickly as possible."" The announcement comes amid renewed tensions between the US and Iran after Washington accused the Islamic republic of attacks last week on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Mr Shanahan on Monday announced the deployment of 1,000 US troops to the Middle East to counter ""hostile behaviour"" by Iranian forces. He added that the US does ""not seek conflict with Iran"" and the action had been taken to ""ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region to protect our national interests"". This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? Mr Trump on Tuesday said the US was ""very well set"" when it came to Iran, adding: ""We'll see what happens."" Speaking on the senate floor earlier, Mr Schumer criticised the administration's lack of transparency on Iran, saying the White House ""has an obligation to explain to the American people exactly what is happening and why"" as US troops are once again sent to the Middle East. ""The president has yet to articulate a strategy about American involvement in the region,"" Mr Schumer said.

US billionaire gives Oxford University Â£150m,"Multi-billionaire Stephen Schwarzman is a confidant of President Trump The largest single donation to a UK university has been given to Oxford for a new institute that will study the ethics of artificial intelligence. Stephen Schwarzman, a US private equity billionaire who has advised Republican presidents including Donald Trump, has given the university Â£150m. The donation will fund a new faculty for the humanities. The UK government said it was a ""globally significant"" investment in Britain. At a time when universities face uncertainty over research funding because of Brexit, this is a major financial coup for the University of Oxford. Mr Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity firm Blackstone, is one of America's best known billionaires. In the past, his lavish lifestyle as a Wall Street financier has attracted criticism, but more recently he has also become a major donor to education. Mr Schwarzman told the BBC he was giving the money to Oxford because artificial intelligence was the major issue of our age. ""At the moment, most governments are utterly unprepared to deal with this, and why would they be, it's a different type of technology,"" he said. ""They're going to have to rely on great universities like Oxford, and others around the world who specialise in helping them think this through."" Stephen Schwarzman with the University of Oxford's vice-chancellor, Prof Louise Richardson Mr Schwarzman said universities needed to help construct an ethical framework for changes that were happening rapidly. Some economists have warned the expansion of artificial intelligence could have a significant impact on society - including the loss of jobs due to automation - in what is sometimes called the ""fourth industrial revolution"". Academics have also raised concerns about the potential for malicious use in cyber warfare and the subverting of democracy. Can artificial intelligence help stop religious violence? Artificial intelligence must be 'for common good' Artificial intelligence: How to avoid racist algorithms The donation by Mr Schwarzman to Oxford follows a $350m (Â£279m) gift he made to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to establish a centre for computing and artificial intelligence. The study of the ethics of AI at Oxford will be in a new humanities centre, bringing together subjects from languages to philosophy. Mr Schwarzman said it was ""important for people to remember what being human is"". ""Why are we here? What are your values? How does technology deal and interact with that. ""We should want it to be positive and productive for society, and technology can't be allowed to just do whatever it wants because it can. "" The University of Oxford has long been a subject of patronage by the wealthy and powerful Accepting large donations is not without risk for institutions if controversy emerges later. Prof Louise Richardson, the vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford, said all philanthropic gifts were reviewed to make sure they fitted with its values. ""The margin of excellence requires more than we can expect from public funding, so philanthropy is going to become more important for Oxford and other universities,"" she said. The new building will also create a concert hall and other public spaces. Universities Minister Chris Skidmore said: ""Pushing the boundaries of knowledge and conquering new innovations are what our universities are known for across the world. And attracting this globally significant investment reinforces our reputation as a leader in higher education. ""More importantly, disciplines within humanities enrich our culture and society and have an immeasurable impact on our health and wellbeing. ""Not only do I look forward to the benefits this can bring to students but the prospect of transforming the world we live in."" The gift to Oxford comes a few months after hedge-fund billionaire David Hardingdonated Â£100m to Cambridge University.

"Rising levels of poverty in working familiesPoverty among those who are working has risen, but many more people are now in work, research indicates.Business","As care worker Liam Doherty knows all too well, if you're in a low-paid job, the slightest setback can capsize your finances. The Irishman moved to the UK in September 2013, bringing his wife Debbie and four children from County Limerick to take up a job in Dawlish in Devon. ""We were struggling to get by,"" he says. With his wife unable to work because of ill-health, he was the sole provider in the family. ""Sometimes friends would help us out. They would just arrive with food. ""You want to work, but low-paid work can sometimes make it harder financially."" Liam is far from an isolated example. Poverty among people who are working has risen sharply since the mid-1990s, partly driven by higher housing costs and lower earnings growth, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The proportion has risen from 13% in 1994-95 to 18% in 2017, meaning that about eight million people living in working households are in relative poverty, according to the IFS research, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. ""In the mid-1990s, 37% of those in poverty lived in a working household. That has reached 58%,"" said the IFS. But the rise also reflected the fact that many more people were now in work, it added. ""They are better off than they would have been had they stayed out of work, but they remain in poverty. In addition, pensioner incomes have risen faster than working-age incomes - pushing up the relative poverty line,"" the IFS said. A household is defined as being in relative poverty when its income is less than 60% of the average - less than Â£17,040 a year, on the most recent figures. The IFS said the rapid growth in pensioners' incomes over the past 25 years had pushed up median income and therefore the relative poverty line. More worryingly, the institute said that fast growth in housing costs for lower-income working households had pushed up the in-work poverty rate since the mid-1990s by 2.4 percentage points, equivalent to one million people. At the same time, increased earning inequality had caused in-work poverty to rise by 1.4 percentage points, or 600,000 people. As well as relative poverty, the research also looked at ""severe"" poverty, defined as having living standards meaningfully below those on the poverty line. ""Severe poverty is a clear policy concern, but it is hard to measure. We find little evidence that there are significant rises in it,"" said Tom Waters, a research economist at the IFS and one of the authors of the research. Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: ""Our economy should work for everyone, but the rise of working poverty across the UK shows that success in increasing employment isn't always a reliable route to a better living standard. ""High housing costs, low pay and insecure hours are holding many people back, despite more people moving into work. ""Our next prime minister must further reform Universal Credit so that it helps more people get on, and bring forward an ambitious plan to rebalance the economy by investing in places where low employment and widespread low pay trap people in poverty."" The issues spelt out in the IFS report are ones that Liam Doherty knows only too well. In an effort to make ends meet, they were advised to claim tax credits and housing benefit, but that was when their problems really began. The benefits were worth Â£400 a month to them, but then they were told that they had been given too much and had to repay Â£3,000. Liam remembers the authorities asking for Â£50 a month, but he pleaded that he couldn't afford that. ""Then we got a letter asking for more."" Other bills started to mount up. Finally, thanks to the aid of charityChristians Against Poverty,external, the Doherty family were able to get out of debt. Now aged 64, Liam says he can't see himself retiring any time soon. ""I have to keep going,"" he says. ""But at least we're not in debt and we live within our means. All our bills are paid each month and then we manage what's left, for food and other things.""

Tory candidates clash on TV over Brexit date,"This video can not be played Tory leader debate: 5 candidates, 5 things Tory leadership rivals have clashed in a live BBC TV debate on whether the UK can leave the EU, no matter what, by the 31 October deadline. Asked for a guarantee he would do this, Boris Johnson described the deadline as ""eminently feasible"". Sajid Javid said it ""focused minds"", but Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt said extra time might be needed. Rory Stewart accused his colleagues of lacking realism - of ""staring at the wall and saying 'believe in Britain'"". The five men vying to be Conservative Party leader - and the UK's next prime minister - were taking part in a live debate on BBC One on Tuesday night. Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was earliereliminated in the second round of voting,when Conservative MPs held a secret ballot. The third round of voting will take place later, between 15:00 and 17:00 BST. The result is expected at 18:00 BST and the MP with the lowest number of votes will be out of the race. Who will give up to stop Johnson? Five key moments from Tory leadership debate Fact-checking the Tory leadership candidates' claims During Tuesday's hour-long debate, all five men ruled out calling a general election until Brexit was resolved. But the encounter exposed divisions in their approaches to Brexit and whether they could accept the UK leaving the EU without an agreement. This video can not be played The first question to the five standing for who could be the Tory leader and PM was about a Brexit date guarantee. The candidates, who faced questions from members of the public on issues ranging from climate change to Islamophobia, also disagreed over whether to prioritise tax cuts or increased spending on public services after the UK leaves the EU. Mr Johnson, the frontrunner in the contest, was taking part in his first debate of the campaign after he skipped Sunday's Channel 4 encounter. Rory Stewart, reflecting on the debate on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said he had found it a ""frustrating"" format and wished he had pressed Mr Johnson further to explain how he would get a no-deal Brexit through without the consent of Parliament. Looking ahead to the vote later, he said he had received a ""couple of positive responses"" to appeals for support from MPs who had previously given their backing to Dominic Raab. Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who has switched his support from Mr Raab to Mr Johnson, said he ""certainly believed"" the UK would leave the EU by 31 October under Mr Johnson. Pressed on why Mr Johnson did not ""guarantee"" that on live TV, Mr Zahawi said: ""If the other side don't believe you will leave on 31 October on WTO terms then they will not come forward with a deal."" He added that EU negotiators would take Mr Johnson ""very seriously because they know he will prepare the country"". Jeremy Hunt said the EU needed to be able to trust the person they negotiate with. ""I believe they would trust Jeremy Hunt, they would sit around the table, they would listen,"" he told the Today programme. Asked if he was missing the charisma needed to win the leadership race, he said he had been underestimated all his life - in politics and in setting up his own successful business - and planned to surprise people. The former foreign secretary said the British people were ""fed up"" with the current deadlock over Brexit and the Tories would pay a ""really serious price"" if this continued. He warned of a ""catastrophic loss of confidence in politics"" if the latest Brexit deadline was not met. Asked if he could guarantee this, he replied that ""October 31 is eminently feasible"". ""If we allow 31 October to come and go as we let March come and go, I think the public would look on us with increasing mystification,"" Mr Johnson said. He also suggested there was no issue with continuing free trade after Brexit - citing something called Article 24 of GATT - butas BBC Reality Check points out,that relies on the UK and EU both signing up and in the event of no deal, that will not happen. Mr Javid, who came fifth in Tuesday's second round of voting, said a deadline was needed to ""focus minds"" in both the EU and the UK. ""We have to learn from our mistakes,"" he said. ""One of the mistakes we have made is having a flexible deadline."" This video can not be played The five Conservative leadership contenders were asked about resolving the Irish border issue He suggested the route to getting a Brexit deal through Parliament was by re-presenting Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement but without the controversial Irish backstop. Mr Gove said an ""arbitrary"" deadline was counter-productive and if he was prime minister he would be prepared to delay Brexit by a matter of days to finalise a deal. ""You sometimes have extra time in football matches in order to slot home the winner."" Mr Hunt said he would back a no-deal exit as a ""last resort"" but if the UK was close to finalising a deal with the EU he would extend the talks to prevent the disruption a no-deal exit would cause to business. As it happened: Tory leadership debate Compare the candidates left in the race Viewers' verdict on Tory leadership debate Both Mr Hunt and Mr Javid suggested new technology could potentially solve the intractable Irish border issue, butthe EU has said there is currently none in use anywherein the world that can keep it as open after Brexit as it is now. Mr Stewart said he would not allow a ""damaging and unnecessary"" no-deal exit and his rivals could not explain how they could possibly do this ""against the consent of Parliament"". He suggested he was seeking the most realistic ""door"" out of the EU while ""everyone else was staring at the wall and saying believe in Britain"". EU politicians across the continent were dipping in and out of the debate. The comments I've heard so far off-the-record have not been particularly complimentary. The EU simply thinks that most of those leadership candidates are not being realistic. EU leaders are preparing a united, determined front when it comes to the idea of renegotiating the Brexit deal, and the answer is no. Even if, come the autumn, the EU were to be tempted to reopen some of those questions such as the Irish backstop, those conversations could never be finished by 31 October - the date by which most of those leadership candidates want to leave the EU. That's why this evening the EU thinks the idea of a no-deal Brexit is becoming increasingly likely. Moving beyond Brexit, the candidates clashed over their economic plans and whether to prioritise higher spending on public services or tax cuts. There were sharp exchanges between Mr Stewart and other contenders, Michael Gove accusing him of having ""no plan"" for how to run the economy or public services. ""Bringing people together is not enough,"" he told Mr Stewart, who has emerged as the surprise contender in the race. However, after the debate Mr Stewart admitted his performance had been lacklustre, adding he did not think the ""strange"" format worked for him. Mr Gove also took aim at Mr Johnson's plans to give a tax cut to those earning more than Â£50,000 a year, saying the focus should be on ""helping the poorest in society"". Helping middle-earners was ""sensible"", Mr Johnson responded. Mr Stewart said promising tax cuts was ""wrong"" given the uncertainty around Brexit. Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? He called for a ""revolution"" in care for the elderly, calling current provision a ""disgrace"". Mr Hunt, who was health secretary for six years, also called for increased investment, suggesting cuts to care budgets under the current government had gone ""too far"". Mr Johnson reiterated that it was his ""ambition"" to cut taxes for higher earners, but as political correspondent Chris Mason pointed out, that seemed less committal than a ""promise"" to do it. Plenty expected lots of ganging up on Boris Johnson tonight from his rivals. But what was striking - after the Stewart surge in votes between rounds one and two in Parliament - is there was at least as much, if not more, ganging up on Rory Stewart. Why? Look at the numbers. There were just 13 votes separating Jeremy Hunt, who finished second, and Sajid Javid, who finished fifth in the leadership ballot. In other words, all of them, other than Boris Johnson, are potentially vulnerable to relatively small shifts in votes. And Mr Stewart, in the build up to tonight, had the momentum. Meanwhile, speaking to Newsnight after the debate, Mr Gove said he believed he had won the debate because of what he said were his ""detailed answers"" and ""clear plan"" on Brexit. Of his rivals, he said there were ""some other great people"" but added: ""They will all be fantastic members of my team."" Amid claims that the Conservatives have failed to tackle Islamophobia in the party, the candidates were pressed by an imam to accept that ""words have consequences"". Mr Johnson said he apologised if anything he had written, during 20 to 30 years as a journalist, or had said during his political career had caused offence. But he defended his conduct as foreign secretary in relation to the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who remains in jail in Iran on spying charges. He suggested his claim in 2017 that the dual British-Iranian national was actually working as a journalist in the country - which the Iranian authorities cited as a reason to increase her sentence - ""did not make any difference"". ""If you point the finger at the UK, all you are doing is exculpating those who are truly responsible,"" he said. Mr Javid challenged the other candidates to agree to an external inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory Party - which they all appeared to do. Referring to Donald Trump's string of attacks on London's Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan, he said politicians should be ""brave enough"" to call out Islamophobia wherever it came from.

Viewers' verdict on Tory leadership debateVideoVideoThe moment the result of latest Tory ballot announced,"The five remaining candidates met at BBC Broadcasting House in London for their latest debate Brexit and Islamophobia dominated the second TV debate faced by the Conservative Party leadership contenders. The five remaining candidates met for the Our Next Prime Minister debate on BBC One, during which they answered questions from members of the public. But what did viewers make of their answers? Speaking ona special programmewhich went out across BBC Local Radio in England on Tuesday evening, some callers felt none of the hopefuls were clear enough on how to move the country forward. ""They still don't live in the real world,"" said one woman. It was the second time most candidates had gone head-to-head on TV, following a debate held on Channel 4 on Sunday. However, it was the first to feature current frontrunner Boris Johnson. The BBC had received thousands of questions, with other topics debated including the HS2 high speed rail project, public spending and climate change. But, of course, Brexit dominated discussion in the debate, hosted by Emily Maitlis. Brexit was the topic which dominated the debate The deadline for exiting the European Union and whether that would be a no-deal scenario, were both issues put to the candidates. Some viewers said they felt none of the hopefuls were clear enough on how to move the country forward. Owen Reed, 19, from Bedworth, stood for the Tories in the local elections, but said he had now joined the Brexit Party. He felt the candidates were not strong enough about leaving on 31 October and believes there has been a swing publicly in favour of no-deal, which he felt has not been recognised. ""From the debate tonight it became clear that time and time again they are not listening,"" he said. ""They are all going to Theresa May's deal again, they just want to change it cosmetically."" Fact-checking the Tory leadership candidates' claims Five key moments from Tory leadership debate Chris Edwards, 34, from Colchester, felt none of the candidates ""seem to believe in leaving the EU"". ""They were all saying leaving without a deal is basically Armageddon but we should prepare for it just in case,"" he said. ""It was in British law that we were supposed to leave on 29 March... I feel like the chance has gone."" But Mr Edwards believes Mr Johnson has the best chance of securing a deal on 31 October, if he has the right cabinet. ""If he can get Jacob Rees-Mogg and Esther McVey in the cabinet they would be the real structure... and he could just be the celebrity,"" he added. Robert Dugmore, 63, from Birmingham, said he found the debate ""profoundly depressing"". ""Whichever of those gentlemen gets elected at the end of July, nothing has changed in parliament,"" he added. ""They are going to go in, they don't have a majority, what are they going to do if they can't get it through? ""All they were doing was demonstrating the impossibility of the situation, they were kicking it around and I thought none of them were better than what we just got rid of."" Abdullah Patel said he welcomed calls for a independent investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party Among those who appeared during the debate posing questions to the candidates was Abdullah Patel from Gloucester, speaking from a studio in Bristol. An imam, he said he had seen the everyday impact of ""Islamophobic rhetoric"" and asked whether candidates accepted that words have consequences. Mr Patel said he had assumed the candidates would not answer his question, but was pleased with the promise of action. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Boris answered by speaking about his grandfather then going on to Iran and dodging the question, Gove used it to have a dig at Jeremy Corbyn and Jeremy Hunt thought it was the right time to start speaking about his own family rather than actually addressing the question and to be honest it is nothing less than I expected,"" he said. On Wednesday it emergedMr Patel had shared controversial tweets about Israel. He said he was sure he had not criticised his Jewish ""brothers"", but stood by criticism of Israeli policy. A BBC spokesperson said: ""Had we been aware of the views he expressed there he would not have been selected."" Mr Patel has also been suspended as deputy head of a girls' school in Gloucester. Boris Johnson is the current favourite Boris Johnson might be the current favourite, but viewers had mixed opinions on whether there was an overall winner. Mr Johnson's place in the lead was secured in the latest round of voting, securing 126 votes - 12 more than in the first round and 80 more than Mr Hunt who was in second place with with 46 votes.

Viewers' verdict on Tory leadership debate,"The five remaining candidates met at BBC Broadcasting House in London for their latest debate Brexit and Islamophobia dominated the second TV debate faced by the Conservative Party leadership contenders. The five remaining candidates met for the Our Next Prime Minister debate on BBC One, during which they answered questions from members of the public. But what did viewers make of their answers? Speaking ona special programmewhich went out across BBC Local Radio in England on Tuesday evening, some callers felt none of the hopefuls were clear enough on how to move the country forward. ""They still don't live in the real world,"" said one woman. It was the second time most candidates had gone head-to-head on TV, following a debate held on Channel 4 on Sunday. However, it was the first to feature current frontrunner Boris Johnson. The BBC had received thousands of questions, with other topics debated including the HS2 high speed rail project, public spending and climate change. But, of course, Brexit dominated discussion in the debate, hosted by Emily Maitlis. Brexit was the topic which dominated the debate The deadline for exiting the European Union and whether that would be a no-deal scenario, were both issues put to the candidates. Some viewers said they felt none of the hopefuls were clear enough on how to move the country forward. Owen Reed, 19, from Bedworth, stood for the Tories in the local elections, but said he had now joined the Brexit Party. He felt the candidates were not strong enough about leaving on 31 October and believes there has been a swing publicly in favour of no-deal, which he felt has not been recognised. ""From the debate tonight it became clear that time and time again they are not listening,"" he said. ""They are all going to Theresa May's deal again, they just want to change it cosmetically."" Fact-checking the Tory leadership candidates' claims Five key moments from Tory leadership debate Chris Edwards, 34, from Colchester, felt none of the candidates ""seem to believe in leaving the EU"". ""They were all saying leaving without a deal is basically Armageddon but we should prepare for it just in case,"" he said. ""It was in British law that we were supposed to leave on 29 March... I feel like the chance has gone."" But Mr Edwards believes Mr Johnson has the best chance of securing a deal on 31 October, if he has the right cabinet. ""If he can get Jacob Rees-Mogg and Esther McVey in the cabinet they would be the real structure... and he could just be the celebrity,"" he added. Robert Dugmore, 63, from Birmingham, said he found the debate ""profoundly depressing"". ""Whichever of those gentlemen gets elected at the end of July, nothing has changed in parliament,"" he added. ""They are going to go in, they don't have a majority, what are they going to do if they can't get it through? ""All they were doing was demonstrating the impossibility of the situation, they were kicking it around and I thought none of them were better than what we just got rid of."" Abdullah Patel said he welcomed calls for a independent investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party Among those who appeared during the debate posing questions to the candidates was Abdullah Patel from Gloucester, speaking from a studio in Bristol. An imam, he said he had seen the everyday impact of ""Islamophobic rhetoric"" and asked whether candidates accepted that words have consequences. Mr Patel said he had assumed the candidates would not answer his question, but was pleased with the promise of action. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Wednesday it emergedMr Patel had shared controversial tweets about Israel. He said he was sure he had not criticised his Jewish ""brothers"", but stood by criticism of Israeli policy.

Berlin backs rent freeze amid housing pressure,"A fair rent march in Berlin: The top banner reads ""My home is not your profit"" Berlin's left-wing government has approved a plan to freeze rents in the German capital for the next five years. Rents have risen sharply in the city and there have been rallies urging the authorities to keep housing affordable. The plan is expected to become law in January. It could apply to 1.4 million properties, but not to social housing - regulated separately - or new builds. The average monthly rent for a furnished Berlin flat is about â¬1,100 (Â£983; $1,232). Aninternational comparison website, housinganywhere.com, reports,externalthat several major European cities are more expensive than Berlin for apartment rents, including Barcelona, Rotterdam and Milan. Berlin rents however rose by 7% in the first quarter of this year, and in the past decade rents have doubled as the booming city has become a magnet for jobseekers. The most expensive for rents in Europe is London:the Evening Standard reports,externalthat a typical two-bedroom flat in Southwark, near central London, costs Â£1,573 (â¬1,760; $1,970) a month. This video can not be played Berlin vs London: Which city is better for renters? The Berlin draft law, approved by the city's Senate, is being keenly watched across Germany, as there have been many complaints about housing costs elsewhere too, for example in Hamburg. The Berlin regional parliament still has to vote on it. The left-wing Social Democrats (SPD), in power in Berlin, favour a national rent cap, but critics point out that the housing market varies considerably from one region to the next. Central Berlin has undergone major redevelopment in recent years BBC Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill writes: The flyers appeared overnight on lampposts in my neighbourhood. A picture of a young couple who explained that they were flat-hunting and, as professional photographers, would offer a free photoshoot to any landlord who'd take them on. It's not an unusual phenomenon. One woman recently offered to bake regularly for anyone who'd rent her their flat. Berlin can't build affordable accommodation fast enough for the city's rising population. An open showing of a newly available flat is likely to attract well over 100 hopeful, would-be tenants. Demand is pushing up rents as corporate investors buy up and renovate old or dilapidated buildings, and it's pricing Berliners out of their old neighbourhoods. Demand and rents are rising in many other German cities too. Berlin is, by comparison with somewhere like Munich, still relatively cheap but, even as the Berlin authorities ponder their response, Chancellor Angela Merkel has promised to take action over what is an increasingly sensitive subject for the electorate. Chancellor Merkel, of the Christian Democrats (CDU), agrees with the SPD - her coalition partner - that the squeeze on affordable housing is a problem. But she argues that the best solution is to build new homes. Under the Berlin plan, the rent cap - likely to become law in January - would be backdated to 18 June, to prevent landlords from pushing up rents sharply over the next six months.

Some argue that such a freeze would reduce housing improvements by landlords, including investments in better insulation and other green economy measures. Some critics argue that there would be many exemptions, undermining the law's effectiveness. For example, rents for new builds could go up sharply as they would not be covered by the cap. German property firms justify the cost of new apartments by arguing that construction costs have risen 33% in Germany since 2005, compared with just 6% in the Netherlands, ARD reports.

Dominic Raab out of Tory leadership race,"This video can not be played Dame Cheryl Gillan announces the result of Tuesday's Tory leadership vote - with five going through the next round Dominic Raab has been knocked out of the Tory leadership race in the latest ballot of MPs, leaving five candidates in the battle to be the next PM. Boris Johnson once again came top of the ballot, with 126 votes - 12 more than in the first round. Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart also got enough votes to make it into the next round. Mr Raab was eliminated after coming last with 30 votes, three fewer than the minimum needed to progress. The former Brexit secretary had called for the UK to leave the EU without a deal on 31 October if necessary. He also caused controversy by refusing to rule out suspending Parliament to thwart attempts by MPs to block a no-deal Brexit. Tory leadership: Who will be the next prime minister? Tory debate clash over Brexit deadline The next ballot will take place on Wednesday, with the candidate with the lowest number of votes eliminated.

Mr Hunt again came second in the latest ballot of 313 Tory MPs, with 46 votes - three more than in last week's first vote. Mr Gove and Mr Javid also increased their level of support - by four and 10 votes to 41 and 33 votes respectively. But it was Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, who made the biggest stride forward, nearly doubling his backing from 19 to 37 votes. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was likely that most of Mr Raab's supporters would transfer their votes to Mr Johnson, but, she said, ""there will certainly be a scrap for them."" And she pointed out how close the result was for the other candidates, adding: ""In tomorrow's vote a couple of moves here and there could make all the difference."" Tory MP Gillian Keegan said Mr Stewart was appealing to his colleagues because of his ""realistic plan"" for Brexit and his progress showed there was a ""market for honest politicians"". ""I think Rory is extraordinary. He has star quality you don't often see in politics."" Johnny Mercer, a supporter of Mr Johnson, said he was pleased by his performance but conceded the contest ""was not done yet"". Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who is backing Mr Hunt for the top job, said he remained in a ""strong"" second place. She told the BBC the foreign secretary remained ""a serious candidate for a serious job"". The BBC's Nicholas Watt said he had been told by a source close to Mr Javid that he would not be dropping out of the race even though he secured the lowest number of votes. Simon Hoare, one of Mr Javid's backers, said he was ""delighted"" the home secretary had made it through to the next stage. He said ""barring emergencies"" Mr Johnson would make it into the final two candidates and appealed to Tory MPs to think ""tactically"" about who should join him. Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Guy Opperman, who is backing Michael Gove, said a frontrunner ""had never won"" a Tory leadership contest and he believed MPs would ultimately ""coalesce"" around an alternative to Mr Johnson. He said Mr Gove had ""clawed his way"" back into the contest after days of negative newspaper headlines at the start of the campaign following his admission he had taken cocaine while working as a journalist in the late 1990s. As ""a committed Brexiteer"", he said he expected Mr Gove would pick up the overwhelming share of Mr Raab's 30 supporters in the next round. The remaining candidates will face up to three further ballots later this week, where the lowest-ranked MP will be knocked out until only two are left. The final two names will then be put to a postal vote of the 160,000 Tory party members, beginning on 22 June, with the winner expected to be announced about four weeks later.

Brexit: Where do leadership candidates stand?,"Boris Johnson is the UK's new prime minister and will now begin the task of trying to deliver Brexit. The former foreign secretary has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. He has called the withdrawal agreement ""dead"" but says he will ""take the bits that are serviceable and get them done"" - such as guaranteeing the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK. The withdrawal agreement (WA) is the deal negotiated by the UK government and the European Union (EU) to settle the basis on which the UK will leave. As part of it, the UK agreed to pay the EU a ""divorce bill"" (estimated to be Â£39bn), guarantee EU citizens' rights and sign up to the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The deal allowed for a transition period after Brexit, during which things like UK-EU trade would stay the same, while both sides worked out their future relationship. But the withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by MPs - leading to Theresa May's downfall. After Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which might mean products being checked at the border. To avoid border posts (which some believe could threaten the peace process), Mrs May and the EU agreed on the backstop. In the event that no free trade deal was agreed that avoided a hard border, this insurance policy would effectively keep the UK and EU in a customs union. This proved controversial because it would stop the UK doing some of its own trade deals. Mr Johnson is saying the Irish border can be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU, instead of as part of the withdrawal agreement. Obstacle:The EU has said the Irish backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement - the deal to delay the UK's exit until the end of October specifically prohibited its renegotiation. If the UK leaves with no deal and seeks a free trade agreement, the EU has said it will not begin negotiations until the issue of the Irish border is settled. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Boris Johnson wants to ditch the Irish backstop - he's called it ""a prison"". He has said there are ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" to avoid checks at the border. He concedes there is ""no single magic bullet"" but points to a ""wealth of solutions"" instead. Obstacle:The UK and the EU have previously looked fortechnological solutions to the Irish borderwithout success. EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said in January: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" There are ""alternative arrangements"" which could help: trusted trader schemes (where businesses are certified to make sure they meet certain standards) and ways of making customs declarations away from the border, but they wouldn't eliminate the need for checks altogether. After Brexit, the EU would still require inspections of things like animal and plant products entering its single market, and the new entry point to that market would be at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to withhold the money the UK has agreed to pay the EU and use it as a negotiating tool to get a better deal. Settling the UK's financial obligations (which include previously agreed contributions to the EU budget and funding things like EU staff pensions) was agreed by Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement. The figure for those obligations has been calculated at Â£39bn. Obstacle:The EU has said it will not start future trade talks until the issue of money (along with citizens' rights and the Irish border) is settled. Refusing to pay would almost certainly sour relations between the two,and could lead to a legal challenge from the EU. While accepting that a ""disruptive... badly handled"" no-deal Brexit would be costly, Mr Johnson said it was ""vanishingly inexpensive if you prepare"" and added that ""much of this work has been done"". Obstacle:Mr Johnson's view of the cost of a no-deal Brexit is at odds with the vast majority of economists, a significant number of his own backbenchers, and organisations such as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the government's forecasts for the economy.The OBR saidno deal would push the UK economy into recession. Mr Johnson has said he would mitigate the effects of no deal on the UK economy (which he admits would cause ""disruption"") by relying on a piece of trade law known as Article 24. He originally said this would allow the UK and the EU to have zero tariffs (taxes on imports) on trade while the two sides negotiated a trade deal. This would, in theory, help keep trade flowing and would stop the EU imposing tariffs on goods being imported from the UK (cars, for example, are subject to a 10% import tax from non-EU countries, and on agricultural produce it's even higher). Obstacle:Boris Johnson was wrong to sayArticle 24 would automatically allow for a standstill in trade relations, and indeed - when challenged in interviews - he later accepted that it would require the agreement of both sides. Also, Article 24 only covers the trade in goods (not services) and it does not cover non-tariff barriers such as regulations. The EU has ruled out signing any Article 24 agreement immediately after a no-deal Brexit.

He will become prime minister on 24 July and Parliament begins its summer recess the following day. A week later there will be a by-election and the rest of August will be pretty quiet, both in Westminster and Brussels. Parliament returns at the start of September but will take another recess later in the month for party conferences. On 17 October there will be a summit of EU leaders. Brexit is scheduled for 31 October, the day before the new European Commission takes office.

Fact-checking the Tory leadership candidates' claims,"The BBC Reality Check team has been checking claims made by the five remaining candidates to replace Theresa May in their live BBC debate. Here are the verdicts on one claim from each of them in the event chaired by Emily Maitlis. All the candidates were asked about their plan for the Irish border after Brexit (most want to change the Irish backstop plan negotiated by Theresa May to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Boris Johnson was challenged by Rory Stewart to detail what tariffs (taxes on imports) would be charged on agricultural goods crossing the border. He said there would be ""no tariffs or quotas"" because ""what we want to do is get a standstill in our current arrangements under GATT 24"" until a free trade deal had been negotiated. GATT 24 is an article of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  Supporters of a no-deal Brexit say it would allow the UK to continue to trade with the EU without tariffs for up to 10 years, while the two sides were negotiating a permanent future trade agreement. But you can't use it in this way - a trade agreement has to be agreed in principle before Article 24 can be used. It also needs the two sides to agree - the UK can't just impose it on the EU.You can read more about it here. Home Secretary Sajid Javid outlined his plan to keep the Irish border open after Brexit - he said he would use existing technology. Other borders between EU and non-EU countries do use technology - for example at the Sweden-Norway border cars go through unmanned border posts equipped with cameras that use an automatic number plate recognition system and goods are declared to customs before they leave warehouses. But there is still some physical infrastructure. The EU still requires physical checks of goods at the Swedish border, so this system alone wouldn't eliminate the need for checks at the border in Ireland - a key sticking point in negotiations. You can read more about the question oftechnology on the Irish border here. Michael Gove used a figure on good and outstanding schools that has been criticised by the UK Statistics Authority. You can read theletter to the secretary of state for education here,external. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was talking about schools. ""You have nearly 25% of primary school leavers unable to read - I want us to be the Conservative government that abolishes illiteracy,"" he said. While 25% of year 6 pupils in 2018 failed to meet the expected standard for reading, that does not mean they were unable to read. Last week, the governmentsaid it would pass a law,externalcommitting the UK to cutting net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero by 2050 (that means any remaining emissions will be offset by investing in carbon reduction projects in other countries). Rory Stewart said that it was the most ambitious target so far set by any advanced industrial economy. The UK would indeed be the first major industrial economy to legislate in this way, and the first G7 country to set a net-zero emissions target by 2050. But, the Green Partyhas pointed out,externalthat Norway has a 2030 target for net-zero emissions, while Finland has committed to be carbon neutral by 2035.

The field has now been cut to five, with former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raabknocked out of the raceafter only gaining 30 votes. Boris Johnson remains the frontrunner, having upped his tally to 126 votes from the 114 he received in the first ballot last week. The remaining candidates then clashed over Brexit, their tax pledges, climate policy and other areas in a televised debate hosted by the BBC. The process will continue tomorrow with another ballot of Conservative MPs, after which the bottom-placed candidate will be eliminated. Scottish climate striker Erin, 15, asked the leadership contenders to commit to net zero admissions by 2025.Read more. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC Radio 5 Live BBC political correspondent Chris Mason says the expectation was there would be ""a lot of ganging up"" on Boris Johnson. But he says what was actually striking was ""how much ganging up there was on Rory Stewart"". That's because Mr Johnson is ""ahead by a country mile"" and so the ""battle now is to be second"" on the ballot. The gap between the current second place candidate and fifth place is just 13 MPs' votes, he says. ""I just wonder if Rory Stewart's 'big mo' might have eased off after tonight,"" he says. Katya AdlerEurope Editor EU politicians across the continent were dipping in and out of the debate. The comments I've heard so far off-the-record have not been particularly complimentary. The EU simply thinks that most of those leadership candidates are not being realistic. EU leaders are preparing a united, determined front when it comes to the idea of renegotiating the Brexit deal, and the answer is no. Even if, come the autumn, the EU were to be tempted to reopen some of those questions such as the Irish backstop, those conversations could never be finished by 31 October - the date by which most of those leadership candidates want to leave the EU. That's why this evening the EU thinks the idea of a no-deal Brexit is becoming increasingly likely. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reality Check When it comes to the border, there are three key
problems to solve - how do you keep the United Kingdom together, how do you preserve the integrity of the
EU single market and how do you prevent any sort of border controls being introduced? Boris Johnson suggested he could use something called Article 24 of GATT to
keep trade free. Acronyms aside, that requires both sides to agree so it isnât going to
happen in the event of no deal. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid suggested
technology could be used to avoid the need for the controversial backstop. But the EU has
said repeatedly that there is no technology in use anywhere in the world that
will keep the border as open as it is now after Brexit. BBC News editorial director tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reality Check Four of the five candidates committed to leave the EU by -
or not longer after - 31 October. Time is short, though. The new prime minister will not be in
place until the end of July and then all of the relevant institutions in the UK
and EU go on holiday until September. In September, you then have several weeks
of recess for party conference season in Britain, so no real work is likely to get done
until October. There is then only the rest of that month to do any negotiation,
ratification and legislating, so the chances of getting anything through by Halloween look slim. Daily Mirror politics correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content?

"Tory debate clash over Brexit deadlineBoris Johnson says it is ""eminently feasible"" to leave the EU by 31 October while several rivals say more time may be needed.UK Politics","This video can not be played Tory leader debate: 5 candidates, 5 things Tory leadership rivals have clashed in a live BBC TV debate on whether the UK can leave the EU, no matter what, by the 31 October deadline. Asked for a guarantee he would do this, Boris Johnson described the deadline as ""eminently feasible"". Sajid Javid said it ""focused minds"", but Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt said extra time might be needed. Rory Stewart accused his colleagues of lacking realism - of ""staring at the wall and saying 'believe in Britain'"". The five men vying to be Conservative Party leader - and the UK's next prime minister - were taking part in a live debate on BBC One on Tuesday night. Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was earliereliminated in the second round of voting,when Conservative MPs held a secret ballot. The third round of voting will take place later, between 15:00 and 17:00 BST. The result is expected at 18:00 BST and the MP with the lowest number of votes will be out of the race. Who will give up to stop Johnson? Five key moments from Tory leadership debate Fact-checking the Tory leadership candidates' claims During Tuesday's hour-long debate, all five men ruled out calling a general election until Brexit was resolved. But the encounter exposed divisions in their approaches to Brexit and whether they could accept the UK leaving the EU without an agreement. This video can not be played The first question to the five standing for who could be the Tory leader and PM was about a Brexit date guarantee. The candidates, who faced questions from members of the public on issues ranging from climate change to Islamophobia, also disagreed over whether to prioritise tax cuts or increased spending on public services after the UK leaves the EU. Mr Johnson, the frontrunner in the contest, was taking part in his first debate of the campaign after he skipped Sunday's Channel 4 encounter. Rory Stewart, reflecting on the debate on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said he had found it a ""frustrating"" format and wished he had pressed Mr Johnson further to explain how he would get a no-deal Brexit through without the consent of Parliament. Looking ahead to the vote later, he said he had received a ""couple of positive responses"" to appeals for support from MPs who had previously given their backing to Dominic Raab. Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who has switched his support from Mr Raab to Mr Johnson, said he ""certainly believed"" the UK would leave the EU by 31 October under Mr Johnson. Pressed on why Mr Johnson did not ""guarantee"" that on live TV, Mr Zahawi said: ""If the other side don't believe you will leave on 31 October on WTO terms then they will not come forward with a deal."" He added that EU negotiators would take Mr Johnson ""very seriously because they know he will prepare the country"". Jeremy Hunt said the EU needed to be able to trust the person they negotiate with. ""I believe they would trust Jeremy Hunt, they would sit around the table, they would listen,"" he told the Today programme. Asked if he was missing the charisma needed to win the leadership race, he said he had been underestimated all his life - in politics and in setting up his own successful business - and planned to surprise people. The former foreign secretary said the British people were ""fed up"" with the current deadlock over Brexit and the Tories would pay a ""really serious price"" if this continued. He warned of a ""catastrophic loss of confidence in politics"" if the latest Brexit deadline was not met. Asked if he could guarantee this, he replied that ""October 31 is eminently feasible"". ""If we allow 31 October to come and go as we let March come and go, I think the public would look on us with increasing mystification,"" Mr Johnson said. He also suggested there was no issue with continuing free trade after Brexit - citing something called Article 24 of GATT - butas BBC Reality Check points out,that relies on the UK and EU both signing up and in the event of no deal, that will not happen. Mr Javid, who came fifth in Tuesday's second round of voting, said a deadline was needed to ""focus minds"" in both the EU and the UK. ""We have to learn from our mistakes,"" he said. ""One of the mistakes we have made is having a flexible deadline."" This video can not be played The five Conservative leadership contenders were asked about resolving the Irish border issue He suggested the route to getting a Brexit deal through Parliament was by re-presenting Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement but without the controversial Irish backstop. Mr Gove said an ""arbitrary"" deadline was counter-productive and if he was prime minister he would be prepared to delay Brexit by a matter of days to finalise a deal. ""You sometimes have extra time in football matches in order to slot home the winner."" Mr Hunt said he would back a no-deal exit as a ""last resort"" but if the UK was close to finalising a deal with the EU he would extend the talks to prevent the disruption a no-deal exit would cause to business. As it happened: Tory leadership debate Compare the candidates left in the race Viewers' verdict on Tory leadership debate Both Mr Hunt and Mr Javid suggested new technology could potentially solve the intractable Irish border issue, butthe EU has said there is currently none in use anywherein the world that can keep it as open after Brexit as it is now. Mr Stewart said he would not allow a ""damaging and unnecessary"" no-deal exit and his rivals could not explain how they could possibly do this ""against the consent of Parliament"". He suggested he was seeking the most realistic ""door"" out of the EU while ""everyone else was staring at the wall and saying believe in Britain"". EU politicians across the continent were dipping in and out of the debate. The comments I've heard so far off-the-record have not been particularly complimentary. The EU simply thinks that most of those leadership candidates are not being realistic. EU leaders are preparing a united, determined front when it comes to the idea of renegotiating the Brexit deal, and the answer is no. Even if, come the autumn, the EU were to be tempted to reopen some of those questions such as the Irish backstop, those conversations could never be finished by 31 October - the date by which most of those leadership candidates want to leave the EU. That's why this evening the EU thinks the idea of a no-deal Brexit is becoming increasingly likely. Moving beyond Brexit, the candidates clashed over their economic plans and whether to prioritise higher spending on public services or tax cuts. There were sharp exchanges between Mr Stewart and other contenders, Michael Gove accusing him of having ""no plan"" for how to run the economy or public services. ""Bringing people together is not enough,"" he told Mr Stewart, who has emerged as the surprise contender in the race. However, after the debate Mr Stewart admitted his performance had been lacklustre, adding he did not think the ""strange"" format worked for him. Mr Gove also took aim at Mr Johnson's plans to give a tax cut to those earning more than Â£50,000 a year, saying the focus should be on ""helping the poorest in society"". Helping middle-earners was ""sensible"", Mr Johnson responded. Mr Stewart said promising tax cuts was ""wrong"" given the uncertainty around Brexit. Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? He called for a ""revolution"" in care for the elderly, calling current provision a ""disgrace"". Mr Hunt, who was health secretary for six years, also called for increased investment, suggesting cuts to care budgets under the current government had gone ""too far"". Mr Johnson reiterated that it was his ""ambition"" to cut taxes for higher earners, but as political correspondent Chris Mason pointed out, that seemed less committal than a ""promise"" to do it. Plenty expected lots of ganging up on Boris Johnson tonight from his rivals. But what was striking - after the Stewart surge in votes between rounds one and two in Parliament - is there was at least as much, if not more, ganging up on Rory Stewart. Why? Look at the numbers. There were just 13 votes separating Jeremy Hunt, who finished second, and Sajid Javid, who finished fifth in the leadership ballot. In other words, all of them, other than Boris Johnson, are potentially vulnerable to relatively small shifts in votes. And Mr Stewart, in the build up to tonight, had the momentum. Meanwhile, speaking to Newsnight after the debate, Mr Gove said he believed he had won the debate because of what he said were his ""detailed answers"" and ""clear plan"" on Brexit. Of his rivals, he said there were ""some other great people"" but added: ""They will all be fantastic members of my team."" Amid claims that the Conservatives have failed to tackle Islamophobia in the party, the candidates were pressed by an imam to accept that ""words have consequences"". Mr Johnson said he apologised if anything he had written, during 20 to 30 years as a journalist, or had said during his political career had caused offence. But he defended his conduct as foreign secretary in relation to the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who remains in jail in Iran on spying charges. He suggested his claim in 2017 that the dual British-Iranian national was actually working as a journalist in the country - which the Iranian authorities cited as a reason to increase her sentence - ""did not make any difference"". ""If you point the finger at the UK, all you are doing is exculpating those who are truly responsible,"" he said. Mr Javid challenged the other candidates to agree to an external inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory Party - which they all appeared to do. Referring to Donald Trump's string of attacks on London's Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan, he said politicians should be ""brave enough"" to call out Islamophobia wherever it came from.

Second question on Irish border issue,"This video can not be played The five Conservative leadership contenders were asked about resolving the Irish border issue The five remaining candidates to become the next prime minister have clashed over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland after Brexit. The MPs running to become Conservative leaderanswered questions from the public in a live debateon BBC One. All five agreed the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should remain ""free and open"". But they offered different visions of how they would ensure this. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop As it happened: Tory leadership debate Four of the five have rejected the backstop, which was part of the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May. The backstop is a position of last resort to maintain a seamless border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. Only International Development Secretary Rory Stewart spoke in favour of it. BBC viewer Mark Nolan, from Ballyclare in County Antrim, asked the candidates how they would ""solve the issue of the Irish border"". The debate was the first to feature Boris Johnson Frontrunner Boris Johnson said he remembered the Troubles and ""nobody wants to see the return of any kind of infrastructural or hard border"" on the island of Ireland, insisting the UK government would ""never"" do that. He insisted the problems posed by trade across the border could be resolved during an implementation period as the UK leaves the EU. The former foreign secretary argued the EU could be persuaded to amend its Brexit deal as it did not want the UK to leave in a disorderly manner and wanted the Â£39bn so-called divorce bill negotiated as part of the withdrawal agreement. Boris Johnson said ""nobody wants to see a hard border"" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said technology could be used to create a ""soft border"", but it was important the UK was not ""trapped"" indefinitely in the customs union. ""It is for us to come up with the solutions that would work,"" he said. ""What we can't have is a return to border infrastructure on the island of Ireland, because that was one of the fundamental achievements of the Good Friday Agreement."" This video can not be played What do the British public want to ask the Conservative hopefuls? Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the backstop needed to be time-limited, arguing Parliament would not vote for it as it stood. Mr Javid previously pledged to pay Ireland for the cost of border technology. ""Border force has looked at this. It is perfectly possible to have an open border with two different customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,"" he said. The Irish government and EU have both rejected this argument. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the ""peace process is about much more than just trade across the border"". He said there was a need to ""supercharge"" work on alternative arrangements that could replace the backstop. Rory Stewart said the only way to ensure an open border was through a withdrawal agreement that must include the backstop as it is currently configured. This would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. Mr Stewart said the EU had made it ""entirely clear"" the withdrawal agreement must include the currently configured backstop.

Why are more Scots living alone?,"More than a third of Scotland's households are occupied by a single person More people than ever are living on their own in Scotland. The latest government statistics show the number of households is rising - and increasing numbers of those are occupied by single people. More than a third of households in Scotland are filled by single occupants, about 885,000 people. An ageing population and an increase in younger people living alone are among the reasons for the change. The number of households in Scotland rose to 2.48 million in 2018, according to new figures published by National Records of Scotland (NRS). The report ""Estimates of Households and Dwellings in Scotland, 2018,external"" shows that over the last 10 years the number of households in Scotland has grown by about 139,000 (6%). Households consisting of only one person have been the most common type in Scotland since 2010 and now make up more than a third of households. One person households are increasing The main reason for single occupancy is the ageing population. Many elderly people are left alone when their partner dies and a growing proportion of older people are living in their own homes rather than care homes. Brian Sloan, chief executive of Age Scotland, said: ""Older people are more likely to live alone, with the number of households consisting of someone aged 70 or older projected to increase by 58% in the next 25 years. ""While it's good news that we're living longer, we urgently need to prepare for the challenges of our ageing population. It's vital that the Scottish government embeds the housing needs of older people in the planning process, especially those living alone. ""We need to build more accessible, age-friendly homes, that are the right type and tenure and enable people to live independently as long as possible. Most older people want to stay part of their own communities and prefer not to have to move as their health needs change. ""We also need more action to tackle the soaring levels of pensioner poverty and loneliness and isolation. Single older people are more likely to experience financial hardship, with six in 10 struggling to pay their fuel bills. They are also more at risk of loneliness, which can have a devastating impact on their physical and mental health."" Settling down into marriage or civil partnership at an older age and divorce also contributes to more solo households. And many younger people are choosing to live alone. The figures are put together each year to help planners, especially local authorities, to make decisions on housing provision and to organise things like waste collection, community care and risk analysis by Fire and Rescue Services. The rise in one-person households is partly down to the ageing population With the number of people living alone on the up, housing charity Shelter Scotland said this information should encourage housebuilders to change the kind of properties they offered. It said policymakers and housebuilders needed to catch up with this demand for different types of housing which would only get more intense as these demographic changes continued. Gordon MacRae from Shelter said: ""The failure to keep up with this long-term trend for more and smaller households is why Scotland is in the grip of a housing emergency. This emergency has a real human cost with almost 35,000 applications for homelessness in the last full year and 130,000 households on council waiting lists. ""Fundamentally, we need to see many more homes built with priority given to new homes for rent from councils and housing associations to ensure no-one is left behind. We also need people's housing rights strengthened and enforced so homelessness is prevented wherever possible."" The number of households has increased in every council area over the last 10 years, with the greatest relative increases occurring in Midlothian (16%) and the Orkney Islands (13%).

Further maths A-level paper replaced,"A further maths A-level paper due to be sat by about 7,000 candidates on Thursday has been replaced following the leak of an earlier exam last week. Two questions from the Edexcel maths A-level paper were shared on social ahead of it being sat on Friday. Pearson, the exam board's parent company, says it is replacing the latest paper and an unnamed centre is being investigated for the leak. It described the move as ""precautionary steps"" to protect students. Pearson said their investigation had revealed a package containing the further maths paper had been opened by an individual at the centre concerned. According to the company, there is no evidence to suggest the withdrawn test or any of its questions have been leaked but it is taking ""precautionary steps"" to safeguard the exam for the students. Exam leak: 'I cried in the car on the way home' Investigation after A-level paper leaked Sharon Hague, senior vice-president, schools for Pearson, said: ""We have reached out to all of our centres directly to inform them of this decision. ""We will continue to support and communicate with them through this unusual yet necessary step that is vital for the safeguarding of confidence in the examination system and to ensure fairness for all learners. ""Our message to students is not to worry about this and focus on your revision as you normally would."" Arrangements are being made to deliver the new further maths paper to all centres shortly before Thursday's exam - with the exception of the one being investigated. For this centre, separate arrangements are being made to ensure its students can complete their exams. In a video message to students, teachers and parents, Ms Hague said it was necessary for everyone involved in the exam system to work together. ""We are reliant on the collaboration and trust of everyone involved in the exam system - and when someone commits malpractice, they let everyone down,"" she said. She said the ""serious security breach"" last Thursday had been referred to the police, who had been asked to investigate it as a criminal matter. Ms Hague added there were various ways to ensure fair outcomes from last week's A-level maths exam, including the option to exclude the two leaked questions from the final calculation. Earlier this year, Pearson said it would be trialling a scheme where microchips were placed in exam packs to track the date, time and location of the bundles.

"Dominic Raab out of Tory leadership raceFive candidates, including frontrunner Boris Johnson and Rory Stewart, make it through to the next round.UK Politics","This video can not be played Dame Cheryl Gillan announces the result of Tuesday's Tory leadership vote - with five going through the next round Dominic Raab has been knocked out of the Tory leadership race in the latest ballot of MPs, leaving five candidates in the battle to be the next PM. Boris Johnson once again came top of the ballot, with 126 votes - 12 more than in the first round. Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart also got enough votes to make it into the next round. Mr Raab was eliminated after coming last with 30 votes, three fewer than the minimum needed to progress. The former Brexit secretary had called for the UK to leave the EU without a deal on 31 October if necessary. He also caused controversy by refusing to rule out suspending Parliament to thwart attempts by MPs to block a no-deal Brexit. Tory leadership: Who will be the next prime minister? Tory debate clash over Brexit deadline The next ballot will take place on Wednesday, with the candidate with the lowest number of votes eliminated.

Mr Hunt again came second in the latest ballot of 313 Tory MPs, with 46 votes - three more than in last week's first vote. Mr Gove and Mr Javid also increased their level of support - by four and 10 votes to 41 and 33 votes respectively. But it was Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, who made the biggest stride forward, nearly doubling his backing from 19 to 37 votes. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was likely that most of Mr Raab's supporters would transfer their votes to Mr Johnson, but, she said, ""there will certainly be a scrap for them."" And she pointed out how close the result was for the other candidates, adding: ""In tomorrow's vote a couple of moves here and there could make all the difference."" Tory MP Gillian Keegan said Mr Stewart was appealing to his colleagues because of his ""realistic plan"" for Brexit and his progress showed there was a ""market for honest politicians"". ""I think Rory is extraordinary. He has star quality you don't often see in politics."" Johnny Mercer, a supporter of Mr Johnson, said he was pleased by his performance but conceded the contest ""was not done yet"". Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who is backing Mr Hunt for the top job, said he remained in a ""strong"" second place. She told the BBC the foreign secretary remained ""a serious candidate for a serious job"". The BBC's Nicholas Watt said he had been told by a source close to Mr Javid that he would not be dropping out of the race even though he secured the lowest number of votes. Simon Hoare, one of Mr Javid's backers, said he was ""delighted"" the home secretary had made it through to the next stage. He said ""barring emergencies"" Mr Johnson would make it into the final two candidates and appealed to Tory MPs to think ""tactically"" about who should join him. Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Guy Opperman, who is backing Michael Gove, said a frontrunner ""had never won"" a Tory leadership contest and he believed MPs would ultimately ""coalesce"" around an alternative to Mr Johnson. He said Mr Gove had ""clawed his way"" back into the contest after days of negative newspaper headlines at the start of the campaign following his admission he had taken cocaine while working as a journalist in the late 1990s. As ""a committed Brexiteer"", he said he expected Mr Gove would pick up the overwhelming share of Mr Raab's 30 supporters in the next round. The remaining candidates will face up to three further ballots later this week, where the lowest-ranked MP will be knocked out until only two are left. The final two names will then be put to a postal vote of the 160,000 Tory party members, beginning on 22 June, with the winner expected to be announced about four weeks later.

Tory candidates face off in BBC leader debate,"This video can not be played Tory leader debate: 5 candidates, 5 things Tory leadership rivals have clashed in a live BBC TV debate on whether the UK can leave the EU, no matter what, by the 31 October deadline. Asked for a guarantee he would do this, Boris Johnson described the deadline as ""eminently feasible"". Sajid Javid said it ""focused minds"", but Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt said extra time might be needed. Rory Stewart accused his colleagues of lacking realism - of ""staring at the wall and saying 'believe in Britain'"". The five men vying to be Conservative Party leader - and the UK's next prime minister - were taking part in a live debate on BBC One on Tuesday night. Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was earliereliminated in the second round of voting,when Conservative MPs held a secret ballot. The third round of voting will take place later, between 15:00 and 17:00 BST. The result is expected at 18:00 BST and the MP with the lowest number of votes will be out of the race. Who will give up to stop Johnson? Five key moments from Tory leadership debate Fact-checking the Tory leadership candidates' claims During Tuesday's hour-long debate, all five men ruled out calling a general election until Brexit was resolved. But the encounter exposed divisions in their approaches to Brexit and whether they could accept the UK leaving the EU without an agreement. This video can not be played The first question to the five standing for who could be the Tory leader and PM was about a Brexit date guarantee. The candidates, who faced questions from members of the public on issues ranging from climate change to Islamophobia, also disagreed over whether to prioritise tax cuts or increased spending on public services after the UK leaves the EU. Mr Johnson, the frontrunner in the contest, was taking part in his first debate of the campaign after he skipped Sunday's Channel 4 encounter. Rory Stewart, reflecting on the debate on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said he had found it a ""frustrating"" format and wished he had pressed Mr Johnson further to explain how he would get a no-deal Brexit through without the consent of Parliament. Looking ahead to the vote later, he said he had received a ""couple of positive responses"" to appeals for support from MPs who had previously given their backing to Dominic Raab. Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who has switched his support from Mr Raab to Mr Johnson, said he ""certainly believed"" the UK would leave the EU by 31 October under Mr Johnson. Pressed on why Mr Johnson did not ""guarantee"" that on live TV, Mr Zahawi said: ""If the other side don't believe you will leave on 31 October on WTO terms then they will not come forward with a deal."" He added that EU negotiators would take Mr Johnson ""very seriously because they know he will prepare the country"". Jeremy Hunt said the EU needed to be able to trust the person they negotiate with. ""I believe they would trust Jeremy Hunt, they would sit around the table, they would listen,"" he told the Today programme. Asked if he was missing the charisma needed to win the leadership race, he said he had been underestimated all his life - in politics and in setting up his own successful business - and planned to surprise people. The former foreign secretary said the British people were ""fed up"" with the current deadlock over Brexit and the Tories would pay a ""really serious price"" if this continued. He warned of a ""catastrophic loss of confidence in politics"" if the latest Brexit deadline was not met. Asked if he could guarantee this, he replied that ""October 31 is eminently feasible"". ""If we allow 31 October to come and go as we let March come and go, I think the public would look on us with increasing mystification,"" Mr Johnson said. He also suggested there was no issue with continuing free trade after Brexit - citing something called Article 24 of GATT - butas BBC Reality Check points out,that relies on the UK and EU both signing up and in the event of no deal, that will not happen. Mr Javid, who came fifth in Tuesday's second round of voting, said a deadline was needed to ""focus minds"" in both the EU and the UK. ""We have to learn from our mistakes,"" he said. ""One of the mistakes we have made is having a flexible deadline."" This video can not be played The five Conservative leadership contenders were asked about resolving the Irish border issue He suggested the route to getting a Brexit deal through Parliament was by re-presenting Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement but without the controversial Irish backstop. Mr Gove said an ""arbitrary"" deadline was counter-productive and if he was prime minister he would be prepared to delay Brexit by a matter of days to finalise a deal. ""You sometimes have extra time in football matches in order to slot home the winner."" Mr Hunt said he would back a no-deal exit as a ""last resort"" but if the UK was close to finalising a deal with the EU he would extend the talks to prevent the disruption a no-deal exit would cause to business. As it happened: Tory leadership debate Compare the candidates left in the race Viewers' verdict on Tory leadership debate Both Mr Hunt and Mr Javid suggested new technology could potentially solve the intractable Irish border issue, butthe EU has said there is currently none in use anywherein the world that can keep it as open after Brexit as it is now. Mr Stewart said he would not allow a ""damaging and unnecessary"" no-deal exit and his rivals could not explain how they could possibly do this ""against the consent of Parliament"". He suggested he was seeking the most realistic ""door"" out of the EU while ""everyone else was staring at the wall and saying believe in Britain"". EU politicians across the continent were dipping in and out of the debate. The comments I've heard so far off-the-record have not been particularly complimentary. The EU simply thinks that most of those leadership candidates are not being realistic. EU leaders are preparing a united, determined front when it comes to the idea of renegotiating the Brexit deal, and the answer is no. Even if, come the autumn, the EU were to be tempted to reopen some of those questions such as the Irish backstop, those conversations could never be finished by 31 October - the date by which most of those leadership candidates want to leave the EU. That's why this evening the EU thinks the idea of a no-deal Brexit is becoming increasingly likely. Moving beyond Brexit, the candidates clashed over their economic plans and whether to prioritise higher spending on public services or tax cuts. There were sharp exchanges between Mr Stewart and other contenders, Michael Gove accusing him of having ""no plan"" for how to run the economy or public services. ""Bringing people together is not enough,"" he told Mr Stewart, who has emerged as the surprise contender in the race. However, after the debate Mr Stewart admitted his performance had been lacklustre, adding he did not think the ""strange"" format worked for him. Mr Gove also took aim at Mr Johnson's plans to give a tax cut to those earning more than Â£50,000 a year, saying the focus should be on ""helping the poorest in society"". Helping middle-earners was ""sensible"", Mr Johnson responded. Mr Stewart said promising tax cuts was ""wrong"" given the uncertainty around Brexit. Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? He called for a ""revolution"" in care for the elderly, calling current provision a ""disgrace"". Mr Hunt, who was health secretary for six years, also called for increased investment, suggesting cuts to care budgets under the current government had gone ""too far"". Mr Johnson reiterated that it was his ""ambition"" to cut taxes for higher earners, but as political correspondent Chris Mason pointed out, that seemed less committal than a ""promise"" to do it. Plenty expected lots of ganging up on Boris Johnson tonight from his rivals. But what was striking - after the Stewart surge in votes between rounds one and two in Parliament - is there was at least as much, if not more, ganging up on Rory Stewart. Why? Look at the numbers. There were just 13 votes separating Jeremy Hunt, who finished second, and Sajid Javid, who finished fifth in the leadership ballot. In other words, all of them, other than Boris Johnson, are potentially vulnerable to relatively small shifts in votes. And Mr Stewart, in the build up to tonight, had the momentum. Meanwhile, speaking to Newsnight after the debate, Mr Gove said he believed he had won the debate because of what he said were his ""detailed answers"" and ""clear plan"" on Brexit. Of his rivals, he said there were ""some other great people"" but added: ""They will all be fantastic members of my team."" Amid claims that the Conservatives have failed to tackle Islamophobia in the party, the candidates were pressed by an imam to accept that ""words have consequences"". Mr Johnson said he apologised if anything he had written, during 20 to 30 years as a journalist, or had said during his political career had caused offence. But he defended his conduct as foreign secretary in relation to the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who remains in jail in Iran on spying charges. He suggested his claim in 2017 that the dual British-Iranian national was actually working as a journalist in the country - which the Iranian authorities cited as a reason to increase her sentence - ""did not make any difference"". ""If you point the finger at the UK, all you are doing is exculpating those who are truly responsible,"" he said. Mr Javid challenged the other candidates to agree to an external inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory Party - which they all appeared to do. Referring to Donald Trump's string of attacks on London's Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan, he said politicians should be ""brave enough"" to call out Islamophobia wherever it came from.

Berlin backs rent freeze amid housing pressureRents have soared in the German capital - and now politicians are moving to keep flats affordable.Europe,"A fair rent march in Berlin: The top banner reads ""My home is not your profit"" Berlin's left-wing government has approved a plan to freeze rents in the German capital for the next five years. Rents have risen sharply in the city and there have been rallies urging the authorities to keep housing affordable. The plan is expected to become law in January. It could apply to 1.4 million properties, but not to social housing - regulated separately - or new builds. The average monthly rent for a furnished Berlin flat is about â¬1,100 (Â£983; $1,232). Aninternational comparison website, housinganywhere.com, reports,externalthat several major European cities are more expensive than Berlin for apartment rents, including Barcelona, Rotterdam and Milan. Berlin rents however rose by 7% in the first quarter of this year, and in the past decade rents have doubled as the booming city has become a magnet for jobseekers. The most expensive for rents in Europe is London:the Evening Standard reports,externalthat a typical two-bedroom flat in Southwark, near central London, costs Â£1,573 (â¬1,760; $1,970) a month. This video can not be played Berlin vs London: Which city is better for renters? The Berlin draft law, approved by the city's Senate, is being keenly watched across Germany, as there have been many complaints about housing costs elsewhere too, for example in Hamburg. The Berlin regional parliament still has to vote on it. The left-wing Social Democrats (SPD), in power in Berlin, favour a national rent cap, but critics point out that the housing market varies considerably from one region to the next. Central Berlin has undergone major redevelopment in recent years BBC Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill writes: The flyers appeared overnight on lampposts in my neighbourhood. A picture of a young couple who explained that they were flat-hunting and, as professional photographers, would offer a free photoshoot to any landlord who'd take them on. It's not an unusual phenomenon. One woman recently offered to bake regularly for anyone who'd rent her their flat. Berlin can't build affordable accommodation fast enough for the city's rising population. An open showing of a newly available flat is likely to attract well over 100 hopeful, would-be tenants. Demand is pushing up rents as corporate investors buy up and renovate old or dilapidated buildings, and it's pricing Berliners out of their old neighbourhoods. Demand and rents are rising in many other German cities too. Berlin is, by comparison with somewhere like Munich, still relatively cheap but, even as the Berlin authorities ponder their response, Chancellor Angela Merkel has promised to take action over what is an increasingly sensitive subject for the electorate. Chancellor Merkel, of the Christian Democrats (CDU), agrees with the SPD - her coalition partner - that the squeeze on affordable housing is a problem. But she argues that the best solution is to build new homes. Under the Berlin plan, the rent cap - likely to become law in January - would be backdated to 18 June, to prevent landlords from pushing up rents sharply over the next six months.

Some argue that such a freeze would reduce housing improvements by landlords, including investments in better insulation and other green economy measures. Some critics argue that there would be many exemptions, undermining the law's effectiveness. For example, rents for new builds could go up sharply as they would not be covered by the cap. German property firms justify the cost of new apartments by arguing that construction costs have risen 33% in Germany since 2005, compared with just 6% in the Netherlands, ARD reports.

Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?Tory leadership: Who will be the next prime minister?,"Boris Johnson is the UK's new prime minister and will now begin the task of trying to deliver Brexit. The former foreign secretary has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. He has called the withdrawal agreement ""dead"" but says he will ""take the bits that are serviceable and get them done"" - such as guaranteeing the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK. The withdrawal agreement (WA) is the deal negotiated by the UK government and the European Union (EU) to settle the basis on which the UK will leave. As part of it, the UK agreed to pay the EU a ""divorce bill"" (estimated to be Â£39bn), guarantee EU citizens' rights and sign up to the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The deal allowed for a transition period after Brexit, during which things like UK-EU trade would stay the same, while both sides worked out their future relationship. But the withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by MPs - leading to Theresa May's downfall. After Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which might mean products being checked at the border. To avoid border posts (which some believe could threaten the peace process), Mrs May and the EU agreed on the backstop. In the event that no free trade deal was agreed that avoided a hard border, this insurance policy would effectively keep the UK and EU in a customs union. This proved controversial because it would stop the UK doing some of its own trade deals. Mr Johnson is saying the Irish border can be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU, instead of as part of the withdrawal agreement. Obstacle:The EU has said the Irish backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement - the deal to delay the UK's exit until the end of October specifically prohibited its renegotiation. If the UK leaves with no deal and seeks a free trade agreement, the EU has said it will not begin negotiations until the issue of the Irish border is settled. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Boris Johnson wants to ditch the Irish backstop - he's called it ""a prison"". He has said there are ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" to avoid checks at the border. He concedes there is ""no single magic bullet"" but points to a ""wealth of solutions"" instead. Obstacle:The UK and the EU have previously looked fortechnological solutions to the Irish borderwithout success. EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said in January: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" There are ""alternative arrangements"" which could help: trusted trader schemes (where businesses are certified to make sure they meet certain standards) and ways of making customs declarations away from the border, but they wouldn't eliminate the need for checks altogether. After Brexit, the EU would still require inspections of things like animal and plant products entering its single market, and the new entry point to that market would be at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to withhold the money the UK has agreed to pay the EU and use it as a negotiating tool to get a better deal. Settling the UK's financial obligations (which include previously agreed contributions to the EU budget and funding things like EU staff pensions) was agreed by Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement. The figure for those obligations has been calculated at Â£39bn. Obstacle:The EU has said it will not start future trade talks until the issue of money (along with citizens' rights and the Irish border) is settled. Refusing to pay would almost certainly sour relations between the two,and could lead to a legal challenge from the EU. While accepting that a ""disruptive... badly handled"" no-deal Brexit would be costly, Mr Johnson said it was ""vanishingly inexpensive if you prepare"" and added that ""much of this work has been done"". Obstacle:Mr Johnson's view of the cost of a no-deal Brexit is at odds with the vast majority of economists, a significant number of his own backbenchers, and organisations such as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the government's forecasts for the economy.The OBR saidno deal would push the UK economy into recession. Mr Johnson has said he would mitigate the effects of no deal on the UK economy (which he admits would cause ""disruption"") by relying on a piece of trade law known as Article 24. He originally said this would allow the UK and the EU to have zero tariffs (taxes on imports) on trade while the two sides negotiated a trade deal. This would, in theory, help keep trade flowing and would stop the EU imposing tariffs on goods being imported from the UK (cars, for example, are subject to a 10% import tax from non-EU countries, and on agricultural produce it's even higher). Obstacle:Boris Johnson was wrong to sayArticle 24 would automatically allow for a standstill in trade relations, and indeed - when challenged in interviews - he later accepted that it would require the agreement of both sides. Also, Article 24 only covers the trade in goods (not services) and it does not cover non-tariff barriers such as regulations. The EU has ruled out signing any Article 24 agreement immediately after a no-deal Brexit.

BBC prepares to host Tory leadership debateVideoVideoThe moment Raab was eliminated from leadership raceBrexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand?The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister,"This video can not be played Tory leader debate: 5 candidates, 5 things Tory leadership rivals have clashed in a live BBC TV debate on whether the UK can leave the EU, no matter what, by the 31 October deadline. Asked for a guarantee he would do this, Boris Johnson described the deadline as ""eminently feasible"". Sajid Javid said it ""focused minds"", but Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt said extra time might be needed. Rory Stewart accused his colleagues of lacking realism - of ""staring at the wall and saying 'believe in Britain'"". The five men vying to be Conservative Party leader - and the UK's next prime minister - were taking part in a live debate on BBC One on Tuesday night. Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was earliereliminated in the second round of voting,when Conservative MPs held a secret ballot. The third round of voting will take place later, between 15:00 and 17:00 BST. The result is expected at 18:00 BST and the MP with the lowest number of votes will be out of the race. Who will give up to stop Johnson? Five key moments from Tory leadership debate Fact-checking the Tory leadership candidates' claims During Tuesday's hour-long debate, all five men ruled out calling a general election until Brexit was resolved. But the encounter exposed divisions in their approaches to Brexit and whether they could accept the UK leaving the EU without an agreement. This video can not be played The first question to the five standing for who could be the Tory leader and PM was about a Brexit date guarantee. The candidates, who faced questions from members of the public on issues ranging from climate change to Islamophobia, also disagreed over whether to prioritise tax cuts or increased spending on public services after the UK leaves the EU. Mr Johnson, the frontrunner in the contest, was taking part in his first debate of the campaign after he skipped Sunday's Channel 4 encounter. Rory Stewart, reflecting on the debate on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said he had found it a ""frustrating"" format and wished he had pressed Mr Johnson further to explain how he would get a no-deal Brexit through without the consent of Parliament. Looking ahead to the vote later, he said he had received a ""couple of positive responses"" to appeals for support from MPs who had previously given their backing to Dominic Raab. Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who has switched his support from Mr Raab to Mr Johnson, said he ""certainly believed"" the UK would leave the EU by 31 October under Mr Johnson. Pressed on why Mr Johnson did not ""guarantee"" that on live TV, Mr Zahawi said: ""If the other side don't believe you will leave on 31 October on WTO terms then they will not come forward with a deal."" He added that EU negotiators would take Mr Johnson ""very seriously because they know he will prepare the country"". Jeremy Hunt said the EU needed to be able to trust the person they negotiate with. ""I believe they would trust Jeremy Hunt, they would sit around the table, they would listen,"" he told the Today programme. Asked if he was missing the charisma needed to win the leadership race, he said he had been underestimated all his life - in politics and in setting up his own successful business - and planned to surprise people. The former foreign secretary said the British people were ""fed up"" with the current deadlock over Brexit and the Tories would pay a ""really serious price"" if this continued. He warned of a ""catastrophic loss of confidence in politics"" if the latest Brexit deadline was not met. Asked if he could guarantee this, he replied that ""October 31 is eminently feasible"". ""If we allow 31 October to come and go as we let March come and go, I think the public would look on us with increasing mystification,"" Mr Johnson said. He also suggested there was no issue with continuing free trade after Brexit - citing something called Article 24 of GATT - butas BBC Reality Check points out,that relies on the UK and EU both signing up and in the event of no deal, that will not happen. Mr Javid, who came fifth in Tuesday's second round of voting, said a deadline was needed to ""focus minds"" in both the EU and the UK. ""We have to learn from our mistakes,"" he said. ""One of the mistakes we have made is having a flexible deadline."" This video can not be played The five Conservative leadership contenders were asked about resolving the Irish border issue He suggested the route to getting a Brexit deal through Parliament was by re-presenting Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement but without the controversial Irish backstop. Mr Gove said an ""arbitrary"" deadline was counter-productive and if he was prime minister he would be prepared to delay Brexit by a matter of days to finalise a deal. ""You sometimes have extra time in football matches in order to slot home the winner."" Mr Hunt said he would back a no-deal exit as a ""last resort"" but if the UK was close to finalising a deal with the EU he would extend the talks to prevent the disruption a no-deal exit would cause to business. As it happened: Tory leadership debate Compare the candidates left in the race Viewers' verdict on Tory leadership debate Both Mr Hunt and Mr Javid suggested new technology could potentially solve the intractable Irish border issue, butthe EU has said there is currently none in use anywherein the world that can keep it as open after Brexit as it is now. Mr Stewart said he would not allow a ""damaging and unnecessary"" no-deal exit and his rivals could not explain how they could possibly do this ""against the consent of Parliament"". He suggested he was seeking the most realistic ""door"" out of the EU while ""everyone else was staring at the wall and saying believe in Britain"". EU politicians across the continent were dipping in and out of the debate. The comments I've heard so far off-the-record have not been particularly complimentary. The EU simply thinks that most of those leadership candidates are not being realistic. EU leaders are preparing a united, determined front when it comes to the idea of renegotiating the Brexit deal, and the answer is no. Even if, come the autumn, the EU were to be tempted to reopen some of those questions such as the Irish backstop, those conversations could never be finished by 31 October - the date by which most of those leadership candidates want to leave the EU. That's why this evening the EU thinks the idea of a no-deal Brexit is becoming increasingly likely. Moving beyond Brexit, the candidates clashed over their economic plans and whether to prioritise higher spending on public services or tax cuts. There were sharp exchanges between Mr Stewart and other contenders, Michael Gove accusing him of having ""no plan"" for how to run the economy or public services. ""Bringing people together is not enough,"" he told Mr Stewart, who has emerged as the surprise contender in the race. However, after the debate Mr Stewart admitted his performance had been lacklustre, adding he did not think the ""strange"" format worked for him. Mr Gove also took aim at Mr Johnson's plans to give a tax cut to those earning more than Â£50,000 a year, saying the focus should be on ""helping the poorest in society"". Helping middle-earners was ""sensible"", Mr Johnson responded. Mr Stewart said promising tax cuts was ""wrong"" given the uncertainty around Brexit. Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? He called for a ""revolution"" in care for the elderly, calling current provision a ""disgrace"". Mr Hunt, who was health secretary for six years, also called for increased investment, suggesting cuts to care budgets under the current government had gone ""too far"". Mr Johnson reiterated that it was his ""ambition"" to cut taxes for higher earners, but as political correspondent Chris Mason pointed out, that seemed less committal than a ""promise"" to do it. Plenty expected lots of ganging up on Boris Johnson tonight from his rivals. But what was striking - after the Stewart surge in votes between rounds one and two in Parliament - is there was at least as much, if not more, ganging up on Rory Stewart. Why? Look at the numbers. There were just 13 votes separating Jeremy Hunt, who finished second, and Sajid Javid, who finished fifth in the leadership ballot. In other words, all of them, other than Boris Johnson, are potentially vulnerable to relatively small shifts in votes. And Mr Stewart, in the build up to tonight, had the momentum. Meanwhile, speaking to Newsnight after the debate, Mr Gove said he believed he had won the debate because of what he said were his ""detailed answers"" and ""clear plan"" on Brexit. Of his rivals, he said there were ""some other great people"" but added: ""They will all be fantastic members of my team."" Amid claims that the Conservatives have failed to tackle Islamophobia in the party, the candidates were pressed by an imam to accept that ""words have consequences"". Mr Johnson said he apologised if anything he had written, during 20 to 30 years as a journalist, or had said during his political career had caused offence. But he defended his conduct as foreign secretary in relation to the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who remains in jail in Iran on spying charges. He suggested his claim in 2017 that the dual British-Iranian national was actually working as a journalist in the country - which the Iranian authorities cited as a reason to increase her sentence - ""did not make any difference"". ""If you point the finger at the UK, all you are doing is exculpating those who are truly responsible,"" he said. Mr Javid challenged the other candidates to agree to an external inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory Party - which they all appeared to do. Referring to Donald Trump's string of attacks on London's Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan, he said politicians should be ""brave enough"" to call out Islamophobia wherever it came from.

The stark photo highlighting GreenlandÃ¢ÂÂs ice loss,"Climate scientist Steffen Olsen took this picture while travelling across melted sea ice in north-west Greenland With their sled in tow, a pack of dogs trudge towards a distant mountain range in north-west Greenland. The stunning picture may seem typical enough of the Danish territory. What's beneath their feet - a shallow pool of crystal-blue water - is anything but. Last week, however, temperatures soared well above normal levels in Greenland, causing about half of its ice sheet surface to experience melting. And the sea ice around the territory is, of course, also feeling this heat. Steffen Olsen, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), took the photo on 13 June as these warming conditions reached their peak. 'Cryoegg' to explore under Greenland Ice Sheet Greenland map captures changing Arctic Rain melting Greenland ice sheet 'even in winter' Mr Olsen and his team were retrieving equipment from a weather station in the Inglefield Fjord area. As they walked across the 1.2m (4ft) thick sea ice, water pooled on the surface. On Twitter, his colleague at DMI Rasmus Tonboe later shared the image, telling followers ""rapid melt"" had occurred. Because the sea ice is compact with almost no cracks, the image gives the impression the dogs are walking on water, Martin Stendel, senior researcher at the institute, told the BBC.

On that day, Greenland is estimated to have lost the equivalent of 2bn tonnes of ice. Temperatures, according to the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting, were around 22C above normal the day before. In the village of Qaanaaq, a high of 17.3C was recorded. Since then, Mr Olsen's photo has been shared widely on social media, provoking concern at the extent of the melting event and its causes. Greenland's ice sheet melts annually, with the season usually lasting from June to August. The summer months - typically in July - are when it reaches its height. This year, however, climate experts say it is early. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It's very unusual to have this much melt so early in the season,"" William Colgan, senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told the BBC. ""It takes very rare conditions but they're becoming increasingly common."" Mr Colgan compared the melt to 2012, when record-breaking ice sheet loss was recorded in Greenland. He said the same two factors were thought to have caused last week's ice melt and the historic event of 2012. One is high pressure lodged over Greenland, creating warm and sunny conditions. The other is low cloud cover and snowfall, meaning solar radiation can strike the ice sheet surface. Global warming, Mr Colgan said, was ""tremendously important"" to these sorts of events. This video can not be played Watch: Huge iceberg breaks apart near a village in western Greenland A small fishing boat heads out into the sea ice near the town of Uummannaq in western Greenland ""What climate change is doing is increasingly loading the dice to set up weather conditions that can tip the ice sheets into these mass loss events,"" he said. If these trends continued, said Professor Edward Hanna, a climate scientist at the University of Lincoln, Greenland could experience a record melt this year. ""The thing is, with climate trends, as we've seen over the past 20 years, as it gets warmer and warmer over Greenland, you don't need that much of an exceptional event to melt the whole surface of the ice,"" he told the BBC. The consequences, he said, would not only be felt locally but globally, too. Temperatures were around 22C above normal in Greenland last week, data shows As sea ice disappears, local communities who rely on it for transport, hunting and fishing are expected to suffer. On a global level, Prof Hanna said ""sea level rise is the big one"". ""You're losing something like 250 billion tonnes of ice a year on average. A huge mass is being transferred from the land into the oceans,"" he said. Mr Colgan said we should be mindful that the melt on 13 June was just ""a one-day event that is surprising in its magnitude and its early onset"". As studies showed, he said, global warming could mean more extreme melting events were yet to come. ""We can expect to see more of these in the future,"" he said.

The third round of voting will take place later, between 15:00 and 17:00 BST. The result is expected at 18:00 BST and the MP with the lowest number of votes will be out of the race. Who will give up to stop Johnson? Five key moments from Tory leadership debate Fact-checking the Tory leadership candidates' claims During Tuesday's hour-long debate, all five men ruled out calling a general election until Brexit was resolved. But the encounter exposed divisions in their approaches to Brexit and whether they could accept the UK leaving the EU without an agreement. This video can not be played The first question to the five standing for who could be the Tory leader and PM was about a Brexit date guarantee. The candidates, who faced questions from members of the public on issues ranging from climate change to Islamophobia, also disagreed over whether to prioritise tax cuts or increased spending on public services after the UK leaves the EU. Mr Johnson, the frontrunner in the contest, was taking part in his first debate of the campaign after he skipped Sunday's Channel 4 encounter. Rory Stewart, reflecting on the debate on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said he had found it a ""frustrating"" format and wished he had pressed Mr Johnson further to explain how he would get a no-deal Brexit through without the consent of Parliament. Looking ahead to the vote later, he said he had received a ""couple of positive responses"" to appeals for support from MPs who had previously given their backing to Dominic Raab. Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who has switched his support from Mr Raab to Mr Johnson, said he ""certainly believed"" the UK would leave the EU by 31 October under Mr Johnson. Pressed on why Mr Johnson did not ""guarantee"" that on live TV, Mr Zahawi said: ""If the other side don't believe you will leave on 31 October on WTO terms then they will not come forward with a deal."" He added that EU negotiators would take Mr Johnson ""very seriously because they know he will prepare the country"". Jeremy Hunt said the EU needed to be able to trust the person they negotiate with. ""I believe they would trust Jeremy Hunt, they would sit around the table, they would listen,"" he told the Today programme. Asked if he was missing the charisma needed to win the leadership race, he said he had been underestimated all his life - in politics and in setting up his own successful business - and planned to surprise people. The former foreign secretary said the British people were ""fed up"" with the current deadlock over Brexit and the Tories would pay a ""really serious price"" if this continued. He warned of a ""catastrophic loss of confidence in politics"" if the latest Brexit deadline was not met. Asked if he could guarantee this, he replied that ""October 31 is eminently feasible"". ""If we allow 31 October to come and go as we let March come and go, I think the public would look on us with increasing mystification,"" Mr Johnson said. He also suggested there was no issue with continuing free trade after Brexit - citing something called Article 24 of GATT - butas BBC Reality Check points out,that relies on the UK and EU both signing up and in the event of no deal, that will not happen. Mr Javid, who came fifth in Tuesday's second round of voting, said a deadline was needed to ""focus minds"" in both the EU and the UK. ""We have to learn from our mistakes,"" he said. ""One of the mistakes we have made is having a flexible deadline."" This video can not be played The five Conservative leadership contenders were asked about resolving the Irish border issue He suggested the route to getting a Brexit deal through Parliament was by re-presenting Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement but without the controversial Irish backstop. Mr Gove said an ""arbitrary"" deadline was counter-productive and if he was prime minister he would be prepared to delay Brexit by a matter of days to finalise a deal. ""You sometimes have extra time in football matches in order to slot home the winner."" Mr Hunt said he would back a no-deal exit as a ""last resort"" but if the UK was close to finalising a deal with the EU he would extend the talks to prevent the disruption a no-deal exit would cause to business. As it happened: Tory leadership debate Compare the candidates left in the race Viewers' verdict on Tory leadership debate Both Mr Hunt and Mr Javid suggested new technology could potentially solve the intractable Irish border issue, butthe EU has said there is currently none in use anywherein the world that can keep it as open after Brexit as it is now. Mr Stewart said he would not allow a ""damaging and unnecessary"" no-deal exit and his rivals could not explain how they could possibly do this ""against the consent of Parliament"". He suggested he was seeking the most realistic ""door"" out of the EU while ""everyone else was staring at the wall and saying believe in Britain"". EU politicians across the continent were dipping in and out of the debate. The comments I've heard so far off-the-record have not been particularly complimentary. The EU simply thinks that most of those leadership candidates are not being realistic. EU leaders are preparing a united, determined front when it comes to the idea of renegotiating the Brexit deal, and the answer is no. Even if, come the autumn, the EU were to be tempted to reopen some of those questions such as the Irish backstop, those conversations could never be finished by 31 October - the date by which most of those leadership candidates want to leave the EU. That's why this evening the EU thinks the idea of a no-deal Brexit is becoming increasingly likely. Moving beyond Brexit, the candidates clashed over their economic plans and whether to prioritise higher spending on public services or tax cuts. There were sharp exchanges between Mr Stewart and other contenders, Michael Gove accusing him of having ""no plan"" for how to run the economy or public services. ""Bringing people together is not enough,"" he told Mr Stewart, who has emerged as the surprise contender in the race. However, after the debate Mr Stewart admitted his performance had been lacklustre, adding he did not think the ""strange"" format worked for him. Mr Gove also took aim at Mr Johnson's plans to give a tax cut to those earning more than Â£50,000 a year, saying the focus should be on ""helping the poorest in society"". Helping middle-earners was ""sensible"", Mr Johnson responded. Mr Stewart said promising tax cuts was ""wrong"" given the uncertainty around Brexit. Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? He called for a ""revolution"" in care for the elderly, calling current provision a ""disgrace"". Mr Hunt, who was health secretary for six years, also called for increased investment, suggesting cuts to care budgets under the current government had gone ""too far"". Mr Johnson reiterated that it was his ""ambition"" to cut taxes for higher earners, but as political correspondent Chris Mason pointed out, that seemed less committal than a ""promise"" to do it. Plenty expected lots of ganging up on Boris Johnson tonight from his rivals. But what was striking - after the Stewart surge in votes between rounds one and two in Parliament - is there was at least as much, if not more, ganging up on Rory Stewart. Why? Look at the numbers. There were just 13 votes separating Jeremy Hunt, who finished second, and Sajid Javid, who finished fifth in the leadership ballot. In other words, all of them, other than Boris Johnson, are potentially vulnerable to relatively small shifts in votes. And Mr Stewart, in the build up to tonight, had the momentum. Meanwhile, speaking to Newsnight after the debate, Mr Gove said he believed he had won the debate because of what he said were his ""detailed answers"" and ""clear plan"" on Brexit. Of his rivals, he said there were ""some other great people"" but added: ""They will all be fantastic members of my team."" Amid claims that the Conservatives have failed to tackle Islamophobia in the party, the candidates were pressed by an imam to accept that ""words have consequences"". Mr Johnson said he apologised if anything he had written, during 20 to 30 years as a journalist, or had said during his political career had caused offence. But he defended his conduct as foreign secretary in relation to the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who remains in jail in Iran on spying charges. He suggested his claim in 2017 that the dual British-Iranian national was actually working as a journalist in the country - which the Iranian authorities cited as a reason to increase her sentence - ""did not make any difference"". ""If you point the finger at the UK, all you are doing is exculpating those who are truly responsible,"" he said. Mr Javid challenged the other candidates to agree to an external inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory Party - which they all appeared to do. Referring to Donald Trump's string of attacks on London's Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan, he said politicians should be ""brave enough"" to call out Islamophobia wherever it came from.

The stark photo highlighting Greenlandâs ice loss,"Climate scientist Steffen Olsen took this picture while travelling across melted sea ice in north-west Greenland With their sled in tow, a pack of dogs trudge towards a distant mountain range in north-west Greenland. The stunning picture may seem typical enough of the Danish territory. What's beneath their feet - a shallow pool of crystal-blue water - is anything but. Last week, however, temperatures soared well above normal levels in Greenland, causing about half of its ice sheet surface to experience melting. And the sea ice around the territory is, of course, also feeling this heat. Steffen Olsen, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), took the photo on 13 June as these warming conditions reached their peak.

As they walked across the 1.2m (4ft) thick sea ice, water pooled on the surface. On Twitter, his colleague at DMI Rasmus Tonboe later shared the image, telling followers ""rapid melt"" had occurred. Because the sea ice is compact with almost no cracks, the image gives the impression the dogs are walking on water, Martin Stendel, senior researcher at the institute, told the BBC.

""It's very unusual to have this much melt so early in the season,"" William Colgan, senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told the BBC. ""It takes very rare conditions but they're becoming increasingly common."" Mr Colgan compared the melt to 2012, when record-breaking ice sheet loss was recorded in Greenland. He said the same two factors were thought to have caused last week's ice melt and the historic event of 2012. One is high pressure lodged over Greenland, creating warm and sunny conditions. The other is low cloud cover and snowfall, meaning solar radiation can strike the ice sheet surface. Global warming, Mr Colgan said, was ""tremendously important"" to these sorts of events. This video can not be played Watch: Huge iceberg breaks apart near a village in western Greenland A small fishing boat heads out into the sea ice near the town of Uummannaq in western Greenland ""What climate change is doing is increasingly loading the dice to set up weather conditions that can tip the ice sheets into these mass loss events,"" he said. If these trends continued, said Professor Edward Hanna, a climate scientist at the University of Lincoln, Greenland could experience a record melt this year. ""The thing is, with climate trends, as we've seen over the past 20 years, as it gets warmer and warmer over Greenland, you don't need that much of an exceptional event to melt the whole surface of the ice,"" he told the BBC. The consequences, he said, would not only be felt locally but globally, too. Temperatures were around 22C above normal in Greenland last week, data shows As sea ice disappears, local communities who rely on it for transport, hunting and fishing are expected to suffer. On a global level, Prof Hanna said ""sea level rise is the big one"". ""You're losing something like 250 billion tonnes of ice a year on average. A huge mass is being transferred from the land into the oceans,"" he said. Mr Colgan said we should be mindful that the melt on 13 June was just ""a one-day event that is surprising in its magnitude and its early onset"". As studies showed, he said, global warming could mean more extreme melting events were yet to come. ""We can expect to see more of these in the future,"" he said.

"Further maths A-level paper replacedThe move is a ""precautionary step"" to protect students, says Edexcel's parent company, Pearson.Family & Education","A further maths A-level paper due to be sat by about 7,000 candidates on Thursday has been replaced following the leak of an earlier exam last week. Two questions from the Edexcel maths A-level paper were shared on social ahead of it being sat on Friday. Pearson, the exam board's parent company, says it is replacing the latest paper and an unnamed centre is being investigated for the leak. It described the move as ""precautionary steps"" to protect students. Pearson said their investigation had revealed a package containing the further maths paper had been opened by an individual at the centre concerned. According to the company, there is no evidence to suggest the withdrawn test or any of its questions have been leaked but it is taking ""precautionary steps"" to safeguard the exam for the students. Exam leak: 'I cried in the car on the way home' Investigation after A-level paper leaked Sharon Hague, senior vice-president, schools for Pearson, said: ""We have reached out to all of our centres directly to inform them of this decision. ""We will continue to support and communicate with them through this unusual yet necessary step that is vital for the safeguarding of confidence in the examination system and to ensure fairness for all learners. ""Our message to students is not to worry about this and focus on your revision as you normally would."" Arrangements are being made to deliver the new further maths paper to all centres shortly before Thursday's exam - with the exception of the one being investigated. For this centre, separate arrangements are being made to ensure its students can complete their exams. In a video message to students, teachers and parents, Ms Hague said it was necessary for everyone involved in the exam system to work together. ""We are reliant on the collaboration and trust of everyone involved in the exam system - and when someone commits malpractice, they let everyone down,"" she said. She said the ""serious security breach"" last Thursday had been referred to the police, who had been asked to investigate it as a criminal matter. Ms Hague added there were various ways to ensure fair outcomes from last week's A-level maths exam, including the option to exclude the two leaked questions from the final calculation. Earlier this year, Pearson said it would be trialling a scheme where microchips were placed in exam packs to track the date, time and location of the bundles.

Breaking|Breaking newsDominic Raab out of Tory leadership race,"This video can not be played Dame Cheryl Gillan announces the result of Tuesday's Tory leadership vote - with five going through the next round Dominic Raab has been knocked out of the Tory leadership race in the latest ballot of MPs, leaving five candidates in the battle to be the next PM. Boris Johnson once again came top of the ballot, with 126 votes - 12 more than in the first round. Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart also got enough votes to make it into the next round. Mr Raab was eliminated after coming last with 30 votes, three fewer than the minimum needed to progress. The former Brexit secretary had called for the UK to leave the EU without a deal on 31 October if necessary. He also caused controversy by refusing to rule out suspending Parliament to thwart attempts by MPs to block a no-deal Brexit. Tory leadership: Who will be the next prime minister? Tory debate clash over Brexit deadline The next ballot will take place on Wednesday, with the candidate with the lowest number of votes eliminated. On leaving the contest, Mr Raab wished the remaining candidates good luck in the forthcoming BBC debate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Hunt again came second in the latest ballot of 313 Tory MPs, with 46 votes - three more than in last week's first vote. Mr Gove and Mr Javid also increased their level of support - by four and 10 votes to 41 and 33 votes respectively. But it was Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, who made the biggest stride forward, nearly doubling his backing from 19 to 37 votes. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was likely that most of Mr Raab's supporters would transfer their votes to Mr Johnson, but, she said, ""there will certainly be a scrap for them."" And she pointed out how close the result was for the other candidates, adding: ""In tomorrow's vote a couple of moves here and there could make all the difference."" Tory MP Gillian Keegan said Mr Stewart was appealing to his colleagues because of his ""realistic plan"" for Brexit and his progress showed there was a ""market for honest politicians"". ""I think Rory is extraordinary. He has star quality you don't often see in politics."" Johnny Mercer, a supporter of Mr Johnson, said he was pleased by his performance but conceded the contest ""was not done yet"". Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who is backing Mr Hunt for the top job, said he remained in a ""strong"" second place. She told the BBC the foreign secretary remained ""a serious candidate for a serious job"". The BBC's Nicholas Watt said he had been told by a source close to Mr Javid that he would not be dropping out of the race even though he secured the lowest number of votes. Simon Hoare, one of Mr Javid's backers, said he was ""delighted"" the home secretary had made it through to the next stage. He said ""barring emergencies"" Mr Johnson would make it into the final two candidates and appealed to Tory MPs to think ""tactically"" about who should join him. Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Guy Opperman, who is backing Michael Gove, said a frontrunner ""had never won"" a Tory leadership contest and he believed MPs would ultimately ""coalesce"" around an alternative to Mr Johnson. He said Mr Gove had ""clawed his way"" back into the contest after days of negative newspaper headlines at the start of the campaign following his admission he had taken cocaine while working as a journalist in the late 1990s. As ""a committed Brexiteer"", he said he expected Mr Gove would pick up the overwhelming share of Mr Raab's 30 supporters in the next round. The remaining candidates will face up to three further ballots later this week, where the lowest-ranked MP will be knocked out until only two are left. The final two names will then be put to a postal vote of the 160,000 Tory party members, beginning on 22 June, with the winner expected to be announced about four weeks later.

Berlin backs rent freeze amid housing pressureRents have soared in the German capital - and now politicians are moving to keep flats affordable.,"A fair rent march in Berlin: The top banner reads ""My home is not your profit"" Berlin's left-wing government has approved a plan to freeze rents in the German capital for the next five years. Rents have risen sharply in the city and there have been rallies urging the authorities to keep housing affordable. The plan is expected to become law in January. It could apply to 1.4 million properties, but not to social housing - regulated separately - or new builds. The average monthly rent for a furnished Berlin flat is about â¬1,100 (Â£983; $1,232). Aninternational comparison website, housinganywhere.com, reports,externalthat several major European cities are more expensive than Berlin for apartment rents, including Barcelona, Rotterdam and Milan. Berlin rents however rose by 7% in the first quarter of this year, and in the past decade rents have doubled as the booming city has become a magnet for jobseekers. The most expensive for rents in Europe is London:the Evening Standard reports,externalthat a typical two-bedroom flat in Southwark, near central London, costs Â£1,573 (â¬1,760; $1,970) a month. This video can not be played Berlin vs London: Which city is better for renters? The Berlin draft law, approved by the city's Senate, is being keenly watched across Germany, as there have been many complaints about housing costs elsewhere too, for example in Hamburg. The Berlin regional parliament still has to vote on it. The left-wing Social Democrats (SPD), in power in Berlin, favour a national rent cap, but critics point out that the housing market varies considerably from one region to the next. Central Berlin has undergone major redevelopment in recent years BBC Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill writes: The flyers appeared overnight on lampposts in my neighbourhood. A picture of a young couple who explained that they were flat-hunting and, as professional photographers, would offer a free photoshoot to any landlord who'd take them on. It's not an unusual phenomenon. One woman recently offered to bake regularly for anyone who'd rent her their flat. Berlin can't build affordable accommodation fast enough for the city's rising population. An open showing of a newly available flat is likely to attract well over 100 hopeful, would-be tenants. Demand is pushing up rents as corporate investors buy up and renovate old or dilapidated buildings, and it's pricing Berliners out of their old neighbourhoods. Demand and rents are rising in many other German cities too. Berlin is, by comparison with somewhere like Munich, still relatively cheap but, even as the Berlin authorities ponder their response, Chancellor Angela Merkel has promised to take action over what is an increasingly sensitive subject for the electorate. Chancellor Merkel, of the Christian Democrats (CDU), agrees with the SPD - her coalition partner - that the squeeze on affordable housing is a problem. But she argues that the best solution is to build new homes. Under the Berlin plan, the rent cap - likely to become law in January - would be backdated to 18 June, to prevent landlords from pushing up rents sharply over the next six months.

Some argue that such a freeze would reduce housing improvements by landlords, including investments in better insulation and other green economy measures. Some critics argue that there would be many exemptions, undermining the law's effectiveness. For example, rents for new builds could go up sharply as they would not be covered by the cap. German property firms justify the cost of new apartments by arguing that construction costs have risen 33% in Germany since 2005, compared with just 6% in the Netherlands, ARD reports.

The stark photo highlighting Greenlandâs ice lossA climate scientist has captured the reality of sea ice loss in Greenland in a viral picture.,"Climate scientist Steffen Olsen took this picture while travelling across melted sea ice in north-west Greenland With their sled in tow, a pack of dogs trudge towards a distant mountain range in north-west Greenland. The stunning picture may seem typical enough of the Danish territory. What's beneath their feet - a shallow pool of crystal-blue water - is anything but. Last week, however, temperatures soared well above normal levels in Greenland, causing about half of its ice sheet surface to experience melting. And the sea ice around the territory is, of course, also feeling this heat. Steffen Olsen, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), took the photo on 13 June as these warming conditions reached their peak. 'Cryoegg' to explore under Greenland Ice Sheet Greenland map captures changing Arctic Rain melting Greenland ice sheet 'even in winter' Mr Olsen and his team were retrieving equipment from a weather station in the Inglefield Fjord area. As they walked across the 1.2m (4ft) thick sea ice, water pooled on the surface. On Twitter, his colleague at DMI Rasmus Tonboe later shared the image, telling followers ""rapid melt"" had occurred. Because the sea ice is compact with almost no cracks, the image gives the impression the dogs are walking on water, Martin Stendel, senior researcher at the institute, told the BBC.

On that day, Greenland is estimated to have lost the equivalent of 2bn tonnes of ice. Temperatures, according to the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting, were around 22C above normal the day before. In the village of Qaanaaq, a high of 17.3C was recorded. Since then, Mr Olsen's photo has been shared widely on social media, provoking concern at the extent of the melting event and its causes. Greenland's ice sheet melts annually, with the season usually lasting from June to August. The summer months - typically in July - are when it reaches its height. This year, however, climate experts say it is early. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It's very unusual to have this much melt so early in the season,"" William Colgan, senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told the BBC. ""It takes very rare conditions but they're becoming increasingly common."" Mr Colgan compared the melt to 2012, when record-breaking ice sheet loss was recorded in Greenland. He said the same two factors were thought to have caused last week's ice melt and the historic event of 2012. One is high pressure lodged over Greenland, creating warm and sunny conditions. The other is low cloud cover and snowfall, meaning solar radiation can strike the ice sheet surface. Global warming, Mr Colgan said, was ""tremendously important"" to these sorts of events. This video can not be played Watch: Huge iceberg breaks apart near a village in western Greenland A small fishing boat heads out into the sea ice near the town of Uummannaq in western Greenland ""What climate change is doing is increasingly loading the dice to set up weather conditions that can tip the ice sheets into these mass loss events,"" he said. If these trends continued, said Professor Edward Hanna, a climate scientist at the University of Lincoln, Greenland could experience a record melt this year. ""The thing is, with climate trends, as we've seen over the past 20 years, as it gets warmer and warmer over Greenland, you don't need that much of an exceptional event to melt the whole surface of the ice,"" he told the BBC. The consequences, he said, would not only be felt locally but globally, too. Temperatures were around 22C above normal in Greenland last week, data shows As sea ice disappears, local communities who rely on it for transport, hunting and fishing are expected to suffer. On a global level, Prof Hanna said ""sea level rise is the big one"". ""You're losing something like 250 billion tonnes of ice a year on average. A huge mass is being transferred from the land into the oceans,"" he said. Mr Colgan said we should be mindful that the melt on 13 June was just ""a one-day event that is surprising in its magnitude and its early onset"". As studies showed, he said, global warming could mean more extreme melting events were yet to come. ""We can expect to see more of these in the future,"" he said.

Rehabilitation order sees 400 spared jail,"The scheme involves unpaid work as well as psychological assessment and treatment More than 400 people whose crimes would normally attract a jail term of up to a year have instead served their sentences outside prison. The scheme, known as an enhanced combination order, has been running in three court districts since 2015. The rehabilitation order has led to a 20% reduction in the number of short-term jail sentences in those areas. The order, which lasts between 12 months to three years, involves unpaid work in the community. It also involves intensive probation, restorative intervention, psychological assessment and treatment. James was given the option of avoiding prison by participating in the programme after he admitted to a public order offence while drunk and high on drugs. The scheme allows people who would previously have spent time behind bars seek rehabilitation James, which is not his real name due to concerns for his safety if he is identified, said the programme forced him to address his offending behaviour. ""I got to write a letter of apology to the police, and I got to hand it in and apologise, person to person, and we got to shake hands and just say: 'I'm sorry for that act of stupidness.' ""I think if I got sent to prison I would have had an aspect of what prison life was like. You see people going in and out of prison all the time so I think it would have been, 'oh right, I know what prison is like now' and probably go on to reoffend. ""But this order really helped me understand that drink ain't the answer, drugs ain't the answer and I'm so glad I never got sent to prison."" The order has been successfully completed by 404 offenders in three courts areas since 2015 - Armagh and south Down, Ards and the north west. Judge Eamonn King would like to see the scheme extended District Judge Eamonn King, along with other members of the judiciary, would like to see it extended across Northern Ireland but that could depend on an executive being in place at Stormont. ""If it's an economic argument, the cost of keeping someone in jail is a number of times the cost of trying to keep someone in the community and rehabilitated within the community,"" he said. ""They are part of the community and if we give them the support to overcome their problems, then we're giving them back their dignity."" Stephen Hamilton of the Probation Board said the scheme has the potential to save millions of pounds The Probation Board for NI said one evaluation of the scheme found there would be a saving of up to Â£8.3m per year to the public purse if the orders were rolled out throughout Northern Ireland. ""That is not an insignificant amount of money, it requires resourcing but, nevertheless, we believe there will be fewer victims and communities will be safer,"" said Stephen Hamilton, assistant director of the Probation Board. Paul Millar from Barnardo's said the charity has worked with 76 people who have been sentenced to an enhanced combination order providing support and training to the offenders and their families. ""It can be around actually increasing parents' knowledge of parenting,"" he said. ""So increasing their parenting skills, looking at the impact of offending, their behaviour on family and family life because we know from research that for children who have a parent who offends there is a higher risk of them actually being involved in the criminal justice system,"" he said. The Department of Justice said it was working to enable access to the orders as a sentencing option across Northern Ireland following full evaluation of the initial pilot.

Platini questioned over Qatar World Cup,"Michel Platini leaves a police station in Nanterre where he was questioned Former Uefa president Michel Platini has been released by French anti-corruption investigators after being questioned over the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. Platini, 63, was head of European football's governing body until being banned in 2015 for ethics breaches. The former France midfielder and three-time Ballon d'Or winner has always denied any wrongdoing. Qatar beat bids from USA, Australia, South Korea and Japan in 2010. Platini was taken into custody and questioned in Nanterre, a suburb in western Paris, on Tuesday. He was released from custody later that night. ""It was long but considering the number of questions, it could only be long, since I was asked about Euro 2016, the World Cup in Russia, the World Cup in Qatar, Fifa,"" said Platini. Officials have been investigating alleged corruption connected to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups for the past two years and were reported to have interviewed Sepp Blatter, the former president of world governing body Fifa, in 2017. In a statement, Platini's lawyers reiterated he had not been arrested and had ""expressed himself serenely and precisely, answering all the questions, including those on the conditions for the awarding of Euro 2016, and has provided useful explanations"". They added: ""He has nothing to do with this event which doesn't concern him at all. He is absolutely confident about what's next."" Fifa said it was aware of Platini's questioning, but added it was ""not in a position to comment further"". Platini was bannedover a 2m Swiss francs (Â£1.3m) ""disloyal payment"" from Blatter, who was also banned from football for his part in the matter. Blatter has also always denied any wrongdoing. Platini's eight-year ban was later reduced to four on appeal and will expire in October 2019. Qatar's bid team has been previously accused of corruption, but was cleared following a two-year Fifa inquiry. However, former Football Association chairman Greg Dyke told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the decision to award Qatar the 2022 World Cup was a ""bizarre"" one. ""I think anyone who was involved in that decision has to be questioned because it was such a bizarre decision,"" he said. ""It was against the advice of their own technical committee, who said they didn't think it would be safe - and as we now know they have had to move it to the winter to make it safe. And Qatar didn't meet all sorts of criteria, so it was always a very odd decision. ""I like Michel Platini. I thought he was a good leader for Uefa and he was a very likeable, charismatic man. ""In some ways it's sad that this is being dragged up again but if you look at the wider picture of why was that World Cup awarded to Qatar, there are still so many questions to be answered."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan This is the result of two years of work by French investigators from the country's serious financial crime unit, who - just like their counterparts in the US and Switzerland - have been looking into allegations of corruption connected to Fifa's shock decision to award Qatar the World Cup in 2022. Given that Blatter has been interviewed as part of the same case, it is no surprise that Platini is also now facing questions. It is understood these will focus on a lunch Platini attended in Paris just days before that hugely controversial vote in 2010, with the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy at his official residence and the Qatari head of state. It has long been suspected that the prospect of important bilateral trade deals between the two nations, and the subsequent Qatari takeover of Paris St-Germain may have been used as leverage to get Sarkozy's support. Platini has always denied that was why he changed his mind to vote for Qatar (rather than the US). Given how much time has now passed since the 2010 vote, and how much has changed at Fifa, there seems no real prospect that this latest development could affect Qatar's status as hosts, even if Platini is charged. Fifa's own 2014 internal investigation effectively cleared Qatar of corruption, and stripping it of the event at this stage could leave it open to legal action. But yet again it does serve as a reminder of the scandal and suspicion that surrounds the saga of how Qatar won the right to stage the event. Back in 2015, when still one of the sport's most powerful figures, Platini told me he had ""no regrets"" about voting for Qatar, despite the allegations of corruption and human rights abuses directed against the country, and the havoc a winter tournament would play with the European game he represented at the time. He may feel differently now.

US boosts Middle East troops amid Iran tensions,"The US released new images on Monday it says provide more evidence Iran was behind recent Gulf of Oman attacks The US military will send an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East as tensions build with Iran. Acting Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan said the deployment was in response to ""hostile behaviour"" by Iranian forces. The US Navy also shared new images it says link Iran to attacks last week on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Washington has accused Iran of blowing holes in the vessels with mines. Iran has denied the allegations. Tensions were further fuelled on Monday whenIran said its stockpile of low-enriched uranium would next week exceed levels set under the 2015 nuclear agreement. This video can not be played Mike Pompeo: US pressure on Iran has been ""very effective"" It recently stepped up production in response to the US tightening sanctions. The 2015 deal, from which the US has withdrawn, curbed Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said his country did not seek to wage war with any nation and had remained ""loyal"" to its international obligations. What we know about the tanker attacks Why would Iran attack tankers? Iran, the US and the Gulf: What now? Overnight three rockets hit a military base housing US troops north of Baghdad, the Iraqi military said.The US said it was ""indirect fire"",externaland did not cause injuries. No group said it had carried out the attack, though it followed US warnings of an increased threat to US interests in Iraq by Iranian-backed militias. Announcing the deployment, Mr Shanahan said the US did ""not seek conflict with Iran"" but the action had been taken to ""ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region to protect our national interests"". He said the military would continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments to troop levels accordingly. This video can not be played Security correspondent Frank Gardner looks at the evidence which the US says proves Iran's involvement in Thursday's attacks The 1,000 additional troops being despatched to the Middle East is presented as a prudent defensive measure by the Pentagon; the recent attacks on the two oil tankers being taken as a clear sign of Iran's hostile intent. They join some 1,500 additional troops sent last month. Taken together, these deployments inevitably raise tensions but they are clearly not in any sense an assault force. If direct conflict does break out between Washington and Tehran, it will most likely be a sporadic air and maritime battle, not a land campaign. But what worries Washington is attacks by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or Iran's proxies against US troops or facilities in the wider region - hence this latest deployment. The US defence secretary is again insisting that Washington does not want conflict with Tehran, but tensions remain high and any miscalculation could lead to a serious escalation. Shortly before the announcement, the Pentagon released new images including some purporting to show the remnants of an unexploded mine on the Japanese-owned oil tanker damaged in the attacks. The photos appear to show it being removed by members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Pentagon has already released grainy video said to show the same episode. Also seen in the latest images is apparent damage - a hole - above the waterline on the hull of the Kokuka Courageous. Your questions answered on tanker attacks US-Iran tensions explained Another image is said to show the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps vessel shortly after it was involved in removing the limpet mine. The other tanker damaged in the attacks was the Norwegian-owned Front Altair. The US has implicated Iran in the latest attacks and four others outside the Strait of Hormuz in May, allegations denied by Iran. China urged the US to lower the pressure and for Iran to stick to the nuclear deal, warning of a ""Pandora's box"" in the region. Russia - another party to the nuclear accord - also called for restraint, calling US actions ""truly provocative"". Saudi Arabia also blames Iran for the attacks on the two oil tankers, while the UK said it was ""almost certain"" Iran was behind the blasts. But EU foreign ministers meeting on Monday warned against jumping to conclusions and backed UN calls for an independent investigation. In 2015, Iran agreed to a landmark deal with world powers to curb its nuclear development. It agreed to limit the enrichment of uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, and other measures in return for relief from sanctions. Mr Trump abandoned the nuclear accord last year and started to re-impose sanctions. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words The key details of the Iran nuclear deal The move has crippled Iran's economy, which relies on oil, and Iran has responded by scaling back its nuclear commitments. This video can not be played Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi says the enriched uranium limit will be breached on 27 June. Speaking on Iranian TV, President Rouhani said the international community could see that it was the US, not Iran, that was acting badly. ""Iran has been loyal to its signature,"" he said. ""Iran has been loyal to international agreements, and the one standing against us today [the US] is the one that has trampled all pacts, agreements and international accords."" Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation said earlier it was on course to exceed agreed limits on its low-enriched uranium stockpiles by 27 June. But Iran said there was ""still time"" for European countries to act by protecting Iran from reinstated US sanctions. Why would Iran attack tankers in the Gulf of Oman?

BBC prepares to host Tory leadership debateQuestions from the public will be put to the candidates hoping to become the next UK prime minister.,"This video can not be played Tory leader debate: 5 candidates, 5 things Tory leadership rivals have clashed in a live BBC TV debate on whether the UK can leave the EU, no matter what, by the 31 October deadline. Asked for a guarantee he would do this, Boris Johnson described the deadline as ""eminently feasible"". Sajid Javid said it ""focused minds"", but Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt said extra time might be needed. Rory Stewart accused his colleagues of lacking realism - of ""staring at the wall and saying 'believe in Britain'"". The five men vying to be Conservative Party leader - and the UK's next prime minister - were taking part in a live debate on BBC One on Tuesday night. Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was earliereliminated in the second round of voting,when Conservative MPs held a secret ballot. The third round of voting will take place later, between 15:00 and 17:00 BST. The result is expected at 18:00 BST and the MP with the lowest number of votes will be out of the race. Who will give up to stop Johnson? Five key moments from Tory leadership debate Fact-checking the Tory leadership candidates' claims During Tuesday's hour-long debate, all five men ruled out calling a general election until Brexit was resolved. But the encounter exposed divisions in their approaches to Brexit and whether they could accept the UK leaving the EU without an agreement. This video can not be played The first question to the five standing for who could be the Tory leader and PM was about a Brexit date guarantee. The candidates, who faced questions from members of the public on issues ranging from climate change to Islamophobia, also disagreed over whether to prioritise tax cuts or increased spending on public services after the UK leaves the EU. Mr Johnson, the frontrunner in the contest, was taking part in his first debate of the campaign after he skipped Sunday's Channel 4 encounter. Rory Stewart, reflecting on the debate on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said he had found it a ""frustrating"" format and wished he had pressed Mr Johnson further to explain how he would get a no-deal Brexit through without the consent of Parliament. Looking ahead to the vote later, he said he had received a ""couple of positive responses"" to appeals for support from MPs who had previously given their backing to Dominic Raab. Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who has switched his support from Mr Raab to Mr Johnson, said he ""certainly believed"" the UK would leave the EU by 31 October under Mr Johnson. Pressed on why Mr Johnson did not ""guarantee"" that on live TV, Mr Zahawi said: ""If the other side don't believe you will leave on 31 October on WTO terms then they will not come forward with a deal."" He added that EU negotiators would take Mr Johnson ""very seriously because they know he will prepare the country"". Jeremy Hunt said the EU needed to be able to trust the person they negotiate with. ""I believe they would trust Jeremy Hunt, they would sit around the table, they would listen,"" he told the Today programme. Asked if he was missing the charisma needed to win the leadership race, he said he had been underestimated all his life - in politics and in setting up his own successful business - and planned to surprise people. The former foreign secretary said the British people were ""fed up"" with the current deadlock over Brexit and the Tories would pay a ""really serious price"" if this continued. He warned of a ""catastrophic loss of confidence in politics"" if the latest Brexit deadline was not met. Asked if he could guarantee this, he replied that ""October 31 is eminently feasible"". ""If we allow 31 October to come and go as we let March come and go, I think the public would look on us with increasing mystification,"" Mr Johnson said. He also suggested there was no issue with continuing free trade after Brexit - citing something called Article 24 of GATT - butas BBC Reality Check points out,that relies on the UK and EU both signing up and in the event of no deal, that will not happen. Mr Javid, who came fifth in Tuesday's second round of voting, said a deadline was needed to ""focus minds"" in both the EU and the UK. ""We have to learn from our mistakes,"" he said. ""One of the mistakes we have made is having a flexible deadline."" This video can not be played The five Conservative leadership contenders were asked about resolving the Irish border issue He suggested the route to getting a Brexit deal through Parliament was by re-presenting Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement but without the controversial Irish backstop. Mr Gove said an ""arbitrary"" deadline was counter-productive and if he was prime minister he would be prepared to delay Brexit by a matter of days to finalise a deal. ""You sometimes have extra time in football matches in order to slot home the winner."" Mr Hunt said he would back a no-deal exit as a ""last resort"" but if the UK was close to finalising a deal with the EU he would extend the talks to prevent the disruption a no-deal exit would cause to business. As it happened: Tory leadership debate Compare the candidates left in the race Viewers' verdict on Tory leadership debate Both Mr Hunt and Mr Javid suggested new technology could potentially solve the intractable Irish border issue, butthe EU has said there is currently none in use anywherein the world that can keep it as open after Brexit as it is now. Mr Stewart said he would not allow a ""damaging and unnecessary"" no-deal exit and his rivals could not explain how they could possibly do this ""against the consent of Parliament"". He suggested he was seeking the most realistic ""door"" out of the EU while ""everyone else was staring at the wall and saying believe in Britain"". EU politicians across the continent were dipping in and out of the debate. The comments I've heard so far off-the-record have not been particularly complimentary. The EU simply thinks that most of those leadership candidates are not being realistic. EU leaders are preparing a united, determined front when it comes to the idea of renegotiating the Brexit deal, and the answer is no. Even if, come the autumn, the EU were to be tempted to reopen some of those questions such as the Irish backstop, those conversations could never be finished by 31 October - the date by which most of those leadership candidates want to leave the EU. That's why this evening the EU thinks the idea of a no-deal Brexit is becoming increasingly likely. Moving beyond Brexit, the candidates clashed over their economic plans and whether to prioritise higher spending on public services or tax cuts. There were sharp exchanges between Mr Stewart and other contenders, Michael Gove accusing him of having ""no plan"" for how to run the economy or public services. ""Bringing people together is not enough,"" he told Mr Stewart, who has emerged as the surprise contender in the race. However, after the debate Mr Stewart admitted his performance had been lacklustre, adding he did not think the ""strange"" format worked for him. Mr Gove also took aim at Mr Johnson's plans to give a tax cut to those earning more than Â£50,000 a year, saying the focus should be on ""helping the poorest in society"". Helping middle-earners was ""sensible"", Mr Johnson responded. Mr Stewart said promising tax cuts was ""wrong"" given the uncertainty around Brexit. Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? He called for a ""revolution"" in care for the elderly, calling current provision a ""disgrace"". Mr Hunt, who was health secretary for six years, also called for increased investment, suggesting cuts to care budgets under the current government had gone ""too far"". Mr Johnson reiterated that it was his ""ambition"" to cut taxes for higher earners, but as political correspondent Chris Mason pointed out, that seemed less committal than a ""promise"" to do it. Plenty expected lots of ganging up on Boris Johnson tonight from his rivals. But what was striking - after the Stewart surge in votes between rounds one and two in Parliament - is there was at least as much, if not more, ganging up on Rory Stewart. Why? Look at the numbers. There were just 13 votes separating Jeremy Hunt, who finished second, and Sajid Javid, who finished fifth in the leadership ballot. In other words, all of them, other than Boris Johnson, are potentially vulnerable to relatively small shifts in votes. And Mr Stewart, in the build up to tonight, had the momentum. Meanwhile, speaking to Newsnight after the debate, Mr Gove said he believed he had won the debate because of what he said were his ""detailed answers"" and ""clear plan"" on Brexit. Of his rivals, he said there were ""some other great people"" but added: ""They will all be fantastic members of my team."" Amid claims that the Conservatives have failed to tackle Islamophobia in the party, the candidates were pressed by an imam to accept that ""words have consequences"". Mr Johnson said he apologised if anything he had written, during 20 to 30 years as a journalist, or had said during his political career had caused offence. But he defended his conduct as foreign secretary in relation to the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who remains in jail in Iran on spying charges. He suggested his claim in 2017 that the dual British-Iranian national was actually working as a journalist in the country - which the Iranian authorities cited as a reason to increase her sentence - ""did not make any difference"". ""If you point the finger at the UK, all you are doing is exculpating those who are truly responsible,"" he said. Mr Javid challenged the other candidates to agree to an external inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory Party - which they all appeared to do. Referring to Donald Trump's string of attacks on London's Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan, he said politicians should be ""brave enough"" to call out Islamophobia wherever it came from.

Facebook reveals digital currency details,"Using the Calibra payments system will be as easy as texting, Facebook says Social media giant Facebook has unveiled plans to launch a new digital currency, called Libra, next year. It said people would be able to make payments with the currency via its own apps, as well as on messaging service WhatsApp. Firms such as Uber and Visa are also likely to accept it in future, it said. But there have been concerns about how people's money and data will be protected, as well as over the potential volatility of the currency. Facebook said Libra would be independently-managed and backed by real assets, and that paying with it would be as easy as texting. It is the latest foray by a tech giant into the payments sector, after Google Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay - although none of those services are based on a crypto-currency. Facebook boss Mark Zuckerburg has been criticised for the firm's record on data protection According to Facebook, from next year you will be able to buy Libra via its platforms and store it in a digital wallet called Calibra. You can then send your Libra to other users, it said, ""as easily and instantly as you might send a text message"". ""In time, we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses, such as paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code, or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass."" It said transactions would be at ""low to no cost"", although the firm is expected to take a small commission on payments made through its platforms. It is a hugely ambitious - some might say megalomaniacal - project to create a new global currency. But the message is that this is not some little side project that a small team at the firm's Menlo Park headquarters will try out for a few months before moving on to something else. This is both the future of Facebook and the future of money, an initiative which has seen an alliance of big players in payments such as Paypal and Visa, Silicon Valley players like Uber and Lyft and major venture capital firms. But there are still many questions about FaceCoin - or Libra as the firm wants us to call it. The principal one I keep coming back to is - why? Read more from Rory Facebook stressed Libra would be managed independently by a group of companies and charities - of which Facebook is just one - called the Libra Association. It said all the group's members were eventually likely to accept Libra, including: Payments firms such as Mastercard and PayPal Digital businesses including eBay, Spotify and Uber Telecoms firms such as Vodafone And charities such as the microfinance group Women's World Banking. Facebook also said it expected Libra would be bought and sold on currency markets in the future. Facebook said Libra was particularly aimed at the 1.7 billion adults worldwide who do not have a bank account. It said the issue of being ""unbanked"" disproportionately affected people in developing countries, and in particular women. Libra payments will also be available via Whatsapp However, while the social network says the currency will be global, apps and services that use Libra will need to be compliant with the regulatory regimes in the markets they operate. While the currency already has the green light to launch in the US, it is unclear what will happen in places such as India, which has recently clamped down on digital currencies. Reports in May suggested only about 12 markets would be ready for Libra by the time it has launched. Facebook has faced questions from US politicians,externalabout how the currency will work, what consumer protection will be offered and how data will be secured. Other virtual-currencies such as Bitcoin have seen huge fluctuations in value, and have also been used to launder money. Facebook meanwhile has been criticised for failing to protect its users' data in the past. The social network hopes to prevent wild swings in the value of the currency by pegging it to a basket of well-known currencies, including the pound, US dollar, Japanese yen and euro. Virtual currency Bitcoin has seen huge swings in value Facebook also said its Calibra payments system would have strong protection to keep money and personal information safe. It said Calibra would use the same verification and anti-fraud processes that banks and credit cards use, and would refund any money that was stolen. This is not the first time Facebook has dabbled in digital currencies. A decade ago, it created Facebook Credits, a virtual currency that enabled people to purchase items in apps on the social networking site. However, Facebook ended the project after less than two years when it failed to gain traction. The biggest test is likely to be whether people will trust the social networking giant enough to start changing their cash for Libra. To build trust in the system, Facebook has been engaging with governments, central banks and regulators, including officials from the US Treasury and the Bank of England.

Eating disorder failures 'destroying lives',"Lives are being lost and destroyed by the failure of the NHS in England to provide care for people with eating disorders, MPs and campaigners say. They say more than a million people have an eating disorder, but specialist help is often difficult to access. It leaves patients relying on GPs who lack the skills and training to help. The warnings have been made in two separate reports - by charity Beat and the cross-party Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. They acknowledged improvements had been made to children's services, but said adult care remained more problematic. Research by Beat showed some specialist services had waiting times of more than five months. Chief executive Andrew Radford said: ""This research should set alarm bells ringing. ""Eating disorders have among the highest mortality rates of any mental illness, yet people's chances of recovery are being subjected to a lottery, and lives are at risk."" Fears over Instagram eating disorder posts Why my bones are crumbling at 27 Hannah says there was no plan for her treatment when she was seriously ill Hannah, 30, from south London, developed bulimia in her early 20s. It got so bad that she had several suicide attempts. But her only treatment was one hour of group therapy a week - and she had to wait months before it started. ""It just wasn't enough,"" she said. ""I was so unwell I couldn't carry on. I couldn't see a way forward."" After being diagnosed with depression and bulimia, the treatment was still inadequate, Hannah said. ""It wasn't done in a meaningful way - there was no care plan."" She finally got the help she needed from a charity, but over the following three to four years she developed anorexia. This time, she went for private treatment because it was available more quickly. ""If I had accessed the right care back in my 20s, I might have been OK. ""The model is flawed. You are asking people to wait months for treatment when they are already sick walking through the door of their GP."" Estimates suggest more than one million people have an eating disorder, although campaigners believe the true figure could be even higher. Around three-quarters of them are female. There is a range of different conditions. Anorexia and bulimia - where bouts of over-eating are compensated by steps such as enforced vomiting or taking laxatives - account for around half of all cases. Many cases start during adolescence, but treatment can take years, so most patients need support during adulthood. Fewer than half of patients with anorexia and bulimia fully recover. Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. People with the condition have a five-fold increased risk of death which is linked to complications such as a weakened immune system and heart problems. GPs are often the first point of call for patients. But the committee warned they lack training, with some research suggesting doctors get little more than ""a couple of hours in medical school"". The committee was told that it resulted in doctors simply relying on body mass index (BMI) as an indicator of problems. It echoes the research carried out by Beat, with patients complaining they find it difficult to get help. GPs can refer on to specialist support provided by community mental health teams. This normally involves some form of talking therapy. But information provided under the Freedom of Information Act found a seven-fold variation in the numbers getting help across different services. Waiting times varied between two weeks and five-and-a-half months. And even when they are referred for help, significant numbers have to rely on the support of general community health teams because of a lack of specialist staff. While both reports looked at services in England, Beat said the rest of the UK had similar - if not worse - problems. The committee's report was a follow-up to a 2017 review by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman in 2017. It highlighted serious failings which contributed to the death of 19-year-old Averil Hart - who died after moving away from home to go to university - and two other young women. Averil Hart went to the University of East Anglia to study creative writing The committee said the findings of their review two years on showed there had been a lack of progress. But NHS England insisted it has been taking steps. The health service has been investing in services specifically for under-19s, with a new waiting time target due to come into force next year. It demands that 95% of those referred for help for an eating disorder should receive help within one week for urgent cases, and four weeks for non-urgent cases. Funding for mental health services generally is also being increased at a faster rate than the overall budget. Some Â£2.3bn of the extra Â£20bn available for the NHS in England by 2020, will go towards mental health. Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard, of the Royal College of GPs, said more resources were needed to help doctors support patients with eating disorders.

Is the United States heading for war with Iran?,"The US has deployed the aircraft carrier strike group to the Gulf There are two competing narratives. The first, which is favoured by US President Donald Trump's administration, is that Iran is up to no good. Preparations are said to have been seen for a potential attack on US targets, though few details have been revealed publicly. The US has moved reinforcements to the region; it is reducing its non-essential diplomatic personnel in Iraq; and it is reportedly dusting off war plans. The message to Tehran is clear: any attack on a US target from whatever source, be it Iran or one of its many proxies or allies in the region, will be met by a significant military response. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? The second narrative lays the blame for this crisis squarely at Washington's door. Iran - not surprisingly - holds to this view, but so too do many domestic critics of the Trump administration's approach. Indeed, to varying degrees many of Mr Trump's key European allies share some of these concerns. According to this narrative, the ""Iran hawks"" in the Trump administration - people like National Security Adviser John Bolton, or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - sense an opportunity. Their goal, this narrative argues, is regime change in Tehran. And if maximum economic pressure does not work then they believe, military action is not ruled out in the appropriate circumstances. Reinstated US sanctions have pushed Iran's economy towards a deep recession These two narratives reflect different interpretations of the reality and, as so often, they play up certain facts and ignore others to make their case. But perceptions here matter just as much as reality. Indeed, in many ways they produce the reality. And that reality is that a conflict between the US and Iran - albeit by accident rather than design - is more likely today than at any time since Mr Trump took office. Tensions in the Middle East are certainly mounting. Iran, its economy suffering from the re-imposition of US sanctions that were lifted under a 2015 nuclear accord with world powers, is pushing back. It has warned that it may no longer abide by the restrictions on its nuclear activities. Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, has said it does not want to pull out of the nuclear deal The arrival of Mr Trump was a turning point. The president pulled the US out of the nuclear deal a year ago and embarked upon a policy of maximum pressure against Tehran. Iran has had enough. It is pushing the Europeans to do more to help its ailing economy and threatening if they do not - and it is hard to see what they can do - it will go ahead and breach the nuclear deal. That would only give the Trump administration additional ammunition. John Bolton, the US national security adviser, has long pushed for regime change in Iran Much now depends upon the dynamics inside the Trump administration and also on Tehran's assessment of what is going on there. The president himself has sought to play down the idea that his officials are divided regarding Iran, and reports indicate that he has little enthusiasm for war. His opposition to military entanglements abroad is well-known. However Mr Trump is unlikely to back down if US forces or facilities are attacked. However this is not necessarily the way things may be seen in Tehran. Might Iran think that it can play off Mr Bolton against his boss; raising tensions enough for the national security adviser's perceived designs to be revealed perhaps precipitating his downfall? If that is Tehran's assessment, then it is a high-risk strategy. Spain withdrew a frigate from the US carrier strike group amid differences over Iran While Washington's key Middle Eastern allies - Israel and Saudi Arabia - may be applauding from the sidelines, Mr Trump's European partners are uneasy at the way things are heading. Spain, Germany and the Netherlands have all taken steps to suspend military activities in the region alongside the Americans, citing the rising tensions. This is not the moment to rehearse what a conflict between Iran and the US would look like. But comparisons between such a conflict and the 2003 Iraq war are unhelpful. Iran is a very different proposition to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. A full-scale invasion of Iran is not going to be on the cards. Rather, this would be an air and maritime conflict with a huge dose of asymmetry in Iran's responses. It could set the whole region ablaze. US-led forces invaded Iraq in 2003 and overthrew Saddam Hussein's regime There were those who predicted a major foreign policy catastrophe when Mr Trump took office. Instead, there is an unfolding and multi-dimensional crisis that has many elements and the Iran situation illustrates them all: an antipathy to international agreements; an over-reliance on regional allies with their own agendas to pursue; rising tensions with long-standing Nato partners; and, above all, an inability to determine and to prioritise Washington's real strategic interests. With the revival of great power competition, when the US is seeking to re-orientate its deployments and to bolster its armed forces to face a rising China and an emboldened Russia, where should Iran rate in Washington's strategic priorities? The US sees the thousands of Iran-backed Shia Muslim paramilitary fighters in Iraq as a threat Does the Iran threat really merit a major conflict? Many US strategic pundits would say no. Many accept that containing Tehran and, yes, threatening severe reprisals if US interests are attacked, may be necessary. But the steady drumbeat towards war is not. And one thing should be clear. There is no ""drift"" towards war. That suggests an involuntary process that people can do little about. If there is a conflict then it will be down to conscious decision-making, to the calculations and miscalculations of the Iranians and the Americans themselves.

BBC prepares to host Tory leadership debateQuestions from the public will be put to the candidates hoping to become the next UK prime minister.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Tory leader debate: 5 candidates, 5 things Tory leadership rivals have clashed in a live BBC TV debate on whether the UK can leave the EU, no matter what, by the 31 October deadline. Asked for a guarantee he would do this, Boris Johnson described the deadline as ""eminently feasible"". Sajid Javid said it ""focused minds"", but Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt said extra time might be needed. Rory Stewart accused his colleagues of lacking realism - of ""staring at the wall and saying 'believe in Britain'"". The five men vying to be Conservative Party leader - and the UK's next prime minister - were taking part in a live debate on BBC One on Tuesday night. Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was earliereliminated in the second round of voting,when Conservative MPs held a secret ballot. The third round of voting will take place later, between 15:00 and 17:00 BST. The result is expected at 18:00 BST and the MP with the lowest number of votes will be out of the race. Who will give up to stop Johnson? Five key moments from Tory leadership debate Fact-checking the Tory leadership candidates' claims During Tuesday's hour-long debate, all five men ruled out calling a general election until Brexit was resolved. But the encounter exposed divisions in their approaches to Brexit and whether they could accept the UK leaving the EU without an agreement. This video can not be played The first question to the five standing for who could be the Tory leader and PM was about a Brexit date guarantee. The candidates, who faced questions from members of the public on issues ranging from climate change to Islamophobia, also disagreed over whether to prioritise tax cuts or increased spending on public services after the UK leaves the EU. Mr Johnson, the frontrunner in the contest, was taking part in his first debate of the campaign after he skipped Sunday's Channel 4 encounter. Rory Stewart, reflecting on the debate on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said he had found it a ""frustrating"" format and wished he had pressed Mr Johnson further to explain how he would get a no-deal Brexit through without the consent of Parliament. Looking ahead to the vote later, he said he had received a ""couple of positive responses"" to appeals for support from MPs who had previously given their backing to Dominic Raab. Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who has switched his support from Mr Raab to Mr Johnson, said he ""certainly believed"" the UK would leave the EU by 31 October under Mr Johnson. Pressed on why Mr Johnson did not ""guarantee"" that on live TV, Mr Zahawi said: ""If the other side don't believe you will leave on 31 October on WTO terms then they will not come forward with a deal."" He added that EU negotiators would take Mr Johnson ""very seriously because they know he will prepare the country"". Jeremy Hunt said the EU needed to be able to trust the person they negotiate with. ""I believe they would trust Jeremy Hunt, they would sit around the table, they would listen,"" he told the Today programme. Asked if he was missing the charisma needed to win the leadership race, he said he had been underestimated all his life - in politics and in setting up his own successful business - and planned to surprise people. The former foreign secretary said the British people were ""fed up"" with the current deadlock over Brexit and the Tories would pay a ""really serious price"" if this continued. He warned of a ""catastrophic loss of confidence in politics"" if the latest Brexit deadline was not met. Asked if he could guarantee this, he replied that ""October 31 is eminently feasible"". ""If we allow 31 October to come and go as we let March come and go, I think the public would look on us with increasing mystification,"" Mr Johnson said. He also suggested there was no issue with continuing free trade after Brexit - citing something called Article 24 of GATT - butas BBC Reality Check points out,that relies on the UK and EU both signing up and in the event of no deal, that will not happen. Mr Javid, who came fifth in Tuesday's second round of voting, said a deadline was needed to ""focus minds"" in both the EU and the UK. ""We have to learn from our mistakes,"" he said. ""One of the mistakes we have made is having a flexible deadline."" This video can not be played The five Conservative leadership contenders were asked about resolving the Irish border issue He suggested the route to getting a Brexit deal through Parliament was by re-presenting Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement but without the controversial Irish backstop. Mr Gove said an ""arbitrary"" deadline was counter-productive and if he was prime minister he would be prepared to delay Brexit by a matter of days to finalise a deal. ""You sometimes have extra time in football matches in order to slot home the winner."" Mr Hunt said he would back a no-deal exit as a ""last resort"" but if the UK was close to finalising a deal with the EU he would extend the talks to prevent the disruption a no-deal exit would cause to business. As it happened: Tory leadership debate Compare the candidates left in the race Viewers' verdict on Tory leadership debate Both Mr Hunt and Mr Javid suggested new technology could potentially solve the intractable Irish border issue, butthe EU has said there is currently none in use anywherein the world that can keep it as open after Brexit as it is now. Mr Stewart said he would not allow a ""damaging and unnecessary"" no-deal exit and his rivals could not explain how they could possibly do this ""against the consent of Parliament"". He suggested he was seeking the most realistic ""door"" out of the EU while ""everyone else was staring at the wall and saying believe in Britain"". EU politicians across the continent were dipping in and out of the debate. The comments I've heard so far off-the-record have not been particularly complimentary. The EU simply thinks that most of those leadership candidates are not being realistic. EU leaders are preparing a united, determined front when it comes to the idea of renegotiating the Brexit deal, and the answer is no. Even if, come the autumn, the EU were to be tempted to reopen some of those questions such as the Irish backstop, those conversations could never be finished by 31 October - the date by which most of those leadership candidates want to leave the EU. That's why this evening the EU thinks the idea of a no-deal Brexit is becoming increasingly likely. Moving beyond Brexit, the candidates clashed over their economic plans and whether to prioritise higher spending on public services or tax cuts. There were sharp exchanges between Mr Stewart and other contenders, Michael Gove accusing him of having ""no plan"" for how to run the economy or public services. ""Bringing people together is not enough,"" he told Mr Stewart, who has emerged as the surprise contender in the race. However, after the debate Mr Stewart admitted his performance had been lacklustre, adding he did not think the ""strange"" format worked for him. Mr Gove also took aim at Mr Johnson's plans to give a tax cut to those earning more than Â£50,000 a year, saying the focus should be on ""helping the poorest in society"". Helping middle-earners was ""sensible"", Mr Johnson responded. Mr Stewart said promising tax cuts was ""wrong"" given the uncertainty around Brexit. Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? He called for a ""revolution"" in care for the elderly, calling current provision a ""disgrace"". Mr Hunt, who was health secretary for six years, also called for increased investment, suggesting cuts to care budgets under the current government had gone ""too far"". Mr Johnson reiterated that it was his ""ambition"" to cut taxes for higher earners, but as political correspondent Chris Mason pointed out, that seemed less committal than a ""promise"" to do it. Plenty expected lots of ganging up on Boris Johnson tonight from his rivals. But what was striking - after the Stewart surge in votes between rounds one and two in Parliament - is there was at least as much, if not more, ganging up on Rory Stewart. Why? Look at the numbers. There were just 13 votes separating Jeremy Hunt, who finished second, and Sajid Javid, who finished fifth in the leadership ballot. In other words, all of them, other than Boris Johnson, are potentially vulnerable to relatively small shifts in votes. And Mr Stewart, in the build up to tonight, had the momentum. Meanwhile, speaking to Newsnight after the debate, Mr Gove said he believed he had won the debate because of what he said were his ""detailed answers"" and ""clear plan"" on Brexit. Of his rivals, he said there were ""some other great people"" but added: ""They will all be fantastic members of my team."" Amid claims that the Conservatives have failed to tackle Islamophobia in the party, the candidates were pressed by an imam to accept that ""words have consequences"". Mr Johnson said he apologised if anything he had written, during 20 to 30 years as a journalist, or had said during his political career had caused offence. But he defended his conduct as foreign secretary in relation to the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who remains in jail in Iran on spying charges. He suggested his claim in 2017 that the dual British-Iranian national was actually working as a journalist in the country - which the Iranian authorities cited as a reason to increase her sentence - ""did not make any difference"". ""If you point the finger at the UK, all you are doing is exculpating those who are truly responsible,"" he said. Mr Javid challenged the other candidates to agree to an external inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory Party - which they all appeared to do. Referring to Donald Trump's string of attacks on London's Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan, he said politicians should be ""brave enough"" to call out Islamophobia wherever it came from.

Facebook reveals digital currency detailsUsers will be able make payments with the currency via Facebook's apps and WhatsApp.Business,"Using the Calibra payments system will be as easy as texting, Facebook says Social media giant Facebook has unveiled plans to launch a new digital currency, called Libra, next year. It said people would be able to make payments with the currency via its own apps, as well as on messaging service WhatsApp. Firms such as Uber and Visa are also likely to accept it in future, it said. But there have been concerns about how people's money and data will be protected, as well as over the potential volatility of the currency. Facebook said Libra would be independently-managed and backed by real assets, and that paying with it would be as easy as texting. It is the latest foray by a tech giant into the payments sector, after Google Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay - although none of those services are based on a crypto-currency. Facebook boss Mark Zuckerburg has been criticised for the firm's record on data protection According to Facebook, from next year you will be able to buy Libra via its platforms and store it in a digital wallet called Calibra. You can then send your Libra to other users, it said, ""as easily and instantly as you might send a text message"". ""In time, we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses, such as paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code, or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass."" It said transactions would be at ""low to no cost"", although the firm is expected to take a small commission on payments made through its platforms. It is a hugely ambitious - some might say megalomaniacal - project to create a new global currency. But the message is that this is not some little side project that a small team at the firm's Menlo Park headquarters will try out for a few months before moving on to something else. This is both the future of Facebook and the future of money, an initiative which has seen an alliance of big players in payments such as Paypal and Visa, Silicon Valley players like Uber and Lyft and major venture capital firms. But there are still many questions about FaceCoin - or Libra as the firm wants us to call it. The principal one I keep coming back to is - why? Read more from Rory Facebook stressed Libra would be managed independently by a group of companies and charities - of which Facebook is just one - called the Libra Association. It said all the group's members were eventually likely to accept Libra, including: Payments firms such as Mastercard and PayPal Digital businesses including eBay, Spotify and Uber Telecoms firms such as Vodafone And charities such as the microfinance group Women's World Banking. Facebook also said it expected Libra would be bought and sold on currency markets in the future. Facebook said Libra was particularly aimed at the 1.7 billion adults worldwide who do not have a bank account. It said the issue of being ""unbanked"" disproportionately affected people in developing countries, and in particular women. Libra payments will also be available via Whatsapp However, while the social network says the currency will be global, apps and services that use Libra will need to be compliant with the regulatory regimes in the markets they operate. While the currency already has the green light to launch in the US, it is unclear what will happen in places such as India, which has recently clamped down on digital currencies. Reports in May suggested only about 12 markets would be ready for Libra by the time it has launched. Facebook has faced questions from US politicians,externalabout how the currency will work, what consumer protection will be offered and how data will be secured. Other virtual-currencies such as Bitcoin have seen huge fluctuations in value, and have also been used to launder money. Facebook meanwhile has been criticised for failing to protect its users' data in the past. The social network hopes to prevent wild swings in the value of the currency by pegging it to a basket of well-known currencies, including the pound, US dollar, Japanese yen and euro. Virtual currency Bitcoin has seen huge swings in value Facebook also said its Calibra payments system would have strong protection to keep money and personal information safe. It said Calibra would use the same verification and anti-fraud processes that banks and credit cards use, and would refund any money that was stolen. This is not the first time Facebook has dabbled in digital currencies. A decade ago, it created Facebook Credits, a virtual currency that enabled people to purchase items in apps on the social networking site. However, Facebook ended the project after less than two years when it failed to gain traction. The biggest test is likely to be whether people will trust the social networking giant enough to start changing their cash for Libra. To build trust in the system, Facebook has been engaging with governments, central banks and regulators, including officials from the US Treasury and the Bank of England.

Number of middle-aged 'money mules' rising,"Middle-aged people are increasingly being lured into becoming ""money mules"" and their bank accounts used to launder proceeds of crime, a report suggests. More than 40,000 cases which ""bore the hallmarks"" of money mule activity were reported to UK fraud prevention service Cifas last year, up 26% on 2017. The largest rise - 35% - was among those aged between 41 and 60. It is believed fraudsters target people without a criminal background, in the hope payments go unnoticed. ""Typically, money mules are recruited on social media sites and via messaging apps: they're offered payments if they allow their bank accounts to be used to transfer cash,"" said BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw. Many may not initially realise they are committing a crime. The dangerous world of teen 'money mules' What's the new weapon against money laundering gangsters? Most money mules are young men and those who try to quit may be threatened with violence by the criminals who roped them in. If they are caught they could face prison, as well as consequences for their ability to manage their finances, such as having their bank account closed and finding it difficult to apply for credit in the future. This video can not be played The dangerous world of teen ""money mules"" Holly would receive money into her bank account and then transfer it to another account or take it out in cash and give it to someone. In exchange she would get a cut of the money. But by becoming a money mule, what Holly was really doing was laundering the proceeds of crime. It's a serious offence, and if caught money mules could get a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison.

Platini 'detained over Qatar World Cup',"Michel Platini leaves a police station in Nanterre where he was questioned Former Uefa president Michel Platini has been released by French anti-corruption investigators after being questioned over the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. Platini, 63, was head of European football's governing body until being banned in 2015 for ethics breaches. The former France midfielder and three-time Ballon d'Or winner has always denied any wrongdoing. Qatar beat bids from USA, Australia, South Korea and Japan in 2010. Platini was taken into custody and questioned in Nanterre, a suburb in western Paris, on Tuesday. He was released from custody later that night. ""It was long but considering the number of questions, it could only be long, since I was asked about Euro 2016, the World Cup in Russia, the World Cup in Qatar, Fifa,"" said Platini. Officials have been investigating alleged corruption connected to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups for the past two years and were reported to have interviewed Sepp Blatter, the former president of world governing body Fifa, in 2017. In a statement, Platini's lawyers reiterated he had not been arrested and had ""expressed himself serenely and precisely, answering all the questions, including those on the conditions for the awarding of Euro 2016, and has provided useful explanations"". They added: ""He has nothing to do with this event which doesn't concern him at all. He is absolutely confident about what's next."" Fifa said it was aware of Platini's questioning, but added it was ""not in a position to comment further"". Platini was bannedover a 2m Swiss francs (Â£1.3m) ""disloyal payment"" from Blatter, who was also banned from football for his part in the matter. Blatter has also always denied any wrongdoing. Platini's eight-year ban was later reduced to four on appeal and will expire in October 2019. Qatar's bid team has been previously accused of corruption, but was cleared following a two-year Fifa inquiry. However, former Football Association chairman Greg Dyke told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the decision to award Qatar the 2022 World Cup was a ""bizarre"" one. ""I think anyone who was involved in that decision has to be questioned because it was such a bizarre decision,"" he said. ""It was against the advice of their own technical committee, who said they didn't think it would be safe - and as we now know they have had to move it to the winter to make it safe. And Qatar didn't meet all sorts of criteria, so it was always a very odd decision. ""I like Michel Platini. I thought he was a good leader for Uefa and he was a very likeable, charismatic man. ""In some ways it's sad that this is being dragged up again but if you look at the wider picture of why was that World Cup awarded to Qatar, there are still so many questions to be answered."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan This is the result of two years of work by French investigators from the country's serious financial crime unit, who - just like their counterparts in the US and Switzerland - have been looking into allegations of corruption connected to Fifa's shock decision to award Qatar the World Cup in 2022. Given that Blatter has been interviewed as part of the same case, it is no surprise that Platini is also now facing questions. It is understood these will focus on a lunch Platini attended in Paris just days before that hugely controversial vote in 2010, with the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy at his official residence and the Qatari head of state. It has long been suspected that the prospect of important bilateral trade deals between the two nations, and the subsequent Qatari takeover of Paris St-Germain may have been used as leverage to get Sarkozy's support. Platini has always denied that was why he changed his mind to vote for Qatar (rather than the US). Given how much time has now passed since the 2010 vote, and how much has changed at Fifa, there seems no real prospect that this latest development could affect Qatar's status as hosts, even if Platini is charged. Fifa's own 2014 internal investigation effectively cleared Qatar of corruption, and stripping it of the event at this stage could leave it open to legal action. But yet again it does serve as a reminder of the scandal and suspicion that surrounds the saga of how Qatar won the right to stage the event. Back in 2015, when still one of the sport's most powerful figures, Platini told me he had ""no regrets"" about voting for Qatar, despite the allegations of corruption and human rights abuses directed against the country, and the havoc a winter tournament would play with the European game he represented at the time. He may feel differently now.

Ministers 'reject fast fashion impact advice'An 18-point plan to end the era of throwaway clothes and improve working conditions is dismissed.Science & Environment,"A report by MPs has urged the UK government to end the era of throwaway clothes and poor working conditions in the fashion supply chain. The MPs' proposals are designed to force the fashion industry to clean up its act. They made 18 recommendations covering environmental and labour practices and want the government to act. Not only is the fashion industry a source of emissions, but old clothes pile up in landfill. Fibres also flow into the sea when clothes are washed, polluting the marine environment. A government spokesperson said it was dealing with the impacts of fast fashion - and many measures were already in place. Among the proposals from the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) were: A 1p charge per garment on producers to fund better recycling of clothes; Ban on incinerating or landfilling unsold stock that can be reused or recycled instead; Mandatory environmental targets for fashion retailers with a turnover above Â£36 million; Tax changes to reward reuse, repair and recycling - to support responsible fashion companies. The EAC's chair, Labour MP Mary Creagh, said: ""Fashion producers should be forced to clear up the mountains of waste they create. Small changes you can make for a greener life Fast fashion is harming the planet, MPs say Call for '1p a garment' fast fashion charge Can we make fashion greener? Forever 21 'steals' anti-fast-fashion art ""The government is content to tolerate practices that trash the environment and exploit workers despite having just committed to net zero emission targets. ""It is out of step with the public who are shocked by the fact that we are sending 300,000 tonnes of clothes a year to incineration or landfill."" But ministers cite the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (SCAP), a voluntary agreement co-ordinated by the waste watchdog WRAP. This sets targets for the industry to reduce carbon emissions, water and waste. The government also maintains it's better to find outlets for waste textiles rather than simply imposing a landfill ban. A government spokesperson said: ""It simply isn't true to say we are not accepting the committee's recommendations. ""In our landmark Resources and Waste Strategy we will take forward measures including developing proposals and consulting on extended producer responsibility (EPR) and higher product standards for textiles. ""This would make producers responsible for the full cost of managing and disposing of their products after they're no longer useful.""

Ministers say they're focusing on a tax on single-use plastic in packaging, rather than a tax on cheap fashion items. They point to Sweden's VAT reduction for repair services, which they say has made little impact. They say they will consider a levy on clothes alongside their plans for making firms in different sectors more responsible for their waste - but no decisions will be made on this until 2025.

'ÃÂ£3.8bn needed to reverse school cuts',"Heads say inadequate funding for schools is adding to the pressure on teachers A one-off increase of Â£3.8bn would be needed to reverse 8% cuts in per pupil school spending, new analysis shows. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says a further Â£1.1bn would be needed each year up until 2023 to maintain spending in real terms, once rising costs were taken into account. Candidates for the Conservative leadership have been making competing promises on education spending. The government says funding for schools has been at its highest level ever. School budgets have moved up the political agenda, partly as a result of campaigning by parents and head teachers across England. IFS analysis says since 2009, spending has fallen by 8% per pupil once rising costs such as pay and pension contributions are taken into account. Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap Head teachers warn of action over cash crisis Schools facing 'financial cliff edge' ""It's the largest reduction in education spending for at least 30 or 40 years or longer, so it's not surprising it has generated political pressure,"" says their economist Luke Sibieta. In a new analysis published on Tuesday, the IFS says to reverse that real terms fall for 5 to 16-year-olds would take a one-off increase of Â£3.8bn. That includes all spending in schools, including that by local authorities, and is more than any candidate has promised so far. Jules White, the Sussex head teacher who has led the WorthLess campaign said: ""There is immense frustration that this bidding war has begun, when the government has been in absolute denial about the financial constraints."" To keep up with rising pupil numbers, the IFS says Â£1.1bn a year would be needed to avoid future real terms cuts. A similar 8% increase for 16 to 19-year-olds would cost around Â£480m as a one-off uplift. Sixth form and further education colleges have faced the sharpest squeeze in budgets in recent years. Head teachers have staged protest marches in Westminster But with some Conservative leadership contenders also suggesting tax cuts, it's not clear where the money would be found. Mr Sibieta says making education a priority would deepen the squeeze elsewhere, unless the government increased borrowing. ""The NHS has received a very generous settlement in advance of the spending review, but over four years other government departments are being asked to reduce spending by Â£2.5bn in total"". There is also a subtle rebuke for Boris Johnson from the IFS, after he described variation in funding per pupil in different parts of England as a ""postcode lottery"". A new funding formula for schools is being gradually introduced, based a combination of measures of need in different local authorities. The IFS said: ""With the introduction of this formula, the government - which Mr Johnson was part of - effectively ended a long-standing postcode lottery in school funding in England."" However, many in the lowest funded areas, which include many conservative heartlands in the counties and shires, remain disappointed that the formula will not lead to substantial increases for all. The government has argued that school spending in England is at its highest level ever in cash terms. A statement from the Department for Education added: ""We know schools face budgeting challenges, which is why we have introduced a wide range of support to help schools reduce costs and get the best value from their resources."" ""The Secretary of State has made clear that as we approach the next spending review, he will back head teachers to have the resources they need to deliver a world class education in the years ahead.""

PSNI facing ÃÂ£40m holiday pay bill,"The Police Service of Northern Ireland is facing a Â£40m bill after losing a court challenge over holiday pay. Class action was brought by a group representing more than 3,700 police officers and civilian staff. The Court of Appeal in Belfast upheld a 2018 tribunal finding that they are owed money for a shortfall in holiday pay dating back 20 years. Miscalculations arose after holiday pay was based on basic pay and did not include overtime. The original tribunal made its decision in November 2018. At that stage, the bill was up to Â£30m. PSNI and Police Authority could face Â£30m holiday pay bill However, the figure could now be Â£40m after appeal court judges held that holiday pay should be calculated on the basis of actual annual working days. It is understood payments could be in the region of Â£10,000 on average per individual. BBC News NI's Home Affairs Correspondent Julian O'Neill said the PSNI had previously accepted ""3,700 personnel had been short changed"" after holiday pay was miscalculated in breach of European law. He said the appeal, brought by the PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton and the Police Authority, (now the Policing Board) had challenged the period of time settlements should cover. Our correspondent said the dismissal of the appeal meant ""what is owed must now be recalculated from as far back as 1998"". Chief Constable George Hamilton's appeal against a tribunal decision on holiday pay has been dismissed The appeal court judge said that the ""lead cases should now continue before the tribunal to a final determination"". PSNI Assistant Chief Constable George Clarke said the PSNI was now seeking further legal advice on the matter. ""This will include considering implications of the judgement and how the costs will be met,"" he said. The chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, Mark Lindsay, hailed the judgement as a ""major victory"". ""This more than justifies our decision to go to the Employment Tribunal as we believed there was something inherently unfair in the way officers were being denied what was rightfully their entitlement,"" he said. He added that the federation was now seeking ""a timely and final resolution"" but warned that it could take a long time due to the number of claims involved. Solicitor John McShane, who represents the officers and civilian workers, described the result as ""significant"". He said the claim was not for compensation but was ""a claim to actually get paid what they are properly entitled to be paid"". He said they would now begin negotiations with the chief constable to ""bring a financial conclusion to the matter"".
