Transgender cyclist will not take part in event,"Emily Bridges previously set a national junior men's record over 25 miles and was selected to join British Cycling's senior academy in 2019 Transgender cyclist Emily Bridges will not compete at Saturday's National Omnium Championships in her first women's event after a ruling by cycling's world governing body. The 21-year-old looked set to face some of the sport's biggest names, including five-time Olympic champion Laura Kenny. However, British Cycling said in a statement on Wednesday: ""We have now been informed by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) that under their current guidelines Emily is not eligible to participate in this event."" Transgender cyclist set to race in women's National Omnium event The UCI told British Cycling that because international ranking points are allocated at national championship events, Bridges' participation could only be allowed once her eligibility to race in international competitions is confirmed. That process is currently ongoing. Bridges began hormone therapy last year as part of her gender dysphoria treatment and has now become eligible to compete in women's events because of lowered levels of testosterone. In May 2021, she finished 43rd out of 45 riders in the elite men's criterium at the Loughborough Cycling Festival and in September she was second to last in the Welsh National Championship road race, a 12km lap behind the winner. Last month, Bridges won a men's points race at the British Universities Championships in Glasgow - her final men's race. British Cycling's transgender regulations require riders to have had testosterone levels below five nanomoles per litre for a 12-month period prior to competition. ""We have been in close discussions with the UCI regarding Emily's participation this weekend and have also engaged closely with Emily and her family regarding her transition and involvement in elite competitions,"" said British Cycling. ""We acknowledge the decision of the UCI with regards to Emily's participation, however we fully recognise her disappointment with today's decision. ""Transgender and non-binary inclusion is bigger than one race and one athlete - it is a challenge for all elite sports."" Earlier this month, US college transgender swimmer Lia Thomas won the 500-yard freestyle and finished fifth and eighth in other races at the NCAA Championships. Thomas was backed by an open letter from 300 swimmers, including rival Erica Sullivan - but her inclusion also faced opposition from another competitor, Hungary's Reka Gyorgy, as well as Florida governor Ron DeSantis. Asked about the issue, World Athletics president Lord Sebastian Coe claimed the ""integrity"" of women's sport was at stake and its future was ""fragile"". Coe also called on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to introduce regulations that can be applied across every sport and insisted ""gender cannot trump biology"". British Cycling has also called for a coalition across a number of sports - involving governing bodies, athletes, the transgender and non-binary athlete community and the government - to work together to ""find a better answer"". ""We also understand that, in elite sports, the concept of fairness is essential,"" it said. ""For this reason, British Cycling is today calling for a coalition to share, learn and understand more about how we can achieve fairness in a way that maintains the dignity and respect of all athletes."" Former Great Britain Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies, who has criticised British Cycling for initially allowing Bridges to take part in the women's race, said female cyclists had been ""thrown under the PC bus"" by the governing body. ""Time for true female athlete equality of opportunities in cycling,"" she tweeted. ""Find better ways of being inclusive (which we all want)."" Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, speaking in the House of Commons earlier on Wednesday, said the Government needed ""urgent conversations"" with British Cycling about their policy of transgender inclusion. However on Thursday Liz Ward, director of programmes at campaign group Stonewall, said Bridges ""hasn't been given a fair chance to compete in Saturday's race."" ""It is disappointing that UCI have overruled British Cycling's competition criteria, which Emily was in full compliance of,"" she said. ""British Cycling had already extensively consulted on their trans-inclusion policy which is fully in line with International Olympic Committee guidelines. Our thoughts are with Emily."" Shortly before British Cycling's announcement, UCI president David Lappartient told BBC Sport he was ""worried"" the inclusion of transgender athletes could affect the fairness of competition in cycling. In an interview earlier on Wednesday, Lappartient said the rules regarding permitted testosterone levels in transgender athletes is ""probably not enough"". But he added the governing body ""fully recognises the rights of transgender athletes to do sport"". ""We fully recognise the rights of people to change and to make that transition,"" said Lappartient, who was talking generally about the issue and did not directly address Bridges' case. This video can not be played We fully recognise the rights of transgender cyclists - UCI president ""I'm a little bit worried that [their participation in women's events] will affect the fairness of competition. I believe that maybe the situation we have now, of the rules of five nanomoles per litre [to measure testosterone levels], is probably not enough. ""When I speak with some professors in medicine, some specialists, they say, 'yes, your body probably has a memory already of what you are and so there is maybe some advantages'. ""But is there a memory from your body from what you were before - and do you have advantage for this? Is it a bridge of fair competition?"" When British Cycling updated its rules surrounding transgender athletes in January, it decided trans athletes needed to have their testosterone below five nanomoles per litre for a year to compete against other women. Men typically have between 10 and 30 nanomoles per litre depending on age and time of day. But a young healthy male's level of testosterone will range from 20 to 30, compared with a female's range of 0.7 to 2.8, according to the NHS. Again, speaking earlier on Wednesday, Lappartient told BBC Sport many female cyclists had registered their concern with the UCI over fairness of competition and ""do not accept"" the current controls.

MP comes out as trans and speaks of rape ordeal,"This video can not be played Watch: Johnson and Starmer pay tribute to trans MP Jamie Wallis Politicians have praised a Welsh MP for his bravery after he tweeted he has gender dysphoria and has been a victim of rape and blackmail. Jamie Wallis, who was elected in 2019, is the first MP to come out as trans. The Conservative MP for Bridgend said a man sent pictures to his family and demanded Â£50,000 in 2020. He said he was raped in a separate incident. Mr Wallis wrote that after he was raped ""things have taken a tumble. I am not ok."" The MP confirmed that he fled the scene of a car crash two months after he was raped. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the leader of the opposition Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged Mr Wallis' statement in the Commons. With Mr Wallis looking on from the backbenches, Mr Johnson said: ""the House stands with you and will give you the support you need to live freely as yourself"". Earlier, Tory MP Andrea Leadsom confirmed that Mr Johnson made a ""light-hearted joke"" on Tuesday night about Sir Keir Starmer's decision not to answer whether a woman can have a penis in a debate on trans rights. It was reported that Mr Johnson began a dinner among Tory MPs by saying: ""Good evening ladies and gentleman - or as Keir Starmer would put it, people who are assigned female or male at birth."" Jamie Wallis was at the dinner. SNP MP John Nicholson told BBC Politics Live the joke was ""appallingly bad taste"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Wallis was arrested last year on suspicion of driving while unfit, following an incident where a car hit a lamppost at Church Road in Llanblethian, Vale of Glamorgan. ""When I crashed my car on the 28th November I fled the scene. I did so because I was terrified,"" he wrote. The MP said he suffered with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and ""I honestly have no idea what I was doing except I was overcome by an overwhelming sense of fear"". ""I am sorry that it appears I 'ran away' but this isn't how it happened in the moment,"" he said. South Wales Police said the matter is still under investigation. MP arrested on suspicion of driving while unfit 'I help to rescue other trans people from death' 'When one transgender person is hurt, we all feel it' In the Twitter statement posted early Wednesday morning, Mr Wallis said: ""I've been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and I've felt this way since I was a very young child. ""I had no intention of ever sharing this with you. I always imagined I would leave politics well before I ever said this out loud. ""There was a close call in April 2020 when someone blackmailed me, outed me to my father and sent photographs to other family members. ""He wanted Â£50,000 to keep quiet. The police were so supportive, so understanding and on this occasion the system worked."" The MP said the man pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years and nine months prison. ""For a while it seemed as though I would be able to get on with things and move on. Being an MP and hiding something like this was always going to be tough, but I arrogantly assumed I was up for it. ""Well, I'm not."" He continued: ""In September I 'hooked up' with someone who I met online. ""When I chose to say 'no' on the basis that he wouldn't wear a condom he chose to rape me. I have not been myself since this incident and I don't think I will ever recover. It is not something you ever forget, and it is not something you ever move on from."" Jamie Wallis was elected in 2019 Born in Bridgend Studied chemistry at Oxford University and completed PhD at Cardiff University Was director at data recovery firm Fields Associates Elected in 2019, unseating Labour for the first time in three decades The MP praised Tory party whips: ""As far as I've seen they try their best to support and help MPs who are having a tough time. ""Well they've certainly earned their keep with me."" He said the dinner with Tory MPs on Tuesday evening reminded him ""of the incredible support those you work with can provide"". ""I was reminded how important it is to be yourself. I have never lived my truth and I'm not sure how. Perhaps it starts with telling everyone."" Later he said he was ""overwhelmed by the kindness and support I have received"". ""I am proud to be completely open and honest about the struggles I have had, and continue to have, with my identity. However, I remain the same person I was yesterday. For the time being, I will continue to present as I always have and will use he/him/his pronouns."" Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""Proud of my colleague Jamie Wallis. ""As a Conservative family we stand together, and we will support you. ""I hope that your brave statement will help others."" Mike Freer, the Minister for Equalities, acknowledged the  ""enormously personal"" statement in the Commons.""I hope I speak for the whole house in sending our support, it is so important that people are free and safe to be themselves whoever they are and whoever they love"", he said. Labour MP Wes Streeting said: ""Sending you love and solidarity from the other side of the Commons. This is hugely courageous of you to share."" Plaid Cymru Commons leader Liz Saville Roberts said: ""This is an extraordinarily brave message to send out, Jamie. Whatever our politics, public life is unremitting and often merciless. Great respect for your personal courage."" Former MP and chancellor George Osborne said ""we comment on the things that have got worse in politics, but many things have got better"", tweeting that ""if a Tory MP had said this when I was first elected 20 years ago they would have been hounded not applauded and supported"". The LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall said it was sending ""solidarity"" and ""love"" to Mr Wallis, calling his decision to come out ""brave"". ""It's clear [he] has been through very painful recent experiences, and coming out in the public eye will be liberating, but also profoundly stressful,"" said CEO Nancy Kelley. ""We've been heartened to see support from across the LGBTQ+ community and across the political spectrum.""

Russia to allow unauthorised imports from West,"Russia's prime minister said he wanted to saturate the market to create fast access to essential goods Russia is allowing imports without a trademark owner's permission, in reaction to sanctions that have halted an array of Western products. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin approved ""parallel imports"" as part of a fourth package of support for small and medium-sized businesses. The West's response to Russia's war has prompted a surge in inflation. The prime minister said until now goods could not be sold in Russia without the trademark owner's authorisation. The aim of letting retailers import products without the companies' permission, he explained, was to saturate the market so that people had fast access to necessary goods, guaranteeing supply despite the ""unfriendly actions of foreign politicians"". Lists of products were to be co-ordinated with the ministry of industry and trade, Mr Mishustin said in a televised address. Russian reports indicate they will focus on consumer products where prices have risen. Annual inflation has soared this week to 15.66%. Sugar in particular has been hit by price rises and shortages and Russia's anti-monopoly service said it was investigating the country's five biggest producers. In a bid to prop up the currency, Russia announced last week that ""unfriendly countries"" would have to pay for their natural gas in roubles from Thursday. The EU has rejected the ideaand Germany said Chancellor Olaf Scholz had been told that Europe would be able to continue paying in euros to a Russian bank not under sanctions, which would then convert the money into roubles. Hundreds of global brands such as Apple and H&M have also either pulled out of the Russian market or halted sales since the invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. Several companies have continued to provide basic nutrition and hygiene items. Sports shop Decathlon said this week it was only closing its shops because of supply chain problems, while Nestle has suspended the sale of the ""vast majority of volume and sales"" in Russia. In a separate development, Russian state institutions have been barred from buying foreign software from Thursday for so-called critical information infrastructure, without prior government consent. The decree covers telecom and information systems used by government agencies, as well as companies in defence, healthcare, transport, energy and finance.

End of Scottish face mask law delayed until Easter,"Scotland's mandatory face covering rules will now remain in force until 18 April, Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The legal requirement to wear masks in shops and on public transport had been expected to be lifted next week. But the first minister told MSPs that the changes would now not take effect until 18 April. She said this was due to there still being a very high level of infection in Scotland, and because masks provide extra protection. However, the requirement to wear a face covering in places of worship and while attending marriage and funeral services will end on 4 April. Ms Sturgeon said this phased approach struck a ""sensible balance between our desire to remove this one remaining legal measure and the common sense need for continued caution"". Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid plans Case numbers have hit record levels in Scotland in recent weeks, with one in 11 people estimated to have had the virus in the week to 20 March. Both Deputy First Minister John Swinney and Justice Secretary Keith Browntested positive on Wednesday morning, just hours before Ms Sturgeon made her announcement. Ms Sturgeon said the daily figures remained high but were ""perhaps stabilising"", with a 15% fall from about 12,000 cases to 10,200 over the past week. She said there was therefore ""grounds for optimism that this latest wave of infection may now have peaked"". However she said the high levels of infection and the pressure it was placing on the NHS meant the planned lifting of the law on face coverings would be delayed until 18 April. She told MSPs that this would be a ""proportionate precautionary measure while we pass the peak of this latest wave"". This is the second time the first minister has delayed lifting the face mask laws, which had originally been due to be removed on 21 March. All of Scotland's other legal restrictions have already been phased out. Ms Sturgeon said a delay was needed until Scotland passed the peak of the latest wave Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, a leading infections expert at University of Edinburgh, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandthat cotton masks offered ""much less protection"" from the BA.2 subvariant because far fewer virus particles needed to be inhaled to catch it. She said: ""The surgical and cotton masks just allow for a little more of the virus to get through. They are still very good for people who are lower risk - they stop them shedding a lot of virus into the environment. ""For people who are more vulnerable it is probably the moment to increase to an FFP2 mask just until the pressure in the environment from so many people infected actually decreases."" Dr Tait-Burkard said she did not believe legal enforcement of face masks was needed any more, and that recommending people wear them in high risk environments was the right thing to do. The mask laws will now be phased out, with the requirement to wear them in places of worship and at services to be dropped on 4 April. Ms Sturgeon was pictured without a mask at a memorial service for Prince Philip on Tuesday, but insisted that she wore one on the train and ""abided by the rules"" while in England. The Scottish Licensed Trade Association said it would have set a better example for the first minister to wear a face covering, adding that it was ""bitterly disappointing"" the changes had been delayed in Scotland. Managing director Colin Wilkinson said the pause would ultimately make little difference as ""the lack of use of face coverings is already clearly evident in many settings"". And the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the ""prolonging of Covid-19 rules"" might make Scotland a less attractive tourist destination. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Scotland's case rate being higher than other parts of the UK showed that the first minister's ""strategy is clearly failing"". He said: ""She is keeping restrictions in place here in Scotland weeks after they have been removed elsewhere. ""We believe that anyone who wants to keep wearing a face mask should do so, but it should be down to individual choice as it is in other parts of the UK. ""We should leave it up to people and businesses to decide what is best for them based on public health advice - Nicola Sturgeon has to start trusting the people of Scotland."" Ms Sturgeon accused the Tory leader of being ""seriously out of step with the vast majority of people"". She said: ""Particularly in public places where people don't always have a choice about being, people have to go to shops and therefore if we all wear face coverings in shops right now we help protect each other. ""For a couple of weeks more while we see this wave of infection peak and start to fall I think that is a sensible thing to do."" The testing system is also being wound down in Scotland, with the population-wide contact tracing system to be shut down by the end of April. Scottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said infection levels were concerning, calling for more details about future support and testing for vulnerable people. She said: ""While life is returning to near normality for many, that is not the case for those who are immunocompromised and the 180,000 who were on the shielding list."" Ms Sturgeon said vulnerable people were being offered extra booster jabs, and that testing would continue to be used in a targeted way to support them.

Brexit delayed pandemic plans says disaster expert,"This video can not be played One of the countryâs foremost disaster planners, Lucy Easthope, speaks to Emma Barnett. Planning for Brexit got in the way of the government preparing for Covid, despite warnings that a pandemic could pose a ""major risk"", a top disasters expert has said. Prof Lucy Easthope said a ""slow erosion of priorities"" meant that by January 2020, government meetings to discuss UK pandemic planning had been postponed. She said planners felt ""stymied"" in trying to ensure the UK was prepared. The government said the pandemic had challenged health systems globally. As one of the UK's leading experts on disaster planning and recovery, Prof Easthope has worked on the response to major incidents including the 9/11 and 7/7 attacks, the Grenfell Tower fire and the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking to Emma Barnett onBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hourshe said the UK had ""acted too late"" in its response to the coronavirus pandemic. Prof Easthope - who has written a new book on her experiences, called When the Dust Settles - said disaster experts were told ""we couldn't plan for Brexit and a pandemic at the same time, it was too ridiculous to think of both happening at the same time"". Asked who made this statement, she said it came as a ""slow erosion of priorities"" with meetings on pandemic planning delayed, or cancelled altogether. By January 2020 - when reportsof a ""mysterious viral pneumonia"" emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan- Prof Easthope said ""multiple meetings at ministerial department level had been postponed"". The UK went into its first national lockdown in March 2020, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson telling people they could only leave their homes for limited reasons to slow the spread of Covid. Prof Easthope said disaster planners felt ""very stymied"" in their ability to go into the pandemic with their ""best foot forward"". The UK went into the pandemic with a ""very depleted"" health and social care system, leaving disaster planners ""very very nervous"", she added. The country also lacked proper supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) - designed to protect health and social care workers from coronavirus, she said. ""As disaster planners, we were devastated by the loss of the PPE stockpile. The essential part of the pandemic plan...developed since 2004, was a major logistics contract that would manage the PPE."" But she said her understanding was that the stockpile was rundown between 2017 and 2020 so when disaster planners ""went to reach for it...it wasn't there"". UK failed to stockpile crucial protective kit Covid inquiry: Don't forget families like us UK marks second anniversary of first lockdown A BBC Panoramainvestigation in April 2020 found the government failed to buy crucial PPE to cope with a pandemic, with no gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in its stockpile when Covid reached the UK. Prof Easthope said disaster planners knew a pandemic was the UK's ""highest and most likely National Risk"" but that they struggled to convince central government it was a ""major risk"". She said experts wanted to ""constantly"" test and prepare for a pandemic, but found they needed ""ministerial engagement"" to boost the need for a PPE stockpile or better funding for elements of intensive care. UK's early Covid response was a failure - inquiry UK government wasn't ready for Covid, report finds Looking ahead, Prof Easthope said a public inquiry would ""uncover how much work was done... and how easy it is to erode that, particularly during times of austerity"". The Covid inquiry's public hearings are set to start next year. Its draft terms of reference were published last month. Prof Easthope said at the moment, a ""common trick"" was to tell bereaved families the pandemic was ""unpredicted and unplanned for"". But on meeting these families recently, she said their pain had been ""almost reopened all over again at the idea that there were people who had worked very hard"" to map the pandemic out. A government spokesman said: ""The Covid pandemic was unprecedented and challenged health systems around the world. Throughout the pandemic we have been guided by scientific and medical experts, and our main priority was to protect the NHS and save lives. ""As the National Audit Office Report on Covid-19 Pandemic Preparedness recognised, the government benefited from EU exit planning as well as the challenge of balancing multiple priorities. ""Thanks to our national efforts, we are now one of the most open countries in the world, and our focus is on building back better from the pandemic and delivering Brexit opportunities that benefit the British public.""

Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that shelling of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol will only end when Ukrainian troops surrender. Mr Putin made the comments during an hour long phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday night, the Kremlin said in a statement. But French officials said the Russian leader had agreed to consider plans to evacuate civilians from the city. Russia later proposed a one-day ceasefire for Thursday. The defence ministry said the ceasefire would start at 10:00 local time (08:00 BST) and would allow people to travel westwards to Zaporizhzhia via the Russian-controlled port of Berdyansk. On Thursday morning, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy of Ukrainian buses was on its way to Mariupol to try to evacuate civilians. She said the International Committee of the Red Cross had confirmed that Russia had agreed to open a humanitarian corridor to the city. Previous attempts to establish a ceasefire in Mariupol have collapsed amid accusations of bad faith from both sides. Russia has also been accused offorcibly relocating thousands of civiliansto Russia or Russian-controlled areas. The announcement comes as new satellite photos showed the destruction caused by the shelling. The images, released by the Earth observation company Maxar, showed that residential areas have been reduced to rubble and highlighted Russian artillery cannons in firing positions on the outskirts of the city. Officials from France's ElyseÃ© palace called the situation in the city ""catastrophic"" and added that ""civilian populations must be protected and must leave the city if they wish to. They must have access to food aid, water and the medicines they need"". ""This very degraded humanitarian situation is linked to the siege of the city by the Russian armed forces,"" the statement said. France, along with Turkey, Greece and several humanitarian groups, have presented Mr Putin with a plan to evacuate the city. Officials said that Mr Putin told Mr Macron that he will ""think about"" the proposal. But in its readout of the call, the Kremlin appeared to suggest that Mr Putin has provided no such assurances. Russian officials said Mr Putin told the French leader that ""in order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in this city, Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms"". The statement added that Mr Putin had given Mr Macron ""detailed information about measures taken by the Russian military to provide emergency humanitarian assistance and ensure the safe evacuation"" of civilians from the besieged south-eastern city. Ukraine has accused Russia offorcibly relocating thousands of peoplefrom Mariupol to Russian-held territory. Russian artillery positions on the periphery of Mariupol The call followed claims by the mayor of Mariupol that thousands of people have been killed during the Russian bombardment of the port city. Vadym Boychenko, who has been evacuated from the city, told the Reuters news agency that almost 5,000 people, including around 210 children, have been killed since Russian shelling began. Matilda Bogner, the head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine, told Reuters that she believes ""there could be thousands of deaths, civilian casualties, in Mariupol"". The International Red Cross humanitarian organisation has confirmed reports that one of its warehouses in the city has been hit by Russian shelling, telling the BBC that all supplies in the depot had already been distributed. It added that it no longer has ""a team on the ground"" and therefore could not comment on potential extent of casualties or damage. Are you or your family in Mariupol?

Let's take a look at some of the major developments on Thursday:  Read more from our daily Ukraine roundup. We've heard from Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov, one of the negotiators who suffered symptoms ofsuspected poisoning at peace talksalongside Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich earlier this month. One report after the incident said,externalthe alleged poisoning was orchestrated by Russian hardliners who wanted to sabotage the talks. Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""I feel better now, I feel good, but there was a situation. ""But my colleagues who are more competent in this sphere are analysing what it was and I hope during the shortest period of time they will be able to finalise it [their analysis] and I will be able to comment on it more thoroughly."" He said that while the talks were ""very tense"" at the start, ""it takes courage to find solutions and to meet"". ""Weâve had several rounds of
negotiations and at the end of the day weâre
coming to some sort of collective security agreement articles that we are
trying to negotiate."" Umerov added: ""Weâve been given a task
to find a solution so Iâm treating it as work and trying my best to find
political and diplomatic resolution to this brutal invasion."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says the situation in the south and the Donbas region remain extremely difficult. In a video address tonight, he reiterated that Russia was building up forces near the besieged city of Mariupol. ""There will be battles ahead. We still need to go down a very difficult path to get everything we want,"" he said. Russia said earlier a humanitarian corridor would be opened tomorrow to allowcivilians out of the south eastern port city of Mariupol. The Pentagon said on Thursday it did not know if Russia's convoy of military vehicles converging on Kyiv, which once stretched some 40 miles, ""still exists at this point"". ""It's been now so long,"" said spokesman John Kirby. ""They never really accomplished their mission."" The stalled convoy was never re-supplied, he noted, and was making little effort to advance on the capital even before Moscow announced its plans to reposition troops. âWe don't think that they properly planned for logistics and sustainment of a force that size in the field under combat conditions,â Kirby said. âIt's also a function of Ukrainian resistance and agility and frankly, just battlefield smarts,â he added. This video can not be played A 3D model earlier this month showed the size of the Russian convoy Nick BeakeBBC News Europe correspondent, in Brussels The EU is to urge China not to provide weapons to Russia in its war on Ukraine, nor give President Putin relief from Western sanctions. China's President Xi Jinping â who has refused to condemn Moscowâs attack on its neighbour - will hold a three-hour virtual summit with officials on Friday, including President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. At the start of February, China and Russia issued a long, joint declaration saying theirs was a relationship with ""no limits"". European leaders were worried by what they saw as a manifesto to redefine the international order. A few weeks later, President Putin invaded Ukraine. Western officials now believe Moscow has asked Beijing for military assistance and other help to cushion the blow of sanctions. EU sources say von der Leyen will urge President Xi to reject such Russian requests and instead use Chinaâs might to bring the fighting to an end â arguing the damage to the global economy benefits no one. But Chinaâs foreign minister has praised Russia this week for, in his words, preventing a large-scale humanitarian crisis and insisted the relationship with Moscow was heading in the right direction. Brussels officials are not expecting any significant agreement from the virtual talks but hope China will consider dissuading Putin from using weapons of mass destruction as his war grinds on. Yvette Cooper said the situation people were facing was ""Kafkaesque"" The UK has two visa schemes for Ukrainian refugees: The Ukraine Family Scheme, for people with a close relative living in the UK, and Homes for Ukraine, which allows people to sponsor named refugees, housing them in their homes or buildings. But thousands of families are being ""left in limbo"" as a result of bureaucracy, Labour has warned. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs earlier today that the schemes are not working, and went on to give a number of examples. ""A businesswoman who is trying to get her sister and daughter to come here on the family visa scheme is still waiting, 10 days since she applied to the Home Office. ""A constituent of mine in Pontefract who applied under the Homes for Ukraine scheme has been waiting nearly two weeks to hear anything back from the Home Office. ""Another British host who has applied for a visa for a woman undergoing a high-risk pregnancy [has been] waiting 12 days for a reply, despite the Home Office helpline saying she'd be treated as a priority."" On Wednesday, the UK said it had issued 2,700 visas through the Homes for Ukraine scheme and 22,800 under the Ukraine Family Scheme, which has been running for longer. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC South Asia Correspondent, Delhi Russiaâs Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has
touched down in India, the latest official to visit in what feels like a
conveyor belt of diplomacy. In the last week or so, delegations from China,
America, Germany, Japan and Mexico have also passed through. Lavrovâs
arrival came just as UK Foreign Secretary Liz Trusswrapped up a day of meetings in Delhi.While sheâs unlikely to bump into Lavrov, the fact
theyâre both here at the same time is an indication of how India is being wooed
from all sides. New Delhi has remained neutral on the issue of Ukraine. Prime
Minister Modi has called for the violence to end, but has stopped short of
denouncing Russiaâs actions. Fridayâs talks with Lavrov are expected to
include discussions on how India can buy more cheap oil from Russia, using a
payment system that would not breach sanctions regulations. But the US deputy
national security adviser Daleep Singh, who is yet another visitor in Delhi
today, warned there would be âconsequences
to countries that actively attempt to circumvent or backfill the
sanctions"". India is keen to stress that Russian oil makes up a tiny
proportion of its overall purchases and that the EU still buys far more. India's position remains one of
neutrality. Here, Moscow remains a friend, not a foe. As Thursday draws to an end in Ukraine, here are some pictures of people affected by the war on the 36th day of Russia's invasion. Relatives of a Ukrainian soldier, Yuriy Oliynyk, attend his burial in the western city of Lviv This man was among several people brought to a centre in Kyiv after being evacuated from the town of Irpin Xenia comforts her baby Alexander in a refugee centre in Lviv station, after fleeing her home in Kyiv A Ukrainian soldier carries a child from a displaced family across a river on the outskirts of Kyiv Refugees are still arriving in Poland, although the UN says numbers have slowed in recent days Russia is now a ""lesser country"" as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, says UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. Speaking to Sky News, he adds: ""President Putin is not the force he used to be. He is now a man in a cage he built himself. ""His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. ""The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed. ""He has not only got to live with the consequences of what he is doing to Ukraine, but he has also got to live with the consequences of what he has done to his own army."" Wallace says Russian forces appear to be regrouping and shifting their focus towards the south and east of Ukraine. ""We have seen it before. It always gets worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas."" He adds that international allies have agreed to supply more military equipment and ""lethal aid"" to Ukraine, including armoured vehicles and long-range artillery and ammunition. The US president has told journalists he is sceptical of Russian claims that it would pull troops away from Kyiv and focus on the east of the country. ""It's an open question whether he's actually pulling back,"" Joe Biden told journalists. ""Thus far, there is no clear evidence that he's pulling all his forces out of Kyiv. There is also evidence that he's beefing up his troops down in the Donbass area,"" he said. ""I don't know the answer, it appears so far...  the idea that he's pulling all his troops out from around Kyiv and moving south - there's no evidence he's done that,"" he added If you're just joining us, here is a recap of some of the main developments today: On the international stage:  On the ground: Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said Putin had damaged himself through a series of ""catastrophic misjudgements"" Earlier this afternoon, the head of Britain's armed forces gave his update on the war. In a speech followed by a question-and-answer session at the Institute for Government think tank, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin echoed sentiments made elsewhere by the UK and US, that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been ""misled"" about the effectiveness of his country's armed forces. He said the UK was ""incredibly cautious"" about believing Russian claims of withdrawing from the capital Kyiv but said there did appear to be signs the Kremlin was preparing to focus its efforts on the east and south of Ukraine. ""We are starting to see the early indications of those forces being moved back from Kyiv and retreating to both Russia and Belarus,"" Radakin said. ""That in itself is a difficult evolution for Russia because they are doing that under contact, so Ukraine armed forces will attack those Russian forces as they retreat."" Radakin, who replaced General Sir Nick Carter in the top job late last year, warned the coming weeks would ""continue to be very difficult"" for Ukraine, before adding: ""But in many ways, Putin has already lost. ""Far from being the far-sighted manipulator of events that he would have us believe, Putin has damaged himself through a series of catastrophic misjudgements."" US President Joe Biden says Russian President Vladimir Putin ""seems to be self-isolating"". ""There's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,"" he claims. ""I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time because we don't have that much hard evidence."" More now from US President Joe Biden. He says moving towards clean energy will help Americans deal with rising fuel prices. The US must ""double down on clean energy"", Biden says, which includes passing his bill currently before Congress. Biden says he's issuing a directive to strengthen the US's clean energy economy, using the Defense Production Act - which gives the government increased power over domestic industries in emergencies. This will help secure American supply chains and reduce dependence on China and other countries for materials such as lithium, nickel and graphite, which are used in electric cars and energy storage, he says, in order to ""build a made-in-America clean energy future"". This, he says, will save Americans money. President Biden said high oil prices were ""hitting Americans at the pump"" US President Joe Biden is speaking about the way high oil prices are ""hitting Americans at the pump"". ""I know how much it hurts,"" he says. He says banning Russian oil imports was ""the right thing to do"" but it would ""come with a cost"". Biden says US oil companies are recording increasing profits and have a choice: Between putting these to use by producing more oil, giving US people a break, or ""they can exploit the situation"". Biden says he is announcing a ""use-it-or-lose it"" policy, where companies will face fees for idle wells if they do not restart production.  President Joe Biden is now announcing plans to release a record amount of oil from US strategic stockpiles, in response to the Ukraine war. We'll bring you updates from what he says. Wyre DaviesBBC News, Zaporizhzhia Here in Zaporizhzhia, the last big city in Ukrainian held territory in the south east, local officials and aid workers are preparing to receive thousands of refugees from Mariupol. Tens of thousands of people are trapped in the city after weeks of fighting and heavy Russian bombardments. Organised by the Ukrainian government in conjunction with the Red Cross, the convoy of 45 buses, supported by medical vehicles, will depart from Zaporizhzhia on Friday but only if all sides can agree on a 24 hour ceasefire around the city. Previous attempts to establish humanitarian corridors from Mariupol failed after vehicles were attack on the roads out. A spokesperson for the ICRC said it was âdesperately important the operation takes place - the lives of tens of thousands of people in Mariupol depend on it"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor For
the Kremlin this is designed to suggest a dramatic escalation in the economic
battle between the West and Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir
Putinhas outlined a pathway for the cutting off gas supplies to Europe, if
Western customers refuse to pay for supplies in the Russian currency the
rouble. However, the market reaction suggests the details of the mechanism, means that, in
practice, European customers will just have to change their currency dealers to
Gazprombank. That bank has already been left unsanctioned, for the purpose of
continuity of energy trade. As a
result, gas prices remain very high, but did not today shoot into the
stratosphere. There should be a work-around. As one leading analyst told me,
this solution has âsaved faceâ for Putin, who can sound tough on domestic TV.
Ultimately, as Russian officials have repeatedly said for decades, Russian
supply of energy to the West continued uninterrupted even during the height of
the Cold War. Ultimately,
Russia still needs the money for the gas and still wants to leave the
possibility of a market for its main export, once a peace deal is signed.
However, it is also true to say that the threat of a cut-off has escalated. EU
nations have prepared emergency measures to manage demand, and would be more
willing to face that now during spring and summer than winter. The
net effect of the mechanism announced is to limit the ability of the West to
freeze the revenues they pay to Gazprom, which Putin described as receiving the
gas for free. Some Ukrainian officials have suggested such an approach. Oil and
gas dollars and euros continue to help the Kremlin resist an otherwise tough
set of financial sanctions. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Maternity deaths scandal will spark change - JavidSajid Javid apologises over the maternity scandal and pledges to hold those responsible to account.,"Rhiannon Davies and Kayleigh Griffiths spearheaded calls for the inquiry after their daughters' deaths Sweeping changes to maternity services in England are expected after a report laid bare catastrophic failures at an NHS trust that may have led to the deaths of more than 200 babies. Over 20 years, errors at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust led to babies being stillborn, dying after birth or being left severely brain damaged. Health Secretary Sajid Javid apologised to the families affected - and pledged to hold those responsible to account. The trust has also apologised. It said it had already made changes and promised to continue to make improvements. The inquiry into the UK's biggest maternity scandal - led by senior midwife Donna Ockendon - looked into nearly 1,600 incidents at the trust in Shropshire over two decades. It found: repeated failures in the quality of care at the trust between 2000 and 2019 - with mothers and babies dying or suffering major injuries as a consequence some 201 babies could have survived had the trust provided better care - including 131 stillbirths and 70 neonatal deaths staff were reluctant to perform Caesarean sections leading many babies to die during birth or shortly after, and there was ineffective monitoring of foetal growth in many cases, mothers and babies were left with life-long conditions as a result of their care some babies suffered skull fractures, broken bones or developed cerebral palsy after traumatic forceps deliveries, while others were starved of oxygen and experienced life-changing brain injuries there were significant or major concerns over the care provided in 65 cases of cerebral palsy and 29 severe brain injuries babies' deaths were often not investigated and grieving parents were not listened to, meaning ""failures in care were repeated"" the deaths of nine mothers raised significant or major concerns with the care they received The report also said the trust was not held to account by external bodies - and it either failed to undertake investigations or when an investigation did take place it was inadequate. The reason for the failures included lack of staff, lack of ongoing training, lack of effective investigations and governance and a culture of not listening to the families involved. The trust also had a tendency to blame mothers for poor outcomes - in some cases for their own deaths, the report found. It made a range of recommendations - including more than 60 for the local trust involved, 15 for the wider NHS and three for the government. These included: for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to work with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, (RCOG) and Health Education England to consider how to deliver a sustainable level of obstetric training posts, to enable trusts to deliver safe staffing a proportion of maternity budgets must be ring-fenced for training in every maternity unit for the trust to make the needs of families affected the primary concern during incident investigations a robust process to be in place to ensure that all safety concerns raised by staff at the trust are investigated the trust board must review the progress of the maternity improvement and transformation plan every month the trust must also ensure complete and accurate information is given to families after any poor outcome Mr Javid told MPs the government was accepting all recommendations and ""will act swiftly so no families have to go through the same pain in the future"". He added: ""To all the families who have suffered so greatly, I am sorry. ""The report clearly shows that you were failed by a service that was there you help you and your loved ones to bring life into this world, we will make the changes that the report says are needed at both a local and national level."" Rhiannon Davies (left) lost her daughter in 2009 - campaigning by her and others saw Donna Ockenden's review set up in 2017 The report was the culmination of an inquiry, first launched in 2017, into concerns over maternity care at Shropshire hospitals. Initially set out to examine 23 cases, it has now examined almost 1,600 and is thought to be largest of its kind in NHS history. The findings of the inquiry, Mr Javid said, were ""stark and deeply upsetting"". He told of one case where he said, ""important"" medical information had been kept on Post It notes which were swept into a bin by cleaners which had ""tragic consequences for a newborn baby and her family"". 'We've had to fight all the way for this' Baby death numbers far worse than imagined - Hunt Watch on iPlayer: Maternity Scandal - Fighting for the Truth The health secretary added: ""I'd like to reassure MPs that a number of people who were working at the trust at the time of the incidents have been suspended or struck off from the professional register, and members of senior management have also been removed from their posts. ""There is also an active police investigation, Operation Lincoln, which is looking at around 600 cases."" Det Ch Supt Damian Barratt said the investigation was ""very much active"", although no charges had yet been brought. The findings of the Ockenden review are, of course, shocking. Even more alarming is the common thread that runs through this scandal and others. Neglect and abuse at Stafford hospital during the first decade of this century led to the unnecessary suffering and deaths of hundreds of patients, a subsequent inquiry found. Then there was the investigation into University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which uncovered a ""lethal mix of failures"" that led to the unnecessary deaths of 11 babies and one mother between 2004 and 2013. Common to all these are poor care, a defensive response by staff and managers and a lack of scrutiny both locally and nationally that failed to uncover the problems for too long. And this is unlikely to be the end of the story. An inquiry into mental health care in Essex between 2000 and 2020 has been launched and there are ongoing investigations into maternity care provided in both Nottingham and Kent. These are all exceptional cases - there is lots of good care in the NHS. But there also seems to be a failure of the culture and systems in the NHS to spot and deal with problems early enough. This video can not be played Senior midwife Donna Ockenden: New maternity failure reports ""a grave concern"" Two families spearheaded the campaign for the inquiry. Richard Stanton and Rhiannon Davies's daughter Kate died hours after her birth in March 2009, while Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths' daughter Pippa died in 2016 from a Group B Streptococcus infection. Ms Davies said: ""All we ever wanted was to understand why Kate died. It was as simple as that."" While Mr Stanton said the report was a ""damning account of systemic healthcare failures"". ""There were regulators who should have prevented this, it shouldn't have been left to bereaved families to have uncovered the biggest tragedy in NHS history."" This video can not be played Shropshire baby deaths: Report is a 'gift' to NHS While Mrs Griffiths added: ""It's so important that the learning is taken."" Other families affected have shared their stories, including Julie Rowlings, whose daughter Olivia died in 2002 due to injuries suffered during her birth. ""She had a haematoma the full size of her scalp,"" Ms Rowlings said. ""Her ear was almost severed, her brain stem was almost severed. ""Every major organ haemorrhaged. ""They found brain matter in her lungs, her acid levels were through the roof which meant she was in pain."" Julie Rowlings lost daughter Olivia in 2002 She said the publication of the report meant Olivia ""finally had a voice"". ""She's been heard so it kind of gives her death a purpose and it gives all this pain and anguish which we continually put ourselves through to try and get change a purpose."" Report author Ms Ockenden said hearing the stories had a ""huge impact"" on her and her team. ""There were days where I would go back to my hotel room and cry, I'm not ashamed to say that seeing the distress, seeing the grief, seeing the angerâ¦of so many families that had been torn apart, I sat and cried, more times than I can count,"" she said. Ms Ockenden said the spotlight on maternity services has ""never been greater"" and felt everyone in the system felt the opportunity for change. However, she earlier said she remained ""very concerned that in very recent weeks staff currently working at the trust have contacted the review team to express their concerns about maternity services at the trust in the here and now"". ""No woman should ever have to face going into hospital to give birth and not know whether she and her baby will come out alive,"" Labour shadow health minister Feryal Clark said. A number of health bodies have responded to the inquiry including the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), which said the report's findings were ""appalling"". The NHS Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said it deeply regretted the ""horrific experiences these families went through"" and it would work with partners to ensure further improvements are made. Louise Barnett, chief executive at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said: ""We offer our wholehearted apologies for the pain and distress caused by our failings as a trust.""

"New ferry rules on pay wonât work, warn ports","British ports have described Grant Shapps' new pay plans for the ferry industry as ""unworkable"". The transport secretary has urged ports to block ferries from docking if they do not pay their crew the UK minimum wage, with plans to create new laws. The move comes after P&O Ferries sacked 800 of its staff without notice and replaced with them with agency workers. But the boss of the ferry ports trade body raised concerns the government was ""rushing to find a solution"". ""The ports industry is genuinely sympathetic towards the situation of the impacted seafarers, however we would suggest that ports are not the competent authorities to enforce rules on employee salaries or working conditions in the shipping industry,"" Richard Ballantyne, of the British Ports Association, said. The trade organisation covers more than 400 port facilities in the UK. The UK Major Ports Group, the trade association representing large commercial ports in the UK, argued ports should not have to ""be the police for the labour practices of ferry companies"". ""We want to engage urgently and work with government to find a more effective and appropriate way of addressing the issues raised"" by the P&O Ferries sackings, it said. Unions also expressed disappointment that the plans didn't go far enough. The Department for Transport said it is ""engaging closely with industry to ensure that the new measures work effectively for all parties"" and added Mr Shapps had written to all ports requesting their support. P&O given deadline to reemploy sacked workers Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? Unions criticise plans to tackle fire and rehire Mr Shapps said he wanted to see British ports refusing access to ferry companies ""who don't pay a fair wage, as soon as [is] practical"". The government will consult on the changes needed to make it a legal requirement, he added, but urged ports to take action ""as soon as practical"". The UK minimum wage is Â£8.91 per hour for workers over 23. The average rate paid to the agency staff brought in by P&O Ferries is Â£5.50, which is in line with international maritime standards. Mr Shapps set out a number of other measures in response to the P&O sackings, including plans to create ""minimum wage corridors"" on ferry routes between the UK and other countries. The transport secretary has also asked the Insolvency Service to consider disqualifying P&O Ferries chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite from acting as a company director. He said the announcement would force P&O Ferries to ""fundamentally rethink"" its sacking of 800 workers without consulting unions beforehand. P&O Ferries drew outrage from politicians, unions and the public when it sacked hundreds of seafarers without any notice, replacing them with agency workers paid less than the minimum wage. This video can not be played P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite faces MPs Mr Hebblethwaite admitted that the firm knowingly broke the law by not consulting with unions and planned to compensate workers instead. Mr Shapps said that he would also take action to prevent employers using ""fire and re-hire tactics"" where the employer has not made ""all reasonable efforts to reach agreement through a full and thorough consultation"". Mr Shapps said: ""P&O Ferries' failure to see reason, to recognise the public anger, and to do the right thing by their staff has left the government with no choice. ""Where new laws are needed, we will create them. Where legal loopholes are cynically exploited, we will close them. And where employment rights are too weak, we will strengthen them."" But Nick Humphreys, an employment partner at Penningtons Manches Cooper, described the package as ""weak"". ""I don't think that these measures will have any affect whatsoever on P&O Ferries,"" he said. ""It's aspirational in a lot of places, it won't get workers their jobs back,"" he added, saying that nothing was likely to change for several months because of the need for consultation. On asking ports to enforce pay rules, he pointed out that one problem was that there is no legal basis for turning away ships that don't pay the national minimum wage. It could even mean that ports could be liable for damages if sued by a ferry operator, Mr Humphreys said. Unions also hit out at the government's response, saying it was too little, too late. Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the RMT union, said: ""Despite all the bluster, Grant Shapps has failed to grasp the opportunity to adequately stand up to the banditry behaviour of P&O. ""The prime minister repeatedly said to parliament that the government would be taking legal action save British seafarers' jobs but he has failed to keep his word,"" he said. Mark Dickinson, general secretary of the Nautilus trade union, said he broadly welcomed the measures announced but that they would not make P&O change course. ""P&O Ferries are already extolling that extending the UK National Minimum Wage to international ferry routes will not cause them to change direction and that their cheap labour agency-based crewing strategy will remain intact."" Ministers have condemned the actions of P&O Ferries in strong terms over the last fortnight. Today's measures are designed to improve wages and protections for seafarers working for all ferry companies operating to and from the UK - not just P&O Ferries. But they show the limits of what the government can actually do in this situation. Sacked workers won't be offered their jobs back, nor will the change to using agency crew be stopped. In an ongoing war of words with Grant Shapps, P&O Ferries' boss insisted reinstating fired workers would lead to the business collapsing. Tomorrow's deadline for staff to respond to their severance offers will be looming large, with many of the measures announced today expected to take some time to come into effect. .

Changes promised after maternity deaths scandal,"Rhiannon Davies and Kayleigh Griffiths spearheaded calls for the inquiry after their daughters' deaths Sweeping changes to maternity services in England are expected after a report laid bare catastrophic failures at an NHS trust that may have led to the deaths of more than 200 babies. Over 20 years, errors at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust led to babies being stillborn, dying after birth or being left severely brain damaged. Health Secretary Sajid Javid apologised to the families affected - and pledged to hold those responsible to account. The trust has also apologised. It said it had already made changes and promised to continue to make improvements. The inquiry into the UK's biggest maternity scandal - led by senior midwife Donna Ockendon - looked into nearly 1,600 incidents at the trust in Shropshire over two decades. It found: repeated failures in the quality of care at the trust between 2000 and 2019 - with mothers and babies dying or suffering major injuries as a consequence some 201 babies could have survived had the trust provided better care - including 131 stillbirths and 70 neonatal deaths staff were reluctant to perform Caesarean sections leading many babies to die during birth or shortly after, and there was ineffective monitoring of foetal growth in many cases, mothers and babies were left with life-long conditions as a result of their care some babies suffered skull fractures, broken bones or developed cerebral palsy after traumatic forceps deliveries, while others were starved of oxygen and experienced life-changing brain injuries there were significant or major concerns over the care provided in 65 cases of cerebral palsy and 29 severe brain injuries babies' deaths were often not investigated and grieving parents were not listened to, meaning ""failures in care were repeated"" the deaths of nine mothers raised significant or major concerns with the care they received The report also said the trust was not held to account by external bodies - and it either failed to undertake investigations or when an investigation did take place it was inadequate. The reason for the failures included lack of staff, lack of ongoing training, lack of effective investigations and governance and a culture of not listening to the families involved. The trust also had a tendency to blame mothers for poor outcomes - in some cases for their own deaths, the report found. It made a range of recommendations - including more than 60 for the local trust involved, 15 for the wider NHS and three for the government. These included: for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to work with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, (RCOG) and Health Education England to consider how to deliver a sustainable level of obstetric training posts, to enable trusts to deliver safe staffing a proportion of maternity budgets must be ring-fenced for training in every maternity unit for the trust to make the needs of families affected the primary concern during incident investigations a robust process to be in place to ensure that all safety concerns raised by staff at the trust are investigated the trust board must review the progress of the maternity improvement and transformation plan every month the trust must also ensure complete and accurate information is given to families after any poor outcome Mr Javid told MPs the government was accepting all recommendations and ""will act swiftly so no families have to go through the same pain in the future"". He added: ""To all the families who have suffered so greatly, I am sorry. ""The report clearly shows that you were failed by a service that was there you help you and your loved ones to bring life into this world, we will make the changes that the report says are needed at both a local and national level."" Rhiannon Davies (left) lost her daughter in 2009 - campaigning by her and others saw Donna Ockenden's review set up in 2017 The report was the culmination of an inquiry, first launched in 2017, into concerns over maternity care at Shropshire hospitals. Initially set out to examine 23 cases, it has now examined almost 1,600 and is thought to be largest of its kind in NHS history. The findings of the inquiry, Mr Javid said, were ""stark and deeply upsetting"". He told of one case where he said, ""important"" medical information had been kept on Post It notes which were swept into a bin by cleaners which had ""tragic consequences for a newborn baby and her family"". 'We've had to fight all the way for this' Baby death numbers far worse than imagined - Hunt Watch on iPlayer: Maternity Scandal - Fighting for the Truth The health secretary added: ""I'd like to reassure MPs that a number of people who were working at the trust at the time of the incidents have been suspended or struck off from the professional register, and members of senior management have also been removed from their posts. ""There is also an active police investigation, Operation Lincoln, which is looking at around 600 cases."" Det Ch Supt Damian Barratt said the investigation was ""very much active"", although no charges had yet been brought. The findings of the Ockenden review are, of course, shocking. Even more alarming is the common thread that runs through this scandal and others. Neglect and abuse at Stafford hospital during the first decade of this century led to the unnecessary suffering and deaths of hundreds of patients, a subsequent inquiry found. Then there was the investigation into University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which uncovered a ""lethal mix of failures"" that led to the unnecessary deaths of 11 babies and one mother between 2004 and 2013. Common to all these are poor care, a defensive response by staff and managers and a lack of scrutiny both locally and nationally that failed to uncover the problems for too long. And this is unlikely to be the end of the story. An inquiry into mental health care in Essex between 2000 and 2020 has been launched and there are ongoing investigations into maternity care provided in both Nottingham and Kent. These are all exceptional cases - there is lots of good care in the NHS. But there also seems to be a failure of the culture and systems in the NHS to spot and deal with problems early enough. This video can not be played Senior midwife Donna Ockenden: New maternity failure reports ""a grave concern"" Two families spearheaded the campaign for the inquiry. Richard Stanton and Rhiannon Davies's daughter Kate died hours after her birth in March 2009, while Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths' daughter Pippa died in 2016 from a Group B Streptococcus infection. Ms Davies said: ""All we ever wanted was to understand why Kate died. It was as simple as that."" While Mr Stanton said the report was a ""damning account of systemic healthcare failures"". ""There were regulators who should have prevented this, it shouldn't have been left to bereaved families to have uncovered the biggest tragedy in NHS history."" This video can not be played Shropshire baby deaths: Report is a 'gift' to NHS While Mrs Griffiths added: ""It's so important that the learning is taken."" Other families affected have shared their stories, including Julie Rowlings, whose daughter Olivia died in 2002 due to injuries suffered during her birth. ""She had a haematoma the full size of her scalp,"" Ms Rowlings said. ""Her ear was almost severed, her brain stem was almost severed. ""Every major organ haemorrhaged. ""They found brain matter in her lungs, her acid levels were through the roof which meant she was in pain."" Julie Rowlings lost daughter Olivia in 2002 She said the publication of the report meant Olivia ""finally had a voice"". ""She's been heard so it kind of gives her death a purpose and it gives all this pain and anguish which we continually put ourselves through to try and get change a purpose."" Report author Ms Ockenden said hearing the stories had a ""huge impact"" on her and her team. ""There were days where I would go back to my hotel room and cry, I'm not ashamed to say that seeing the distress, seeing the grief, seeing the angerâ¦of so many families that had been torn apart, I sat and cried, more times than I can count,"" she said. Ms Ockenden said the spotlight on maternity services has ""never been greater"" and felt everyone in the system felt the opportunity for change. However, she earlier said she remained ""very concerned that in very recent weeks staff currently working at the trust have contacted the review team to express their concerns about maternity services at the trust in the here and now"". ""No woman should ever have to face going into hospital to give birth and not know whether she and her baby will come out alive,"" Labour shadow health minister Feryal Clark said. A number of health bodies have responded to the inquiry including the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), which said the report's findings were ""appalling"". The NHS Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said it deeply regretted the ""horrific experiences these families went through"" and it would work with partners to ensure further improvements are made. Louise Barnett, chief executive at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said: ""We offer our wholehearted apologies for the pain and distress caused by our failings as a trust.""

Brexit held back pandemic plans says disaster expert,"This video can not be played One of the countryâs foremost disaster planners, Lucy Easthope, speaks to Emma Barnett. Planning for Brexit got in the way of the government preparing for Covid, despite warnings that a pandemic could pose a ""major risk"", a top disasters expert has said. Prof Lucy Easthope said a ""slow erosion of priorities"" meant that by January 2020, government meetings to discuss UK pandemic planning had been postponed. She said planners felt ""stymied"" in trying to ensure the UK was prepared. The government said the pandemic had challenged health systems globally. As one of the UK's leading experts on disaster planning and recovery, Prof Easthope has worked on the response to major incidents including the 9/11 and 7/7 attacks, the Grenfell Tower fire and the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking to Emma Barnett onBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hourshe said the UK had ""acted too late"" in its response to the coronavirus pandemic. Prof Easthope - who has written a new book on her experiences, called When the Dust Settles - said disaster experts were told ""we couldn't plan for Brexit and a pandemic at the same time, it was too ridiculous to think of both happening at the same time"". Asked who made this statement, she said it came as a ""slow erosion of priorities"" with meetings on pandemic planning delayed, or cancelled altogether. By January 2020 - when reportsof a ""mysterious viral pneumonia"" emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan- Prof Easthope said ""multiple meetings at ministerial department level had been postponed"". The UK went into its first national lockdown in March 2020, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson telling people they could only leave their homes for limited reasons to slow the spread of Covid. Prof Easthope said disaster planners felt ""very stymied"" in their ability to go into the pandemic with their ""best foot forward"". The UK went into the pandemic with a ""very depleted"" health and social care system, leaving disaster planners ""very very nervous"", she added. The country also lacked proper supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) - designed to protect health and social care workers from coronavirus, she said. ""As disaster planners, we were devastated by the loss of the PPE stockpile. The essential part of the pandemic plan...developed since 2004, was a major logistics contract that would manage the PPE."" But she said her understanding was that the stockpile was rundown between 2017 and 2020 so when disaster planners ""went to reach for it...it wasn't there"". UK failed to stockpile crucial protective kit Covid inquiry: Don't forget families like us UK marks second anniversary of first lockdown A BBC Panoramainvestigation in April 2020 found the government failed to buy crucial PPE to cope with a pandemic, with no gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in its stockpile when Covid reached the UK. Prof Easthope said disaster planners knew a pandemic was the UK's ""highest and most likely National Risk"" but that they struggled to convince central government it was a ""major risk"". She said experts wanted to ""constantly"" test and prepare for a pandemic, but found they needed ""ministerial engagement"" to boost the need for a PPE stockpile or better funding for elements of intensive care. UK's early Covid response was a failure - inquiry UK government wasn't ready for Covid, report finds Looking ahead, Prof Easthope said a public inquiry would ""uncover how much work was done... and how easy it is to erode that, particularly during times of austerity"". The Covid inquiry's public hearings are set to start next year. Its draft terms of reference were published last month. Prof Easthope said at the moment, a ""common trick"" was to tell bereaved families the pandemic was ""unpredicted and unplanned for"". But on meeting these families recently, she said their pain had been ""almost reopened all over again at the idea that there were people who had worked very hard"" to map the pandemic out. A government spokesman said: ""The Covid pandemic was unprecedented and challenged health systems around the world. Throughout the pandemic we have been guided by scientific and medical experts, and our main priority was to protect the NHS and save lives. ""As the National Audit Office Report on Covid-19 Pandemic Preparedness recognised, the government benefited from EU exit planning as well as the challenge of balancing multiple priorities. ""Thanks to our national efforts, we are now one of the most open countries in the world, and our focus is on building back better from the pandemic and delivering Brexit opportunities that benefit the British public.""

Germany warns on gas supply over Russia payment row,"Germany and Austria have triggered emergency plans over possible gas supply disruption amid a payments stand-off with Russia. Russia had demanded ""unfriendly"" countries pay for its gas in roubles from 31 March, but the EU, which mainly pays in euros, rejected the idea. Moscow later appeared to soften its stance, saying on Wednesday rouble payments would be introduced gradually. But Germany and Austria have taken the first steps towards gas rationing Germany urged consumers and companies to reduce consumption in anticipation of possible shortages, while Austria said it was tightening its monitoring of the gas market. Germany gets about half its gas and a third of its oil from Russia and has warned that it could face a recession if supplies suddenly stopped. Neighbouring Austria relies on Russia much more for gas, with the country getting about 80% from the country and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer's office said measures such as gas rationing would only come into play in an ""immediate crisis"". Under an existing gas emergency plan, the ""early warning phase"", which both Germany and Austria have begun, is the first of three steps designed to prepare the country for a potential supply shortage. In its final stage, the governments would bring in gas rationing. German economy minister Robert Habeck said the country's gas supplies were safeguarded for the time being, but said it was increasing precautionary measures in case of escalation by Russia. The head of German network regulator Bundesnetzagentur, Klaus MÃ¼ller, said the aim of the early warning was to avoid a deterioration of supply. He urged consumers and industry to prepare for ""all scenarios"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would not demand payments in roubles from Thursday. ""Payments and delivery is a time consuming process... from a technological point of view, this is a more prolonged process,"" he said. Russia doubles interest rate after rouble slumps Russia considers accepting Bitcoin for oil and gas The West has been imposing sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that natural gas exported to Europe should be paid for in roubles. Analysts say the move will support the country's currency, which fell sharply after the invasion but has begun to recover. Europe, which in total imports about 40% of its gas from Russia and pays mostly in euros, says Russia's state-controlled gas giant Gazprom cannot redraw contracts. But Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, said on Wednesday: ""European politicians need to stop the talk, stop trying to find some justification about why they cannot pay in roubles. ""If you want gas, find roubles."" The Kremlin also said Russia could start demanding payment in roubles for other commodities such as fertiliser, grain, metals and timber. France gets around 20% of its gas from Russia and the head of the country's CRE regulatory body said it did not expect any supply issues Bulgaria gets 90% of its gas via imports from Russian company Gazprom. Its natural gas grid operator has opened a tender for underground drilling as part of plans to almost double the country's gas storage capacity and prepare for any supply disruptions Poland gets around 50% of its gas per year from Russia but says it has no current plans to limit gas use Greece receives about 40% of its gas via a pipeline that bypasses Ukraine. Its government will meet to assess supply security if Russia switches the tap off Italy gets around 40% of its gas supply from Russia and is monitoring the situation. It will wait to see if Gazprom sends contract amendments to operators before it takes any further decisions The Netherlands gets between 15%-20% of its gas from Russia. The Dutch government said it will ask people to use less gas but it is not yet activating its gas crisis plan Britain gets around 3% of gas from Russia and says it has a range of sources to ensure supply German business leaders have welcomed Berlin's announcement of an ""early warning"" of a gas emergency. That's because German industry would be the first to be hit by gas rationing if Russia turned off the taps. If Germany was forced to ration gas, households and emergency services, such as hospitals, would get priority. This would hit manufacturers that rely on gas for production particularly hard, pushing up prices and possibly leading to job losses. This early warning stage aims to help businesses plan for any future shortfalls: a crisis group of representatives from the government will meet daily. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck also hopes for support from the public and has called for people to save energy where possible. ""Every kilowatt helps,"" he said. So far there are no gas shortages - Germany had large reserves. But over the past year Russia has failed to keep German gas reserve tanks fully stocked - some believe this indicates a long-standing plan by the Kremlin to use gas as a weapon against Europe. S&P Global energy analyst Laurent Ruseckas said Russia and the EU were involved in ""a game of chicken"" over who would back down first. ""Putin started it last Wednesday, with his first comment about requiring the change to payment in roubles, and now the EU has responded at a political level, saying: 'Well, no, we won't,'"" he told the BBC World Service. ""Something has got to give here."" He said the most likely next step was for the EU and Gazprom to seek a compromise by redrawing contracts, as both sides have an interest in resolving the stand-off. Russia currently gets â¬400m (Â£340m) per day from gas sales to the EU and it has no way of rerouting this supply to other markets. However, Mr Ruseckas said there was a small chance ""the brinksmanship leads very quickly towards a cut-off"". This would force Germany to run more coal plants, import as much liquified natural gas as possible, and in the longer term build more renewable energy production.

They were there to see Donna Ockenden present her findings this morning and Kayleigh Griffiths, who lost her daughter Pippa in 2016 said: ""To finally be heart by Donna is a great achievement for all families."" But she doesn't believe the fight will be over until the concerns raised in the report are taken on board by the trust. Both she and Rhiannon Davies, who lost her daughter Kate in 2009 were in tears after Ms Ockenden delivered her speech. And Ms Davies says: ""This report can make a difference, this report could be a legacy, it should be."" Read more:The mothers who helped uncover the biggest NHS maternity scandal As the magnitude of today's report into baby deaths and maternity failings sinks in, one mother has paid tribute to its author Donna Ockenden. Hayley Matthews' son, Jack Burns, was 11 hours old when he died in 2015 after staff failed to spot he was suffering from a serious infection, Group B Streptococcus. ""She genuinely cares, it is not another baby and another number, she genuinely cares about each and every one of us,"" Ms Matthews says. ""As she says, we are her family."" She was among the families who attended the publication of the review at the at Mercure Shrewsbury Albrighton Hotel, Shropshire. Ms Matthews says she is ""shocked"" by the report's findings  but hoped lessons will be learned. ""Telford and Shropshire as a whole isn't big, but the numbers that it has happened to, it is like probably half, it is disgusting and it should never happen again,"" she says. Here's the boss of the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospitals Trust making a statement following the publication of the Ockenden report which detailed unprecedented failings in maternity care. Trust chief executive Louise Barnett ""apologises fully"" and says ""we do have more to do"". This video can not be played Shrewsbury maternity scandal: Trust has 'more to do' The head of a birth charity says there is ""surprise"" at the scale of the maternity report's inquiry. Clea Harmer, chief executive of stillbirth and neonatal charity Sands, says the inquiry has grown ""enormously"" since its launch in 2017 when it was begun to look at 23 cases. She says the charity is ""very aware...how often parents aren't listened to, how often they aren't involved in reviews and how difficult and painful and devastating some of their experiences have been"". The ""most important message"" to come out of this report is that parents must be listened to, she says. ""That must change and not just at Shrewsbury and Telford but in every hospital, in every maternity unit,"" she says. Two senior NHS figures have promised to ""redouble"" efforts to improve maternity services around the country, in the light of the Ockenden report. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, England's chief midwifery officer and Matthew Jolly, national clinical director for maternity and women's health, say the families ""should have been protected and cared for at the most special time in their lives"". An extra Â£127m has been committed to ""boost our workforce, strengthen leadership and improve culture"" they say. The chief executive of the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, says she encourages staff to speak out about any concerns after the report highlighted some feared the consequences. Asked about staff comments made to the inquiry claiming they had been told not to participate she says it is ""very committed to our culture change programme"". ""We have made progress,"" Ms Barnett says. ""We have more colleagues contributing their ideas and also raising concerns, which we are acting on within the organisation,"" she says. ""But we do have more to go, and if any person or any member of staff has any concerns, I would really encourage them to raise it through the many routes we have available... so that we can absolutely act on those issues."" We've been hearing that Donna Ockenden's team found it difficult to get hospital staff to speak to them. A process
whereby staff could speak to the review team heard âthat there was a culture of
bullying within the leadership team,â that wasnât confined to maternity
services. Another said, âits very hard
to speak up because despite what anybody will tell you, there are consequencesâ. âYou feel like you are penalised constantly. Iâm keeping my head down,â said another
medic, while a fourth remarked that âI feel thereâs a reluctance to change
there.â Throughout the day we've been hearing from families affected by today's report. Emma Priddey has told the BBC how she nearly died after giving birth to twins in 2019 at the Princess Royal Hospital, in Telford. Ms Priddey says she was told to continue with a natural birth despite her son being breech. ""I remember asking three times, one of them whilst I was pushing. When I was pushing I remember asking the consultant, 'are you sure that it's OK to go ahead with this?' and they said, 'yeah he'll turn'. ""But what I wasn't aware of was as a twin mum it is my right to choose whether I have a C-section or go naturally,"" she says. 'I nearly died' Ms Priddey had an emergency c-section and says she became unwell very quickly afterwards. ""Throwing up, couldn't hold my babies. I don't remember the first few days of their life. Despite all of my family's efforts and my efforts to tell the team that were on how unwell I was, I just wasn't listened to. ""Just short of 48 hours later I had to be rushed back in for major surgery for which they realised I had a mass bleed on the uterus and the only way to save my life was to have a hysterectomy."" If you are affected by any of todayâs news, help is available through theBBCâs Action Line. If you're just joining us or need a recap, here's a look at the reaction to a major report into baby deaths and maternity failings at a hospital trust. The report:The Ockenden report is the conclusion of an inquiry, first launched in 2017 to examine concerns over maternity care at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust (SaTH). The findings:The report outlines how failures led to the deaths of more than 200 babies, nine mothers and left other infants with life-changing injuries, with deaths often not investigated and parents not listened to. The families:In total, the inquiry has looked at almost 1,600 cases, including that of Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa died in 2016 at 31-hours-old from a Group B Streptococcus infection. Mrs Griffiths was instrumental in securing the inquiry and says it is ""so important that the learning is taken"" from the report. The hospital trust:Louise Barnett, chief executive of the trust, says it offers its ""wholehearted apologies"" to the families affected and says it will continue to make improvements. The health secretary:Sajid Javid told MPs vital clinical information was kept on post-it notes and swept into a bin ""with tragic consequences for a newborn baby and her family"". He vowed to ""act swiftly
so no families have to go through the same pain in the future"". The police:Operation Lincoln, West Mercia Police's investigation to explore whether there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved, is ongoing, with Det Ch Supt Damian Barratt adding it will feed ""appropriate elements"" from the report into its work. Donna Ockenden has spoken of the difficulties her team faced in getting staff to speak out in order to contribute to the report. She says: ""Staff have described to us they were frightened to speak to the maternity review team and were advised by trust managers not to participate in the Staff Voices initiative."" Staff Voices is the listening exercise set up by the Ockenden team. One member of staff, who came forward earlier this month, told the team: ""If I could say anything to the families it would be that there were people who tried to make changes. ""We tried to escalate our concerns and be heard, but every process we used was set up not to acknowledge our voices or the problems we were highlighting. ""We were ignored and made out to be the problem. But ultimately we failed to make ourselves heard."" The Ockenden report has been described as a ""watershed moment"" by the leader of one local authority in Shropshire. Shaun Davies, from Labour-run Telford and Wrekin Council, says he is in regular contact with the leadership at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust, ""seeking assurances that they are implementing changes"". He says he recognises ""considerable strides"" have been made to maternity care in the county since the publication of Ockenden's interim report, but more investment is needed. And he believes that's not just in maternity, that's across hospital services in the county. This video can not be played Caesarean sections: Why and when are they used? Among the failures highlighted in today's Ockenden report is about the Shrewsbury and Telford trust's stance towards Caesarean sections. The report says there was a reluctance to perform Caesareans, which led to many babies dying during birth or shortly after. Until last month, maternity units in England were encouraged to promote natural births and keep the Caesarean rate to about 20%. But in Februarythe guidance was changed- and now the NHS in England no longer limits the number of Caesarean sections it performs, under plans to improve care for mothers and babies. Maternity staff have been told to treat cases on an individual basis and followNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance,externalallowing women to opt for a planned Caesarean even if it is not for medical reasons. If a woman wants to have a caesarean, a trust must try to grant their wishes, and only say no if they have a good, evidence-based reason. Health Secretary Sajid Javid also referred to the issue in his Commons statement earlier. He said it was right that doctors' groups - the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Royal College of Midwives - had since said they regretted their campaign pushing for natural births. While the Ockenden report has finally drawn to a conclusion, the police investigation into actions in Shropshire is still under way. West Mercia Police provided an update today to say it's still trying to determine whether there is enough evidence to support a criminal case against the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust or any individuals involved. It described its own investigation, which also started in 2017, as ""highly complex"" and said so far no arrests had been made. The findings of the Ockenden report will now be fed in to its own inquiry, the force said. Kye Hall was four days old when he died One of the mothers who lost a baby at the trust is Katie Anson, whose son Kye Hall died in 2015 aged four days. Staff failed to properly take or read heart-rate readings which meant they didn't spot Kye was in distress. ""You feel robbed,"" says Katie. ""It makes me angry, but it makes me sad as well. To think of all the people who've lost their children because they haven't done anything, they haven't acted."" In a similar case, Graham Scott Holmes-Smith was stillborn in 2015. Midwives didn't realise he was in distress because they failed to read his heart-rate monitor properly. ""They're not just taking people's babies away, they're taking away Christmases, birthdays, everything,"" says mother Sophie Holmes. More here. The Nursing and Midwifery Council is looking for ""sustained investment in continuing professional development"" of midwives, following the publication of the Ockenden report. Andrea Sutcliffe, its chief executive and registrar, says: âSafe care for mothers and babies happens when maternity services have a fair culture, strong multidisciplinary relationships and an open approach if thereâs a concern."" She also says it's important to know ""when things are going wrong"" and people take the correct response. ""Last night I couldn't sleep, my anxiety was through the roof,"" says Kayleigh Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa was one-day-old when she died in 2016 after midwives failed to spot an infection, has responded to the report. Kayleigh was one of the first mothers to publicly raise concerns - and you canread more about her role in uncovering the scandal here. ""It's so important that the learning is taken,"" she says. ""This is 200-odd pages of harmed families... It's really important, and it's really important that maternity services up and down the country read this and listen to what families have gone through and the impact that's had on people's lives."" Asked on how proud she must feel to have come this far, Kayleigh Griffiths says it's difficult to comprehend. Her partner Colin adds: ""It's bittersweet. It's an accomplishment, but it didn't need to happen. It shouldn't have happened in the first place."" ""We visited Pippa this morning before we came, and we said 'this is what we've done for her',"" says Kayleigh - who says she's suffered from PTSD.
""It's just heartbreaking."" ""We've had to fight all the way along in this, so to finally be heard by Donna is a great achievement for all families. But I don't think we've been heard by the trust yet. That's the really important thing we need from this - that the trust need to recognise that words aren't going to be enough."" The session on the Ockenden report in the House of Commons has now come to an end. Here's a reminder of some of the figures highlighted by today's report before we hear more from the families affected. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who commissioned the Ockenden report, asks Sajid Javid when action will be taken as a result of it. Hunt calls for ""a culture in the NHS that is open, transparent accepts things go wrong, but hungry to learn from mistakes so that we never again repeat tragedies like this."" Javid says he has asked for a timetable on the implementation of the report's calls for action. ""I want to see that done as quickly as possible,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Join us again soon. The PM was questioned at length about the Ukraine crisis. His main points were: This video can not be played Johnson backs more UK nuclear and offshore power supplies Labour's Clive Betts finishes up the session by thanking the prime minister. And it is all over! We will bring you more analysis and reaction from the committee here, so don't go anywhere... Tory MP Mel Stride asks if the government has started looking at cutting expenditure, as a result of inflation and the reduction in the rate of income tax, due to come in in 2024. The PM says there's been ""massive pressure"" on public finances since Covid hit, but ministers took a decision not to return to austerity. The cost of interest on the government's debt is Â£83bn a year and could go up, so it has to be ""very, very careful"" in deciding how much to spend, he adds. Stride says exports and imports have stayed ""very low"" following the pandemic and asks whether the UK is becoming more of a ""closed economy"" because of Brexit. The PM says he doesn't want this to happen and he wants ""much more of an export drive"" and it is a matter of ""will and energy and ambition"". Tory MP Mel Stride, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, says rapidly increasing inflation is higher than the rate of benefit rises, which was decided last year. He asks whether payments could be revisited in a couple of months. Otherwise some people will see 10% reduction in net income, Stride tells the PM. Boris Johnson promises to look into his colleague's suggestion, saying the ""aftershocks"" of the rises in energy prices - which are driving much of the increase in inflation - are difficult to deal with. Many of the government's policies are designed ""to tide people over through a tough time"", he adds. Continuing on the cost of living theme, Catherine McKinnell is back and questioning the figures the PM is using. She says 75% of children living in poverty across the UK are living in working households, and the government's measurement of absolute child poverty is not accurate. The Labour MP points to one of the government's central policies and asks: ""Do you believe it is possible to level up the country without reducing the number of children living in poverty?"" ""No,"" says the PM. Despite disputing her figures, he accepts ""there is an issue we have got to fix"", adding: ""I am not going to pretend it is easy, but we are going to go at it as hard as we can."" So, how many times is child poverty mentioned in the levelling up white paper published by the government? McKinnell reveals it is none. Johnson replies it is an accident ""because the whole objective of levelling up is to make sure kids growing up everywhere have opportunity."" Asked about last week's Spring Statement, the PM says the government is prioritising helping people back into work. But Labour's Stephen Timms says more needs to be done to boost Universal Credit to help those who can't work for health reasons. Boris Johnson responds by saying there is direct support for those facing ""particular hardships"" because of rising inflation, and the ""fundamental route out of poverty"" is getting people into jobs. Labour's Stephen Timms queries the PM's previous statement that there are now more people in work than before the pandemic, asking if he accepts acorrection made last monthby the head of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove. Boris Johnson accepts that it was ""payroll employment"" he was talking about, and that the number has now risen by 600,000, which ""is not half bad"". Timms asks if that number is more than offset by the fall in the number of self-employed people. The PM replies that unemployment had been predicted to hit 12% and this has not happened, adding that the government wants to help more people back into work. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The government's energy strategy - which was expected this week - has been delayed again. There have been reports that tensions over nuclear power have been one factor behind the delay - with reports the Treasury have been reluctant to commit outright to some of the huge costs of nuclear power given some of the targets the strategy is likely to set will fall outside the current Spending Review period. The prime minister has previously said, for example, that he wants 25% of UK power sourced from nuclear by 2050. There have also been tensions in cabinet over wind energy. Some ministers want to loosen planning laws in England to enable more onshore wind farms, but others oppose this. There is, however, pretty widespread support for more offshore wind turbines. When asked about the energy strategy, the prime minister seemed to drop some pretty strong hints about where his preferences lie. He said ""offshore wind - I stress offshore wind - has massive potential"" and added ""so does nuclear"". His message to cabinet colleagues here seems pretty clear, though No10 have also stressed in recent weeks that they want to keep all options on the table to help the UK become more energy independent and move towards net zero and away from Russian oil and gas. Tory Philip Dunne takes up the questioning on the cost of living, focusing on energy prices. He says since we began to emerge from the pandemic, households have faced an ""astonishing increase "" to their bills, exacerbated by Ukraine. But, he asks, will the much talked about - and much delayed - government energy security strategy address that? The PM says the government ""have to provide as much short term relief as you can within fiscal constraints"", pointing to the likes of the council tax rebate on its way, but also the need to look at North Sea oil and gas. ""But we have got to recognise in the UK that we have failed for a generation to put in enough long term supply,"" he adds, calling it a ""colossal mistake"". As well as renewables - and the PM stresses offshore wind specifically, rather than onshore - he wants to focus on nuclear, saying: ""This is the country that split the atom... why aren't we doing it?"" Johnson adds: ""I am not going to pretend we are going to get nuclear reactors on stream in next couple of years, but in the medium and long term, we have got to be looking at big ticket nuclear solutions."" Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News As the conversation shifts from Ukraine onto the cost of living - one area that bridges the two is the soaring costs facing farmers right now. Fertiliser and fuel costs for farmers have risen drastically due to rising gas prices. It's something the industry has warned could lead to shortages, cuts in food production, and a knock-on impact on the cost of food. The Tory MP Neil Parish urged the prime minister to do more to help farmers with fertiliser costs - including reopening a second fertiliser plant in the north of England. The prime minister was loathe to make a solid commitment to doing so without more information to hand - saying he can't just ""wave a massive wand"" but said he would ""jolly well find out what I can do"". This video can not be played Johnson and Wishart on police investigating lockdown parties Questions move on to the rising cost of living. Tory MP Neil Parish says the UK must produce more of its own food to protect consumers from global price increases. Farmers want to do it, he adds, asking what the government can do to help. The PM says he shares Parish's ambition and that investment in agriculture is rising. But young people need to be encouraged into the sector, he argues, adding that his own grandfather was a farmer, albeit ""very unsuccessfully"". Every UK embassy around the world is getting a food and drink export expert, Boris Johnson says. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News While parties have come together in Parliament in recent weeks to express solidarity with Ukraine - the government's refugee scheme has generally attracted the most scrutiny, from Tory and opposition MPs alike. The prime minister faced further questions on why applications for Ukrainian visas have reached 28,300, but only 2,700 have been granted.
He also was asked about safeguarding concerns around Ukrainians being put up in people's homes in the UK. The Tory MP Sir Bill Wiggin also pushed him on ""why can't we get right people through our immigration system instead of the wrong ones."" This is a reference to a criticism that many Tory MPs - including some ministers privately - have levelled at the government around their handling of small boat migrant crossings. The prime minister insisted that officials were processing about 1,000 visas a day for Ukrainians and that it was ""right to have checks both ways"" for Ukrainians coming to the UK - as well as UK families offering to host them. Chair Clive Betts refers back to promises made by the government on the two schemes - families bringing relatives over, and the Homes for Ukraine scheme. He says one committee was told local councils would receive Â£10,500 per refugee, no matter which scheme they come through, to provide services for them. But another select committee was told the funding was only available for people coming via Homes for Ukraine. Which is it? Johnson says it is right that councils will only get funding for refugees offered rooms by strangers, not those reuniting with families. He said they would still be able to access benefits, the NHS and education, which is ""a considerable package of support"". But Betts says councils will be left with lots more people to provide services to ""with not one penny of extra help"". The PM says most Ukrainians want to remain in the region they are from and would like to return home when the conflict ends. Officials dealing with refugees have to balance some difficult objectives, he adds, as ""gangsters"" are attempting to traffic the vulnerable and some people are ""not who they say they are"". Conservative MP Sir Bill Wiggin asks why the UK immigration system can't get ""the right people through, rather than the wrong ones"". Johnson says the system is being kept under constant review and that the government is trying to get more visa applications processed. He adds that he wants to see ""more wonderful Ukrainians coming"" to the UK. The Labour MP then raises Homes for Ukraine - where British citizens offer a home to Ukrainian refugees. She says only one in 100 offers has resulted in a visa being issued. But how many of those have actually arrived in the UK? The PM still doesn't have a number. Dame Diana Johnson tells the story of a heavily pregnant woman who has been matched with a home in the UK, but has been told she has to give birth to her child in temporary accommodation in Poland to get the child a birth certificate, before flying here. ""Is that how scheme should be operating?"" she asks. ""I can't see any reason why she couldn't come here and have the baby here,"" says the PM. Next up is the issue of visas, and Dame Diana Johnson leads the questioning. She asks whether the PM considered going for an emergency humanitarian visa for those fleeing war, rather than the schemes the Home Office has put in place. The PM says ""of course I thought about having a system when we opened the doors"" - but he is interrupted by the Labour MP, who says an emergency visa would still allow checks when people arrived. Johnson says he wanted ""a light tough system"" but one that would also allow the UK to do checks for security. He says have been 25,000 visas approved so far - ""not a bad number"" - and 1,000 visas were being processed a day. ""The number will mount quickly,"" he adds.

UK plans to block ferries that don't pay minimum wage,"British ports have described Grant Shapps' new pay plans for the ferry industry as ""unworkable"". The transport secretary has urged ports to block ferries from docking if they do not pay their crew the UK minimum wage, with plans to create new laws. The move comes after P&O Ferries sacked 800 of its staff without notice and replaced with them with agency workers. But the boss of the ferry ports trade body raised concerns the government was ""rushing to find a solution"". ""The ports industry is genuinely sympathetic towards the situation of the impacted seafarers, however we would suggest that ports are not the competent authorities to enforce rules on employee salaries or working conditions in the shipping industry,"" Richard Ballantyne, of the British Ports Association, said. The trade organisation covers more than 400 port facilities in the UK. The UK Major Ports Group, the trade association representing large commercial ports in the UK, argued ports should not have to ""be the police for the labour practices of ferry companies"". ""We want to engage urgently and work with government to find a more effective and appropriate way of addressing the issues raised"" by the P&O Ferries sackings, it said. Unions also expressed disappointment that the plans didn't go far enough. The Department for Transport said it is ""engaging closely with industry to ensure that the new measures work effectively for all parties"" and added Mr Shapps had written to all ports requesting their support. P&O given deadline to reemploy sacked workers Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? Unions criticise plans to tackle fire and rehire Mr Shapps said he wanted to see British ports refusing access to ferry companies ""who don't pay a fair wage, as soon as [is] practical"". The government will consult on the changes needed to make it a legal requirement, he added, but urged ports to take action ""as soon as practical"". The UK minimum wage is Â£8.91 per hour for workers over 23. The average rate paid to the agency staff brought in by P&O Ferries is Â£5.50, which is in line with international maritime standards. Mr Shapps set out a number of other measures in response to the P&O sackings, including plans to create ""minimum wage corridors"" on ferry routes between the UK and other countries. The transport secretary has also asked the Insolvency Service to consider disqualifying P&O Ferries chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite from acting as a company director. He said the announcement would force P&O Ferries to ""fundamentally rethink"" its sacking of 800 workers without consulting unions beforehand. P&O Ferries drew outrage from politicians, unions and the public when it sacked hundreds of seafarers without any notice, replacing them with agency workers paid less than the minimum wage. This video can not be played P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite faces MPs Mr Hebblethwaite admitted that the firm knowingly broke the law by not consulting with unions and planned to compensate workers instead. Mr Shapps said that he would also take action to prevent employers using ""fire and re-hire tactics"" where the employer has not made ""all reasonable efforts to reach agreement through a full and thorough consultation"". Mr Shapps said: ""P&O Ferries' failure to see reason, to recognise the public anger, and to do the right thing by their staff has left the government with no choice. ""Where new laws are needed, we will create them. Where legal loopholes are cynically exploited, we will close them. And where employment rights are too weak, we will strengthen them."" But Nick Humphreys, an employment partner at Penningtons Manches Cooper, described the package as ""weak"". ""I don't think that these measures will have any affect whatsoever on P&O Ferries,"" he said. ""It's aspirational in a lot of places, it won't get workers their jobs back,"" he added, saying that nothing was likely to change for several months because of the need for consultation. On asking ports to enforce pay rules, he pointed out that one problem was that there is no legal basis for turning away ships that don't pay the national minimum wage. It could even mean that ports could be liable for damages if sued by a ferry operator, Mr Humphreys said. Unions also hit out at the government's response, saying it was too little, too late. Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the RMT union, said: ""Despite all the bluster, Grant Shapps has failed to grasp the opportunity to adequately stand up to the banditry behaviour of P&O. ""The prime minister repeatedly said to parliament that the government would be taking legal action save British seafarers' jobs but he has failed to keep his word,"" he said. Mark Dickinson, general secretary of the Nautilus trade union, said he broadly welcomed the measures announced but that they would not make P&O change course. ""P&O Ferries are already extolling that extending the UK National Minimum Wage to international ferry routes will not cause them to change direction and that their cheap labour agency-based crewing strategy will remain intact."" Ministers have condemned the actions of P&O Ferries in strong terms over the last fortnight. Today's measures are designed to improve wages and protections for seafarers working for all ferry companies operating to and from the UK - not just P&O Ferries. But they show the limits of what the government can actually do in this situation. Sacked workers won't be offered their jobs back, nor will the change to using agency crew be stopped. In an ongoing war of words with Grant Shapps, P&O Ferries' boss insisted reinstating fired workers would lead to the business collapsing. Tomorrow's deadline for staff to respond to their severance offers will be looming large, with many of the measures announced today expected to take some time to come into effect. .

His main points were: This video can not be played Johnson backs more UK nuclear and offshore power supplies Labour's Clive Betts finishes up the session by thanking the prime minister. And it is all over! We will bring you more analysis and reaction from the committee here, so don't go anywhere... Tory MP Mel Stride asks if the government has started looking at cutting expenditure, as a result of inflation and the reduction in the rate of income tax, due to come in in 2024. The PM says there's been ""massive pressure"" on public finances since Covid hit, but ministers took a decision not to return to austerity. The cost of interest on the government's debt is Â£83bn a year and could go up, so it has to be ""very, very careful"" in deciding how much to spend, he adds. Stride says exports and imports have stayed ""very low"" following the pandemic and asks whether the UK is becoming more of a ""closed economy"" because of Brexit. The PM says he doesn't want this to happen and he wants ""much more of an export drive"" and it is a matter of ""will and energy and ambition"". Tory MP Mel Stride, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, says rapidly increasing inflation is higher than the rate of benefit rises, which was decided last year. He asks whether payments could be revisited in a couple of months. Otherwise some people will see 10% reduction in net income, Stride tells the PM. Boris Johnson promises to look into his colleague's suggestion, saying the ""aftershocks"" of the rises in energy prices - which are driving much of the increase in inflation - are difficult to deal with. Many of the government's policies are designed ""to tide people over through a tough time"", he adds. Continuing on the cost of living theme, Catherine McKinnell is back and questioning the figures the PM is using. She says 75% of children living in poverty across the UK are living in working households, and the government's measurement of absolute child poverty is not accurate. The Labour MP points to one of the government's central policies and asks: ""Do you believe it is possible to level up the country without reducing the number of children living in poverty?"" ""No,"" says the PM. Despite disputing her figures, he accepts ""there is an issue we have got to fix"", adding: ""I am not going to pretend it is easy, but we are going to go at it as hard as we can."" So, how many times is child poverty mentioned in the levelling up white paper published by the government? McKinnell reveals it is none. Johnson replies it is an accident ""because the whole objective of levelling up is to make sure kids growing up everywhere have opportunity."" Asked about last week's Spring Statement, the PM says the government is prioritising helping people back into work. But Labour's Stephen Timms says more needs to be done to boost Universal Credit to help those who can't work for health reasons. Boris Johnson responds by saying there is direct support for those facing ""particular hardships"" because of rising inflation, and the ""fundamental route out of poverty"" is getting people into jobs. Labour's Stephen Timms queries the PM's previous statement that there are now more people in work than before the pandemic, asking if he accepts acorrection made last monthby the head of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove. Boris Johnson accepts that it was ""payroll employment"" he was talking about, and that the number has now risen by 600,000, which ""is not half bad"". Timms asks if that number is more than offset by the fall in the number of self-employed people. The PM replies that unemployment had been predicted to hit 12% and this has not happened, adding that the government wants to help more people back into work. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The government's energy strategy - which was expected this week - has been delayed again. There have been reports that tensions over nuclear power have been one factor behind the delay - with reports the Treasury have been reluctant to commit outright to some of the huge costs of nuclear power given some of the targets the strategy is likely to set will fall outside the current Spending Review period. The prime minister has previously said, for example, that he wants 25% of UK power sourced from nuclear by 2050. There have also been tensions in cabinet over wind energy. Some ministers want to loosen planning laws in England to enable more onshore wind farms, but others oppose this. There is, however, pretty widespread support for more offshore wind turbines. When asked about the energy strategy, the prime minister seemed to drop some pretty strong hints about where his preferences lie. He said ""offshore wind - I stress offshore wind - has massive potential"" and added ""so does nuclear"". His message to cabinet colleagues here seems pretty clear, though No10 have also stressed in recent weeks that they want to keep all options on the table to help the UK become more energy independent and move towards net zero and away from Russian oil and gas. Tory Philip Dunne takes up the questioning on the cost of living, focusing on energy prices. He says since we began to emerge from the pandemic, households have faced an ""astonishing increase "" to their bills, exacerbated by Ukraine. But, he asks, will the much talked about - and much delayed - government energy security strategy address that? The PM says the government ""have to provide as much short term relief as you can within fiscal constraints"", pointing to the likes of the council tax rebate on its way, but also the need to look at North Sea oil and gas. ""But we have got to recognise in the UK that we have failed for a generation to put in enough long term supply,"" he adds, calling it a ""colossal mistake"". As well as renewables - and the PM stresses offshore wind specifically, rather than onshore - he wants to focus on nuclear, saying: ""This is the country that split the atom... why aren't we doing it?"" Johnson adds: ""I am not going to pretend we are going to get nuclear reactors on stream in next couple of years, but in the medium and long term, we have got to be looking at big ticket nuclear solutions."" Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News As the conversation shifts from Ukraine onto the cost of living - one area that bridges the two is the soaring costs facing farmers right now. Fertiliser and fuel costs for farmers have risen drastically due to rising gas prices. It's something the industry has warned could lead to shortages, cuts in food production, and a knock-on impact on the cost of food. The Tory MP Neil Parish urged the prime minister to do more to help farmers with fertiliser costs - including reopening a second fertiliser plant in the north of England. The prime minister was loathe to make a solid commitment to doing so without more information to hand - saying he can't just ""wave a massive wand"" but said he would ""jolly well find out what I can do"". This video can not be played Johnson and Wishart on police investigating lockdown parties Questions move on to the rising cost of living. Tory MP Neil Parish says the UK must produce more of its own food to protect consumers from global price increases. Farmers want to do it, he adds, asking what the government can do to help. The PM says he shares Parish's ambition and that investment in agriculture is rising. But young people need to be encouraged into the sector, he argues, adding that his own grandfather was a farmer, albeit ""very unsuccessfully"". Every UK embassy around the world is getting a food and drink export expert, Boris Johnson says. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News While parties have come together in Parliament in recent weeks to express solidarity with Ukraine - the government's refugee scheme has generally attracted the most scrutiny, from Tory and opposition MPs alike. The prime minister faced further questions on why applications for Ukrainian visas have reached 28,300, but only 2,700 have been granted.
He also was asked about safeguarding concerns around Ukrainians being put up in people's homes in the UK. The Tory MP Sir Bill Wiggin also pushed him on ""why can't we get right people through our immigration system instead of the wrong ones."" This is a reference to a criticism that many Tory MPs - including some ministers privately - have levelled at the government around their handling of small boat migrant crossings. The prime minister insisted that officials were processing about 1,000 visas a day for Ukrainians and that it was ""right to have checks both ways"" for Ukrainians coming to the UK - as well as UK families offering to host them. Chair Clive Betts refers back to promises made by the government on the two schemes - families bringing relatives over, and the Homes for Ukraine scheme. He says one committee was told local councils would receive Â£10,500 per refugee, no matter which scheme they come through, to provide services for them. But another select committee was told the funding was only available for people coming via Homes for Ukraine. Which is it? Johnson says it is right that councils will only get funding for refugees offered rooms by strangers, not those reuniting with families. He said they would still be able to access benefits, the NHS and education, which is ""a considerable package of support"". But Betts says councils will be left with lots more people to provide services to ""with not one penny of extra help"". The PM says most Ukrainians want to remain in the region they are from and would like to return home when the conflict ends. Officials dealing with refugees have to balance some difficult objectives, he adds, as ""gangsters"" are attempting to traffic the vulnerable and some people are ""not who they say they are"". Conservative MP Sir Bill Wiggin asks why the UK immigration system can't get ""the right people through, rather than the wrong ones"". Johnson says the system is being kept under constant review and that the government is trying to get more visa applications processed. He adds that he wants to see ""more wonderful Ukrainians coming"" to the UK. The Labour MP then raises Homes for Ukraine - where British citizens offer a home to Ukrainian refugees. She says only one in 100 offers has resulted in a visa being issued. But how many of those have actually arrived in the UK? The PM still doesn't have a number. Dame Diana Johnson tells the story of a heavily pregnant woman who has been matched with a home in the UK, but has been told she has to give birth to her child in temporary accommodation in Poland to get the child a birth certificate, before flying here. ""Is that how scheme should be operating?"" she asks. ""I can't see any reason why she couldn't come here and have the baby here,"" says the PM. Next up is the issue of visas, and Dame Diana Johnson leads the questioning. She asks whether the PM considered going for an emergency humanitarian visa for those fleeing war, rather than the schemes the Home Office has put in place. The PM says ""of course I thought about having a system when we opened the doors"" - but he is interrupted by the Labour MP, who says an emergency visa would still allow checks when people arrived. Johnson says he wanted ""a light tough system"" but one that would also allow the UK to do checks for security. He says have been 25,000 visas approved so far - ""not a bad number"" - and 1,000 visas were being processed a day. ""The number will mount quickly,"" he adds.

MP comes out as trans and speaks of rape ordealJamie Wallis praised for bravery after he opens up about being a victim of rape and blackmail.,"This video can not be played Watch: Johnson and Starmer pay tribute to trans MP Jamie Wallis Politicians have praised a Welsh MP for his bravery after he tweeted he has gender dysphoria and has been a victim of rape and blackmail. Jamie Wallis, who was elected in 2019, is the first MP to come out as trans. The Conservative MP for Bridgend said a man sent pictures to his family and demanded Â£50,000 in 2020. He said he was raped in a separate incident. Mr Wallis wrote that after he was raped ""things have taken a tumble. I am not ok."" The MP confirmed that he fled the scene of a car crash two months after he was raped. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the leader of the opposition Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged Mr Wallis' statement in the Commons. With Mr Wallis looking on from the backbenches, Mr Johnson said: ""the House stands with you and will give you the support you need to live freely as yourself"". Earlier, Tory MP Andrea Leadsom confirmed that Mr Johnson made a ""light-hearted joke"" on Tuesday night about Sir Keir Starmer's decision not to answer whether a woman can have a penis in a debate on trans rights. It was reported that Mr Johnson began a dinner among Tory MPs by saying: ""Good evening ladies and gentleman - or as Keir Starmer would put it, people who are assigned female or male at birth."" Jamie Wallis was at the dinner. SNP MP John Nicholson told BBC Politics Live the joke was ""appallingly bad taste"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Wallis was arrested last year on suspicion of driving while unfit, following an incident where a car hit a lamppost at Church Road in Llanblethian, Vale of Glamorgan. ""When I crashed my car on the 28th November I fled the scene. I did so because I was terrified,"" he wrote. The MP said he suffered with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and ""I honestly have no idea what I was doing except I was overcome by an overwhelming sense of fear"". ""I am sorry that it appears I 'ran away' but this isn't how it happened in the moment,"" he said. South Wales Police said the matter is still under investigation. MP arrested on suspicion of driving while unfit 'I help to rescue other trans people from death' 'When one transgender person is hurt, we all feel it' In the Twitter statement posted early Wednesday morning, Mr Wallis said: ""I've been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and I've felt this way since I was a very young child. ""I had no intention of ever sharing this with you. I always imagined I would leave politics well before I ever said this out loud. ""There was a close call in April 2020 when someone blackmailed me, outed me to my father and sent photographs to other family members. ""He wanted Â£50,000 to keep quiet. The police were so supportive, so understanding and on this occasion the system worked."" The MP said the man pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years and nine months prison. ""For a while it seemed as though I would be able to get on with things and move on. Being an MP and hiding something like this was always going to be tough, but I arrogantly assumed I was up for it. ""Well, I'm not."" He continued: ""In September I 'hooked up' with someone who I met online. ""When I chose to say 'no' on the basis that he wouldn't wear a condom he chose to rape me. I have not been myself since this incident and I don't think I will ever recover. It is not something you ever forget, and it is not something you ever move on from."" Jamie Wallis was elected in 2019 Born in Bridgend Studied chemistry at Oxford University and completed PhD at Cardiff University Was director at data recovery firm Fields Associates Elected in 2019, unseating Labour for the first time in three decades The MP praised Tory party whips: ""As far as I've seen they try their best to support and help MPs who are having a tough time. ""Well they've certainly earned their keep with me."" He said the dinner with Tory MPs on Tuesday evening reminded him ""of the incredible support those you work with can provide"". ""I was reminded how important it is to be yourself. I have never lived my truth and I'm not sure how. Perhaps it starts with telling everyone."" Later he said he was ""overwhelmed by the kindness and support I have received"". ""I am proud to be completely open and honest about the struggles I have had, and continue to have, with my identity. However, I remain the same person I was yesterday. For the time being, I will continue to present as I always have and will use he/him/his pronouns."" Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""Proud of my colleague Jamie Wallis. ""As a Conservative family we stand together, and we will support you. ""I hope that your brave statement will help others."" Mike Freer, the Minister for Equalities, acknowledged the  ""enormously personal"" statement in the Commons.""I hope I speak for the whole house in sending our support, it is so important that people are free and safe to be themselves whoever they are and whoever they love"", he said. Labour MP Wes Streeting said: ""Sending you love and solidarity from the other side of the Commons. This is hugely courageous of you to share."" Plaid Cymru Commons leader Liz Saville Roberts said: ""This is an extraordinarily brave message to send out, Jamie. Whatever our politics, public life is unremitting and often merciless. Great respect for your personal courage."" Former MP and chancellor George Osborne said ""we comment on the things that have got worse in politics, but many things have got better"", tweeting that ""if a Tory MP had said this when I was first elected 20 years ago they would have been hounded not applauded and supported"". The LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall said it was sending ""solidarity"" and ""love"" to Mr Wallis, calling his decision to come out ""brave"". ""It's clear [he] has been through very painful recent experiences, and coming out in the public eye will be liberating, but also profoundly stressful,"" said CEO Nancy Kelley.

Continuing on the cost of living theme, Catherine McKinnell is back and questioning the figures the PM is using. She says 75% of children living in poverty across the UK are living in working households, and the government's measurement of absolute child poverty is not accurate. The Labour MP points to one of the government's central policies and asks: ""Do you believe it is possible to level up the country without reducing the number of children living in poverty?"" ""No,"" says the PM. Despite disputing her figures, he accepts ""there is an issue we have got to fix"", adding: ""I am not going to pretend it is easy, but we are going to go at it as hard as we can."" So, how many times is child poverty mentioned in the levelling up white paper published by the government? McKinnell reveals it is none. Johnson replies it is an accident ""because the whole objective of levelling up is to make sure kids growing up everywhere have opportunity."" Asked about last week's Spring Statement, the PM says the government is prioritising helping people back into work. But Labour's Stephen Timms says more needs to be done to boost Universal Credit to help those who can't work for health reasons. Boris Johnson responds by saying there is direct support for those facing ""particular hardships"" because of rising inflation, and the ""fundamental route out of poverty"" is getting people into jobs. Labour's Stephen Timms queries the PM's previous statement that there are now more people in work than before the pandemic, asking if he accepts acorrection made last monthby the head of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove. Boris Johnson accepts that it was ""payroll employment"" he was talking about, and that the number has now risen by 600,000, which ""is not half bad"". Timms asks if that number is more than offset by the fall in the number of self-employed people. The PM replies that unemployment had been predicted to hit 12% and this has not happened, adding that the government wants to help more people back into work. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The government's energy strategy - which was expected this week - has been delayed again. There have been reports that tensions over nuclear power have been one factor behind the delay - with reports the Treasury have been reluctant to commit outright to some of the huge costs of nuclear power given some of the targets the strategy is likely to set will fall outside the current Spending Review period. The prime minister has previously said, for example, that he wants 25% of UK power sourced from nuclear by 2050. There have also been tensions in cabinet over wind energy. Some ministers want to loosen planning laws in England to enable more onshore wind farms, but others oppose this. There is, however, pretty widespread support for more offshore wind turbines. When asked about the energy strategy, the prime minister seemed to drop some pretty strong hints about where his preferences lie. He said ""offshore wind - I stress offshore wind - has massive potential"" and added ""so does nuclear"". His message to cabinet colleagues here seems pretty clear, though No10 have also stressed in recent weeks that they want to keep all options on the table to help the UK become more energy independent and move towards net zero and away from Russian oil and gas. Tory Philip Dunne takes up the questioning on the cost of living, focusing on energy prices. He says since we began to emerge from the pandemic, households have faced an ""astonishing increase "" to their bills, exacerbated by Ukraine. But, he asks, will the much talked about - and much delayed - government energy security strategy address that? The PM says the government ""have to provide as much short term relief as you can within fiscal constraints"", pointing to the likes of the council tax rebate on its way, but also the need to look at North Sea oil and gas. ""But we have got to recognise in the UK that we have failed for a generation to put in enough long term supply,"" he adds, calling it a ""colossal mistake"". As well as renewables - and the PM stresses offshore wind specifically, rather than onshore - he wants to focus on nuclear, saying: ""This is the country that split the atom... why aren't we doing it?"" Johnson adds: ""I am not going to pretend we are going to get nuclear reactors on stream in next couple of years, but in the medium and long term, we have got to be looking at big ticket nuclear solutions."" Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News As the conversation shifts from Ukraine onto the cost of living - one area that bridges the two is the soaring costs facing farmers right now. Fertiliser and fuel costs for farmers have risen drastically due to rising gas prices. It's something the industry has warned could lead to shortages, cuts in food production, and a knock-on impact on the cost of food. The Tory MP Neil Parish urged the prime minister to do more to help farmers with fertiliser costs - including reopening a second fertiliser plant in the north of England. The prime minister was loathe to make a solid commitment to doing so without more information to hand - saying he can't just ""wave a massive wand"" but said he would ""jolly well find out what I can do"". This video can not be played Johnson and Wishart on police investigating lockdown parties Questions move on to the rising cost of living. Tory MP Neil Parish says the UK must produce more of its own food to protect consumers from global price increases. Farmers want to do it, he adds, asking what the government can do to help. The PM says he shares Parish's ambition and that investment in agriculture is rising. But young people need to be encouraged into the sector, he argues, adding that his own grandfather was a farmer, albeit ""very unsuccessfully"". Every UK embassy around the world is getting a food and drink export expert, Boris Johnson says. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News While parties have come together in Parliament in recent weeks to express solidarity with Ukraine - the government's refugee scheme has generally attracted the most scrutiny, from Tory and opposition MPs alike. The prime minister faced further questions on why applications for Ukrainian visas have reached 28,300, but only 2,700 have been granted.
He also was asked about safeguarding concerns around Ukrainians being put up in people's homes in the UK. The Tory MP Sir Bill Wiggin also pushed him on ""why can't we get right people through our immigration system instead of the wrong ones."" This is a reference to a criticism that many Tory MPs - including some ministers privately - have levelled at the government around their handling of small boat migrant crossings. The prime minister insisted that officials were processing about 1,000 visas a day for Ukrainians and that it was ""right to have checks both ways"" for Ukrainians coming to the UK - as well as UK families offering to host them. Chair Clive Betts refers back to promises made by the government on the two schemes - families bringing relatives over, and the Homes for Ukraine scheme. He says one committee was told local councils would receive Â£10,500 per refugee, no matter which scheme they come through, to provide services for them. But another select committee was told the funding was only available for people coming via Homes for Ukraine. Which is it? Johnson says it is right that councils will only get funding for refugees offered rooms by strangers, not those reuniting with families. He said they would still be able to access benefits, the NHS and education, which is ""a considerable package of support"". But Betts says councils will be left with lots more people to provide services to ""with not one penny of extra help"". The PM says most Ukrainians want to remain in the region they are from and would like to return home when the conflict ends. Officials dealing with refugees have to balance some difficult objectives, he adds, as ""gangsters"" are attempting to traffic the vulnerable and some people are ""not who they say they are"". Conservative MP Sir Bill Wiggin asks why the UK immigration system can't get ""the right people through, rather than the wrong ones"". Johnson says the system is being kept under constant review and that the government is trying to get more visa applications processed. He adds that he wants to see ""more wonderful Ukrainians coming"" to the UK. The Labour MP then raises Homes for Ukraine - where British citizens offer a home to Ukrainian refugees. She says only one in 100 offers has resulted in a visa being issued. But how many of those have actually arrived in the UK? The PM still doesn't have a number. Dame Diana Johnson tells the story of a heavily pregnant woman who has been matched with a home in the UK, but has been told she has to give birth to her child in temporary accommodation in Poland to get the child a birth certificate, before flying here. ""Is that how scheme should be operating?"" she asks. ""I can't see any reason why she couldn't come here and have the baby here,"" says the PM. Next up is the issue of visas, and Dame Diana Johnson leads the questioning. She asks whether the PM considered going for an emergency humanitarian visa for those fleeing war, rather than the schemes the Home Office has put in place. The PM says ""of course I thought about having a system when we opened the doors"" - but he is interrupted by the Labour MP, who says an emergency visa would still allow checks when people arrived. Johnson says he wanted ""a light tough system"" but one that would also allow the UK to do checks for security. He says have been 25,000 visas approved so far - ""not a bad number"" - and 1,000 visas were being processed a day. ""The number will mount quickly,"" he adds.

Also in the running for the comedy entertainment award is The Lateish Show With Mo Gilligan, who tweeted that he""couldn't be happier"".,external Holby City has been nominated for best soap/continuing drama, just a day after the long-running BBC medical drama aired its final episode. It is up against sister soap Casualty, along with Coronation Street and Emmerdale. Awards like the Baftas are always likely to be regarded as a benchmark of exceptional achievement but viewing figures for many ceremonies have been declining over the last decade. It means that organisations are keen to try to ensure that the public still see such awards as relevant to them. A show like Line of Duty neatly illustrates the potential divide. It was 2021's biggest show by a significant margin, but only scored three nominations in technical categories despite more than 14 million viewers watching each episode. And creator Jed Mercurio revealed that the BBC's own audience research showed that more than half of 1000 randomly polled viewers rated the finale nine or 10 out of 10. While it didn't rate as highly as Line of Duty, many will see it as good news that a programme like It's A Sin is the clear nominations leader - it wasn't just a show that was a big hit for Channel Four, it also had a significant social impact. T-shirts featuring the drama's 'La' catchphrase have helped to raise Â£500,000 for the Terrence Higgins Trust. In short, it was seen as an important programme, talked about by millions. How the shortlists are chosen is of course crucial. For the TV Baftas it's specialist juries. For other ceremonies it's the entire voting membership. And for events like the National Television Awards it's a public vote. So in any given year, their differing tastes mean that in any category, being declared the 'best' varies from ceremony to ceremony. So the challenge for all awards bodies is to ensure that their decisions still maintain their credibility and, just as importantly, the interest of their audiences. Two thirds of the nominees in the performance categories have not been nominated before, as Bafta organisers bid to support new talent. Best actress nominee West has stiff competition from Kate Winslet, who has received her first TV Bafta nomination for Mare of Easttown, plus Denise Gough and Emily Watson for ITV's Too Close, Jodie Comer for Channel 4's Help and Niamh Algar for Channel 4's Deceit. Hugh Quarshie (right) is nominated for best actor for playing the father of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence Alongside Years & Years singer Alexander in the leading actor category is David Thewlis for Sky's dark comic crime drama Landscapers, which was the second most-nominated programme with seven nods. However, they don't include an acting nomination for Olivia Colman, who plays Thewlis's wife. Also in the running are Hugh Quarshie for ITV's Stephen, Samuel Adewunmi for BBC's You Don't Know Me, Sean Bean for BBC One's Time and Stephen Graham for Channel 4's Help. The latter, written by Jack Thorne, is about a carer (Comer) who bonds with a patient (Graham) as the care home residents and staff face the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. The critically-acclaimed drama received six nominations in total, as did Jimmy McGovern's prison drama Time, which earned Graham his second nomination of the year for best supporting actor. We Are Lady Parts was among the leading shows in the nominations Channel 4's groundbreaking music comedy We Are Lady Parts also received six nominations, while Netflix's Sex Education had five. The Bafta nominations also include technical categories such as costume design, editing and hair and sound. Those prizes will be handed out at the Bafta Craft awards on 24 April. The winners of the main Bafta TV Awards will be revealed at a ceremony on 8 May. BBC One drama A Very British Scandal scored four nominations including costume design and make-up and hair design, but there were no acting nods for its stars Claire Foy and Paul Bettany. The final series of Line of Duty was nominated for three craft prizes, but there were no acting prizes for the cast or for the show creator Jed Mercurio. Love Island also missed out in the reality and constructed factual category. Channel 4 shows Gogglebox and Dog House will go head-to-head alongside E4's Married at First Sight UK and BBC Three's RuPaul's Drag Race UK.

Nicola Sturgeon at the Duke of Edinburgh memorial service on Tuesday Nicola Sturgeon says she abided by the Covid rules during aservice of thanksgiving for Prince Philipin London. The first minister was pictured during the event without wearing a face covering. Tory MSP Murdo Fraser asks Ms Sturgeon why this was the case and she insists she ""abided by the rules in place there"". She adds, ""I abide by the rules and I know that is something the Conservatives struggle to understand."" Alex Cole-Hamilton is also concerned about the lack of detail on the removal of access to free lateral flow tests. He calls on the FM to guarantee that all carers, NHS staff, care home staff and visitors have free access to LFTs. The Scottish Lib Dem leader explains thousands of people continue to use LFTs and the new cost ""is nothing short of a visit your gran tax"". The first minister says her government is still supporting testing in ways currently not the case in the UK. She says it will continue to ""support appropriate and targeted use of testing"". ""Where we are advising people to take tests, we will not expect anyone to pay for these tests."" Nicola
Sturgeon says protecting the most vulnerable people from Covid remains a key
priority. The first
minister says offering additional booster jabs has played an important part in this but so have anti-viral drugs, promising âspeedy access for those eligible for themâ. On the
Argyll and Bute booster jab issue, Ms Sturgeon says offering appointments so far away had been an error and
was being rectified and argues that it should not diminish the wider successes
of the vaccination programme. What happens
to people who are immunocompromised, is the focus of Jackie Baillieâs questions. The Scottish
Labour health spokeswoman says the thousands of vulnerable people who were forced to shield during lockdown should be âafforded assurance of what will happen to themâ with regards to testing and anti-viral drugs. Ms Baillie
also raises the issue of people in Argyll and Bute being offered booster jab
appointments up to 100 miles away from their homes. The first minister says it is ""inconsistent"" of Mr Ross to express concern about the pressure on the NHS, while bemoaning the ""very limited protective measures"" that remain in place. Ms Sturgeon says the government has set out in recent weeks investment in the NHS to help ease the pressure it is under. Getting Covid case levels down will help the NHS, says Ms Sturgeon, who adds: ""It is important that we take a cautious approach through this."" Douglas Ross begins by reminding Ms Sturgeon thatthis week saw the worst A&E waiting times on record. The Scottish Conservative leader also highlights cancer treatment waiting times. Mr Ross asks the government to set out the action the government will take now to address these ""failings"" On the issue of Covid, he points out that Scotland has the the highest level of infections in the UK. ""The first minister's strategy is clearly failing,"" he says. He criticises the continuation of face mask rules, arguing it should be down to the public's choice. Mr Ross asks if face masks will be removed completely from schools, while also seeking a guarantee that there will be no further delays. Nicola Sturgeon says phasing out the legal requirements ""strikes a sensible balance"" between getting rid of restrictions and the need for caution given the latest wave of infections. The first minister says she recognises ""face coverings are an inconvenience"" but believes a further two weeks is a ""proportionate
precautionary measure while we pass the peak of this latest wave"". Ms Sturgeon adds it is important people remember that Covid has not gone away. A phased approach to getting rid of the legal obligation to wear face masks is to begin, Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister says the legal requirement should be replaced with guidance. This will begin on 4 April when it will no longer be a legal requirement to wear a face
covering in places of worship or while attending a wedding or funeral. Then on 18 April the legal requirement will be dropped from shops, public transport and other indoor settings. Nicola Sturgeon confirms Scotland's last remaining Covid regulations - over the wearing of face coverings - will be lifted but not until 18 April. From
next Monday 4 April, it will no longer be a legal requirement to wear a face
covering in places of worship or while attending a marriage ceremony, a civil
partnership registration, or a funeral. Then the wider legal requirement applying to shops, certain other indoor settings
and public transport will be converted to guidance two weeks later on 18 April. Nicola Sturgeon tells the chamber: ""Despite
the effectiveness of vaccination, the high level of infection has put the NHS
under even more severe strain"", not least in A&Es.  The first minister gets to her feet and, as ever, begins with the latest Covid statistics. It is currently a legal requirement to wear face masks on public transport and other public settings Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, a leading infections expert at University of Edinburgh, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandmasks should still be worn in high-risk environments such as public transport and healthcare settings but legal enforcement should be dropped. She said cases in the wave of the Omicron sub-variant affecting Scotland had dropped off quickly in Germany and the Netherlands, despite them removing legal mask requirements. ""We are getting much less protection especially of the BA.2 subvariant because we need to inhale much fewer virus particles than we used to,"" Dr Tait-Burkard said. ""The surgical and cotton masks just allow for a little more of the virus to get through. They are still very good for people who are lower risk - they stop them shedding a lot of virus into the environment. ""For people who are more vulnerable, it is probably the moment to increase to an FFP3 mask just until the pressure in the environment from so many people infected actually decreases."" She advised more vulnerable people to ""evaluate your personal risk"" when going to high risk areas where there are lots of people and little ventilation. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Scotland's cabinet met yesterday to decide if the rules on wearing masks should be lifted. It's the last remaining legal Covid restriction. Case numbers are now starting to dip - although the number of Covid patients in hospital has reached a record high. The legal requirement to wear face coverings on public transport and indoor settings should have been lifted on the 21st of March. However, Nicola Sturgeon said it would be ""prudent"" to retain it for longer, given the spike in cases. The Scottish Conservatives have criticised what they called a ""wait-and-see approach"". The cabinet will have decided whether to dispense with the final Covid restrictions in Scotland on Monday 4 April. Given that cases are falling, it might be surprising if the mask mandate is in place for longer. The decision is being announced in parliament today rather than yesterday - as the First Minister was in London for the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service. Face mask rules are expected to be converted to guidance from 4 April Three weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeonconfirmed that Scotland's rules on face coverings would remain in place until April, due to a rise in Covid cases. All other restrictions on businesses and services moved from legal requirement to guidance on 21 March. The rules on masks were reviewed again on 29 March, and are expected to be converted to guidance by 4 April. At the moment,masks must be worn,externalin most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising). They are mandatory in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, as well as in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. They no longer have to be worn bysecondary school students in the classroom- but are still required in ""indoor communal areas"" like corridors. Under-12s are exempt. Nicola Sturgeon will begin her update at 2pm this afternoon Good afternoon and welcome to BBC Scotland's live coverage of the first minister's coronavirus update. Nicola Sturgeon is expected to reveal if the face mask rules will be lifted. The first minister will update MSPs on whether the requirement to wear masks in shops and on public transport will end as planned on 4 April. All of Scotland's other Covid-19 rules have now been converted into guidance. But ministers decided to keep the rule on face coverings for an extra few weeks due to a spike in new cases.

End of Scottish face mask law delayed until EasterThe legal requirement to wear face coverings in shops and on public transport will remain until 18 April.,"Scotland's mandatory face covering rules will now remain in force until 18 April, Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The legal requirement to wear masks in shops and on public transport had been expected to be lifted next week. But the first minister told MSPs that the changes would now not take effect until 18 April. She said this was due to there still being a very high level of infection in Scotland, and because masks provide extra protection. However, the requirement to wear a face covering in places of worship and while attending marriage and funeral services will end on 4 April. Ms Sturgeon said this phased approach struck a ""sensible balance between our desire to remove this one remaining legal measure and the common sense need for continued caution"". Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid plans Case numbers have hit record levels in Scotland in recent weeks, with one in 11 people estimated to have had the virus in the week to 20 March. Both Deputy First Minister John Swinney and Justice Secretary Keith Browntested positive on Wednesday morning, just hours before Ms Sturgeon made her announcement. Ms Sturgeon said the daily figures remained high but were ""perhaps stabilising"", with a 15% fall from about 12,000 cases to 10,200 over the past week. She said there was therefore ""grounds for optimism that this latest wave of infection may now have peaked"". However she said the high levels of infection and the pressure it was placing on the NHS meant the planned lifting of the law on face coverings would be delayed until 18 April. She told MSPs that this would be a ""proportionate precautionary measure while we pass the peak of this latest wave"". This is the second time the first minister has delayed lifting the face mask laws, which had originally been due to be removed on 21 March. All of Scotland's other legal restrictions have already been phased out. Ms Sturgeon said a delay was needed until Scotland passed the peak of the latest wave Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, a leading infections expert at University of Edinburgh, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandthat cotton masks offered ""much less protection"" from the BA.2 subvariant because far fewer virus particles needed to be inhaled to catch it. She said: ""The surgical and cotton masks just allow for a little more of the virus to get through. They are still very good for people who are lower risk - they stop them shedding a lot of virus into the environment. ""For people who are more vulnerable it is probably the moment to increase to an FFP2 mask just until the pressure in the environment from so many people infected actually decreases."" Dr Tait-Burkard said she did not believe legal enforcement of face masks was needed any more, and that recommending people wear them in high risk environments was the right thing to do. The mask laws will now be phased out, with the requirement to wear them in places of worship and at services to be dropped on 4 April. Ms Sturgeon was pictured without a mask at a memorial service for Prince Philip on Tuesday, but insisted that she wore one on the train and ""abided by the rules"" while in England. The Scottish Licensed Trade Association said it would have set a better example for the first minister to wear a face covering, adding that it was ""bitterly disappointing"" the changes had been delayed in Scotland. Managing director Colin Wilkinson said the pause would ultimately make little difference as ""the lack of use of face coverings is already clearly evident in many settings"". And the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the ""prolonging of Covid-19 rules"" might make Scotland a less attractive tourist destination. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Scotland's case rate being higher than other parts of the UK showed that the first minister's ""strategy is clearly failing"". He said: ""She is keeping restrictions in place here in Scotland weeks after they have been removed elsewhere. ""We believe that anyone who wants to keep wearing a face mask should do so, but it should be down to individual choice as it is in other parts of the UK. ""We should leave it up to people and businesses to decide what is best for them based on public health advice - Nicola Sturgeon has to start trusting the people of Scotland."" Ms Sturgeon accused the Tory leader of being ""seriously out of step with the vast majority of people"". She said: ""Particularly in public places where people don't always have a choice about being, people have to go to shops and therefore if we all wear face coverings in shops right now we help protect each other. ""For a couple of weeks more while we see this wave of infection peak and start to fall I think that is a sensible thing to do."" The testing system is also being wound down in Scotland, with the population-wide contact tracing system to be shut down by the end of April. Scottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said infection levels were concerning, calling for more details about future support and testing for vulnerable people. She said: ""While life is returning to near normality for many, that is not the case for those who are immunocompromised and the 180,000 who were on the shielding list."" Ms Sturgeon said vulnerable people were being offered extra booster jabs, and that testing would continue to be used in a targeted way to support them.

LiveLiveLegal mask rule in Scotland ends by mid-AprilLess than a minute ago,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon explains that the phasing out of mandatory face coverings will take place in the first half of next month Masks in public places like shops and on public transport have been in place for longer than anticipated due to the high number of cases On 4 April they will not be required in places of worship and from 18 April they will not be legally enforceable in shops and on public transport However, Ms Sturgeon said the wearing of face coverings would become a matter of guidance and people would be encouraged to use them ""in certain indoor places"" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross criticises delaying lifting the masks requirement, adding that the FM should trust the public Cases in Scotland's hospitals have also been rising, with 2.344 patients recently testing positive Two members of Nicola Sturgeon's cabinet - John Swinney and Keith Brown - were absent from the parliament on Wednesday after testing for Covid BBC Scotland News Allow Twitter content?

Nicola Sturgeon at the Duke of Edinburgh memorial service on Tuesday Nicola Sturgeon says she abided by the Covid rules during aservice of thanksgiving for Prince Philipin London. The first minister was pictured during the event without wearing a face covering. Tory MSP Murdo Fraser asks Ms Sturgeon why this was the case and she insists she ""abided by the rules in place there"". She adds, ""I abide by the rules and I know that is something the Conservatives struggle to understand."" Alex Cole-Hamilton is also concerned about the lack of detail on the removal of access to free lateral flow tests. He calls on the FM to guarantee that all carers, NHS staff, care home staff and visitors have free access to LFTs. The Scottish Lib Dem leader explains thousands of people continue to use LFTs and the new cost ""is nothing short of a visit your gran tax"". The first minister says her government is still supporting testing in ways currently not the case in the UK. She says it will continue to ""support appropriate and targeted use of testing"". ""Where we are advising people to take tests, we will not expect anyone to pay for these tests."" Nicola
Sturgeon says protecting the most vulnerable people from Covid remains a key
priority. The first
minister says offering additional booster jabs has played an important part in this but so have anti-viral drugs, promising âspeedy access for those eligible for themâ. On the
Argyll and Bute booster jab issue, Ms Sturgeon says offering appointments so far away had been an error and
was being rectified and argues that it should not diminish the wider successes
of the vaccination programme. What happens
to people who are immunocompromised, is the focus of Jackie Baillieâs questions. The Scottish
Labour health spokeswoman says the thousands of vulnerable people who were forced to shield during lockdown should be âafforded assurance of what will happen to themâ with regards to testing and anti-viral drugs. Ms Baillie
also raises the issue of people in Argyll and Bute being offered booster jab
appointments up to 100 miles away from their homes. The first minister says it is ""inconsistent"" of Mr Ross to express concern about the pressure on the NHS, while bemoaning the ""very limited protective measures"" that remain in place. Ms Sturgeon says the government has set out in recent weeks investment in the NHS to help ease the pressure it is under. Getting Covid case levels down will help the NHS, says Ms Sturgeon, who adds: ""It is important that we take a cautious approach through this."" Douglas Ross begins by reminding Ms Sturgeon thatthis week saw the worst A&E waiting times on record. The Scottish Conservative leader also highlights cancer treatment waiting times. Mr Ross asks the government to set out the action the government will take now to address these ""failings"" On the issue of Covid, he points out that Scotland has the the highest level of infections in the UK. ""The first minister's strategy is clearly failing,"" he says. He criticises the continuation of face mask rules, arguing it should be down to the public's choice. Mr Ross asks if face masks will be removed completely from schools, while also seeking a guarantee that there will be no further delays. Nicola Sturgeon says phasing out the legal requirements ""strikes a sensible balance"" between getting rid of restrictions and the need for caution given the latest wave of infections. The first minister says she recognises ""face coverings are an inconvenience"" but believes a further two weeks is a ""proportionate
precautionary measure while we pass the peak of this latest wave"". Ms Sturgeon adds it is important people remember that Covid has not gone away. A phased approach to getting rid of the legal obligation to wear face masks is to begin, Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister says the legal requirement should be replaced with guidance. This will begin on 4 April when it will no longer be a legal requirement to wear a face
covering in places of worship or while attending a wedding or funeral. Then on 18 April the legal requirement will be dropped from shops, public transport and other indoor settings. Nicola Sturgeon confirms Scotland's last remaining Covid regulations - over the wearing of face coverings - will be lifted but not until 18 April. From
next Monday 4 April, it will no longer be a legal requirement to wear a face
covering in places of worship or while attending a marriage ceremony, a civil
partnership registration, or a funeral. Then the wider legal requirement applying to shops, certain other indoor settings
and public transport will be converted to guidance two weeks later on 18 April. Nicola Sturgeon tells the chamber: ""Despite
the effectiveness of vaccination, the high level of infection has put the NHS
under even more severe strain"", not least in A&Es.  The first minister gets to her feet and, as ever, begins with the latest Covid statistics. It is currently a legal requirement to wear face masks on public transport and other public settings Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, a leading infections expert at University of Edinburgh, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandmasks should still be worn in high-risk environments such as public transport and healthcare settings but legal enforcement should be dropped. She said cases in the wave of the Omicron sub-variant affecting Scotland had dropped off quickly in Germany and the Netherlands, despite them removing legal mask requirements. ""We are getting much less protection especially of the BA.2 subvariant because we need to inhale much fewer virus particles than we used to,"" Dr Tait-Burkard said. ""The surgical and cotton masks just allow for a little more of the virus to get through. They are still very good for people who are lower risk - they stop them shedding a lot of virus into the environment. ""For people who are more vulnerable, it is probably the moment to increase to an FFP3 mask just until the pressure in the environment from so many people infected actually decreases."" She advised more vulnerable people to ""evaluate your personal risk"" when going to high risk areas where there are lots of people and little ventilation. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Scotland's cabinet met yesterday to decide if the rules on wearing masks should be lifted. It's the last remaining legal Covid restriction. Case numbers are now starting to dip - although the number of Covid patients in hospital has reached a record high. The legal requirement to wear face coverings on public transport and indoor settings should have been lifted on the 21st of March. However, Nicola Sturgeon said it would be ""prudent"" to retain it for longer, given the spike in cases. The Scottish Conservatives have criticised what they called a ""wait-and-see approach"". The cabinet will have decided whether to dispense with the final Covid restrictions in Scotland on Monday 4 April. Given that cases are falling, it might be surprising if the mask mandate is in place for longer. The decision is being announced in parliament today rather than yesterday - as the First Minister was in London for the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service. Face mask rules are expected to be converted to guidance from 4 April Three weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeonconfirmed that Scotland's rules on face coverings would remain in place until April, due to a rise in Covid cases. All other restrictions on businesses and services moved from legal requirement to guidance on 21 March. The rules on masks were reviewed again on 29 March, and are expected to be converted to guidance by 4 April. At the moment,masks must be worn,externalin most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising). They are mandatory in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, as well as in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. They no longer have to be worn bysecondary school students in the classroom- but are still required in ""indoor communal areas"" like corridors. Under-12s are exempt. Nicola Sturgeon will begin her update at 2pm this afternoon Good afternoon and welcome to BBC Scotland's live coverage of the first minister's coronavirus update. Nicola Sturgeon is expected to reveal if the face mask rules will be lifted. The first minister will update MSPs on whether the requirement to wear masks in shops and on public transport will end as planned on 4 April. All of Scotland's other Covid-19 rules have now been converted into guidance. But ministers decided to keep the rule on face coverings for an extra few weeks due to a spike in new cases.

Panic buying in divided Shanghai under lockdown,"Lockdown restrictions in Shanghai have resulted in residents thronging supermarkets to stock up on essential supplies. Shanghai's Covid lockdown has left thousands scrambling to stock up on supplies, while others quarantine in their offices to keep business running. After weeks of isolated compound lockdowns, the city of 25 million has been split into two. Earlier this week those living in Shanghai's eastern half were told to stay home, with the western half due to enter a lockdown on Friday. The move comes as the city battles a surge in Omicron Covid cases. The city has reported more than 20,000 Covid-19 infections including asymptomatic cases since 1 March, registering more cases in four weeks than in the previous two years of the pandemic. China's zero-Covid strategy has been increasingly challenged by the highly infectious Omicron variant. Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on? The economic cost of China's zero-Covid policy Why China is locking down its cities Officials in China's cosmopolitan financial capital had earlier attempted to keep the city running by limiting lockdowns to select neighbourhoods or buildings. But on Sunday authorities announced a mass lockdown that saw the city being split along the Huangpu River. Residents living in the Pudong area, on the river's eastern bank, were told to stay at home for four days starting on Monday. Puxi, on the western bank, will enter lockdown on Friday. Mass testing is also being carried out to screen all of Shanghai's residents for the virus. Earlier this week, rumours circulating that authorities would bring forward Puxi's lockdown by several days or prolong the city's quarantine period reached a fever pitch, resulting in residents thronging supermarkets. Authorities on Tuesday sought to quash the speculation with a statement calling it ""pure rumours"". But several residents living in western districts received notice on Tuesday from their housing committees that they would be stopped from leaving their compounds for the next seven days, reported Reuters. Stacks of empty shelves in a supermarket aisle in Puxi, Shanghai BBC staff in the city tell us more: From Puxi:""On Monday, as I cycled through the central districts of Huangpu, Jing'an and Xuhui, the streets were packed with people stocking up on essentials. The queues I saw at supermarkets and wet markets stretched out the door and down the street with some only letting in a limited number of customers in at a time. ""At a busy wet market on a side street, a butcher pulled out a fresh slab of pork. Customers crowded around him pointing and calling out to get a cut. ""On Tuesday some of the same streets felt much quieter. Xintiandi, a key shopping area, was unusually quiet. Shops including Apple, Coach, and Starbucks were open, but had been deserted by customers."" From Puxi:""My compound had already gone into lockdown a few weeks ago. Some neighbours fear losing jobs over long absence, some say they are suffering depression over long isolation. ""Our days are filled with chaotic Covid testing and hectic online shopping. I've set an alarm to wake up at 6am every day so that I can make an online order for fresh food, as sometimes orders get cancelled because items are out of stock or there aren't any available delivery drivers. ""There is a lot of waiting, and little answers."" From Pudong:""What time will the next test be? Are we allowed to walk around outside? Have you checked the food app to see if we can get a delivery order through? The main questions of the day. ""For the last few days we haven't been able to go past the end of our road. A neighbour put some big bottles of fresh water out front yesterday, for people to come and take. Someone else organised a group buy of vegetables and eggs. ""We're all wondering if it's really possible to test, analyse and then sweep up the Covid carriers among almost 25 million people in a matter of days, then simply open up again. We're preparing for weeks of this."" Ahead of Monday's lockdown, more than 20,000 financial services staff were summoned back to their offices in the financial Lujiazui district and ordered to spend the rest of the lockdown there in an attempt to keep business operations running smoothly, according to officials. Several companies prepared sleeping bags and basic supplies for overnight stays. ""The stock market won't stop opening just because of the virus,"" one worker told The Global Times. Others have been forced to hunker down in more unusual locations. One woman's account went viral when a lockdown in her community was announced on 11 March while she was at the gym. For four days, she was among dozens of people who had to quarantine at the fitness centre, sleeping on yoga mats and quilts provided by staff and eating food delivered to the gym. The woman told news outlet The Paper that she spent the whole period exercising, and left the gym about 3lb (1.5kg) lighter. Her experience echoed a widely-reported case earlier this month where a woman in Zhengzhou had toquarantine for several days at a hot pot restaurant.,external But the restrictions have also led to some frayed nerves. Widely-circulated videos this week showed a rare public protest at one compound in Shanghai. Residents had complained of low food supplies after being stuck indoors for nearly a month. Some have also taken to social media platform Weibo asking for help as they were not able to get medicine or treatment due to the lockdown. Those diagnosed with Covid have been sent to live in warehouses and exhibition halls converted into mass quarantine centres, even if they are asymptomatic, and some have complained about the basic living conditions. One journalist quarantining at the World Expo centre said they had Portaloos for toilets and no shower facilities. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

LiveLiveJohnson defends cost of living measures6 minutes ago,"Boris Johnson has faced questions from senior MPs at the Liaison Committee The PM condemned President Putin's ruthlessness and said he wanted to increase assistance to Ukraine Questioned about the cost of living, he said the route out of poverty was through work and promised to look at benefit payments Initial questions honed in on partygate, after the Met revealed it had issued 20 fixed penalty notices so far for lockdown-breaking parties in and around Downing Street Police will not reveal the names of those fined, but No 10 has promised to confirm if the PM receives one At last week's Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak announced a rise in the wage threshold where people start paying National Insurance, a 5p cut to fuel duty and promised future tax cuts Critics say the economic plan did not do enough to help those hardest hit by rising prices, especially energy and food Edited by Georgina Pattinson, Jennifer Scott and Justin Parkinson That concludes our coverage of today's events in Parliament - from PMQs to the Liaison Committee, the PM has faced questions on Ukraine, the cost of living and partygate. Join us again soon. The PM was questioned at length about the Ukraine crisis. His main points were: This video can not be played Johnson backs more UK nuclear and offshore power supplies Labour's Clive Betts finishes up the session by thanking the prime minister. And it is all over! We will bring you more analysis and reaction from the committee here, so don't go anywhere... Tory MP Mel Stride asks if the government has started looking at cutting expenditure, as a result of inflation and the reduction in the rate of income tax, due to come in in 2024. The PM says there's been ""massive pressure"" on public finances since Covid hit, but ministers took a decision not to return to austerity. The cost of interest on the government's debt is Â£83bn a year and could go up, so it has to be ""very, very careful"" in deciding how much to spend, he adds. Stride says exports and imports have stayed ""very low"" following the pandemic and asks whether the UK is becoming more of a ""closed economy"" because of Brexit. The PM says he doesn't want this to happen and he wants ""much more of an export drive"" and it is a matter of ""will and energy and ambition"". Tory MP Mel Stride, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, says rapidly increasing inflation is higher than the rate of benefit rises, which was decided last year. He asks whether payments could be revisited in a couple of months. Otherwise some people will see 10% reduction in net income, Stride tells the PM. Boris Johnson promises to look into his colleague's suggestion, saying the ""aftershocks"" of the rises in energy prices - which are driving much of the increase in inflation - are difficult to deal with. Many of the government's policies are designed ""to tide people over through a tough time"", he adds. Continuing on the cost of living theme, Catherine McKinnell is back and questioning the figures the PM is using. She says 75% of children living in poverty across the UK are living in working households, and the government's measurement of absolute child poverty is not accurate. The Labour MP points to one of the government's central policies and asks: ""Do you believe it is possible to level up the country without reducing the number of children living in poverty?"" ""No,"" says the PM. Despite disputing her figures, he accepts ""there is an issue we have got to fix"", adding: ""I am not going to pretend it is easy, but we are going to go at it as hard as we can."" So, how many times is child poverty mentioned in the levelling up white paper published by the government? McKinnell reveals it is none. Johnson replies it is an accident ""because the whole objective of levelling up is to make sure kids growing up everywhere have opportunity."" Asked about last week's Spring Statement, the PM says the government is prioritising helping people back into work. But Labour's Stephen Timms says more needs to be done to boost Universal Credit to help those who can't work for health reasons. Boris Johnson responds by saying there is direct support for those facing ""particular hardships"" because of rising inflation, and the ""fundamental route out of poverty"" is getting people into jobs. Labour's Stephen Timms queries the PM's previous statement that there are now more people in work than before the pandemic, asking if he accepts acorrection made last monthby the head of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove. Boris Johnson accepts that it was ""payroll employment"" he was talking about, and that the number has now risen by 600,000, which ""is not half bad"". Timms asks if that number is more than offset by the fall in the number of self-employed people. The PM replies that unemployment had been predicted to hit 12% and this has not happened, adding that the government wants to help more people back into work. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The government's energy strategy - which was expected this week - has been delayed again. There have been reports that tensions over nuclear power have been one factor behind the delay - with reports the Treasury have been reluctant to commit outright to some of the huge costs of nuclear power given some of the targets the strategy is likely to set will fall outside the current Spending Review period. The prime minister has previously said, for example, that he wants 25% of UK power sourced from nuclear by 2050. There have also been tensions in cabinet over wind energy. Some ministers want to loosen planning laws in England to enable more onshore wind farms, but others oppose this. There is, however, pretty widespread support for more offshore wind turbines. When asked about the energy strategy, the prime minister seemed to drop some pretty strong hints about where his preferences lie. He said ""offshore wind - I stress offshore wind - has massive potential"" and added ""so does nuclear"". His message to cabinet colleagues here seems pretty clear, though No10 have also stressed in recent weeks that they want to keep all options on the table to help the UK become more energy independent and move towards net zero and away from Russian oil and gas. Tory Philip Dunne takes up the questioning on the cost of living, focusing on energy prices. He says since we began to emerge from the pandemic, households have faced an ""astonishing increase "" to their bills, exacerbated by Ukraine. But, he asks, will the much talked about - and much delayed - government energy security strategy address that? The PM says the government ""have to provide as much short term relief as you can within fiscal constraints"", pointing to the likes of the council tax rebate on its way, but also the need to look at North Sea oil and gas. ""But we have got to recognise in the UK that we have failed for a generation to put in enough long term supply,"" he adds, calling it a ""colossal mistake"". As well as renewables - and the PM stresses offshore wind specifically, rather than onshore - he wants to focus on nuclear, saying: ""This is the country that split the atom... why aren't we doing it?"" Johnson adds: ""I am not going to pretend we are going to get nuclear reactors on stream in next couple of years, but in the medium and long term, we have got to be looking at big ticket nuclear solutions."" Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News As the conversation shifts from Ukraine onto the cost of living - one area that bridges the two is the soaring costs facing farmers right now. Fertiliser and fuel costs for farmers have risen drastically due to rising gas prices. It's something the industry has warned could lead to shortages, cuts in food production, and a knock-on impact on the cost of food. The Tory MP Neil Parish urged the prime minister to do more to help farmers with fertiliser costs - including reopening a second fertiliser plant in the north of England. The prime minister was loathe to make a solid commitment to doing so without more information to hand - saying he can't just ""wave a massive wand"" but said he would ""jolly well find out what I can do"". This video can not be played Johnson and Wishart on police investigating lockdown parties Questions move on to the rising cost of living. Tory MP Neil Parish says the UK must produce more of its own food to protect consumers from global price increases. Farmers want to do it, he adds, asking what the government can do to help. The PM says he shares Parish's ambition and that investment in agriculture is rising. But young people need to be encouraged into the sector, he argues, adding that his own grandfather was a farmer, albeit ""very unsuccessfully"". Every UK embassy around the world is getting a food and drink export expert, Boris Johnson says. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News While parties have come together in Parliament in recent weeks to express solidarity with Ukraine - the government's refugee scheme has generally attracted the most scrutiny, from Tory and opposition MPs alike. The prime minister faced further questions on why applications for Ukrainian visas have reached 28,300, but only 2,700 have been granted.
He also was asked about safeguarding concerns around Ukrainians being put up in people's homes in the UK. The Tory MP Sir Bill Wiggin also pushed him on ""why can't we get right people through our immigration system instead of the wrong ones."" This is a reference to a criticism that many Tory MPs - including some ministers privately - have levelled at the government around their handling of small boat migrant crossings. The prime minister insisted that officials were processing about 1,000 visas a day for Ukrainians and that it was ""right to have checks both ways"" for Ukrainians coming to the UK - as well as UK families offering to host them. Chair Clive Betts refers back to promises made by the government on the two schemes - families bringing relatives over, and the Homes for Ukraine scheme. He says one committee was told local councils would receive Â£10,500 per refugee, no matter which scheme they come through, to provide services for them. But another select committee was told the funding was only available for people coming via Homes for Ukraine. Which is it? Johnson says it is right that councils will only get funding for refugees offered rooms by strangers, not those reuniting with families. He said they would still be able to access benefits, the NHS and education, which is ""a considerable package of support"". But Betts says councils will be left with lots more people to provide services to ""with not one penny of extra help"". The PM says most Ukrainians want to remain in the region they are from and would like to return home when the conflict ends. Officials dealing with refugees have to balance some difficult objectives, he adds, as ""gangsters"" are attempting to traffic the vulnerable and some people are ""not who they say they are"". Conservative MP Sir Bill Wiggin asks why the UK immigration system can't get ""the right people through, rather than the wrong ones"". Johnson says the system is being kept under constant review and that the government is trying to get more visa applications processed. He adds that he wants to see ""more wonderful Ukrainians coming"" to the UK. The Labour MP then raises Homes for Ukraine - where British citizens offer a home to Ukrainian refugees. She says only one in 100 offers has resulted in a visa being issued. But how many of those have actually arrived in the UK? The PM still doesn't have a number. Dame Diana Johnson tells the story of a heavily pregnant woman who has been matched with a home in the UK, but has been told she has to give birth to her child in temporary accommodation in Poland to get the child a birth certificate, before flying here. ""Is that how scheme should be operating?"" she asks. ""I can't see any reason why she couldn't come here and have the baby here,"" says the PM. Next up is the issue of visas, and Dame Diana Johnson leads the questioning. She asks whether the PM considered going for an emergency humanitarian visa for those fleeing war, rather than the schemes the Home Office has put in place. The PM says ""of course I thought about having a system when we opened the doors"" - but he is interrupted by the Labour MP, who says an emergency visa would still allow checks when people arrived. Johnson says he wanted ""a light tough system"" but one that would also allow the UK to do checks for security. He says have been 25,000 visas approved so far - ""not a bad number"" - and 1,000 visas were being processed a day. ""The number will mount quickly,"" he adds.

Wind and solar now supply 10% of world electricity,"Wind and solar installations grew at pace in 2021 Wind and solar generated 10% of global electricity for the first time in 2021, a new analysis shows. Fifty countries get more than a tenth of their power from wind and solar sources, according toresearch from Ember,external, a climate and energy think tank. As the world's economies rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, demand for energy soared. Demand for electricity grew at a record pace. This saw a surge in coal power, rising at the fastest rate since 1985. Heatwaves redefined in England over climate change UK's rainfall records rescued by volunteer army Pressure grows for global deal to save nature The research shows the growth in the need for electricity last year was the equivalent of adding a new India to the world's grid. Wind turbine blades being made ready for export from China Solar and wind and other clean sources generated 38% of the world's electricity in 2021. For the first time wind turbines and solar panels generated 10% of the total. The share coming from wind and sun has doubled since 2015, when the Paris climate agreement was signed. The fastest switching to wind and solar took place in the Netherlands, Australia, and Vietnam. All three have moved a tenth of their electricity demand from fossil fuels to green sources in the last two years. ""The Netherlands is a great example of a more northern latitude country proving that it's not just where the Sun shines, it's also about having the right policy environment that makes the big difference in whether solar takes off,"" said Hannah Broadbent from Ember. Vietnam also saw spectacular growth, particularly in solar which rose by over 300% in just one year. ""In the case of Vietnam, there was a massive step up in solar generation and it was driven by feed-in tariffs - money the government pays you for generating electricity - which made it very attractive for households and for utilities to be deploying large amounts of solar,"" said Dave Jones, Ember's global lead. ""What we saw with that was a massive step up in solar generation last year, which didn't just meet increased electricity demand, but it also led to a fall in both coal and gas generation."" Despite the growth and the fact that some countries like Denmark now get more than 50% of their electricity from wind and solar, coal power also saw a remarkable rise in 2021. Coal saw a resurgence in 2021 as the price of other energy sources rose rapidly A large majority of the increased demand for electricity in 2021 was met by fossil fuels with coal fired electricity rising by 9%, the fastest rate since 1985. Much of the rise in coal use was in Asian countries including China and India - but the increase in coal was not matched by gas use which increased globally by only 1%, indicating that rising prices for gas have made coal a more viable source of electricity. ""The last year has seen some really super high gas prices, where coal became cheaper than gas,"" said Dave Jones. ""What we're seeing right now is gas prices across Europe and across much of Asia being 10 times more expensive than they were this time last year, where coal is three times more expensive. He called the price rises for both gas and coal: ""a double reason for electricity systems to demand more clean electricity, because the economics have shifted so fundamentally."" The researchers say that despite the coal resurgence in 2021, major economies including the US, UK, Germany, and Canada are aiming to shift their grids to 100% carbon free electricity within the next 15 years. This switch is being driven by concerns over keeping the rise in the world's temperature under 1.5C this century. To do that, scientists say that wind and solar need to grow at around 20% every year up to 2030. The authors of this latest analysis say this is now ""eminently possible"". The war in Ukraine could also give a push to electricity sources that don't depend on Russian imports of oil and gas. ""Wind and solar have arrived, and they offer a solution out of the multiple crises that the world is facing, whether it's a climate crisis, or the dependence on fossil fuels, this could be a real turning point,"" said Hannah Broadbent.

LiveLiveJohnson faces MPs after first partygate finesLess than a minute ago,"Boris Johnson has faced questions from senior MPs at the Liaison Committee The PM condemned President Putin's ruthlessness and said he wanted to increase assistance to Ukraine Questioned about the cost of living, he said the route out of poverty was through work and promised to look at benefit payments Initial questions honed in on partygate, after the Met revealed it had issued 20 fixed penalty notices so far for lockdown-breaking parties in and around Downing Street Police will not reveal the names of those fined, but No 10 has promised to confirm if the PM receives one At last week's Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak announced a rise in the wage threshold where people start paying National Insurance, a 5p cut to fuel duty and promised future tax cuts Critics say the economic plan did not do enough to help those hardest hit by rising prices, especially energy and food Edited by Georgina Pattinson, Jennifer Scott and Justin Parkinson That concludes our coverage of today's events in Parliament - from PMQs to the Liaison Committee, the PM has faced questions on Ukraine, the cost of living and partygate. Join us again soon. The PM was questioned at length about the Ukraine crisis. His main points were: This video can not be played Johnson backs more UK nuclear and offshore power supplies Labour's Clive Betts finishes up the session by thanking the prime minister. And it is all over! We will bring you more analysis and reaction from the committee here, so don't go anywhere... Tory MP Mel Stride asks if the government has started looking at cutting expenditure, as a result of inflation and the reduction in the rate of income tax, due to come in in 2024. The PM says there's been ""massive pressure"" on public finances since Covid hit, but ministers took a decision not to return to austerity. The cost of interest on the government's debt is Â£83bn a year and could go up, so it has to be ""very, very careful"" in deciding how much to spend, he adds. Stride says exports and imports have stayed ""very low"" following the pandemic and asks whether the UK is becoming more of a ""closed economy"" because of Brexit. The PM says he doesn't want this to happen and he wants ""much more of an export drive"" and it is a matter of ""will and energy and ambition"". Tory MP Mel Stride, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, says rapidly increasing inflation is higher than the rate of benefit rises, which was decided last year. He asks whether payments could be revisited in a couple of months. Otherwise some people will see 10% reduction in net income, Stride tells the PM. Boris Johnson promises to look into his colleague's suggestion, saying the ""aftershocks"" of the rises in energy prices - which are driving much of the increase in inflation - are difficult to deal with. Many of the government's policies are designed ""to tide people over through a tough time"", he adds. Continuing on the cost of living theme, Catherine McKinnell is back and questioning the figures the PM is using. She says 75% of children living in poverty across the UK are living in working households, and the government's measurement of absolute child poverty is not accurate. The Labour MP points to one of the government's central policies and asks: ""Do you believe it is possible to level up the country without reducing the number of children living in poverty?"" ""No,"" says the PM. Despite disputing her figures, he accepts ""there is an issue we have got to fix"", adding: ""I am not going to pretend it is easy, but we are going to go at it as hard as we can."" So, how many times is child poverty mentioned in the levelling up white paper published by the government? McKinnell reveals it is none. Johnson replies it is an accident ""because the whole objective of levelling up is to make sure kids growing up everywhere have opportunity."" Asked about last week's Spring Statement, the PM says the government is prioritising helping people back into work. But Labour's Stephen Timms says more needs to be done to boost Universal Credit to help those who can't work for health reasons. Boris Johnson responds by saying there is direct support for those facing ""particular hardships"" because of rising inflation, and the ""fundamental route out of poverty"" is getting people into jobs. Labour's Stephen Timms queries the PM's previous statement that there are now more people in work than before the pandemic, asking if he accepts acorrection made last monthby the head of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove. Boris Johnson accepts that it was ""payroll employment"" he was talking about, and that the number has now risen by 600,000, which ""is not half bad"". Timms asks if that number is more than offset by the fall in the number of self-employed people. The PM replies that unemployment had been predicted to hit 12% and this has not happened, adding that the government wants to help more people back into work. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The government's energy strategy - which was expected this week - has been delayed again. There have been reports that tensions over nuclear power have been one factor behind the delay - with reports the Treasury have been reluctant to commit outright to some of the huge costs of nuclear power given some of the targets the strategy is likely to set will fall outside the current Spending Review period. The prime minister has previously said, for example, that he wants 25% of UK power sourced from nuclear by 2050. There have also been tensions in cabinet over wind energy. Some ministers want to loosen planning laws in England to enable more onshore wind farms, but others oppose this. There is, however, pretty widespread support for more offshore wind turbines. When asked about the energy strategy, the prime minister seemed to drop some pretty strong hints about where his preferences lie. He said ""offshore wind - I stress offshore wind - has massive potential"" and added ""so does nuclear"". His message to cabinet colleagues here seems pretty clear, though No10 have also stressed in recent weeks that they want to keep all options on the table to help the UK become more energy independent and move towards net zero and away from Russian oil and gas. Tory Philip Dunne takes up the questioning on the cost of living, focusing on energy prices. He says since we began to emerge from the pandemic, households have faced an ""astonishing increase "" to their bills, exacerbated by Ukraine. But, he asks, will the much talked about - and much delayed - government energy security strategy address that? The PM says the government ""have to provide as much short term relief as you can within fiscal constraints"", pointing to the likes of the council tax rebate on its way, but also the need to look at North Sea oil and gas. ""But we have got to recognise in the UK that we have failed for a generation to put in enough long term supply,"" he adds, calling it a ""colossal mistake"". As well as renewables - and the PM stresses offshore wind specifically, rather than onshore - he wants to focus on nuclear, saying: ""This is the country that split the atom... why aren't we doing it?"" Johnson adds: ""I am not going to pretend we are going to get nuclear reactors on stream in next couple of years, but in the medium and long term, we have got to be looking at big ticket nuclear solutions."" Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News As the conversation shifts from Ukraine onto the cost of living - one area that bridges the two is the soaring costs facing farmers right now. Fertiliser and fuel costs for farmers have risen drastically due to rising gas prices. It's something the industry has warned could lead to shortages, cuts in food production, and a knock-on impact on the cost of food. The Tory MP Neil Parish urged the prime minister to do more to help farmers with fertiliser costs - including reopening a second fertiliser plant in the north of England. The prime minister was loathe to make a solid commitment to doing so without more information to hand - saying he can't just ""wave a massive wand"" but said he would ""jolly well find out what I can do"". This video can not be played Johnson and Wishart on police investigating lockdown parties Questions move on to the rising cost of living. Tory MP Neil Parish says the UK must produce more of its own food to protect consumers from global price increases. Farmers want to do it, he adds, asking what the government can do to help. The PM says he shares Parish's ambition and that investment in agriculture is rising. But young people need to be encouraged into the sector, he argues, adding that his own grandfather was a farmer, albeit ""very unsuccessfully"". Every UK embassy around the world is getting a food and drink export expert, Boris Johnson says. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News While parties have come together in Parliament in recent weeks to express solidarity with Ukraine - the government's refugee scheme has generally attracted the most scrutiny, from Tory and opposition MPs alike. The prime minister faced further questions on why applications for Ukrainian visas have reached 28,300, but only 2,700 have been granted.
He also was asked about safeguarding concerns around Ukrainians being put up in people's homes in the UK. The Tory MP Sir Bill Wiggin also pushed him on ""why can't we get right people through our immigration system instead of the wrong ones."" This is a reference to a criticism that many Tory MPs - including some ministers privately - have levelled at the government around their handling of small boat migrant crossings. The prime minister insisted that officials were processing about 1,000 visas a day for Ukrainians and that it was ""right to have checks both ways"" for Ukrainians coming to the UK - as well as UK families offering to host them. Chair Clive Betts refers back to promises made by the government on the two schemes - families bringing relatives over, and the Homes for Ukraine scheme. He says one committee was told local councils would receive Â£10,500 per refugee, no matter which scheme they come through, to provide services for them. But another select committee was told the funding was only available for people coming via Homes for Ukraine. Which is it? Johnson says it is right that councils will only get funding for refugees offered rooms by strangers, not those reuniting with families. He said they would still be able to access benefits, the NHS and education, which is ""a considerable package of support"". But Betts says councils will be left with lots more people to provide services to ""with not one penny of extra help"". The PM says most Ukrainians want to remain in the region they are from and would like to return home when the conflict ends. Officials dealing with refugees have to balance some difficult objectives, he adds, as ""gangsters"" are attempting to traffic the vulnerable and some people are ""not who they say they are"". Conservative MP Sir Bill Wiggin asks why the UK immigration system can't get ""the right people through, rather than the wrong ones"". Johnson says the system is being kept under constant review and that the government is trying to get more visa applications processed. He adds that he wants to see ""more wonderful Ukrainians coming"" to the UK. The Labour MP then raises Homes for Ukraine - where British citizens offer a home to Ukrainian refugees. She says only one in 100 offers has resulted in a visa being issued. But how many of those have actually arrived in the UK? The PM still doesn't have a number. Dame Diana Johnson tells the story of a heavily pregnant woman who has been matched with a home in the UK, but has been told she has to give birth to her child in temporary accommodation in Poland to get the child a birth certificate, before flying here. ""Is that how scheme should be operating?"" she asks. ""I can't see any reason why she couldn't come here and have the baby here,"" says the PM. Next up is the issue of visas, and Dame Diana Johnson leads the questioning. She asks whether the PM considered going for an emergency humanitarian visa for those fleeing war, rather than the schemes the Home Office has put in place. The PM says ""of course I thought about having a system when we opened the doors"" - but he is interrupted by the Labour MP, who says an emergency visa would still allow checks when people arrived. Johnson says he wanted ""a light tough system"" but one that would also allow the UK to do checks for security. He says have been 25,000 visas approved so far - ""not a bad number"" - and 1,000 visas were being processed a day. ""The number will mount quickly,"" he adds.

But young people need to be encouraged into the sector, he argues, adding that his own grandfather was a farmer, albeit ""very unsuccessfully"". Every UK embassy around the world is getting a food and drink export expert, Boris Johnson says. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News While parties have come together in Parliament in recent weeks to express solidarity with Ukraine - the government's refugee scheme has generally attracted the most scrutiny, from Tory and opposition MPs alike. The prime minister faced further questions on why applications for Ukrainian visas have reached 28,300, but only 2,700 have been granted.
He also was asked about safeguarding concerns around Ukrainians being put up in people's homes in the UK. The Tory MP Sir Bill Wiggin also pushed him on ""why can't we get right people through our immigration system instead of the wrong ones."" This is a reference to a criticism that many Tory MPs - including some ministers privately - have levelled at the government around their handling of small boat migrant crossings. The prime minister insisted that officials were processing about 1,000 visas a day for Ukrainians and that it was ""right to have checks both ways"" for Ukrainians coming to the UK - as well as UK families offering to host them. Chair Clive Betts refers back to promises made by the government on the two schemes - families bringing relatives over, and the Homes for Ukraine scheme. He says one committee was told local councils would receive Â£10,500 per refugee, no matter which scheme they come through, to provide services for them. But another select committee was told the funding was only available for people coming via Homes for Ukraine. Which is it? Johnson says it is right that councils will only get funding for refugees offered rooms by strangers, not those reuniting with families. He said they would still be able to access benefits, the NHS and education, which is ""a considerable package of support"". But Betts says councils will be left with lots more people to provide services to ""with not one penny of extra help"". The PM says most Ukrainians want to remain in the region they are from and would like to return home when the conflict ends. Officials dealing with refugees have to balance some difficult objectives, he adds, as ""gangsters"" are attempting to traffic the vulnerable and some people are ""not who they say they are"". Conservative MP Sir Bill Wiggin asks why the UK immigration system can't get ""the right people through, rather than the wrong ones"". Johnson says the system is being kept under constant review and that the government is trying to get more visa applications processed. He adds that he wants to see ""more wonderful Ukrainians coming"" to the UK. The Labour MP then raises Homes for Ukraine - where British citizens offer a home to Ukrainian refugees. She says only one in 100 offers has resulted in a visa being issued. But how many of those have actually arrived in the UK? The PM still doesn't have a number. Dame Diana Johnson tells the story of a heavily pregnant woman who has been matched with a home in the UK, but has been told she has to give birth to her child in temporary accommodation in Poland to get the child a birth certificate, before flying here. ""Is that how scheme should be operating?"" she asks. ""I can't see any reason why she couldn't come here and have the baby here,"" says the PM. Next up is the issue of visas, and Dame Diana Johnson leads the questioning. She asks whether the PM considered going for an emergency humanitarian visa for those fleeing war, rather than the schemes the Home Office has put in place. The PM says ""of course I thought about having a system when we opened the doors"" - but he is interrupted by the Labour MP, who says an emergency visa would still allow checks when people arrived. Johnson says he wanted ""a light tough system"" but one that would also allow the UK to do checks for security. He says have been 25,000 visas approved so far - ""not a bad number"" - and 1,000 visas were being processed a day. ""The number will mount quickly,"" he adds.

Let's take a look at some of the major developments on Thursday:  Read more from our daily Ukraine roundup. We've heard from Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov, one of the negotiators who suffered symptoms ofsuspected poisoning at peace talksalongside Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich earlier this month. One report after the incident said,externalthe alleged poisoning was orchestrated by Russian hardliners who wanted to sabotage the talks. Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""I feel better now, I feel good, but there was a situation. ""But my colleagues who are more competent in this sphere are analysing what it was and I hope during the shortest period of time they will be able to finalise it [their analysis] and I will be able to comment on it more thoroughly."" He said that while the talks were ""very tense"" at the start, ""it takes courage to find solutions and to meet"". ""Weâve had several rounds of
negotiations and at the end of the day weâre
coming to some sort of collective security agreement articles that we are
trying to negotiate."" Umerov added: ""Weâve been given a task
to find a solution so Iâm treating it as work and trying my best to find
political and diplomatic resolution to this brutal invasion."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says the situation in the south and the Donbas region remain extremely difficult. In a video address tonight, he reiterated that Russia was building up forces near the besieged city of Mariupol. ""There will be battles ahead. We still need to go down a very difficult path to get everything we want,"" he said. Russia said earlier a humanitarian corridor would be opened tomorrow to allowcivilians out of the south eastern port city of Mariupol. The Pentagon said on Thursday it did not know if Russia's convoy of military vehicles converging on Kyiv, which once stretched some 40 miles, ""still exists at this point"". ""It's been now so long,"" said spokesman John Kirby. ""They never really accomplished their mission."" The stalled convoy was never re-supplied, he noted, and was making little effort to advance on the capital even before Moscow announced its plans to reposition troops. âWe don't think that they properly planned for logistics and sustainment of a force that size in the field under combat conditions,â Kirby said. âIt's also a function of Ukrainian resistance and agility and frankly, just battlefield smarts,â he added. This video can not be played A 3D model earlier this month showed the size of the Russian convoy Nick BeakeBBC News Europe correspondent, in Brussels The EU is to urge China not to provide weapons to Russia in its war on Ukraine, nor give President Putin relief from Western sanctions. China's President Xi Jinping â who has refused to condemn Moscowâs attack on its neighbour - will hold a three-hour virtual summit with officials on Friday, including President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. At the start of February, China and Russia issued a long, joint declaration saying theirs was a relationship with ""no limits"". European leaders were worried by what they saw as a manifesto to redefine the international order. A few weeks later, President Putin invaded Ukraine. Western officials now believe Moscow has asked Beijing for military assistance and other help to cushion the blow of sanctions. EU sources say von der Leyen will urge President Xi to reject such Russian requests and instead use Chinaâs might to bring the fighting to an end â arguing the damage to the global economy benefits no one. But Chinaâs foreign minister has praised Russia this week for, in his words, preventing a large-scale humanitarian crisis and insisted the relationship with Moscow was heading in the right direction. Brussels officials are not expecting any significant agreement from the virtual talks but hope China will consider dissuading Putin from using weapons of mass destruction as his war grinds on. Yvette Cooper said the situation people were facing was ""Kafkaesque"" The UK has two visa schemes for Ukrainian refugees: The Ukraine Family Scheme, for people with a close relative living in the UK, and Homes for Ukraine, which allows people to sponsor named refugees, housing them in their homes or buildings. But thousands of families are being ""left in limbo"" as a result of bureaucracy, Labour has warned. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs earlier today that the schemes are not working, and went on to give a number of examples. ""A businesswoman who is trying to get her sister and daughter to come here on the family visa scheme is still waiting, 10 days since she applied to the Home Office. ""A constituent of mine in Pontefract who applied under the Homes for Ukraine scheme has been waiting nearly two weeks to hear anything back from the Home Office. ""Another British host who has applied for a visa for a woman undergoing a high-risk pregnancy [has been] waiting 12 days for a reply, despite the Home Office helpline saying she'd be treated as a priority."" On Wednesday, the UK said it had issued 2,700 visas through the Homes for Ukraine scheme and 22,800 under the Ukraine Family Scheme, which has been running for longer. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC South Asia Correspondent, Delhi Russiaâs Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has
touched down in India, the latest official to visit in what feels like a
conveyor belt of diplomacy. In the last week or so, delegations from China,
America, Germany, Japan and Mexico have also passed through. Lavrovâs
arrival came just as UK Foreign Secretary Liz Trusswrapped up a day of meetings in Delhi.While sheâs unlikely to bump into Lavrov, the fact
theyâre both here at the same time is an indication of how India is being wooed
from all sides. New Delhi has remained neutral on the issue of Ukraine. Prime
Minister Modi has called for the violence to end, but has stopped short of
denouncing Russiaâs actions. Fridayâs talks with Lavrov are expected to
include discussions on how India can buy more cheap oil from Russia, using a
payment system that would not breach sanctions regulations. But the US deputy
national security adviser Daleep Singh, who is yet another visitor in Delhi
today, warned there would be âconsequences
to countries that actively attempt to circumvent or backfill the
sanctions"". India is keen to stress that Russian oil makes up a tiny
proportion of its overall purchases and that the EU still buys far more. India's position remains one of
neutrality. Here, Moscow remains a friend, not a foe. As Thursday draws to an end in Ukraine, here are some pictures of people affected by the war on the 36th day of Russia's invasion. Relatives of a Ukrainian soldier, Yuriy Oliynyk, attend his burial in the western city of Lviv This man was among several people brought to a centre in Kyiv after being evacuated from the town of Irpin Xenia comforts her baby Alexander in a refugee centre in Lviv station, after fleeing her home in Kyiv A Ukrainian soldier carries a child from a displaced family across a river on the outskirts of Kyiv Refugees are still arriving in Poland, although the UN says numbers have slowed in recent days Russia is now a ""lesser country"" as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, says UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. Speaking to Sky News, he adds: ""President Putin is not the force he used to be. He is now a man in a cage he built himself. ""His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. ""The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed. ""He has not only got to live with the consequences of what he is doing to Ukraine, but he has also got to live with the consequences of what he has done to his own army."" Wallace says Russian forces appear to be regrouping and shifting their focus towards the south and east of Ukraine. ""We have seen it before. It always gets worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas."" He adds that international allies have agreed to supply more military equipment and ""lethal aid"" to Ukraine, including armoured vehicles and long-range artillery and ammunition. The US president has told journalists he is sceptical of Russian claims that it would pull troops away from Kyiv and focus on the east of the country. ""It's an open question whether he's actually pulling back,"" Joe Biden told journalists. ""Thus far, there is no clear evidence that he's pulling all his forces out of Kyiv. There is also evidence that he's beefing up his troops down in the Donbass area,"" he said. ""I don't know the answer, it appears so far...  the idea that he's pulling all his troops out from around Kyiv and moving south - there's no evidence he's done that,"" he added If you're just joining us, here is a recap of some of the main developments today: On the international stage:  On the ground: Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said Putin had damaged himself through a series of ""catastrophic misjudgements"" Earlier this afternoon, the head of Britain's armed forces gave his update on the war. In a speech followed by a question-and-answer session at the Institute for Government think tank, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin echoed sentiments made elsewhere by the UK and US, that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been ""misled"" about the effectiveness of his country's armed forces. He said the UK was ""incredibly cautious"" about believing Russian claims of withdrawing from the capital Kyiv but said there did appear to be signs the Kremlin was preparing to focus its efforts on the east and south of Ukraine. ""We are starting to see the early indications of those forces being moved back from Kyiv and retreating to both Russia and Belarus,"" Radakin said. ""That in itself is a difficult evolution for Russia because they are doing that under contact, so Ukraine armed forces will attack those Russian forces as they retreat."" Radakin, who replaced General Sir Nick Carter in the top job late last year, warned the coming weeks would ""continue to be very difficult"" for Ukraine, before adding: ""But in many ways, Putin has already lost. ""Far from being the far-sighted manipulator of events that he would have us believe, Putin has damaged himself through a series of catastrophic misjudgements."" US President Joe Biden says Russian President Vladimir Putin ""seems to be self-isolating"". ""There's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,"" he claims. ""I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time because we don't have that much hard evidence."" More now from US President Joe Biden. He says moving towards clean energy will help Americans deal with rising fuel prices. The US must ""double down on clean energy"", Biden says, which includes passing his bill currently before Congress. Biden says he's issuing a directive to strengthen the US's clean energy economy, using the Defense Production Act - which gives the government increased power over domestic industries in emergencies. This will help secure American supply chains and reduce dependence on China and other countries for materials such as lithium, nickel and graphite, which are used in electric cars and energy storage, he says, in order to ""build a made-in-America clean energy future"". This, he says, will save Americans money. President Biden said high oil prices were ""hitting Americans at the pump"" US President Joe Biden is speaking about the way high oil prices are ""hitting Americans at the pump"". ""I know how much it hurts,"" he says. He says banning Russian oil imports was ""the right thing to do"" but it would ""come with a cost"". Biden says US oil companies are recording increasing profits and have a choice: Between putting these to use by producing more oil, giving US people a break, or ""they can exploit the situation"". Biden says he is announcing a ""use-it-or-lose it"" policy, where companies will face fees for idle wells if they do not restart production.  President Joe Biden is now announcing plans to release a record amount of oil from US strategic stockpiles, in response to the Ukraine war. We'll bring you updates from what he says. Wyre DaviesBBC News, Zaporizhzhia Here in Zaporizhzhia, the last big city in Ukrainian held territory in the south east, local officials and aid workers are preparing to receive thousands of refugees from Mariupol. Tens of thousands of people are trapped in the city after weeks of fighting and heavy Russian bombardments. Organised by the Ukrainian government in conjunction with the Red Cross, the convoy of 45 buses, supported by medical vehicles, will depart from Zaporizhzhia on Friday but only if all sides can agree on a 24 hour ceasefire around the city. Previous attempts to establish humanitarian corridors from Mariupol failed after vehicles were attack on the roads out. A spokesperson for the ICRC said it was âdesperately important the operation takes place - the lives of tens of thousands of people in Mariupol depend on it"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor For
the Kremlin this is designed to suggest a dramatic escalation in the economic
battle between the West and Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir
Putinhas outlined a pathway for the cutting off gas supplies to Europe, if
Western customers refuse to pay for supplies in the Russian currency the
rouble. However, the market reaction suggests the details of the mechanism, means that, in
practice, European customers will just have to change their currency dealers to
Gazprombank. That bank has already been left unsanctioned, for the purpose of
continuity of energy trade. As a
result, gas prices remain very high, but did not today shoot into the
stratosphere. There should be a work-around. As one leading analyst told me,
this solution has âsaved faceâ for Putin, who can sound tough on domestic TV.
Ultimately, as Russian officials have repeatedly said for decades, Russian
supply of energy to the West continued uninterrupted even during the height of
the Cold War. Ultimately,
Russia still needs the money for the gas and still wants to leave the
possibility of a market for its main export, once a peace deal is signed.
However, it is also true to say that the threat of a cut-off has escalated. EU
nations have prepared emergency measures to manage demand, and would be more
willing to face that now during spring and summer than winter. The
net effect of the mechanism announced is to limit the ability of the West to
freeze the revenues they pay to Gazprom, which Putin described as receiving the
gas for free. Some Ukrainian officials have suggested such an approach. Oil and
gas dollars and euros continue to help the Kremlin resist an otherwise tough
set of financial sanctions. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
The mothers who pushed for inquiry,"Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths Next month, a report will be published into one of the biggest scandals in the history of the NHS, the failures of maternity care at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. The BBC's Michael Buchanan who helped uncover the problems examines why so many failures were allowed to happen for so long. It began with an email from one mother to another.  The two were strangers - ""I hope you don't mind me contacting you and I hope I don't cause any upset."" But almost immediately, a bond was formed - a spark rekindled in a couple who just two months earlier had vowed to move on with their lives. It was a Monday evening in June 2016, when Kayleigh Griffiths in a moment of clarity amid the fog of grief, wrote the email.  She and her husband Colin had welcomed their second daughter Pippa into the world in late April. They had decided on a home birth because of what she said was the ""appalling state"" of the birthing centre in Shrewsbury. Pippa arrived safely but struggled to feed almost immediately. Kayleigh spoke to her midwifery team on four occasions about her concerns, including a frantic call around 03:00 after her daughter coughed up brown liquid. She was repeatedly told not to worry. By 11:30 the following morning, Pippa became unresponsive. ""I went still and watched her chest and it wasn't moving,"" recalls Kayleigh. ""I put my hand under her nose to feel the breath and there was nothing.  At which point utter panic set in."" She screamed for Colin who desperately started trying to resuscitate his daughter while an ambulance was called. Kayleigh Griffiths Pippa died that afternoon. She was just 31 hours old.  The cause of death, the couple were later told, was an infection - Group B Strep. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust told the family they would carry out an investigation. But after several weeks of silence, Kayleigh contacted the trust to be told it was an internal investigation and the couple's input wouldn't be required. Kayleigh, an NHS auditor at a different trust, feared the truth was being hidden from her. That's when she decided to send the email. Rhiannon Davies was on holiday in Pembrokeshire with her husband Richard Stanton when she received the message. Kayleigh had seen some of the significant local media coverage about the couple's seven-year effort to uncover the truth about their daughter's death under the care of the same Shropshire trust. Over a frenetic few hours the sheer elation of new life became overwhelmed by the grief of sudden loss. Rhiannon had become pregnant with the couple's first child in 2008. She had been assessed as being a low-risk pregnancy and was advised to have her child at a midwife-led birthing centre run by the Shropshire trust in Ludlow, her home town. Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton In the days leading up to the birth, she noticed her baby's movements had reduced. She reported her concerns to clinicians at the trust, but was told she simply had a lazy baby. So when Rhiannon went into labour on 1 March 2009, she headed to the midwife-led unit. ""Kate was delivered at 10:03 in the morning,"" recalls Richard. ""It's just hard to describe the happiness that you feel."" Rhiannon says Kate started to make a strange noise. ""It's called grunting but it's not, it's a murmuring.  The midwife said she was trying to cry. She wasn't - this is a distinct clear sign, if you know what you're doing, that the baby is in respiratory distress. She opened her eyes once, beautiful blue eyes."" Rhiannon and her daughter Kate Kate was seriously ill and needed urgent medical attention. But the nearest doctors were 45 minutes away. The midwives ""lost control of the situation,"" said Richard, but eventually an air ambulance arrived to take Kate to a hospital in Birmingham. The couple followed, but Rhiannon collapsed and was taken to hospital in Worcester. Richard raced to his daughter's side. ""Kate was in an incubation cot with cables and tubes,"" he recalls. ""There was no recovery from this situation. So six hours after holding my new born baby, I cradled Kate in my arms dying. The overriding memory I have from that one day is hearing Rhiannon arrive to be told that Kate was no longer with us, and the cries of pain from Rhiannon."" The initial report from the trust noted the death but described it as a ""no harm"" event. In 2012, an inquest jury concluded, however, that Kate's death was preventable - those reduced movements should have seen Rhiannon deliver in a hospital, with doctors on hand. In a written response however, the trust said the care ""given to Ms Davies was in line with both the local and national guidance"". But the couple continued to fight, pushing for two independent reports, which were published over the next four years. Finally, in April 2016, the board of the trust held an extraordinary meeting, in which they apologised and accepted Kate's death was avoidable. ""It was a very emotional experience,"" says Rhiannon, ""but it was one that was very, very, very much for us the end."" Rhiannon could easily have ignored the email in June, but there was something about Kayleigh, she says, that meant she had to respond. In many ways, the two are polar opposites - Kayleigh is quiet and analytical, Rhiannon energetic and passionate. The Griffiths family needed practical advice on how to hold the trust to account. Richard and Rhiannon provided that, and in April 2017 a coroner ruled that Pippa's death was preventable as the trust had failed to give the family information that would have allowed them to recognise the seriousness of the infant's deteriorating condition. As the bond between the mothers deepened, their conversations morphed into something else.  Armed with little more than a gnawing suspicion, they started to scour the internet, coroner's records and death notices to see if any other families had received poor maternity care at the Shropshire trust. They collated 23 cases dating back to 2000 - including stillbirths, neonatal deaths, maternal deaths and babies born with brain injuries. Appalled by what they had found, they wrote to the then health secretary Jeremy Hunt in December 2016, asking him to order an investigation. He agreed and in May 2017, senior midwife Donna Ockenden was appointed to lead the review. ""We sat looking through the case notes of the original 23, and our opinion was these are really, really serious cases,"" Ms Ockenden told Panorama. ""These are amongst the most serious cases that we have seen in our careers.  The likelihood would be that when one tried to put together the full jigsaw there would be other cases but we didn't know that at the outset."" By now I was aware of significant problems at the trust. I'd met Richard and Rhiannon in late 2016, and when they outlined their concerns, I started investigating. In April 2017, I revealed there had been at least seven avoidable deaths at the trust in just 20 months. That initial story set me off on a five-year quest, an investigation that has helped unravel years of failure and grief. As I revealed more failures, the number of families approaching Donna Ockenden escalated rapidly. It was initially an investigation into 23 cases - but the review team has now examined the care that 1862 families received. Watch Panorama Maternity Scandal: Fighting for the Truth is on BBC One on Wednesday 23 February at 21:00 or watch later onBBC iPlayer One of the themes the inquiry has already noted, in an interim report published in December 2020, is that in many cases the trust failed to investigate after something went wrong, or simply carried out its own inquiry. Panorama has discovered the trust even developed its own investigation system, what they called a High Risk Case Review. It was outside any national framework that has been used to help learn lessons from incidents and doesn't appear to be a system that's used in any other NHS organisation. Another consequence of the unorthodox system was that fewer incidents were reported to NHS regulators, limiting the opportunity to learn lessons. One of the earliest cases on the original list of 23 compiled by the two couples was the death of Kathryn Leigh in 2000.  Panorama has investigated the case and discovered that a theme identified almost two decades ago was to come up repeatedly in subsequent incidents. Kathryn was delivered in a poor condition following an emergency caesarean section after her mother had been in labour all night. She needed to be resuscitated but the medics used the wrong equipment, and the baby died within 21 minutes of her birth. The trust admitted that error but refused to accept criticism of its maternity care at the inquest into Kathryn's death, held in April 2003. An expert witness called by the coroner told the court, ""In my opinion, Kathryn Leigh's need for resuscitation arose from incompetent management of her mother's pregnancy and labour"". That criticism, Panorama can reveal, did lead the family's lawyer to raise in court whether there was ""any kind of inbuilt policy or inbuilt bias towards trying to achieve natural births in as many cases as possible"".  The question also built on inquiries made by Kathryn's parents, Phil and Sonia. ""I wondered about the fact that I'd been left so long before going to C-section,"" said Sonia. ""I did a lot of research and found out that Shrewsbury Hospital had the lowest rate of C-sections in the whole of the UK."" Most of the cases the Ockenden review is examining date from 2000-2019. In their interim report, the essence of Sonia Leigh's concerns was strongly highlighted. The inquiry found that rates of caesarean sections at the trust in Shropshire were up to 12% lower than the England average for the period they are examining. The trust's reputation for unusually high numbers of vaginal births was known. Panorama has discovered that just a month before Kathryn Leigh's inquest, a parliamentary hearing was held to discuss concerns about the rising number of caesarean births across England. There was concern that child birth was being over-medicalised, and that too many women were having to undergo unnecessary surgical procedures, which like any operation carries risk. It also costs more money. One hospital was praised for its approach however - the Royal Shrewsbury.  At the time, its caesarean levels were half the England average, and a team from the hospital travelled to London. In the evidence session, seen by Panorama, the then clinical director of the Royal Shrewsbury told MPs: ""The culture of our organisation is that we have low intervention rates and once that is known we attract both midwives and obstetricians who like to practise in that way."" His colleague, the manager of women's service at the time, added that midwives who had worked elsewhere ""almost need retraining to be able to work in Shropshire.  We have recruited people who are like minded. If you want to keep something going and you believe in it, you do not want to employ people who do not believe in what you believe in."" Discussing the initial findings of her inquiry, Donna Ockenden told Panorama, ""There wereâ¯cases where an earlier recourse to caesarean section rather than a persistence towards a normal delivery may well haveâ¯led to a better outcome for mother or baby or both. Low caesarean section rates were a prize."" And the trust had been lauded for them. As the Griffiths and the Stanton-Davies families were striving to bring rigorous external scrutiny to the Shrewsbury and Telford trust, inside the organisation Bernie Bentick was also agitating for change. A consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist for nearly 30 years at the Shrewsbury and Telford trust until he retired in 2020, he's the first former staff member to speak openly about what was happening on the inside. He told Panorama that he wrote to senior management on several occasions highlighting problems. ""I was supported by a number of my clinical colleagues and wrote a long email to my line managers, to the chief executive, outlining the severity of the problems as I saw it - incidents of dysfunctional culture, of bullying, of the imposition of changes in clinical practice that many clinicians felt was unsafe."" He says that while there was a ""genuine attempt to try to ensure the best standards were achieved"" within the maternity department, the deteriorating culture made staff increasingly ""anxious"" and ""cautious"", making their performance ""less than ideal"". ""Because resources were scarce,"" said Dr Bentick, ""there was a tendency to blame individuals for not following guidelines rather than look at the underlying factors which may have led to a particular problem, and in particular staffing levels in the midwifery department. There were frequently not enough."" A lack of both midwives and consultants was a problem for years at the trust according to former employees that Panorama has spoken to.  But there are too few staff in maternity wards across the country, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). They say thousands more midwives and hundreds more obstetricians are needed now.  Maternity services, they say, need additional funding of up to Â£300m a year. In response to his complaints, Bernie Bentick said some ""cursory"" investigations were launched, but he felt that management never got to the heart of the problems. ""I believed that some of the ways they responded to problems were to try to preserve the reputation of the organisation rather than to do anything practical. ""They were prepared to make small, what they regarded as proportionate, changes to try to improve the situation. But I don't think they really understood the gravity of the cultural problems within the trust."" In recent years, he said, a gap developed between the management of the trust and its clinicians, which he says was mainly caused by a problem the whole NHS faces - the lack of good quality, trained managers who have as much professional accountability as clinicians. ""If the resources had been made available to employ adequate numbers, then the situation may have been profoundly different. I feel intense sorry and sadness for the families and I would hope that the NHS responds in a way that ensures that quality of care is at the forefront of what we provide in the NHS."" The Ockenden team, which at one point grew to more than 80 clinicians, has now spoken to more than 800 families. Their interim report found nine areas where the trust had repeatedly failed. As well as low caesarean rates, they highlighted the excessive use of forceps, the repeated misuse of a labour inducing drug, a failure to escalate concerns to senior clinicians and a lack of compassion and kindness in the delivery of care. ""I've heard of accounts where mothers were told quite clearly that it was their fault,"" said Donna Ockenden. ""And heard from fathers who have carried a tremendous amount of guilt that they should have been able to stand up for their wives and partners. And what I say to them is, it isn't your guilt to carry."" One recurring theme the Ockenden team picked up on was a failure by staff to properly monitor the baby's heart rate. The problem raises significant questions for all NHS bodies charged with overseeing trusts because the issue was highlighted as a problem at the Shropshire trust as far back as 2007. After the failure had been noted as a contributory factor in two babies being born with severe brain damage, in 2004 and 2005, the Healthcare Commission, the regulator at the time, wrote to the trust demanding action to ensure the problems ""are not repetitive and that learning is taking place"". But there's no evidence the regulator followed up, with repeated catastrophic consequences: September 2014, Kelly Jones had stillborn twins, Ella and Lola, after the trust failed to properly read and interpret their heart rates. 4 December 2015, Graham Scott Holmes-Smith was stillborn.  The trust accepted they'd failure to monitor the foetal heart rate. 15 December 2015, Ivy Morris was born with a severe brain injury after staff monitored her mother's heart rate rather than Ivy's and failed to spot she was in distress.  She died aged four months. Despite the errors, the new regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), didn't pick up on the problem. Its reports, following inspections of the trust in October 2014 and December 2016, make no mention of a problem with monitoring baby's heart rates.  It wasn't until November 2018, when the CQC rated the trust as inadequate, that the need for training in monitoring baby's heart rates is mentioned. Kelly Jones Chief Inspector of Hospitals at the CQC, Professor Ted Baker, robustly defended his organisation's handling of the trust. ""The families of Shrewsbury and Telford have been really important in driving forward the improvements,"" he told Panorama. ""The regulators identified problems in the maternity service and have subsequently taken enforcement action.  I don't accept that [we didn't spot the problems]."" In a statement, the trust told the BBC they took ""full responsibility"" for the failings in maternity care.  ""We offer our sincere apologies for all the distress and hurt we know this caused. ""Apologies alone are not enough and must be backed up with clear and meaningful action. We have made strong progress, including significant investment in additional staff and staff training. We have completed more than 80% of the recommendations in the interim Ockenden Report."" They added that the term High Risk Case Review is ""no longer used"", adding that its ""aligning"" its investigation systems with those ""being developed across the NHS in England."" The sheer scale of the maternity errors in Shropshire means the well of grief may run deeper here, but it's not the only area to have failed women and babies. In recent years, independent investigations have been ordered into maternity services in Cumbria, East Kent, Nottingham and South Wales. Since 2017, the CQC has been rating the safety of maternity services in England.  Its latest figures show that 41% of units need to improve their safety, while just 1% are rated as outstanding.  The CQC says the rate of improvement is not good enough and Jo Mountfield, vice president of the RCOG, says it's ""probably"" because the patients are women. ""I think women's health and research in this country should be given much higher priority. I think women's voices need to be heard much more loudly."" The interim Ockenden report led to a near Â£100m investment in maternity services in England.  NHS England wrote to all health trusts last week telling them to no longer limit the number of caesarean sections they offer women. They also said they were committed to providing safe, compassionate maternity services. The publication of the final report by Donna Ockenden next month will be a watershed moment in the history of the NHS - the revelation of multiple instances of maternity failures in a rural corner of England. Pippa Griffiths and Kate Stanton-Davies lived fewer than 40 hours between them, but their legacy, in terms of improved maternity care, could last decades. Photographs by Phil Coomes Â© 2025 BBC.

Wind and solar now supply 10% of world electricityWind turbines and solar panels produced 10% of global electricity in 2021 but coal also had a resurgence.Science & Environment,"Wind and solar installations grew at pace in 2021 Wind and solar generated 10% of global electricity for the first time in 2021, a new analysis shows. Fifty countries get more than a tenth of their power from wind and solar sources, according toresearch from Ember,external, a climate and energy think tank. As the world's economies rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, demand for energy soared. Demand for electricity grew at a record pace. This saw a surge in coal power, rising at the fastest rate since 1985. Heatwaves redefined in England over climate change UK's rainfall records rescued by volunteer army Pressure grows for global deal to save nature The research shows the growth in the need for electricity last year was the equivalent of adding a new India to the world's grid. Wind turbine blades being made ready for export from China Solar and wind and other clean sources generated 38% of the world's electricity in 2021. For the first time wind turbines and solar panels generated 10% of the total. The share coming from wind and sun has doubled since 2015, when the Paris climate agreement was signed. The fastest switching to wind and solar took place in the Netherlands, Australia, and Vietnam. All three have moved a tenth of their electricity demand from fossil fuels to green sources in the last two years. ""The Netherlands is a great example of a more northern latitude country proving that it's not just where the Sun shines, it's also about having the right policy environment that makes the big difference in whether solar takes off,"" said Hannah Broadbent from Ember. Vietnam also saw spectacular growth, particularly in solar which rose by over 300% in just one year. ""In the case of Vietnam, there was a massive step up in solar generation and it was driven by feed-in tariffs - money the government pays you for generating electricity - which made it very attractive for households and for utilities to be deploying large amounts of solar,"" said Dave Jones, Ember's global lead. ""What we saw with that was a massive step up in solar generation last year, which didn't just meet increased electricity demand, but it also led to a fall in both coal and gas generation."" Despite the growth and the fact that some countries like Denmark now get more than 50% of their electricity from wind and solar, coal power also saw a remarkable rise in 2021. Coal saw a resurgence in 2021 as the price of other energy sources rose rapidly A large majority of the increased demand for electricity in 2021 was met by fossil fuels with coal fired electricity rising by 9%, the fastest rate since 1985. Much of the rise in coal use was in Asian countries including China and India - but the increase in coal was not matched by gas use which increased globally by only 1%, indicating that rising prices for gas have made coal a more viable source of electricity. ""The last year has seen some really super high gas prices, where coal became cheaper than gas,"" said Dave Jones. ""What we're seeing right now is gas prices across Europe and across much of Asia being 10 times more expensive than they were this time last year, where coal is three times more expensive. He called the price rises for both gas and coal: ""a double reason for electricity systems to demand more clean electricity, because the economics have shifted so fundamentally."" The researchers say that despite the coal resurgence in 2021, major economies including the US, UK, Germany, and Canada are aiming to shift their grids to 100% carbon free electricity within the next 15 years. This switch is being driven by concerns over keeping the rise in the world's temperature under 1.5C this century. To do that, scientists say that wind and solar need to grow at around 20% every year up to 2030. The authors of this latest analysis say this is now ""eminently possible"". The war in Ukraine could also give a push to electricity sources that don't depend on Russian imports of oil and gas. ""Wind and solar have arrived, and they offer a solution out of the multiple crises that the world is facing, whether it's a climate crisis, or the dependence on fossil fuels, this could be a real turning point,"" said Hannah Broadbent.

""She genuinely cares, it is not another baby and another number, she genuinely cares about each and every one of us,"" Ms Matthews says. ""As she says, we are her family."" She was among the families who attended the publication of the review at the at Mercure Shrewsbury Albrighton Hotel, Shropshire.

Trust chief executive Louise Barnett ""apologises fully"" and says ""we do have more to do"". This video can not be played Shrewsbury maternity scandal: Trust has 'more to do' The head of a birth charity says there is ""surprise"" at the scale of the maternity report's inquiry. Clea Harmer, chief executive of stillbirth and neonatal charity Sands, says the inquiry has grown ""enormously"" since its launch in 2017 when it was begun to look at 23 cases. She says the charity is ""very aware...how often parents aren't listened to, how often they aren't involved in reviews and how difficult and painful and devastating some of their experiences have been"". The ""most important message"" to come out of this report is that parents must be listened to, she says. ""That must change and not just at Shrewsbury and Telford but in every hospital, in every maternity unit,"" she says. Two senior NHS figures have promised to ""redouble"" efforts to improve maternity services around the country, in the light of the Ockenden report. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, England's chief midwifery officer and Matthew Jolly, national clinical director for maternity and women's health, say the families ""should have been protected and cared for at the most special time in their lives"". An extra Â£127m has been committed to ""boost our workforce, strengthen leadership and improve culture"" they say. The chief executive of the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, says she encourages staff to speak out about any concerns after the report highlighted some feared the consequences. Asked about staff comments made to the inquiry claiming they had been told not to participate she says it is ""very committed to our culture change programme"". ""We have made progress,"" Ms Barnett says. ""We have more colleagues contributing their ideas and also raising concerns, which we are acting on within the organisation,"" she says. ""But we do have more to go, and if any person or any member of staff has any concerns, I would really encourage them to raise it through the many routes we have available... so that we can absolutely act on those issues."" We've been hearing that Donna Ockenden's team found it difficult to get hospital staff to speak to them. A process
whereby staff could speak to the review team heard âthat there was a culture of
bullying within the leadership team,â that wasnât confined to maternity
services. Another said, âits very hard
to speak up because despite what anybody will tell you, there are consequencesâ. âYou feel like you are penalised constantly. Iâm keeping my head down,â said another
medic, while a fourth remarked that âI feel thereâs a reluctance to change
there.â Throughout the day we've been hearing from families affected by today's report. Emma Priddey has told the BBC how she nearly died after giving birth to twins in 2019 at the Princess Royal Hospital, in Telford. Ms Priddey says she was told to continue with a natural birth despite her son being breech. ""I remember asking three times, one of them whilst I was pushing. When I was pushing I remember asking the consultant, 'are you sure that it's OK to go ahead with this?' and they said, 'yeah he'll turn'. ""But what I wasn't aware of was as a twin mum it is my right to choose whether I have a C-section or go naturally,"" she says. 'I nearly died' Ms Priddey had an emergency c-section and says she became unwell very quickly afterwards. ""Throwing up, couldn't hold my babies. I don't remember the first few days of their life. Despite all of my family's efforts and my efforts to tell the team that were on how unwell I was, I just wasn't listened to. ""Just short of 48 hours later I had to be rushed back in for major surgery for which they realised I had a mass bleed on the uterus and the only way to save my life was to have a hysterectomy."" If you are affected by any of todayâs news, help is available through theBBCâs Action Line. If you're just joining us or need a recap, here's a look at the reaction to a major report into baby deaths and maternity failings at a hospital trust. The report:The Ockenden report is the conclusion of an inquiry, first launched in 2017 to examine concerns over maternity care at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust (SaTH). The findings:The report outlines how failures led to the deaths of more than 200 babies, nine mothers and left other infants with life-changing injuries, with deaths often not investigated and parents not listened to. The families:In total, the inquiry has looked at almost 1,600 cases, including that of Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa died in 2016 at 31-hours-old from a Group B Streptococcus infection. Mrs Griffiths was instrumental in securing the inquiry and says it is ""so important that the learning is taken"" from the report. The hospital trust:Louise Barnett, chief executive of the trust, says it offers its ""wholehearted apologies"" to the families affected and says it will continue to make improvements. The health secretary:Sajid Javid told MPs vital clinical information was kept on post-it notes and swept into a bin ""with tragic consequences for a newborn baby and her family"". He vowed to ""act swiftly
so no families have to go through the same pain in the future"". The police:Operation Lincoln, West Mercia Police's investigation to explore whether there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved, is ongoing, with Det Ch Supt Damian Barratt adding it will feed ""appropriate elements"" from the report into its work. Donna Ockenden has spoken of the difficulties her team faced in getting staff to speak out in order to contribute to the report. She says: ""Staff have described to us they were frightened to speak to the maternity review team and were advised by trust managers not to participate in the Staff Voices initiative."" Staff Voices is the listening exercise set up by the Ockenden team. One member of staff, who came forward earlier this month, told the team: ""If I could say anything to the families it would be that there were people who tried to make changes. ""We tried to escalate our concerns and be heard, but every process we used was set up not to acknowledge our voices or the problems we were highlighting. ""We were ignored and made out to be the problem. But ultimately we failed to make ourselves heard."" The Ockenden report has been described as a ""watershed moment"" by the leader of one local authority in Shropshire. Shaun Davies, from Labour-run Telford and Wrekin Council, says he is in regular contact with the leadership at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust, ""seeking assurances that they are implementing changes"". He says he recognises ""considerable strides"" have been made to maternity care in the county since the publication of Ockenden's interim report, but more investment is needed. And he believes that's not just in maternity, that's across hospital services in the county. This video can not be played Caesarean sections: Why and when are they used? Among the failures highlighted in today's Ockenden report is about the Shrewsbury and Telford trust's stance towards Caesarean sections. The report says there was a reluctance to perform Caesareans, which led to many babies dying during birth or shortly after. Until last month, maternity units in England were encouraged to promote natural births and keep the Caesarean rate to about 20%. But in Februarythe guidance was changed- and now the NHS in England no longer limits the number of Caesarean sections it performs, under plans to improve care for mothers and babies. Maternity staff have been told to treat cases on an individual basis and followNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance,externalallowing women to opt for a planned Caesarean even if it is not for medical reasons. If a woman wants to have a caesarean, a trust must try to grant their wishes, and only say no if they have a good, evidence-based reason. Health Secretary Sajid Javid also referred to the issue in his Commons statement earlier. He said it was right that doctors' groups - the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Royal College of Midwives - had since said they regretted their campaign pushing for natural births. While the Ockenden report has finally drawn to a conclusion, the police investigation into actions in Shropshire is still under way. West Mercia Police provided an update today to say it's still trying to determine whether there is enough evidence to support a criminal case against the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust or any individuals involved. It described its own investigation, which also started in 2017, as ""highly complex"" and said so far no arrests had been made. The findings of the Ockenden report will now be fed in to its own inquiry, the force said. Kye Hall was four days old when he died One of the mothers who lost a baby at the trust is Katie Anson, whose son Kye Hall died in 2015 aged four days. Staff failed to properly take or read heart-rate readings which meant they didn't spot Kye was in distress. ""You feel robbed,"" says Katie. ""It makes me angry, but it makes me sad as well. To think of all the people who've lost their children because they haven't done anything, they haven't acted."" In a similar case, Graham Scott Holmes-Smith was stillborn in 2015. Midwives didn't realise he was in distress because they failed to read his heart-rate monitor properly. ""They're not just taking people's babies away, they're taking away Christmases, birthdays, everything,"" says mother Sophie Holmes. More here. The Nursing and Midwifery Council is looking for ""sustained investment in continuing professional development"" of midwives, following the publication of the Ockenden report. Andrea Sutcliffe, its chief executive and registrar, says: âSafe care for mothers and babies happens when maternity services have a fair culture, strong multidisciplinary relationships and an open approach if thereâs a concern."" She also says it's important to know ""when things are going wrong"" and people take the correct response. ""Last night I couldn't sleep, my anxiety was through the roof,"" says Kayleigh Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa was one-day-old when she died in 2016 after midwives failed to spot an infection, has responded to the report. Kayleigh was one of the first mothers to publicly raise concerns - and you canread more about her role in uncovering the scandal here. ""It's so important that the learning is taken,"" she says. ""This is 200-odd pages of harmed families... It's really important, and it's really important that maternity services up and down the country read this and listen to what families have gone through and the impact that's had on people's lives."" Asked on how proud she must feel to have come this far, Kayleigh Griffiths says it's difficult to comprehend. Her partner Colin adds: ""It's bittersweet. It's an accomplishment, but it didn't need to happen. It shouldn't have happened in the first place."" ""We visited Pippa this morning before we came, and we said 'this is what we've done for her',"" says Kayleigh - who says she's suffered from PTSD.
""It's just heartbreaking."" ""We've had to fight all the way along in this, so to finally be heard by Donna is a great achievement for all families. But I don't think we've been heard by the trust yet. That's the really important thing we need from this - that the trust need to recognise that words aren't going to be enough."" The session on the Ockenden report in the House of Commons has now come to an end. Here's a reminder of some of the figures highlighted by today's report before we hear more from the families affected. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who commissioned the Ockenden report, asks Sajid Javid when action will be taken as a result of it. Hunt calls for ""a culture in the NHS that is open, transparent accepts things go wrong, but hungry to learn from mistakes so that we never again repeat tragedies like this."" Javid says he has asked for a timetable on the implementation of the report's calls for action. ""I want to see that done as quickly as possible,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

The health secretary:Sajid Javid told MPs vital clinical information was kept on post-it notes and swept into a bin ""with tragic consequences for a newborn baby and her family"". He vowed to ""act swiftly
so no families have to go through the same pain in the future"". The police:Operation Lincoln, West Mercia Police's investigation to explore whether there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved, is ongoing, with Det Ch Supt Damian Barratt adding it will feed ""appropriate elements"" from the report into its work. Donna Ockenden has spoken of the difficulties her team faced in getting staff to speak out in order to contribute to the report. She says: ""Staff have described to us they were frightened to speak to the maternity review team and were advised by trust managers not to participate in the Staff Voices initiative."" Staff Voices is the listening exercise set up by the Ockenden team. One member of staff, who came forward earlier this month, told the team: ""If I could say anything to the families it would be that there were people who tried to make changes. ""We tried to escalate our concerns and be heard, but every process we used was set up not to acknowledge our voices or the problems we were highlighting. ""We were ignored and made out to be the problem. But ultimately we failed to make ourselves heard."" The Ockenden report has been described as a ""watershed moment"" by the leader of one local authority in Shropshire. Shaun Davies, from Labour-run Telford and Wrekin Council, says he is in regular contact with the leadership at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust, ""seeking assurances that they are implementing changes"". He says he recognises ""considerable strides"" have been made to maternity care in the county since the publication of Ockenden's interim report, but more investment is needed. And he believes that's not just in maternity, that's across hospital services in the county. This video can not be played Caesarean sections: Why and when are they used? Among the failures highlighted in today's Ockenden report is about the Shrewsbury and Telford trust's stance towards Caesarean sections. The report says there was a reluctance to perform Caesareans, which led to many babies dying during birth or shortly after. Until last month, maternity units in England were encouraged to promote natural births and keep the Caesarean rate to about 20%. But in Februarythe guidance was changed- and now the NHS in England no longer limits the number of Caesarean sections it performs, under plans to improve care for mothers and babies. Maternity staff have been told to treat cases on an individual basis and followNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance,externalallowing women to opt for a planned Caesarean even if it is not for medical reasons. If a woman wants to have a caesarean, a trust must try to grant their wishes, and only say no if they have a good, evidence-based reason. Health Secretary Sajid Javid also referred to the issue in his Commons statement earlier. He said it was right that doctors' groups - the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Royal College of Midwives - had since said they regretted their campaign pushing for natural births. While the Ockenden report has finally drawn to a conclusion, the police investigation into actions in Shropshire is still under way. West Mercia Police provided an update today to say it's still trying to determine whether there is enough evidence to support a criminal case against the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust or any individuals involved. It described its own investigation, which also started in 2017, as ""highly complex"" and said so far no arrests had been made. The findings of the Ockenden report will now be fed in to its own inquiry, the force said. Kye Hall was four days old when he died One of the mothers who lost a baby at the trust is Katie Anson, whose son Kye Hall died in 2015 aged four days. Staff failed to properly take or read heart-rate readings which meant they didn't spot Kye was in distress. ""You feel robbed,"" says Katie. ""It makes me angry, but it makes me sad as well. To think of all the people who've lost their children because they haven't done anything, they haven't acted."" In a similar case, Graham Scott Holmes-Smith was stillborn in 2015. Midwives didn't realise he was in distress because they failed to read his heart-rate monitor properly. ""They're not just taking people's babies away, they're taking away Christmases, birthdays, everything,"" says mother Sophie Holmes. More here. The Nursing and Midwifery Council is looking for ""sustained investment in continuing professional development"" of midwives, following the publication of the Ockenden report. Andrea Sutcliffe, its chief executive and registrar, says: âSafe care for mothers and babies happens when maternity services have a fair culture, strong multidisciplinary relationships and an open approach if thereâs a concern."" She also says it's important to know ""when things are going wrong"" and people take the correct response. ""Last night I couldn't sleep, my anxiety was through the roof,"" says Kayleigh Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa was one-day-old when she died in 2016 after midwives failed to spot an infection, has responded to the report. Kayleigh was one of the first mothers to publicly raise concerns - and you canread more about her role in uncovering the scandal here. ""It's so important that the learning is taken,"" she says. ""This is 200-odd pages of harmed families... It's really important, and it's really important that maternity services up and down the country read this and listen to what families have gone through and the impact that's had on people's lives."" Asked on how proud she must feel to have come this far, Kayleigh Griffiths says it's difficult to comprehend. Her partner Colin adds: ""It's bittersweet. It's an accomplishment, but it didn't need to happen. It shouldn't have happened in the first place."" ""We visited Pippa this morning before we came, and we said 'this is what we've done for her',"" says Kayleigh - who says she's suffered from PTSD.
""It's just heartbreaking."" ""We've had to fight all the way along in this, so to finally be heard by Donna is a great achievement for all families. But I don't think we've been heard by the trust yet. That's the really important thing we need from this - that the trust need to recognise that words aren't going to be enough."" The session on the Ockenden report in the House of Commons has now come to an end. Here's a reminder of some of the figures highlighted by today's report before we hear more from the families affected. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who commissioned the Ockenden report, asks Sajid Javid when action will be taken as a result of it. Hunt calls for ""a culture in the NHS that is open, transparent accepts things go wrong, but hungry to learn from mistakes so that we never again repeat tragedies like this."" Javid says he has asked for a timetable on the implementation of the report's calls for action. ""I want to see that done as quickly as possible,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Germany warns on gas supply over Russia payment rowGermany takes the first step towards gas rationing as a payments row with Russia escalates.,"Germany and Austria have triggered emergency plans over possible gas supply disruption amid a payments stand-off with Russia. Russia had demanded ""unfriendly"" countries pay for its gas in roubles from 31 March, but the EU, which mainly pays in euros, rejected the idea. Moscow later appeared to soften its stance, saying on Wednesday rouble payments would be introduced gradually. But Germany and Austria have taken the first steps towards gas rationing Germany urged consumers and companies to reduce consumption in anticipation of possible shortages, while Austria said it was tightening its monitoring of the gas market. Germany gets about half its gas and a third of its oil from Russia and has warned that it could face a recession if supplies suddenly stopped. Neighbouring Austria relies on Russia much more for gas, with the country getting about 80% from the country and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer's office said measures such as gas rationing would only come into play in an ""immediate crisis"". Under an existing gas emergency plan, the ""early warning phase"", which both Germany and Austria have begun, is the first of three steps designed to prepare the country for a potential supply shortage. In its final stage, the governments would bring in gas rationing. German economy minister Robert Habeck said the country's gas supplies were safeguarded for the time being, but said it was increasing precautionary measures in case of escalation by Russia. The head of German network regulator Bundesnetzagentur, Klaus MÃ¼ller, said the aim of the early warning was to avoid a deterioration of supply. He urged consumers and industry to prepare for ""all scenarios"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would not demand payments in roubles from Thursday. ""Payments and delivery is a time consuming process... from a technological point of view, this is a more prolonged process,"" he said. Russia doubles interest rate after rouble slumps Russia considers accepting Bitcoin for oil and gas The West has been imposing sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that natural gas exported to Europe should be paid for in roubles. Analysts say the move will support the country's currency, which fell sharply after the invasion but has begun to recover. Europe, which in total imports about 40% of its gas from Russia and pays mostly in euros, says Russia's state-controlled gas giant Gazprom cannot redraw contracts. But Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, said on Wednesday: ""European politicians need to stop the talk, stop trying to find some justification about why they cannot pay in roubles. ""If you want gas, find roubles."" The Kremlin also said Russia could start demanding payment in roubles for other commodities such as fertiliser, grain, metals and timber. France gets around 20% of its gas from Russia and the head of the country's CRE regulatory body said it did not expect any supply issues Bulgaria gets 90% of its gas via imports from Russian company Gazprom. Its natural gas grid operator has opened a tender for underground drilling as part of plans to almost double the country's gas storage capacity and prepare for any supply disruptions Poland gets around 50% of its gas per year from Russia but says it has no current plans to limit gas use Greece receives about 40% of its gas via a pipeline that bypasses Ukraine. Its government will meet to assess supply security if Russia switches the tap off Italy gets around 40% of its gas supply from Russia and is monitoring the situation. It will wait to see if Gazprom sends contract amendments to operators before it takes any further decisions The Netherlands gets between 15%-20% of its gas from Russia. The Dutch government said it will ask people to use less gas but it is not yet activating its gas crisis plan Britain gets around 3% of gas from Russia and says it has a range of sources to ensure supply German business leaders have welcomed Berlin's announcement of an ""early warning"" of a gas emergency. That's because German industry would be the first to be hit by gas rationing if Russia turned off the taps. If Germany was forced to ration gas, households and emergency services, such as hospitals, would get priority. This would hit manufacturers that rely on gas for production particularly hard, pushing up prices and possibly leading to job losses. This early warning stage aims to help businesses plan for any future shortfalls: a crisis group of representatives from the government will meet daily. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck also hopes for support from the public and has called for people to save energy where possible. ""Every kilowatt helps,"" he said. So far there are no gas shortages - Germany had large reserves. But over the past year Russia has failed to keep German gas reserve tanks fully stocked - some believe this indicates a long-standing plan by the Kremlin to use gas as a weapon against Europe. S&P Global energy analyst Laurent Ruseckas said Russia and the EU were involved in ""a game of chicken"" over who would back down first. ""Putin started it last Wednesday, with his first comment about requiring the change to payment in roubles, and now the EU has responded at a political level, saying: 'Well, no, we won't,'"" he told the BBC World Service. ""Something has got to give here."" He said the most likely next step was for the EU and Gazprom to seek a compromise by redrawing contracts, as both sides have an interest in resolving the stand-off. Russia currently gets â¬400m (Â£340m) per day from gas sales to the EU and it has no way of rerouting this supply to other markets. However, Mr Ruseckas said there was a small chance ""the brinksmanship leads very quickly towards a cut-off"". This would force Germany to run more coal plants, import as much liquified natural gas as possible, and in the longer term build more renewable energy production.

"Serious mistakes made over decades, report finds","A review into maternity failings at an NHS trust finds more than 200 babies may have died due to repeated failures The report, led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden, follows a five-year investigation of Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust Health Secretary Sajid Javid tells MPs that clinical details were kept on post-it notes that went into the bin with tragic consequences The report found serious mistakes were repeated over decades and there was a failure to investigate and learn from infant deaths A lack of transparency and honesty at the trust is highlighted and some staff described being frightened to speak to the review team Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa died, says families had to fight all the way but have ""finally been heard"" Rhiannon Davies, whose daughter Kate died, says the number of deaths ""do not tell the whole story"" of the impact on families Trust chief executive Louise Barnett vows to make improvements and apologises for the pain and distress caused Andy Giddings, Jennifer Meierhans and Francesca Gillett That's the end of our live coverage for today, thank you for joining us.

We will shortly be ending our live coverage on the UK's biggest maternity scandal at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. Here's what the report concluded:  You can read the latest story in full here Today's report is the biggest of its kind in the history of NHS maternity services is the result of along strugglefor many of the families affected. Some had campaigned for years to have their concerns listened to and refused to be dismissed by the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust. They were there to see Donna Ockenden present her findings this morning and Kayleigh Griffiths, who lost her daughter Pippa in 2016 said: ""To finally be heart by Donna is a great achievement for all families."" But she doesn't believe the fight will be over until the concerns raised in the report are taken on board by the trust. Both she and Rhiannon Davies, who lost her daughter Kate in 2009 were in tears after Ms Ockenden delivered her speech. And Ms Davies says: ""This report can make a difference, this report could be a legacy, it should be."" Read more:The mothers who helped uncover the biggest NHS maternity scandal As the magnitude of today's report into baby deaths and maternity failings sinks in, one mother has paid tribute to its author Donna Ockenden. Hayley Matthews' son, Jack Burns, was 11 hours old when he died in 2015 after staff failed to spot he was suffering from a serious infection, Group B Streptococcus. ""She genuinely cares, it is not another baby and another number, she genuinely cares about each and every one of us,"" Ms Matthews says. ""As she says, we are her family."" She was among the families who attended the publication of the review at the at Mercure Shrewsbury Albrighton Hotel, Shropshire. Ms Matthews says she is ""shocked"" by the report's findings  but hoped lessons will be learned. ""Telford and Shropshire as a whole isn't big, but the numbers that it has happened to, it is like probably half, it is disgusting and it should never happen again,"" she says. Here's the boss of the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospitals Trust making a statement following the publication of the Ockenden report which detailed unprecedented failings in maternity care. Trust chief executive Louise Barnett ""apologises fully"" and says ""we do have more to do"". This video can not be played Shrewsbury maternity scandal: Trust has 'more to do' The head of a birth charity says there is ""surprise"" at the scale of the maternity report's inquiry. Clea Harmer, chief executive of stillbirth and neonatal charity Sands, says the inquiry has grown ""enormously"" since its launch in 2017 when it was begun to look at 23 cases. She says the charity is ""very aware...how often parents aren't listened to, how often they aren't involved in reviews and how difficult and painful and devastating some of their experiences have been"". The ""most important message"" to come out of this report is that parents must be listened to, she says. ""That must change and not just at Shrewsbury and Telford but in every hospital, in every maternity unit,"" she says. Two senior NHS figures have promised to ""redouble"" efforts to improve maternity services around the country, in the light of the Ockenden report. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, England's chief midwifery officer and Matthew Jolly, national clinical director for maternity and women's health, say the families ""should have been protected and cared for at the most special time in their lives"". An extra Â£127m has been committed to ""boost our workforce, strengthen leadership and improve culture"" they say. The chief executive of the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, says she encourages staff to speak out about any concerns after the report highlighted some feared the consequences. Asked about staff comments made to the inquiry claiming they had been told not to participate she says it is ""very committed to our culture change programme"". ""We have made progress,"" Ms Barnett says. ""We have more colleagues contributing their ideas and also raising concerns, which we are acting on within the organisation,"" she says. ""But we do have more to go, and if any person or any member of staff has any concerns, I would really encourage them to raise it through the many routes we have available... so that we can absolutely act on those issues."" We've been hearing that Donna Ockenden's team found it difficult to get hospital staff to speak to them. A process
whereby staff could speak to the review team heard âthat there was a culture of
bullying within the leadership team,â that wasnât confined to maternity
services. Another said, âits very hard
to speak up because despite what anybody will tell you, there are consequencesâ. âYou feel like you are penalised constantly. Iâm keeping my head down,â said another
medic, while a fourth remarked that âI feel thereâs a reluctance to change
there.â Throughout the day we've been hearing from families affected by today's report. Emma Priddey has told the BBC how she nearly died after giving birth to twins in 2019 at the Princess Royal Hospital, in Telford. Ms Priddey says she was told to continue with a natural birth despite her son being breech. ""I remember asking three times, one of them whilst I was pushing. When I was pushing I remember asking the consultant, 'are you sure that it's OK to go ahead with this?' and they said, 'yeah he'll turn'. ""But what I wasn't aware of was as a twin mum it is my right to choose whether I have a C-section or go naturally,"" she says. 'I nearly died' Ms Priddey had an emergency c-section and says she became unwell very quickly afterwards. ""Throwing up, couldn't hold my babies. I don't remember the first few days of their life. Despite all of my family's efforts and my efforts to tell the team that were on how unwell I was, I just wasn't listened to. ""Just short of 48 hours later I had to be rushed back in for major surgery for which they realised I had a mass bleed on the uterus and the only way to save my life was to have a hysterectomy."" If you are affected by any of todayâs news, help is available through theBBCâs Action Line. If you're just joining us or need a recap, here's a look at the reaction to a major report into baby deaths and maternity failings at a hospital trust. The report:The Ockenden report is the conclusion of an inquiry, first launched in 2017 to examine concerns over maternity care at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust (SaTH). The findings:The report outlines how failures led to the deaths of more than 200 babies, nine mothers and left other infants with life-changing injuries, with deaths often not investigated and parents not listened to. The families:In total, the inquiry has looked at almost 1,600 cases, including that of Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa died in 2016 at 31-hours-old from a Group B Streptococcus infection. Mrs Griffiths was instrumental in securing the inquiry and says it is ""so important that the learning is taken"" from the report. The hospital trust:Louise Barnett, chief executive of the trust, says it offers its ""wholehearted apologies"" to the families affected and says it will continue to make improvements. The health secretary:Sajid Javid told MPs vital clinical information was kept on post-it notes and swept into a bin ""with tragic consequences for a newborn baby and her family"". He vowed to ""act swiftly
so no families have to go through the same pain in the future"". The police:Operation Lincoln, West Mercia Police's investigation to explore whether there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved, is ongoing, with Det Ch Supt Damian Barratt adding it will feed ""appropriate elements"" from the report into its work. Donna Ockenden has spoken of the difficulties her team faced in getting staff to speak out in order to contribute to the report. She says: ""Staff have described to us they were frightened to speak to the maternity review team and were advised by trust managers not to participate in the Staff Voices initiative."" Staff Voices is the listening exercise set up by the Ockenden team. One member of staff, who came forward earlier this month, told the team: ""If I could say anything to the families it would be that there were people who tried to make changes. ""We tried to escalate our concerns and be heard, but every process we used was set up not to acknowledge our voices or the problems we were highlighting. ""We were ignored and made out to be the problem. But ultimately we failed to make ourselves heard."" The Ockenden report has been described as a ""watershed moment"" by the leader of one local authority in Shropshire. Shaun Davies, from Labour-run Telford and Wrekin Council, says he is in regular contact with the leadership at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust, ""seeking assurances that they are implementing changes"". He says he recognises ""considerable strides"" have been made to maternity care in the county since the publication of Ockenden's interim report, but more investment is needed. And he believes that's not just in maternity, that's across hospital services in the county. This video can not be played Caesarean sections: Why and when are they used? Among the failures highlighted in today's Ockenden report is about the Shrewsbury and Telford trust's stance towards Caesarean sections. The report says there was a reluctance to perform Caesareans, which led to many babies dying during birth or shortly after. Until last month, maternity units in England were encouraged to promote natural births and keep the Caesarean rate to about 20%. But in Februarythe guidance was changed- and now the NHS in England no longer limits the number of Caesarean sections it performs, under plans to improve care for mothers and babies. Maternity staff have been told to treat cases on an individual basis and followNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance,externalallowing women to opt for a planned Caesarean even if it is not for medical reasons. If a woman wants to have a caesarean, a trust must try to grant their wishes, and only say no if they have a good, evidence-based reason. Health Secretary Sajid Javid also referred to the issue in his Commons statement earlier. He said it was right that doctors' groups - the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Royal College of Midwives - had since said they regretted their campaign pushing for natural births. While the Ockenden report has finally drawn to a conclusion, the police investigation into actions in Shropshire is still under way. West Mercia Police provided an update today to say it's still trying to determine whether there is enough evidence to support a criminal case against the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust or any individuals involved. It described its own investigation, which also started in 2017, as ""highly complex"" and said so far no arrests had been made. The findings of the Ockenden report will now be fed in to its own inquiry, the force said. Kye Hall was four days old when he died One of the mothers who lost a baby at the trust is Katie Anson, whose son Kye Hall died in 2015 aged four days. Staff failed to properly take or read heart-rate readings which meant they didn't spot Kye was in distress. ""You feel robbed,"" says Katie. ""It makes me angry, but it makes me sad as well. To think of all the people who've lost their children because they haven't done anything, they haven't acted."" In a similar case, Graham Scott Holmes-Smith was stillborn in 2015. Midwives didn't realise he was in distress because they failed to read his heart-rate monitor properly. ""They're not just taking people's babies away, they're taking away Christmases, birthdays, everything,"" says mother Sophie Holmes. More here. The Nursing and Midwifery Council is looking for ""sustained investment in continuing professional development"" of midwives, following the publication of the Ockenden report. Andrea Sutcliffe, its chief executive and registrar, says: âSafe care for mothers and babies happens when maternity services have a fair culture, strong multidisciplinary relationships and an open approach if thereâs a concern."" She also says it's important to know ""when things are going wrong"" and people take the correct response. ""Last night I couldn't sleep, my anxiety was through the roof,"" says Kayleigh Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa was one-day-old when she died in 2016 after midwives failed to spot an infection, has responded to the report. Kayleigh was one of the first mothers to publicly raise concerns - and you canread more about her role in uncovering the scandal here. ""It's so important that the learning is taken,"" she says. ""This is 200-odd pages of harmed families... It's really important, and it's really important that maternity services up and down the country read this and listen to what families have gone through and the impact that's had on people's lives."" Asked on how proud she must feel to have come this far, Kayleigh Griffiths says it's difficult to comprehend. Her partner Colin adds: ""It's bittersweet. It's an accomplishment, but it didn't need to happen. It shouldn't have happened in the first place."" ""We visited Pippa this morning before we came, and we said 'this is what we've done for her',"" says Kayleigh - who says she's suffered from PTSD.
""It's just heartbreaking."" ""We've had to fight all the way along in this, so to finally be heard by Donna is a great achievement for all families. But I don't think we've been heard by the trust yet. That's the really important thing we need from this - that the trust need to recognise that words aren't going to be enough."" The session on the Ockenden report in the House of Commons has now come to an end. Here's a reminder of some of the figures highlighted by today's report before we hear more from the families affected. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who commissioned the Ockenden report, asks Sajid Javid when action will be taken as a result of it. Hunt calls for ""a culture in the NHS that is open, transparent accepts things go wrong, but hungry to learn from mistakes so that we never again repeat tragedies like this."" Javid says he has asked for a timetable on the implementation of the report's calls for action. ""I want to see that done as quickly as possible,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Let's take a look at some of the major developments on Thursday:  Read more from our daily Ukraine roundup. We've heard from Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov, one of the negotiators who suffered symptoms ofsuspected poisoning at peace talksalongside Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich earlier this month. One report after the incident said,externalthe alleged poisoning was orchestrated by Russian hardliners who wanted to sabotage the talks. Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""I feel better now, I feel good, but there was a situation. ""But my colleagues who are more competent in this sphere are analysing what it was and I hope during the shortest period of time they will be able to finalise it [their analysis] and I will be able to comment on it more thoroughly."" He said that while the talks were ""very tense"" at the start, ""it takes courage to find solutions and to meet"". ""Weâve had several rounds of
negotiations and at the end of the day weâre
coming to some sort of collective security agreement articles that we are
trying to negotiate."" Umerov added: ""Weâve been given a task
to find a solution so Iâm treating it as work and trying my best to find
political and diplomatic resolution to this brutal invasion."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says the situation in the south and the Donbas region remain extremely difficult. In a video address tonight, he reiterated that Russia was building up forces near the besieged city of Mariupol. ""There will be battles ahead. We still need to go down a very difficult path to get everything we want,"" he said. Russia said earlier a humanitarian corridor would be opened tomorrow to allowcivilians out of the south eastern port city of Mariupol. The Pentagon said on Thursday it did not know if Russia's convoy of military vehicles converging on Kyiv, which once stretched some 40 miles, ""still exists at this point"". ""It's been now so long,"" said spokesman John Kirby. ""They never really accomplished their mission."" The stalled convoy was never re-supplied, he noted, and was making little effort to advance on the capital even before Moscow announced its plans to reposition troops. âWe don't think that they properly planned for logistics and sustainment of a force that size in the field under combat conditions,â Kirby said. âIt's also a function of Ukrainian resistance and agility and frankly, just battlefield smarts,â he added. This video can not be played A 3D model earlier this month showed the size of the Russian convoy Nick BeakeBBC News Europe correspondent, in Brussels The EU is to urge China not to provide weapons to Russia in its war on Ukraine, nor give President Putin relief from Western sanctions. China's President Xi Jinping â who has refused to condemn Moscowâs attack on its neighbour - will hold a three-hour virtual summit with officials on Friday, including President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. At the start of February, China and Russia issued a long, joint declaration saying theirs was a relationship with ""no limits"". European leaders were worried by what they saw as a manifesto to redefine the international order. A few weeks later, President Putin invaded Ukraine. Western officials now believe Moscow has asked Beijing for military assistance and other help to cushion the blow of sanctions. EU sources say von der Leyen will urge President Xi to reject such Russian requests and instead use Chinaâs might to bring the fighting to an end â arguing the damage to the global economy benefits no one. But Chinaâs foreign minister has praised Russia this week for, in his words, preventing a large-scale humanitarian crisis and insisted the relationship with Moscow was heading in the right direction. Brussels officials are not expecting any significant agreement from the virtual talks but hope China will consider dissuading Putin from using weapons of mass destruction as his war grinds on. Yvette Cooper said the situation people were facing was ""Kafkaesque"" The UK has two visa schemes for Ukrainian refugees: The Ukraine Family Scheme, for people with a close relative living in the UK, and Homes for Ukraine, which allows people to sponsor named refugees, housing them in their homes or buildings. But thousands of families are being ""left in limbo"" as a result of bureaucracy, Labour has warned. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs earlier today that the schemes are not working, and went on to give a number of examples. ""A businesswoman who is trying to get her sister and daughter to come here on the family visa scheme is still waiting, 10 days since she applied to the Home Office. ""A constituent of mine in Pontefract who applied under the Homes for Ukraine scheme has been waiting nearly two weeks to hear anything back from the Home Office. ""Another British host who has applied for a visa for a woman undergoing a high-risk pregnancy [has been] waiting 12 days for a reply, despite the Home Office helpline saying she'd be treated as a priority."" On Wednesday, the UK said it had issued 2,700 visas through the Homes for Ukraine scheme and 22,800 under the Ukraine Family Scheme, which has been running for longer. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC South Asia Correspondent, Delhi Russiaâs Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has
touched down in India, the latest official to visit in what feels like a
conveyor belt of diplomacy. In the last week or so, delegations from China,
America, Germany, Japan and Mexico have also passed through. Lavrovâs
arrival came just as UK Foreign Secretary Liz Trusswrapped up a day of meetings in Delhi.While sheâs unlikely to bump into Lavrov, the fact
theyâre both here at the same time is an indication of how India is being wooed
from all sides. New Delhi has remained neutral on the issue of Ukraine. Prime
Minister Modi has called for the violence to end, but has stopped short of
denouncing Russiaâs actions. Fridayâs talks with Lavrov are expected to
include discussions on how India can buy more cheap oil from Russia, using a
payment system that would not breach sanctions regulations. But the US deputy
national security adviser Daleep Singh, who is yet another visitor in Delhi
today, warned there would be âconsequences
to countries that actively attempt to circumvent or backfill the
sanctions"". India is keen to stress that Russian oil makes up a tiny
proportion of its overall purchases and that the EU still buys far more. India's position remains one of
neutrality. Here, Moscow remains a friend, not a foe. As Thursday draws to an end in Ukraine, here are some pictures of people affected by the war on the 36th day of Russia's invasion. Relatives of a Ukrainian soldier, Yuriy Oliynyk, attend his burial in the western city of Lviv This man was among several people brought to a centre in Kyiv after being evacuated from the town of Irpin Xenia comforts her baby Alexander in a refugee centre in Lviv station, after fleeing her home in Kyiv A Ukrainian soldier carries a child from a displaced family across a river on the outskirts of Kyiv Refugees are still arriving in Poland, although the UN says numbers have slowed in recent days Russia is now a ""lesser country"" as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, says UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. Speaking to Sky News, he adds: ""President Putin is not the force he used to be. He is now a man in a cage he built himself. ""His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. ""The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed. ""He has not only got to live with the consequences of what he is doing to Ukraine, but he has also got to live with the consequences of what he has done to his own army."" Wallace says Russian forces appear to be regrouping and shifting their focus towards the south and east of Ukraine. ""We have seen it before. It always gets worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas."" He adds that international allies have agreed to supply more military equipment and ""lethal aid"" to Ukraine, including armoured vehicles and long-range artillery and ammunition. The US president has told journalists he is sceptical of Russian claims that it would pull troops away from Kyiv and focus on the east of the country. ""It's an open question whether he's actually pulling back,"" Joe Biden told journalists. ""Thus far, there is no clear evidence that he's pulling all his forces out of Kyiv. There is also evidence that he's beefing up his troops down in the Donbass area,"" he said. ""I don't know the answer, it appears so far...  the idea that he's pulling all his troops out from around Kyiv and moving south - there's no evidence he's done that,"" he added If you're just joining us, here is a recap of some of the main developments today: On the international stage:  On the ground: Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said Putin had damaged himself through a series of ""catastrophic misjudgements"" Earlier this afternoon, the head of Britain's armed forces gave his update on the war. In a speech followed by a question-and-answer session at the Institute for Government think tank, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin echoed sentiments made elsewhere by the UK and US, that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been ""misled"" about the effectiveness of his country's armed forces. He said the UK was ""incredibly cautious"" about believing Russian claims of withdrawing from the capital Kyiv but said there did appear to be signs the Kremlin was preparing to focus its efforts on the east and south of Ukraine. ""We are starting to see the early indications of those forces being moved back from Kyiv and retreating to both Russia and Belarus,"" Radakin said. ""That in itself is a difficult evolution for Russia because they are doing that under contact, so Ukraine armed forces will attack those Russian forces as they retreat."" Radakin, who replaced General Sir Nick Carter in the top job late last year, warned the coming weeks would ""continue to be very difficult"" for Ukraine, before adding: ""But in many ways, Putin has already lost. ""Far from being the far-sighted manipulator of events that he would have us believe, Putin has damaged himself through a series of catastrophic misjudgements."" US President Joe Biden says Russian President Vladimir Putin ""seems to be self-isolating"". ""There's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,"" he claims. ""I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time because we don't have that much hard evidence."" More now from US President Joe Biden. He says moving towards clean energy will help Americans deal with rising fuel prices. The US must ""double down on clean energy"", Biden says, which includes passing his bill currently before Congress. Biden says he's issuing a directive to strengthen the US's clean energy economy, using the Defense Production Act - which gives the government increased power over domestic industries in emergencies. This will help secure American supply chains and reduce dependence on China and other countries for materials such as lithium, nickel and graphite, which are used in electric cars and energy storage, he says, in order to ""build a made-in-America clean energy future"". This, he says, will save Americans money. President Biden said high oil prices were ""hitting Americans at the pump"" US President Joe Biden is speaking about the way high oil prices are ""hitting Americans at the pump"". ""I know how much it hurts,"" he says. He says banning Russian oil imports was ""the right thing to do"" but it would ""come with a cost"". Biden says US oil companies are recording increasing profits and have a choice: Between putting these to use by producing more oil, giving US people a break, or ""they can exploit the situation"". Biden says he is announcing a ""use-it-or-lose it"" policy, where companies will face fees for idle wells if they do not restart production.  President Joe Biden is now announcing plans to release a record amount of oil from US strategic stockpiles, in response to the Ukraine war. We'll bring you updates from what he says. Wyre DaviesBBC News, Zaporizhzhia Here in Zaporizhzhia, the last big city in Ukrainian held territory in the south east, local officials and aid workers are preparing to receive thousands of refugees from Mariupol. Tens of thousands of people are trapped in the city after weeks of fighting and heavy Russian bombardments. Organised by the Ukrainian government in conjunction with the Red Cross, the convoy of 45 buses, supported by medical vehicles, will depart from Zaporizhzhia on Friday but only if all sides can agree on a 24 hour ceasefire around the city.

A spokesperson for the ICRC said it was âdesperately important the operation takes place - the lives of tens of thousands of people in Mariupol depend on it"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor For
the Kremlin this is designed to suggest a dramatic escalation in the economic
battle between the West and Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir
Putinhas outlined a pathway for the cutting off gas supplies to Europe, if
Western customers refuse to pay for supplies in the Russian currency the
rouble. However, the market reaction suggests the details of the mechanism, means that, in
practice, European customers will just have to change their currency dealers to
Gazprombank. That bank has already been left unsanctioned, for the purpose of
continuity of energy trade. As a
result, gas prices remain very high, but did not today shoot into the
stratosphere. There should be a work-around. As one leading analyst told me,
this solution has âsaved faceâ for Putin, who can sound tough on domestic TV.
Ultimately, as Russian officials have repeatedly said for decades, Russian
supply of energy to the West continued uninterrupted even during the height of
the Cold War. Ultimately,
Russia still needs the money for the gas and still wants to leave the
possibility of a market for its main export, once a peace deal is signed.
However, it is also true to say that the threat of a cut-off has escalated. EU
nations have prepared emergency measures to manage demand, and would be more
willing to face that now during spring and summer than winter. The
net effect of the mechanism announced is to limit the ability of the West to
freeze the revenues they pay to Gazprom, which Putin described as receiving the
gas for free. Some Ukrainian officials have suggested such an approach. Oil and
gas dollars and euros continue to help the Kremlin resist an otherwise tough
set of financial sanctions. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

"Rise of the five-year-old 'TikTots'Children as young as five are regularly using social media despite the rules, a survey finds.Technology","Children as young as five use social media, despite most platforms having rules users must be over the age of 13. An annual study into media habits,from Ofcom,external, highlighted the mini social-media mavens, with a third of parents of five- to seven-year-olds revealing their child had a social-media profile. Among the eight- to 11-year-olds who used social media, the most popular platform was TikTok, with one in every three having an account. TikTok is a ""strictly a 13+ platform"". A spokesman for the viral video-sharing platform said: ""We have processes in place to enforce our minimum-age requirements, both at the point of sign-up and through the continuous proactive removal of suspected under-age accounts from the platform. ""Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our community, especially young people."" The report noted even younger children - TikTots as Ofcom dubbed them - were watching videos on TikTok, including 16% of the three- to four-year-olds. But this could be children being shown videos by a parent or other older person and does not imply they have own accounts. Ofcom strategy and research director Yih-Choung Teh said the findings were ""really striking"". ""I have an 11-year-old and an eight-year-old,"" he said, ""60% of their peers have a social-media profile, which I find a bit surprising. ""Big-tech platforms set minimum ages in their terms and conditions - but it does seem that they aren't really being enforced."" But Mr Teh also said parents had to be aware of what their children were doing online. ""It's not always very easy to tell what they're watching and I think, as a parent, we have responsibilities to have a good dialogue with our kids about what they are doing,"" he said. But the survey also found 22% of parents of three- to four year-olds and 38% of parents of eight- to 11-year-olds said they would allow their child to have a profile on social media before they reached the minimum age. ""Many children could be tactically using other accounts or 'finstas' - fake Instagrams - to conceal aspects of their online lives from parents,"" Ofcom suggested. Instagram is an over-13's platform and offers a number ofparental controls.,external But across social media many children choose to have multiple profiles on the same social media app or site the survey suggested. Two out of every three of eight- to 11-year-olds surveyed used multiple accounts or profiles on social media, the regulator said. ""Among these, almost half (46%) have an account just for their family to see,"" it noted. The survey also found one out of every five of children aged 12-17, surfed in incognito mode or deleted their browsing history. The just published Online Safety Bill makes it a legal requirement for sites and platforms that show pornography to  prevent children accessing inappropriate or harmful material. But a significant minority may already be adept at working around technologies designed to prevent access to inappropriate material, the survey suggests. One in 20 children ""circumvented parental controls put in place to stop them visiting certain apps and sites (6%)"" Ofcom said. Mr Teh said those who were digital natives would often have skills beyond many of their parents. The key was ""ensuring that we have a good awareness of the online environment, what tools that we can use in terms of parental controls, but also that we have conversations with our kids about what they're doing"". But the study also found the children had many positive experiences online. Despite significant concerns, 53% of the 13- to 17-year-olds told Ofcom being online was good for their mental health, while 17% disagreed. The survey also found 70% of the adults were confident they could spot misinformation - but only 20% could correctly identify the tell-tale signs of a genuine post. Among the 12- to 17-year-olds, these proportions were nearly 75% and just over 10%. Perhaps the really surprising statistic in the Ofcom research is so many people - more than two out of every three - are pretty sceptical about what they see online. But there is one problem - they are vastly overconfident in their abilities to pick out truth from fiction. Only about one in four of those surveyed could spot a fake social-media profile in practice. And while a common trope stereotypes misinformation spreaders as clueless boomers spouting off on Facebook, digital natives are not much better at fake spotting. Only about one in 10 of the 12- to 17-year-olds could identify the tell-tale signs of a genuine post. And remember, the UK is among the most wired and technology-savvy countries in the world. When it comes to media literacy, there is big work to be done. The Online Safety Bill requires the technology giants to remove the most harmful misinformation and boost Ofcom's powers.

Here's what the report concluded:  You can read the latest story in full here Today's report is the biggest of its kind in the history of NHS maternity services is the result of along strugglefor many of the families affected. Some had campaigned for years to have their concerns listened to and refused to be dismissed by the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust. They were there to see Donna Ockenden present her findings this morning and Kayleigh Griffiths, who lost her daughter Pippa in 2016 said: ""To finally be heart by Donna is a great achievement for all families."" But she doesn't believe the fight will be over until the concerns raised in the report are taken on board by the trust. Both she and Rhiannon Davies, who lost her daughter Kate in 2009 were in tears after Ms Ockenden delivered her speech. And Ms Davies says: ""This report can make a difference, this report could be a legacy, it should be."" Read more:The mothers who helped uncover the biggest NHS maternity scandal As the magnitude of today's report into baby deaths and maternity failings sinks in, one mother has paid tribute to its author Donna Ockenden. Hayley Matthews' son, Jack Burns, was 11 hours old when he died in 2015 after staff failed to spot he was suffering from a serious infection, Group B Streptococcus. ""She genuinely cares, it is not another baby and another number, she genuinely cares about each and every one of us,"" Ms Matthews says. ""As she says, we are her family."" She was among the families who attended the publication of the review at the at Mercure Shrewsbury Albrighton Hotel, Shropshire. Ms Matthews says she is ""shocked"" by the report's findings  but hoped lessons will be learned. ""Telford and Shropshire as a whole isn't big, but the numbers that it has happened to, it is like probably half, it is disgusting and it should never happen again,"" she says. Here's the boss of the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospitals Trust making a statement following the publication of the Ockenden report which detailed unprecedented failings in maternity care. Trust chief executive Louise Barnett ""apologises fully"" and says ""we do have more to do"". This video can not be played Shrewsbury maternity scandal: Trust has 'more to do' The head of a birth charity says there is ""surprise"" at the scale of the maternity report's inquiry. Clea Harmer, chief executive of stillbirth and neonatal charity Sands, says the inquiry has grown ""enormously"" since its launch in 2017 when it was begun to look at 23 cases. She says the charity is ""very aware...how often parents aren't listened to, how often they aren't involved in reviews and how difficult and painful and devastating some of their experiences have been"". The ""most important message"" to come out of this report is that parents must be listened to, she says. ""That must change and not just at Shrewsbury and Telford but in every hospital, in every maternity unit,"" she says. Two senior NHS figures have promised to ""redouble"" efforts to improve maternity services around the country, in the light of the Ockenden report. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, England's chief midwifery officer and Matthew Jolly, national clinical director for maternity and women's health, say the families ""should have been protected and cared for at the most special time in their lives"". An extra Â£127m has been committed to ""boost our workforce, strengthen leadership and improve culture"" they say. The chief executive of the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, says she encourages staff to speak out about any concerns after the report highlighted some feared the consequences. Asked about staff comments made to the inquiry claiming they had been told not to participate she says it is ""very committed to our culture change programme"". ""We have made progress,"" Ms Barnett says. ""We have more colleagues contributing their ideas and also raising concerns, which we are acting on within the organisation,"" she says. ""But we do have more to go, and if any person or any member of staff has any concerns, I would really encourage them to raise it through the many routes we have available... so that we can absolutely act on those issues."" We've been hearing that Donna Ockenden's team found it difficult to get hospital staff to speak to them. A process
whereby staff could speak to the review team heard âthat there was a culture of
bullying within the leadership team,â that wasnât confined to maternity
services. Another said, âits very hard
to speak up because despite what anybody will tell you, there are consequencesâ. âYou feel like you are penalised constantly. Iâm keeping my head down,â said another
medic, while a fourth remarked that âI feel thereâs a reluctance to change
there.â Throughout the day we've been hearing from families affected by today's report. Emma Priddey has told the BBC how she nearly died after giving birth to twins in 2019 at the Princess Royal Hospital, in Telford. Ms Priddey says she was told to continue with a natural birth despite her son being breech. ""I remember asking three times, one of them whilst I was pushing. When I was pushing I remember asking the consultant, 'are you sure that it's OK to go ahead with this?' and they said, 'yeah he'll turn'. ""But what I wasn't aware of was as a twin mum it is my right to choose whether I have a C-section or go naturally,"" she says. 'I nearly died' Ms Priddey had an emergency c-section and says she became unwell very quickly afterwards. ""Throwing up, couldn't hold my babies. I don't remember the first few days of their life. Despite all of my family's efforts and my efforts to tell the team that were on how unwell I was, I just wasn't listened to. ""Just short of 48 hours later I had to be rushed back in for major surgery for which they realised I had a mass bleed on the uterus and the only way to save my life was to have a hysterectomy."" If you are affected by any of todayâs news, help is available through theBBCâs Action Line. If you're just joining us or need a recap, here's a look at the reaction to a major report into baby deaths and maternity failings at a hospital trust. The report:The Ockenden report is the conclusion of an inquiry, first launched in 2017 to examine concerns over maternity care at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust (SaTH). The findings:The report outlines how failures led to the deaths of more than 200 babies, nine mothers and left other infants with life-changing injuries, with deaths often not investigated and parents not listened to. The families:In total, the inquiry has looked at almost 1,600 cases, including that of Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa died in 2016 at 31-hours-old from a Group B Streptococcus infection. Mrs Griffiths was instrumental in securing the inquiry and says it is ""so important that the learning is taken"" from the report. The hospital trust:Louise Barnett, chief executive of the trust, says it offers its ""wholehearted apologies"" to the families affected and says it will continue to make improvements. The health secretary:Sajid Javid told MPs vital clinical information was kept on post-it notes and swept into a bin ""with tragic consequences for a newborn baby and her family"". He vowed to ""act swiftly
so no families have to go through the same pain in the future"". The police:Operation Lincoln, West Mercia Police's investigation to explore whether there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved, is ongoing, with Det Ch Supt Damian Barratt adding it will feed ""appropriate elements"" from the report into its work. Donna Ockenden has spoken of the difficulties her team faced in getting staff to speak out in order to contribute to the report. She says: ""Staff have described to us they were frightened to speak to the maternity review team and were advised by trust managers not to participate in the Staff Voices initiative."" Staff Voices is the listening exercise set up by the Ockenden team. One member of staff, who came forward earlier this month, told the team: ""If I could say anything to the families it would be that there were people who tried to make changes. ""We tried to escalate our concerns and be heard, but every process we used was set up not to acknowledge our voices or the problems we were highlighting. ""We were ignored and made out to be the problem. But ultimately we failed to make ourselves heard."" The Ockenden report has been described as a ""watershed moment"" by the leader of one local authority in Shropshire. Shaun Davies, from Labour-run Telford and Wrekin Council, says he is in regular contact with the leadership at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust, ""seeking assurances that they are implementing changes"". He says he recognises ""considerable strides"" have been made to maternity care in the county since the publication of Ockenden's interim report, but more investment is needed. And he believes that's not just in maternity, that's across hospital services in the county. This video can not be played Caesarean sections: Why and when are they used? Among the failures highlighted in today's Ockenden report is about the Shrewsbury and Telford trust's stance towards Caesarean sections. The report says there was a reluctance to perform Caesareans, which led to many babies dying during birth or shortly after. Until last month, maternity units in England were encouraged to promote natural births and keep the Caesarean rate to about 20%. But in Februarythe guidance was changed- and now the NHS in England no longer limits the number of Caesarean sections it performs, under plans to improve care for mothers and babies. Maternity staff have been told to treat cases on an individual basis and followNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance,externalallowing women to opt for a planned Caesarean even if it is not for medical reasons. If a woman wants to have a caesarean, a trust must try to grant their wishes, and only say no if they have a good, evidence-based reason. Health Secretary Sajid Javid also referred to the issue in his Commons statement earlier. He said it was right that doctors' groups - the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Royal College of Midwives - had since said they regretted their campaign pushing for natural births. While the Ockenden report has finally drawn to a conclusion, the police investigation into actions in Shropshire is still under way. West Mercia Police provided an update today to say it's still trying to determine whether there is enough evidence to support a criminal case against the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust or any individuals involved. It described its own investigation, which also started in 2017, as ""highly complex"" and said so far no arrests had been made. The findings of the Ockenden report will now be fed in to its own inquiry, the force said. Kye Hall was four days old when he died One of the mothers who lost a baby at the trust is Katie Anson, whose son Kye Hall died in 2015 aged four days. Staff failed to properly take or read heart-rate readings which meant they didn't spot Kye was in distress. ""You feel robbed,"" says Katie. ""It makes me angry, but it makes me sad as well. To think of all the people who've lost their children because they haven't done anything, they haven't acted."" In a similar case, Graham Scott Holmes-Smith was stillborn in 2015. Midwives didn't realise he was in distress because they failed to read his heart-rate monitor properly. ""They're not just taking people's babies away, they're taking away Christmases, birthdays, everything,"" says mother Sophie Holmes. More here. The Nursing and Midwifery Council is looking for ""sustained investment in continuing professional development"" of midwives, following the publication of the Ockenden report. Andrea Sutcliffe, its chief executive and registrar, says: âSafe care for mothers and babies happens when maternity services have a fair culture, strong multidisciplinary relationships and an open approach if thereâs a concern."" She also says it's important to know ""when things are going wrong"" and people take the correct response. ""Last night I couldn't sleep, my anxiety was through the roof,"" says Kayleigh Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa was one-day-old when she died in 2016 after midwives failed to spot an infection, has responded to the report. Kayleigh was one of the first mothers to publicly raise concerns - and you canread more about her role in uncovering the scandal here. ""It's so important that the learning is taken,"" she says. ""This is 200-odd pages of harmed families... It's really important, and it's really important that maternity services up and down the country read this and listen to what families have gone through and the impact that's had on people's lives."" Asked on how proud she must feel to have come this far, Kayleigh Griffiths says it's difficult to comprehend. Her partner Colin adds: ""It's bittersweet. It's an accomplishment, but it didn't need to happen. It shouldn't have happened in the first place."" ""We visited Pippa this morning before we came, and we said 'this is what we've done for her',"" says Kayleigh - who says she's suffered from PTSD.
""It's just heartbreaking."" ""We've had to fight all the way along in this, so to finally be heard by Donna is a great achievement for all families. But I don't think we've been heard by the trust yet. That's the really important thing we need from this - that the trust need to recognise that words aren't going to be enough."" The session on the Ockenden report in the House of Commons has now come to an end. Here's a reminder of some of the figures highlighted by today's report before we hear more from the families affected. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who commissioned the Ockenden report, asks Sajid Javid when action will be taken as a result of it. Hunt calls for ""a culture in the NHS that is open, transparent accepts things go wrong, but hungry to learn from mistakes so that we never again repeat tragedies like this."" Javid says he has asked for a timetable on the implementation of the report's calls for action. ""I want to see that done as quickly as possible,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Two senior NHS figures have promised to ""redouble"" efforts to improve maternity services around the country, in the light of the Ockenden report. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, England's chief midwifery officer and Matthew Jolly, national clinical director for maternity and women's health, say the families ""should have been protected and cared for at the most special time in their lives"". An extra Â£127m has been committed to ""boost our workforce, strengthen leadership and improve culture"" they say. The chief executive of the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, says she encourages staff to speak out about any concerns after the report highlighted some feared the consequences. Asked about staff comments made to the inquiry claiming they had been told not to participate she says it is ""very committed to our culture change programme"". ""We have made progress,"" Ms Barnett says. ""We have more colleagues contributing their ideas and also raising concerns, which we are acting on within the organisation,"" she says. ""But we do have more to go, and if any person or any member of staff has any concerns, I would really encourage them to raise it through the many routes we have available... so that we can absolutely act on those issues."" We've been hearing that Donna Ockenden's team found it difficult to get hospital staff to speak to them. A process
whereby staff could speak to the review team heard âthat there was a culture of
bullying within the leadership team,â that wasnât confined to maternity
services. Another said, âits very hard
to speak up because despite what anybody will tell you, there are consequencesâ. âYou feel like you are penalised constantly. Iâm keeping my head down,â said another
medic, while a fourth remarked that âI feel thereâs a reluctance to change
there.â Throughout the day we've been hearing from families affected by today's report. Emma Priddey has told the BBC how she nearly died after giving birth to twins in 2019 at the Princess Royal Hospital, in Telford. Ms Priddey says she was told to continue with a natural birth despite her son being breech. ""I remember asking three times, one of them whilst I was pushing. When I was pushing I remember asking the consultant, 'are you sure that it's OK to go ahead with this?' and they said, 'yeah he'll turn'. ""But what I wasn't aware of was as a twin mum it is my right to choose whether I have a C-section or go naturally,"" she says. 'I nearly died' Ms Priddey had an emergency c-section and says she became unwell very quickly afterwards. ""Throwing up, couldn't hold my babies. I don't remember the first few days of their life. Despite all of my family's efforts and my efforts to tell the team that were on how unwell I was, I just wasn't listened to. ""Just short of 48 hours later I had to be rushed back in for major surgery for which they realised I had a mass bleed on the uterus and the only way to save my life was to have a hysterectomy.""

If you're just joining us or need a recap, here's a look at the reaction to a major report into baby deaths and maternity failings at a hospital trust. The report:The Ockenden report is the conclusion of an inquiry, first launched in 2017 to examine concerns over maternity care at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust (SaTH). The findings:The report outlines how failures led to the deaths of more than 200 babies, nine mothers and left other infants with life-changing injuries, with deaths often not investigated and parents not listened to. The families:In total, the inquiry has looked at almost 1,600 cases, including that of Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa died in 2016 at 31-hours-old from a Group B Streptococcus infection. Mrs Griffiths was instrumental in securing the inquiry and says it is ""so important that the learning is taken"" from the report. The hospital trust:Louise Barnett, chief executive of the trust, says it offers its ""wholehearted apologies"" to the families affected and says it will continue to make improvements. The health secretary:Sajid Javid told MPs vital clinical information was kept on post-it notes and swept into a bin ""with tragic consequences for a newborn baby and her family"". He vowed to ""act swiftly
so no families have to go through the same pain in the future"". The police:Operation Lincoln, West Mercia Police's investigation to explore whether there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved, is ongoing, with Det Ch Supt Damian Barratt adding it will feed ""appropriate elements"" from the report into its work. Donna Ockenden has spoken of the difficulties her team faced in getting staff to speak out in order to contribute to the report. She says: ""Staff have described to us they were frightened to speak to the maternity review team and were advised by trust managers not to participate in the Staff Voices initiative."" Staff Voices is the listening exercise set up by the Ockenden team. One member of staff, who came forward earlier this month, told the team: ""If I could say anything to the families it would be that there were people who tried to make changes. ""We tried to escalate our concerns and be heard, but every process we used was set up not to acknowledge our voices or the problems we were highlighting. ""We were ignored and made out to be the problem. But ultimately we failed to make ourselves heard."" The Ockenden report has been described as a ""watershed moment"" by the leader of one local authority in Shropshire. Shaun Davies, from Labour-run Telford and Wrekin Council, says he is in regular contact with the leadership at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust, ""seeking assurances that they are implementing changes"". He says he recognises ""considerable strides"" have been made to maternity care in the county since the publication of Ockenden's interim report, but more investment is needed. And he believes that's not just in maternity, that's across hospital services in the county. This video can not be played Caesarean sections: Why and when are they used? Among the failures highlighted in today's Ockenden report is about the Shrewsbury and Telford trust's stance towards Caesarean sections. The report says there was a reluctance to perform Caesareans, which led to many babies dying during birth or shortly after. Until last month, maternity units in England were encouraged to promote natural births and keep the Caesarean rate to about 20%. But in Februarythe guidance was changed- and now the NHS in England no longer limits the number of Caesarean sections it performs, under plans to improve care for mothers and babies. Maternity staff have been told to treat cases on an individual basis and followNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance,externalallowing women to opt for a planned Caesarean even if it is not for medical reasons. If a woman wants to have a caesarean, a trust must try to grant their wishes, and only say no if they have a good, evidence-based reason. Health Secretary Sajid Javid also referred to the issue in his Commons statement earlier. He said it was right that doctors' groups - the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Royal College of Midwives - had since said they regretted their campaign pushing for natural births. While the Ockenden report has finally drawn to a conclusion, the police investigation into actions in Shropshire is still under way. West Mercia Police provided an update today to say it's still trying to determine whether there is enough evidence to support a criminal case against the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust or any individuals involved. It described its own investigation, which also started in 2017, as ""highly complex"" and said so far no arrests had been made. The findings of the Ockenden report will now be fed in to its own inquiry, the force said. Kye Hall was four days old when he died One of the mothers who lost a baby at the trust is Katie Anson, whose son Kye Hall died in 2015 aged four days. Staff failed to properly take or read heart-rate readings which meant they didn't spot Kye was in distress. ""You feel robbed,"" says Katie. ""It makes me angry, but it makes me sad as well. To think of all the people who've lost their children because they haven't done anything, they haven't acted."" In a similar case, Graham Scott Holmes-Smith was stillborn in 2015. Midwives didn't realise he was in distress because they failed to read his heart-rate monitor properly. ""They're not just taking people's babies away, they're taking away Christmases, birthdays, everything,"" says mother Sophie Holmes. More here. The Nursing and Midwifery Council is looking for ""sustained investment in continuing professional development"" of midwives, following the publication of the Ockenden report. Andrea Sutcliffe, its chief executive and registrar, says: âSafe care for mothers and babies happens when maternity services have a fair culture, strong multidisciplinary relationships and an open approach if thereâs a concern."" She also says it's important to know ""when things are going wrong"" and people take the correct response. ""Last night I couldn't sleep, my anxiety was through the roof,"" says Kayleigh Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa was one-day-old when she died in 2016 after midwives failed to spot an infection, has responded to the report. Kayleigh was one of the first mothers to publicly raise concerns - and you canread more about her role in uncovering the scandal here. ""It's so important that the learning is taken,"" she says. ""This is 200-odd pages of harmed families... It's really important, and it's really important that maternity services up and down the country read this and listen to what families have gone through and the impact that's had on people's lives."" Asked on how proud she must feel to have come this far, Kayleigh Griffiths says it's difficult to comprehend. Her partner Colin adds: ""It's bittersweet. It's an accomplishment, but it didn't need to happen. It shouldn't have happened in the first place."" ""We visited Pippa this morning before we came, and we said 'this is what we've done for her',"" says Kayleigh - who says she's suffered from PTSD.
""It's just heartbreaking."" ""We've had to fight all the way along in this, so to finally be heard by Donna is a great achievement for all families. But I don't think we've been heard by the trust yet. That's the really important thing we need from this - that the trust need to recognise that words aren't going to be enough."" The session on the Ockenden report in the House of Commons has now come to an end. Here's a reminder of some of the figures highlighted by today's report before we hear more from the families affected. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who commissioned the Ockenden report, asks Sajid Javid when action will be taken as a result of it. Hunt calls for ""a culture in the NHS that is open, transparent accepts things go wrong, but hungry to learn from mistakes so that we never again repeat tragedies like this."" Javid says he has asked for a timetable on the implementation of the report's calls for action. ""I want to see that done as quickly as possible,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Some had campaigned for years to have their concerns listened to and refused to be dismissed by the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust. They were there to see Donna Ockenden present her findings this morning and Kayleigh Griffiths, who lost her daughter Pippa in 2016 said: ""To finally be heart by Donna is a great achievement for all families."" But she doesn't believe the fight will be over until the concerns raised in the report are taken on board by the trust.

Read more:The mothers who helped uncover the biggest NHS maternity scandal As the magnitude of today's report into baby deaths and maternity failings sinks in, one mother has paid tribute to its author Donna Ockenden. Hayley Matthews' son, Jack Burns, was 11 hours old when he died in 2015 after staff failed to spot he was suffering from a serious infection, Group B Streptococcus. ""She genuinely cares, it is not another baby and another number, she genuinely cares about each and every one of us,"" Ms Matthews says. ""As she says, we are her family."" She was among the families who attended the publication of the review at the at Mercure Shrewsbury Albrighton Hotel, Shropshire. Ms Matthews says she is ""shocked"" by the report's findings  but hoped lessons will be learned. ""Telford and Shropshire as a whole isn't big, but the numbers that it has happened to, it is like probably half, it is disgusting and it should never happen again,"" she says. Here's the boss of the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospitals Trust making a statement following the publication of the Ockenden report which detailed unprecedented failings in maternity care. Trust chief executive Louise Barnett ""apologises fully"" and says ""we do have more to do"". This video can not be played Shrewsbury maternity scandal: Trust has 'more to do' The head of a birth charity says there is ""surprise"" at the scale of the maternity report's inquiry. Clea Harmer, chief executive of stillbirth and neonatal charity Sands, says the inquiry has grown ""enormously"" since its launch in 2017 when it was begun to look at 23 cases. She says the charity is ""very aware...how often parents aren't listened to, how often they aren't involved in reviews and how difficult and painful and devastating some of their experiences have been"".

Public satisfaction with NHS drops to 25-year low,"Public satisfaction with the NHS has dropped to its lowest level for 25 years after a sharp fall during the pandemic, a survey suggests. The British Social Attitudes poll, seen as the gold standard measure of public opinion, found 36% of the 3,100 asked were satisfied in 2021. That is a drop from 53% the year before - the largest fall in a single year. Only once have satisfaction levels been lower since the poll started in 1983. That was in 1997, and shortly after that the Blair government started increasing the budget by record amounts. NHS waiting-list backlog will take years to clear Hospital waiting lists hit six million in England The public said it was taking too long to get a GP appointment or hospital care, and there was not enough staff. Satisfaction with GP care and hospital services were both at their lowest levels since the survey began. The fall in satisfaction was widespread across all age groups and income groups, with political party support having no bearing. More people - 41% - said they were dissatisfied than satisfied. Satisfaction in social care, which is run by councils, was even lower - just 15% said they were satisfied - with more than half dissatisfied. The findings of the survey, carried out by the National Centre for Social Research in England, Scotland and Wales last autumn, have been published by the Nuffield Trust and King's Fund think-tanks. Dan Wellings, senior fellow at the King's Fund, described them as ""extraordinary"". He said the NHS initially saw a ""halo"" effect early on in the pandemic, with satisfaction rates being maintained as the NHS battled through the first wave. But he said it was clear that had now gone. ""People are often struggling to get the care they need. These issues have been exacerbated by the extraordinary events of the past two years, but have been many years in the making following a decade-long funding squeeze, and a workforce crisis that has been left unaddressed for far too long."" It comes as record numbers of people are waiting for hospital treatment - in England more than six million people are on a waiting list. Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, said the sharp drop in satisfaction was a ""real concern"", but was not ""altogether surprising"" given the pressures posed by the pandemic. She said tackling staffing shortages was key to addressing the problems. England, Wales and Scotland have all published Covid recovery plans, promising to reduce waiting times in the coming years. Ministers have pointed to the extra investment in the health service, with some of the extra money being funded through the increase in national insurance contributions which kicks in next month.

Baby death numbers far worse than imagined - Hunt,"Rhiannon Davis (pictured with her daughter Kate) was one of those who campaigned for an independent review The number of babies who could have survived with better maternity care at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust is far worse than imagined, says Jeremy Hunt. About 201 babies might have survived had better treatment been given by the trust, the BBC has learned. Mr Hunt, who as health secretary ordered the inquiry, said he hoped the report would be ""a wake-up call"". The NHS trust has previously said it takes ""full responsibility"" for the failures. Mr Hunt said the NHS had to get rid of a blame culture and ""make it easy for people to speak openly"". ""Even in this inquiry, doctors, midwives nurses at Shrewsbury and Telford said they were silenced, they were told that there would be professional consequences if they co-operated with the inquiry,"" he said. The report would be ""very, very shocking and sobering reading"" Mr Hunt added and the number of deaths were ""far worse"" than he could have imagined at the start of the process. Live coverage: Top midwife to publish report into baby deaths He said the families who had campaigned had played ""a really extraordinary role"", but questioned why it had taken their efforts ""rather than the NHS itself being really hungry to learn from mistakes"". ""We have to get rid of that blame culture and make it easy for people to speak openly and transparently when something goes wrong,"" Mr Hunt said. A report from senior midwife Donna Ockenden, who has been leading a five-year inquiry into maternity care at the trust, will be published at 10:00 BST on Wednesday. The scale of failures uncovered is unprecedented in the history of NHS maternity care. Mothers who helped uncover the biggest NHS maternity scandal Report to be 'a blueprint for care' Ockenden report delayed for second time Significant or major concerns over the maternity care provided by the trust were found in 201 deaths - 131 stillbirths and 70 neonatal deaths. Dozens of other children sustained life changing injuries as a result of the failure to provide adequate treatment. The vast majority of cases date from 2000 to 2019. Publication of the full reporthas twice been delayed. The NHS has been working to get indemnity cover to deal with any potential legal action following the publication. Ms Ockenden's team has been examining 1,862 cases - thought to be the largest ever review of maternity care in the NHS. Families in Shropshire, who campaigned for years to get an independent review into maternity failures across the county, long suspected this would be the conclusion - but the scale of the numbers involved is likely to come as a shock to many. Rhiannon Davies said the number of deaths ""do not tell the whole story"" of the impact on families. ""I think you really must dig into the family details to understand the long-term, deep-seated pain and harm that has been meted out by such appallingly poor care at this trust,"" she said. The trust has previously apologised and also pointed out the investment and improvements made in maternity care across the NHS in England. A criminal investigation is being conducted by West Mercia Police into what happened at the trust. That the Ockenden inquiry was ordered is largely down to the work of two mothers who lost their babies due to failures of care by the trust. Ms Davies fought for years to uncover the truth about the death of her daughter Kate in 2009. It took the board of the trust until April 2016 to apologise, and accept that Kate's death was avoidable. Kayleigh Griffiths' baby Pippa died at 31 hours old in April 2016, and a few weeks later Ms Griffiths emailed Ms Davies hoping for advice on how to hold the trust to account. A year later a coroner ruled that Pippa's death had also been avoidable. The two women began to scour the internet, coroners' records and death notices to see if any other families had received poor maternity care at the Shropshire trust, and they collated 23 cases going back to 2000. They wrote to the then health secretary Jeremy Hunt in December 2016 asking for an investigation. He agreed and in May 2017, Donna Ockenden was appointed to lead the review. Shropshire is not the only area where maternity care has been called into question - in recent years independent investigations have been ordered into maternity services in Cumbria, East Kent, Nottingham and South Wales. The latest Care Quality Commission (CQC) figures show 41% of units need to improve their safety, and just 1% are rated outstanding. The CQC says the rate of improvement is not good enough.

Read more:The mothers who helped uncover the biggest NHS maternity scandal As the magnitude of today's report into baby deaths and maternity failings sinks in, one mother has paid tribute to its author Donna Ockenden. Hayley Matthews' son, Jack Burns, was 11 hours old when he died in 2015 after staff failed to spot he was suffering from a serious infection, Group B Streptococcus. ""She genuinely cares, it is not another baby and another number, she genuinely cares about each and every one of us,"" Ms Matthews says. ""As she says, we are her family."" She was among the families who attended the publication of the review at the at Mercure Shrewsbury Albrighton Hotel, Shropshire. Ms Matthews says she is ""shocked"" by the report's findings  but hoped lessons will be learned. ""Telford and Shropshire as a whole isn't big, but the numbers that it has happened to, it is like probably half, it is disgusting and it should never happen again,"" she says. Here's the boss of the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospitals Trust making a statement following the publication of the Ockenden report which detailed unprecedented failings in maternity care. Trust chief executive Louise Barnett ""apologises fully"" and says ""we do have more to do"". This video can not be played Shrewsbury maternity scandal: Trust has 'more to do' The head of a birth charity says there is ""surprise"" at the scale of the maternity report's inquiry. Clea Harmer, chief executive of stillbirth and neonatal charity Sands, says the inquiry has grown ""enormously"" since its launch in 2017 when it was begun to look at 23 cases. She says the charity is ""very aware...how often parents aren't listened to, how often they aren't involved in reviews and how difficult and painful and devastating some of their experiences have been"". The ""most important message"" to come out of this report is that parents must be listened to, she says. ""That must change and not just at Shrewsbury and Telford but in every hospital, in every maternity unit,"" she says. Two senior NHS figures have promised to ""redouble"" efforts to improve maternity services around the country, in the light of the Ockenden report. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, England's chief midwifery officer and Matthew Jolly, national clinical director for maternity and women's health, say the families ""should have been protected and cared for at the most special time in their lives"". An extra Â£127m has been committed to ""boost our workforce, strengthen leadership and improve culture"" they say. The chief executive of the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, says she encourages staff to speak out about any concerns after the report highlighted some feared the consequences. Asked about staff comments made to the inquiry claiming they had been told not to participate she says it is ""very committed to our culture change programme"". ""We have made progress,"" Ms Barnett says. ""We have more colleagues contributing their ideas and also raising concerns, which we are acting on within the organisation,"" she says. ""But we do have more to go, and if any person or any member of staff has any concerns, I would really encourage them to raise it through the many routes we have available... so that we can absolutely act on those issues."" We've been hearing that Donna Ockenden's team found it difficult to get hospital staff to speak to them. A process
whereby staff could speak to the review team heard âthat there was a culture of
bullying within the leadership team,â that wasnât confined to maternity
services. Another said, âits very hard
to speak up because despite what anybody will tell you, there are consequencesâ. âYou feel like you are penalised constantly. Iâm keeping my head down,â said another
medic, while a fourth remarked that âI feel thereâs a reluctance to change
there.â Throughout the day we've been hearing from families affected by today's report. Emma Priddey has told the BBC how she nearly died after giving birth to twins in 2019 at the Princess Royal Hospital, in Telford. Ms Priddey says she was told to continue with a natural birth despite her son being breech. ""I remember asking three times, one of them whilst I was pushing. When I was pushing I remember asking the consultant, 'are you sure that it's OK to go ahead with this?' and they said, 'yeah he'll turn'. ""But what I wasn't aware of was as a twin mum it is my right to choose whether I have a C-section or go naturally,"" she says. 'I nearly died' Ms Priddey had an emergency c-section and says she became unwell very quickly afterwards. ""Throwing up, couldn't hold my babies. I don't remember the first few days of their life. Despite all of my family's efforts and my efforts to tell the team that were on how unwell I was, I just wasn't listened to. ""Just short of 48 hours later I had to be rushed back in for major surgery for which they realised I had a mass bleed on the uterus and the only way to save my life was to have a hysterectomy."" If you are affected by any of todayâs news, help is available through theBBCâs Action Line. If you're just joining us or need a recap, here's a look at the reaction to a major report into baby deaths and maternity failings at a hospital trust. The report:The Ockenden report is the conclusion of an inquiry, first launched in 2017 to examine concerns over maternity care at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust (SaTH). The findings:The report outlines how failures led to the deaths of more than 200 babies, nine mothers and left other infants with life-changing injuries, with deaths often not investigated and parents not listened to. The families:In total, the inquiry has looked at almost 1,600 cases, including that of Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa died in 2016 at 31-hours-old from a Group B Streptococcus infection. Mrs Griffiths was instrumental in securing the inquiry and says it is ""so important that the learning is taken"" from the report. The hospital trust:Louise Barnett, chief executive of the trust, says it offers its ""wholehearted apologies"" to the families affected and says it will continue to make improvements. The health secretary:Sajid Javid told MPs vital clinical information was kept on post-it notes and swept into a bin ""with tragic consequences for a newborn baby and her family"". He vowed to ""act swiftly
so no families have to go through the same pain in the future"". The police:Operation Lincoln, West Mercia Police's investigation to explore whether there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved, is ongoing, with Det Ch Supt Damian Barratt adding it will feed ""appropriate elements"" from the report into its work. Donna Ockenden has spoken of the difficulties her team faced in getting staff to speak out in order to contribute to the report. She says: ""Staff have described to us they were frightened to speak to the maternity review team and were advised by trust managers not to participate in the Staff Voices initiative."" Staff Voices is the listening exercise set up by the Ockenden team. One member of staff, who came forward earlier this month, told the team: ""If I could say anything to the families it would be that there were people who tried to make changes. ""We tried to escalate our concerns and be heard, but every process we used was set up not to acknowledge our voices or the problems we were highlighting. ""We were ignored and made out to be the problem. But ultimately we failed to make ourselves heard."" The Ockenden report has been described as a ""watershed moment"" by the leader of one local authority in Shropshire. Shaun Davies, from Labour-run Telford and Wrekin Council, says he is in regular contact with the leadership at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust, ""seeking assurances that they are implementing changes"". He says he recognises ""considerable strides"" have been made to maternity care in the county since the publication of Ockenden's interim report, but more investment is needed. And he believes that's not just in maternity, that's across hospital services in the county. This video can not be played Caesarean sections: Why and when are they used? Among the failures highlighted in today's Ockenden report is about the Shrewsbury and Telford trust's stance towards Caesarean sections. The report says there was a reluctance to perform Caesareans, which led to many babies dying during birth or shortly after. Until last month, maternity units in England were encouraged to promote natural births and keep the Caesarean rate to about 20%. But in Februarythe guidance was changed- and now the NHS in England no longer limits the number of Caesarean sections it performs, under plans to improve care for mothers and babies. Maternity staff have been told to treat cases on an individual basis and followNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance,externalallowing women to opt for a planned Caesarean even if it is not for medical reasons. If a woman wants to have a caesarean, a trust must try to grant their wishes, and only say no if they have a good, evidence-based reason. Health Secretary Sajid Javid also referred to the issue in his Commons statement earlier. He said it was right that doctors' groups - the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Royal College of Midwives - had since said they regretted their campaign pushing for natural births. While the Ockenden report has finally drawn to a conclusion, the police investigation into actions in Shropshire is still under way. West Mercia Police provided an update today to say it's still trying to determine whether there is enough evidence to support a criminal case against the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust or any individuals involved. It described its own investigation, which also started in 2017, as ""highly complex"" and said so far no arrests had been made. The findings of the Ockenden report will now be fed in to its own inquiry, the force said. Kye Hall was four days old when he died One of the mothers who lost a baby at the trust is Katie Anson, whose son Kye Hall died in 2015 aged four days. Staff failed to properly take or read heart-rate readings which meant they didn't spot Kye was in distress. ""You feel robbed,"" says Katie. ""It makes me angry, but it makes me sad as well. To think of all the people who've lost their children because they haven't done anything, they haven't acted."" In a similar case, Graham Scott Holmes-Smith was stillborn in 2015. Midwives didn't realise he was in distress because they failed to read his heart-rate monitor properly. ""They're not just taking people's babies away, they're taking away Christmases, birthdays, everything,"" says mother Sophie Holmes. More here. The Nursing and Midwifery Council is looking for ""sustained investment in continuing professional development"" of midwives, following the publication of the Ockenden report. Andrea Sutcliffe, its chief executive and registrar, says: âSafe care for mothers and babies happens when maternity services have a fair culture, strong multidisciplinary relationships and an open approach if thereâs a concern."" She also says it's important to know ""when things are going wrong"" and people take the correct response. ""Last night I couldn't sleep, my anxiety was through the roof,"" says Kayleigh Kayleigh Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa was one-day-old when she died in 2016 after midwives failed to spot an infection, has responded to the report. Kayleigh was one of the first mothers to publicly raise concerns - and you canread more about her role in uncovering the scandal here. ""It's so important that the learning is taken,"" she says. ""This is 200-odd pages of harmed families... It's really important, and it's really important that maternity services up and down the country read this and listen to what families have gone through and the impact that's had on people's lives."" Asked on how proud she must feel to have come this far, Kayleigh Griffiths says it's difficult to comprehend. Her partner Colin adds: ""It's bittersweet. It's an accomplishment, but it didn't need to happen. It shouldn't have happened in the first place."" ""We visited Pippa this morning before we came, and we said 'this is what we've done for her',"" says Kayleigh - who says she's suffered from PTSD.
""It's just heartbreaking."" ""We've had to fight all the way along in this, so to finally be heard by Donna is a great achievement for all families. But I don't think we've been heard by the trust yet. That's the really important thing we need from this - that the trust need to recognise that words aren't going to be enough."" The session on the Ockenden report in the House of Commons has now come to an end. Here's a reminder of some of the figures highlighted by today's report before we hear more from the families affected. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who commissioned the Ockenden report, asks Sajid Javid when action will be taken as a result of it. Hunt calls for ""a culture in the NHS that is open, transparent accepts things go wrong, but hungry to learn from mistakes so that we never again repeat tragedies like this."" Javid says he has asked for a timetable on the implementation of the report's calls for action. ""I want to see that done as quickly as possible,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

But I don't think we've been heard by the trust yet. That's the really important thing we need from this - that the trust need to recognise that words aren't going to be enough."" The session on the Ockenden report in the House of Commons has now come to an end. Here's a reminder of some of the figures highlighted by today's report before we hear more from the families affected. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who commissioned the Ockenden report, asks Sajid Javid when action will be taken as a result of it. Hunt calls for ""a culture in the NHS that is open, transparent accepts things go wrong, but hungry to learn from mistakes so that we never again repeat tragedies like this."" Javid says he has asked for a timetable on the implementation of the report's calls for action. ""I want to see that done as quickly as possible,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Rise of the under-age 'TikTots'Children as young as five are regularly using social media despite the rules, a survey finds.","Children as young as five use social media, despite most platforms having rules users must be over the age of 13. An annual study into media habits,from Ofcom,external, highlighted the mini social-media mavens, with a third of parents of five- to seven-year-olds revealing their child had a social-media profile. Among the eight- to 11-year-olds who used social media, the most popular platform was TikTok, with one in every three having an account. TikTok is a ""strictly a 13+ platform"". A spokesman for the viral video-sharing platform said: ""We have processes in place to enforce our minimum-age requirements, both at the point of sign-up and through the continuous proactive removal of suspected under-age accounts from the platform. ""Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our community, especially young people."" The report noted even younger children - TikTots as Ofcom dubbed them - were watching videos on TikTok, including 16% of the three- to four-year-olds. But this could be children being shown videos by a parent or other older person and does not imply they have own accounts. Ofcom strategy and research director Yih-Choung Teh said the findings were ""really striking"". ""I have an 11-year-old and an eight-year-old,"" he said, ""60% of their peers have a social-media profile, which I find a bit surprising. ""Big-tech platforms set minimum ages in their terms and conditions - but it does seem that they aren't really being enforced."" But Mr Teh also said parents had to be aware of what their children were doing online. ""It's not always very easy to tell what they're watching and I think, as a parent, we have responsibilities to have a good dialogue with our kids about what they are doing,"" he said. But the survey also found 22% of parents of three- to four year-olds and 38% of parents of eight- to 11-year-olds said they would allow their child to have a profile on social media before they reached the minimum age. ""Many children could be tactically using other accounts or 'finstas' - fake Instagrams - to conceal aspects of their online lives from parents,"" Ofcom suggested. Instagram is an over-13's platform and offers a number ofparental controls.,external But across social media many children choose to have multiple profiles on the same social media app or site the survey suggested. Two out of every three of eight- to 11-year-olds surveyed used multiple accounts or profiles on social media, the regulator said. ""Among these, almost half (46%) have an account just for their family to see,"" it noted. The survey also found one out of every five of children aged 12-17, surfed in incognito mode or deleted their browsing history. The just published Online Safety Bill makes it a legal requirement for sites and platforms that show pornography to  prevent children accessing inappropriate or harmful material. But a significant minority may already be adept at working around technologies designed to prevent access to inappropriate material, the survey suggests. One in 20 children ""circumvented parental controls put in place to stop them visiting certain apps and sites (6%)"" Ofcom said. Mr Teh said those who were digital natives would often have skills beyond many of their parents. The key was ""ensuring that we have a good awareness of the online environment, what tools that we can use in terms of parental controls, but also that we have conversations with our kids about what they're doing"". But the study also found the children had many positive experiences online. Despite significant concerns, 53% of the 13- to 17-year-olds told Ofcom being online was good for their mental health, while 17% disagreed. The survey also found 70% of the adults were confident they could spot misinformation - but only 20% could correctly identify the tell-tale signs of a genuine post. Among the 12- to 17-year-olds, these proportions were nearly 75% and just over 10%. Perhaps the really surprising statistic in the Ofcom research is so many people - more than two out of every three - are pretty sceptical about what they see online. But there is one problem - they are vastly overconfident in their abilities to pick out truth from fiction. Only about one in four of those surveyed could spot a fake social-media profile in practice. And while a common trope stereotypes misinformation spreaders as clueless boomers spouting off on Facebook, digital natives are not much better at fake spotting. Only about one in 10 of the 12- to 17-year-olds could identify the tell-tale signs of a genuine post. And remember, the UK is among the most wired and technology-savvy countries in the world.

Let's take a look at some of the major developments on Thursday:  Read more from our daily Ukraine roundup. We've heard from Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov, one of the negotiators who suffered symptoms ofsuspected poisoning at peace talksalongside Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich earlier this month. One report after the incident said,externalthe alleged poisoning was orchestrated by Russian hardliners who wanted to sabotage the talks. Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""I feel better now, I feel good, but there was a situation. ""But my colleagues who are more competent in this sphere are analysing what it was and I hope during the shortest period of time they will be able to finalise it [their analysis] and I will be able to comment on it more thoroughly."" He said that while the talks were ""very tense"" at the start, ""it takes courage to find solutions and to meet"". ""Weâve had several rounds of
negotiations and at the end of the day weâre
coming to some sort of collective security agreement articles that we are
trying to negotiate."" Umerov added: ""Weâve been given a task
to find a solution so Iâm treating it as work and trying my best to find
political and diplomatic resolution to this brutal invasion."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says the situation in the south and the Donbas region remain extremely difficult. In a video address tonight, he reiterated that Russia was building up forces near the besieged city of Mariupol. ""There will be battles ahead. We still need to go down a very difficult path to get everything we want,"" he said. Russia said earlier a humanitarian corridor would be opened tomorrow to allowcivilians out of the south eastern port city of Mariupol. The Pentagon said on Thursday it did not know if Russia's convoy of military vehicles converging on Kyiv, which once stretched some 40 miles, ""still exists at this point"". ""It's been now so long,"" said spokesman John Kirby. ""They never really accomplished their mission."" The stalled convoy was never re-supplied, he noted, and was making little effort to advance on the capital even before Moscow announced its plans to reposition troops. âWe don't think that they properly planned for logistics and sustainment of a force that size in the field under combat conditions,â Kirby said. âIt's also a function of Ukrainian resistance and agility and frankly, just battlefield smarts,â he added. This video can not be played A 3D model earlier this month showed the size of the Russian convoy Nick BeakeBBC News Europe correspondent, in Brussels The EU is to urge China not to provide weapons to Russia in its war on Ukraine, nor give President Putin relief from Western sanctions. China's President Xi Jinping â who has refused to condemn Moscowâs attack on its neighbour - will hold a three-hour virtual summit with officials on Friday, including President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. At the start of February, China and Russia issued a long, joint declaration saying theirs was a relationship with ""no limits"". European leaders were worried by what they saw as a manifesto to redefine the international order. A few weeks later, President Putin invaded Ukraine. Western officials now believe Moscow has asked Beijing for military assistance and other help to cushion the blow of sanctions. EU sources say von der Leyen will urge President Xi to reject such Russian requests and instead use Chinaâs might to bring the fighting to an end â arguing the damage to the global economy benefits no one. But Chinaâs foreign minister has praised Russia this week for, in his words, preventing a large-scale humanitarian crisis and insisted the relationship with Moscow was heading in the right direction. Brussels officials are not expecting any significant agreement from the virtual talks but hope China will consider dissuading Putin from using weapons of mass destruction as his war grinds on. Yvette Cooper said the situation people were facing was ""Kafkaesque"" The UK has two visa schemes for Ukrainian refugees: The Ukraine Family Scheme, for people with a close relative living in the UK, and Homes for Ukraine, which allows people to sponsor named refugees, housing them in their homes or buildings. But thousands of families are being ""left in limbo"" as a result of bureaucracy, Labour has warned. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs earlier today that the schemes are not working, and went on to give a number of examples. ""A businesswoman who is trying to get her sister and daughter to come here on the family visa scheme is still waiting, 10 days since she applied to the Home Office. ""A constituent of mine in Pontefract who applied under the Homes for Ukraine scheme has been waiting nearly two weeks to hear anything back from the Home Office. ""Another British host who has applied for a visa for a woman undergoing a high-risk pregnancy [has been] waiting 12 days for a reply, despite the Home Office helpline saying she'd be treated as a priority."" On Wednesday, the UK said it had issued 2,700 visas through the Homes for Ukraine scheme and 22,800 under the Ukraine Family Scheme, which has been running for longer. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC South Asia Correspondent, Delhi Russiaâs Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has
touched down in India, the latest official to visit in what feels like a
conveyor belt of diplomacy. In the last week or so, delegations from China,
America, Germany, Japan and Mexico have also passed through. Lavrovâs
arrival came just as UK Foreign Secretary Liz Trusswrapped up a day of meetings in Delhi.While sheâs unlikely to bump into Lavrov, the fact
theyâre both here at the same time is an indication of how India is being wooed
from all sides. New Delhi has remained neutral on the issue of Ukraine. Prime
Minister Modi has called for the violence to end, but has stopped short of
denouncing Russiaâs actions. Fridayâs talks with Lavrov are expected to
include discussions on how India can buy more cheap oil from Russia, using a
payment system that would not breach sanctions regulations. But the US deputy
national security adviser Daleep Singh, who is yet another visitor in Delhi
today, warned there would be âconsequences
to countries that actively attempt to circumvent or backfill the
sanctions"". India is keen to stress that Russian oil makes up a tiny
proportion of its overall purchases and that the EU still buys far more. India's position remains one of
neutrality. Here, Moscow remains a friend, not a foe. As Thursday draws to an end in Ukraine, here are some pictures of people affected by the war on the 36th day of Russia's invasion. Relatives of a Ukrainian soldier, Yuriy Oliynyk, attend his burial in the western city of Lviv This man was among several people brought to a centre in Kyiv after being evacuated from the town of Irpin Xenia comforts her baby Alexander in a refugee centre in Lviv station, after fleeing her home in Kyiv A Ukrainian soldier carries a child from a displaced family across a river on the outskirts of Kyiv Refugees are still arriving in Poland, although the UN says numbers have slowed in recent days Russia is now a ""lesser country"" as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, says UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. Speaking to Sky News, he adds: ""President Putin is not the force he used to be. He is now a man in a cage he built himself. ""His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. ""The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed. ""He has not only got to live with the consequences of what he is doing to Ukraine, but he has also got to live with the consequences of what he has done to his own army."" Wallace says Russian forces appear to be regrouping and shifting their focus towards the south and east of Ukraine. ""We have seen it before. It always gets worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas."" He adds that international allies have agreed to supply more military equipment and ""lethal aid"" to Ukraine, including armoured vehicles and long-range artillery and ammunition. The US president has told journalists he is sceptical of Russian claims that it would pull troops away from Kyiv and focus on the east of the country. ""It's an open question whether he's actually pulling back,"" Joe Biden told journalists. ""Thus far, there is no clear evidence that he's pulling all his forces out of Kyiv. There is also evidence that he's beefing up his troops down in the Donbass area,"" he said. ""I don't know the answer, it appears so far...  the idea that he's pulling all his troops out from around Kyiv and moving south - there's no evidence he's done that,"" he added If you're just joining us, here is a recap of some of the main developments today: On the international stage:  On the ground: Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said Putin had damaged himself through a series of ""catastrophic misjudgements"" Earlier this afternoon, the head of Britain's armed forces gave his update on the war. In a speech followed by a question-and-answer session at the Institute for Government think tank, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin echoed sentiments made elsewhere by the UK and US, that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been ""misled"" about the effectiveness of his country's armed forces. He said the UK was ""incredibly cautious"" about believing Russian claims of withdrawing from the capital Kyiv but said there did appear to be signs the Kremlin was preparing to focus its efforts on the east and south of Ukraine. ""We are starting to see the early indications of those forces being moved back from Kyiv and retreating to both Russia and Belarus,"" Radakin said. ""That in itself is a difficult evolution for Russia because they are doing that under contact, so Ukraine armed forces will attack those Russian forces as they retreat."" Radakin, who replaced General Sir Nick Carter in the top job late last year, warned the coming weeks would ""continue to be very difficult"" for Ukraine, before adding: ""But in many ways, Putin has already lost. ""Far from being the far-sighted manipulator of events that he would have us believe, Putin has damaged himself through a series of catastrophic misjudgements."" US President Joe Biden says Russian President Vladimir Putin ""seems to be self-isolating"". ""There's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,"" he claims. ""I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time because we don't have that much hard evidence."" More now from US President Joe Biden. He says moving towards clean energy will help Americans deal with rising fuel prices. The US must ""double down on clean energy"", Biden says, which includes passing his bill currently before Congress. Biden says he's issuing a directive to strengthen the US's clean energy economy, using the Defense Production Act - which gives the government increased power over domestic industries in emergencies. This will help secure American supply chains and reduce dependence on China and other countries for materials such as lithium, nickel and graphite, which are used in electric cars and energy storage, he says, in order to ""build a made-in-America clean energy future"". This, he says, will save Americans money. President Biden said high oil prices were ""hitting Americans at the pump"" US President Joe Biden is speaking about the way high oil prices are ""hitting Americans at the pump"". ""I know how much it hurts,"" he says. He says banning Russian oil imports was ""the right thing to do"" but it would ""come with a cost"". Biden says US oil companies are recording increasing profits and have a choice: Between putting these to use by producing more oil, giving US people a break, or ""they can exploit the situation"". Biden says he is announcing a ""use-it-or-lose it"" policy, where companies will face fees for idle wells if they do not restart production.  President Joe Biden is now announcing plans to release a record amount of oil from US strategic stockpiles, in response to the Ukraine war. We'll bring you updates from what he says. Wyre DaviesBBC News, Zaporizhzhia Here in Zaporizhzhia, the last big city in Ukrainian held territory in the south east, local officials and aid workers are preparing to receive thousands of refugees from Mariupol. Tens of thousands of people are trapped in the city after weeks of fighting and heavy Russian bombardments. Organised by the Ukrainian government in conjunction with the Red Cross, the convoy of 45 buses, supported by medical vehicles, will depart from Zaporizhzhia on Friday but only if all sides can agree on a 24 hour ceasefire around the city. Previous attempts to establish humanitarian corridors from Mariupol failed after vehicles were attack on the roads out. A spokesperson for the ICRC said it was âdesperately important the operation takes place - the lives of tens of thousands of people in Mariupol depend on it"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor For
the Kremlin this is designed to suggest a dramatic escalation in the economic
battle between the West and Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir
Putinhas outlined a pathway for the cutting off gas supplies to Europe, if
Western customers refuse to pay for supplies in the Russian currency the
rouble. However, the market reaction suggests the details of the mechanism, means that, in
practice, European customers will just have to change their currency dealers to
Gazprombank. That bank has already been left unsanctioned, for the purpose of
continuity of energy trade. As a
result, gas prices remain very high, but did not today shoot into the
stratosphere. There should be a work-around. As one leading analyst told me,
this solution has âsaved faceâ for Putin, who can sound tough on domestic TV.
Ultimately, as Russian officials have repeatedly said for decades, Russian
supply of energy to the West continued uninterrupted even during the height of
the Cold War. Ultimately,
Russia still needs the money for the gas and still wants to leave the
possibility of a market for its main export, once a peace deal is signed.
However, it is also true to say that the threat of a cut-off has escalated. EU
nations have prepared emergency measures to manage demand, and would be more
willing to face that now during spring and summer than winter. The
net effect of the mechanism announced is to limit the ability of the West to
freeze the revenues they pay to Gazprom, which Putin described as receiving the
gas for free. Some Ukrainian officials have suggested such an approach. Oil and
gas dollars and euros continue to help the Kremlin resist an otherwise tough
set of financial sanctions. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
