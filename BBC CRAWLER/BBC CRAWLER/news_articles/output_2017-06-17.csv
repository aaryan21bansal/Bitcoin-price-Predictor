How Helen Fawkes filled her years with life,"A week ago, the BBC journalist Helen Fawkes died from ovarian cancer at the age of 45. In the last few years of her life she wrote a blog about living with the disease. It was warm, honest and often funny and included what she described as her ""list for living"" - her way of making the most of the life she had. From the moment Helen Fawkes was first diagnosed with cancer, she knew her life could be cut short. The diagnosis came not long after her 30th birthday, and a move to London to take up a job with BBC 5 Live radio. Back then, the disease motivated Helen to pursue her dream of becoming a foreign correspondent. So, when she had recovered, she moved first to Moscow as a radio producer, then to Kiev, Sarajevo and Belgrade as a BBC reporter. When she returned to the BBC in London, she began working on a book describing how cancer had changed her life for the better. By this point, she was confident she was free of the disease. But shortly after her 40th birthday she began experiencing pain and was told, in early 2012, that the cancer had returned. Her doctors had discovered a tumour the size of a pea in her abdomen. It was then that Helenstarted her blog,external. ""Most people are just so stunned by the news that they're not sure how to respond,"" she wrote. ""A few friends have suggested I write about this as they were stuck for words."" In her first few entries she writes in clear journalistic detail about the operation to remove her tumour. Listen to Helen Fawkes' radio documentary,the Bucket List, which she made in 2013 for the BBC World Service By talking about her own lists for living and asking others about theirs, Helen considers what people want to grab from life when faced with death It turned out she had many more tumours than the doctors originally thought. They were removed successfully, but Helen had an extreme allergic reaction to the pain killers. ""I started to dream about a group of people. I could hear their voices in the distance,"" she writes of lying in the hospital bed. ""'Can you hear us Helen?' they seemed to ask. ""'Yes of course I can hear you all,' I thought to myself and ignored them."" Eventually she did open her eyes. ""In doing so, I chose to live,"" she writes. Helen's operation was followed by rounds of punishing chemotherapy.  She wrote about how she liked to think of her drugs as a Daniel Craig James Bond. ""I imagined my own microscopic army of special agents,"" she wrote, as she described the pain and exhaustion brought on by her treatment. She always found something to laugh about. Much of her blog became devoted to the matter of hair loss and her choice of wigs - she named two of her more outrageous blonde ones Raquel and Candice. She wore Candice to the premiere of the Bond film, Skyfall - which she had been invited to by a cancer charity. By the end of 2012, it appeared the worst was over. Helen was declared cancer-free by her doctors and returned to work determined, she wrote, to enjoy her second chance at life. But, just before Christmas, she received the devastating news that her cancer had returned. This time, she was told, she would never be free of it. ""All I can now do is try to destroy each tumour every time I get one,"" she wrote. ""I'm not terminally ill, but I will die a lot sooner than I ever imagined."" With the news, Helen went back to an idea that had helped her when she was first diagnosed with cancer in 2001. She called it aList for Living,external- a plan of all the things she wanted to do before she died. ""When I wrote my first List for Living it included dreams that I thought were practically impossible,"" she wrote. ""The list led me to achieve more than I ever imagined. Now I hope that what will be my last List for Living will again give my life purpose with incredible goals to aim for."" The list contained 50 ambitions. Some, like pulling a pint in a real pub, were easy to achieve. Others were travel destinations - Rome, the Amalfi Coast, the mountains of Nepal. Some, like going into space, seemed almost impossible, though her name was engraved on a microchip carried by Nasa's Osiris-Rex spacecraft, launched in September last year. 41) Be a model and work the catwalk (DONE!) Two of the most important items she achieved quite quickly - moving to the countryside and buying her own house. Helen moved back to her home county of Gloucestershire, close to her parents. While there, she ticked off another item - holding an exhibition of cow photographs she had taken entitled, Have I got MOOs for you. Friends pitched in to help her with other ambitions. One arranged for her to speed around a racetrack with the Formula 1 driver, David Coulthard. Others took her on trips to see Stonehenge at sunrise and the northern lights in Norway. ""It was spectacular to watch the aurora dance for us,"" she wrote. At the same time, Helen was enduring what seemed like endless rounds of chemo. She was also coming to terms with her diagnosis. ""You grieve for the life you hoped that you'd lead,"" she wrote. ""While it has been horrendous, it hasn't been quite as bad as you'd think. ""I'll never be happy with this cruel twist of fate but half a year on from the diagnosis something has changed, something that I couldn't have imagined happening. ""I now feel like I have acceptance of the situation."" In 2013, Helen was awarded an honorary fellowship by her old university, Goldsmiths College in London. She was recognised not only for her work as a journalist, but also for the impact that her blog was making through its positive and honest portrayal of life with a terminal disease. Helen wrote that she disliked the seriousness that surrounded cancer. ""I don't want constant sadness,"" she wrote. ""Having a deadly disease doesn't kill off your sense of humour or even your desire to have some fun."" And, in between the gruelling medical treatments, she did continue to have fun - ticking off more and more items on her list. She presented a programme on Radio 4, slid down a zip wire, went glassblowing and drove along the Amalfi coast with an old friend. At the same time, she continued to work shifts as a news reporter for the BBC, with the encouragement of  her doctors. In 2015, after experimental treatment reversed the progress of her cancer, Helen had her first long stretch without chemotherapy since 2011 - which she described as her ""record-breaking chemo holiday"". ""You wake up and feel well,"" she wrote. ""That's such an incredible feeling."" At this point, her blog entries become sparse. Friends say that this was, in part, because Helen was busy getting on with other things. After moving back to Gloucestershire she had joined a film club. There she became friends with a man called Luke and after a few months, their friendship turned into something more. Although Helen didn't mention this explicitly in her blog, Luke was clearly in the background as she ticked off more List for Living items - riding a steam train, flying a kite and seeing puffins in the Faroe Islands. Then in March 2016, Helen found out that the new treatment had failed to stop the progression of her disease. ""It's such a harsh blow,"" she wrote. ""I know this is expected and I realise that I had a much bigger chemo holiday than predicted, but it doesn't make it any easier to accept."" More chemo followed, and with it came exhaustion. By this point, Helen was hardly writing anything at all. But early this year, she did post a story. She described how she was able to tick off one of the most treasured items on her list. ""I got married!!!"" she wrote. ""This was the last thing on my List for Living that I really wanted to do and it is the most special. This was much more than just ticking something off a list. ""So much more."" That was Helen's last entry. The final pictures on Helen's blog show her beaming next to her new husband. ""It's not the years in your life that matter,"" she had written. ""It's the life in your years."" Move to the countryside (DONE!) Live in my own house (DONE!) Enjoy walks with Sasha the dog (DONE!) Play a netball game, again (DONE!) Recover from chemo on a ridiculously perfect beach (DONE!) Have a day at the zoo (DONE!) Go to Paris by Eurostar just for lunch (DONE!) Visit Pompeii and drive along the Amalfi coast (DONE!)

"How did holiday to North Korea end in jail, and a coma?","This video can not be played Otto Warmbier, fourth from right, is seen shortly before his arrest Everyone in frame is smiling and laughing in the North Korean cold. Otto Warmbier, like the other tourists, launches a snowball, captured in slow motion on what appears to be a camera phone. It's the kind of innocent fun you expect to be captured on a tour group holiday. Otto turns to his right, mouth wide open, laughing. ""This is the Otto I know and love. This is my brother,"" wrote Austin Warmbier, who released the video, which was shot during a three-night North Korea tour at the end of 2015. Two months later, Otto would again appear on video, but in very different circumstances. Head bowed and clutching a prepared ""confession"", the 21-year-old student walked out in front of North Korean TV cameras to speak, explaining why he had been arrested at the end of that tour, when everyone else had been allowed to leave. Otto (centre, with others on the trip) was ""bright, intelligent and likeable"", according to Danny Gratton, who met him on the North Korea trip Looming over him were the oversized portraits of North Korea's former supreme leaders, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. He wore a cream-coloured jacket and tie. Before speaking, he got up and offered a low bow. Otto thanked the North Korean government for the ""opportunity to apologise for my crime, to beg for forgiveness and to beg for any assistance to save my life"". He said he tried to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel as a ""trophy"" for a US church with the ""connivance of the US administration"" in order to ""harm the work ethic and motivation of the Korean people"". Weeks after the group pictures were taken, Otto ""confessed"" in front of North Korean media Later, he would break down in tears: ""I have made the single worst decision of my life, but I am only human."" On 13 June, Otto Warmbier returned to the US after 17 months of captivity in North Korea. But he was in a coma, could not communicate and had severe brain damage. One week later, he was dead. His family blamed the ""awful torturous mistreatment"" they say he received from North Korea. Much remains unknown about how Otto's health deteriorated. Doctors at Cincinnati Medical Center say they saw no sign he was physically abused but they and his family also don't buy North Korea's story that he contracted botulism and fell into a coma after taking a sleeping pill. This video can not be played Otto said he was ""a poor scapegoat"" But how did a brilliant student from an Ohio suburb with hopes of becoming an investment banker end up imprisoned in a pariah state? The Warmbiers hail from a small suburb called Wyoming in Cincinnati, Ohio, where father Fred owns a small company. Otto attended the best high school in the state, and was prom and homecoming king. He was not only popular but also studious - he graduated as Salutatorian (the second-highest ranking student in his year) - and a talented athlete. His football coach has said he was a gifted player and a natural leader. Otto went on to study economics and commerce with a minor in global sustainability at the University of Virginia and flourished there, according to the Washington Post. Danny was the last person to see Otto (far right), witnessing the moment he was marched away The newspaper interviewed Otto's classmates at their graduation ceremony in May, where #FreeOtto stickers were handed out. The 22-year-old was in his third year of university when he was detained in North Korea. This should have been his graduation too. Friends described him as a ""sports fan who can reel off stats about seemingly any team, a friendly Midwesterner who can break down underground rap lyrics (and craft some of his own), a deep thinker who would challenge himself and others to question their place in the world, a guy from an entrepreneurial family who ate half-price sushi, an insatiably curious person with a strong work ethic and a delight in the ridiculous,"" the paperreported,external. Otto is said to have known long before his college peers what he wanted to pursue as a career: investment banking. According to his LinkedIn profile, he sat on the committee of a student investment fund and travelled to London in 2015 to complete a course in advanced econometrics at the London School of Economics. Danny made a joke - not realising how serious the situation was for his new friend His studiousness - and interest in travel - were what took him to Asia. Otto had been set to study at a university in Hong Kong on a study abroad programme in January 2016 and decided to stop in North Korea on the way. He went through a China-based company called Young Pioneer Tours, which boasts of providing ""budget travel to destinations your mother would rather you stayed away from"". Danny Gratton, from Staffordshire in the UK, shared a room with Otto during the three-night trip - they were the only two members of the tour group who were there on their own. ""From the second I met him we hit it off. He was very bright, intelligent and likeable,"" he told the BBC. The night Otto is said to have tried to take the sign from within a staff-only area of the 1,000-room Yanggakdo International Hotel was New Year's Eve 2015, the second night of the tour. Otto - pictured in ear muffs - was in ""the wrong place at the wrong time"", says Danny Earlier, the group had taken a trip to the border with South Korea before returning, having a meal and taking a coach to Pyongyang's main square, where there was a big fireworks display. They had food and drank beer, Mr Gratton said. However there was no rowdy behaviour - ""It wasn't that sort of holiday,"" Mr Gratton said. ""We toed the line."" He said there was ""no indication at all"" that Otto had taken the hotel propaganda sign and he had not mentioned it. The North Korean government has releasedgrainy video footage,externalshowing a dark figure whose face cannot be seen removing a sign in a corridor. Otto was taken away by guards as the pair went through immigration control at Pyongyang International Airport on 2 January 2016. Otto is accused of stealing a sign from the Yanggakdo hotel, seen on the left - but Danny told the BBC it ""wasn't that sort of holiday"". ""We toed the line,"" he said ""We were the last two people to go through passport control. We handed over our passports and the guy pointed at Otto and pointed to the door. Two security guards came over and ushered him away,"" said Mr Gratton. ""I made an ironic comment. I actually said 'Well we won't be seeing you again'. He sort of laughed at me and that was the last we saw of him. ""They made the decision to take an American. It was just his time, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time."" Later, once the remaining group arrived in Beijing, one of the tour guides is reported to have spoken to Otto on the phone, who said he had a ""severe headache and wanted to be taken to the hospital"", the Postreports,external, citing another passenger. Otto is transferred from a medical transport plane to an ambulance in Cincinnati Troy Collings from Young Pioneer Tours told the BBC none of its employees had direct contact with Otto after he was escorted away. One guide stayed in Pyongyang to try to make contact and offer assistance but was unable to do so, he said. Otto's detention was the only time the North Korean legal authorities had taken issue with anyone on a tour, Mr Collings added. In a statement after his death, Young Pioneer Tours said it would no longer be taking Americans to North Korea. ""The way his detention was handled was appalling and a tragedy like this must never be repeated,"" it said in a statement. ""Despite constant requests, we were denied any opportunity to meet him or anyone in contact with him in Pyongyang, only receiving assurances that he was fine."" North Korea only confirmed that Otto had been arrested weeks later, on 22 January. He gave his televised statement in late February and was given 15 years' hard labour, for crimes against the state, in March. Observers said the sentence seemed unusually high for a foreigner and could be related to deepening tensions between North Korea and the US over the former's nuclear programme. It's unclear what happened to Otto between his sentencing and the announcement of his release on 14 June by the US government. But his father Fred says he slipped into the coma ""the day after he was sentenced"" - well over a year ago. Otto's father Fred wore his son's jacket as he spoke to journalists Speaking at a press conference wearing the same jacket worn by his son on the day he ""confessed"" in Pyongyang, he said the North Korean government had ""brutalised and terrorised"" Otto. North Korea says it released him on ""humanitarian grounds"". Intelligence agencies in the North might have kept the state of his health under wraps, including from top officials, out of fear, says Stephan Haggard, director of the Korea-Pacific Programme at the University of California, San Diego. At some stage, someone would have realised ""that the worst of all possible worlds is for the guy to die in custody"", kickstarting a frantic diplomatic effort to get him out, he told the AFP news agency. How harsh is prison in North Korea? Local businesses in Wyoming have also shown their support Dr Daniel Kanter, one of those looking after Otto in Cincinnati, said last week that he was in ""a state of unresponsive wakefulness"". He had not spoken but had ""spontaneous eye opening and blinking"", he said. Respiratory arrest is believed to be the cause of the brain damage, but it remains unclear what caused it. There are no signs that Otto was beaten. When the plane carrying Otto touched down last week, people gathered at the airport cheered. ""It's just been so long that he's been there that to hear he is actually coming home was incredible,"" his college roommate Emmett Saulnier told CNN before Otto arrived. He was carried out with a tube attached to his nose, and sent straight to hospital by ambulance. Dr Kanter (C) says Otto is in a state of ""unresponsive wakefulness"" The University of Virginia welcomed his return, but President Teresa Sullivan said the community was ""deeply concerned and saddened"" to learn of his condition. ""I knelt down by his side and I hugged him and I told him I missed him and I was so glad he made it home,"" Fred Warmbier said. ""These things are tough to process but he's with us and we're trying to make him comfortable and we want to be a part of his life."" But on 19 June, the Warmbier family announced that Otto had ""completed his journey home"" and died in hospital surrounded by his family. They repeated their insistence that North Korea had killed him. ""The awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today.""

Coming out as Tory was harder than coming out as bisexual," When 18-year-old Megan McGowan told her family she was a Conservative, it was much harder than when she came out as bisexual. Megan’s parents had been completely fine with her sexual orientation. Her mother, Linda, sent her a text: “Your father and I would never judge you, or anything you do. Unless you become a Tory or a mass murderer. Well, even then we probably wouldn't judge you.” A year later, when she broke the news of her political sympathies to Linda, Megan remembered that ""probably"". The two of them were sitting in the front room of their council house in Donnington, Shropshire, eating pasta for dinner. “Mum, I think I'm a Tory,” Megan said. Linda, 57, a home care assistant, tried to process this. Her own father had never forgiven her for failing to turn out to vote in the 1979 general election, the first year she was eligible. He had lost his job under a Tory government when the local steelworks closed, and always held Linda personally responsible for the rise of Margaret Thatcher. Linda had stayed true to Labour ever since, and so had her husband Kevin, 63, an engineer. “Oh, your dad’s not going to be happy at all,” she told Megan. “He’s going to be very annoyed.” Growing up, Megan had always assumed she was Labour, because her parents were Labour. The family would all watch Have I Got News For You together, and afterwards Linda and Kevin would tell her Labour were the good guys, while the Tories only cared about the rich. Before the 2015 general election, Megan joined the Labour Party. She was 16 and it hadn’t occurred to her that she might support any other. She stayed up to watch Ed Miliband’s party crash to defeat even though she had a GCSE physics exam the next day. In the wake of Labour’s loss, though, Megan started to re-think her allegiances. She went to watch a party leadership hustings in Birmingham where Jeremy Corbyn spoke. She wasn’t impressed. I thought, yes, he's a nice man. But I could never vote for him, and if he was leader he would be a terrible one.” When she shared this opinion on Twitter, Megan found herself being trolled. “It was, you know, get out of my party, Tory scum, Red Tory, you're a traitor, eff off and join the Tories.” Once the leadership results were declared, Megan thought: “I can’t do this any more.” The Labour Party didn’t feel like a welcoming place, so she quit. She started reading Thatcher’s autobiography and liked what she discovered. The former prime minister’s emphasis on thrift reminded Megan of the values she had been brought up with. Coming from a working-class background we were taught very early on that money does not grow on trees and you need to really watch your bank account and you need to keep an eye on your budgets.” It was the EU referendum that finally brought home to Megan that she was a Tory. She had supported Remain, and found herself feeling sorry to see David Cameron resign and George Osborne face the sack. Their brand of socially liberal conservatism, she now realised, echoed her own, and she feared it was now at risk. “That made me think: ‘Well, there's something to defend here, isn't there? I might as well as grit my teeth and say: Yeah, I'm a Conservative.’” This put Megan out of step with her age group. Among 18 and 19-year-olds, YouGov found Labour had a 47-point lead over the Tories. On the other hand, the same study found the Conservatives performed best among C2, or skilled working-class voters, of which there are many in Donnington. Days later, Megan broke the news to her mum. But she wasn’t ready to tell her dad. Instead, she started dropping hints. She’d sit reading her Thatcher book and make approving comments about it. Or Prime Minister’s Questions would come on television, and she’d say she agreed with what Theresa May had just said. Eventually, the penny dropped. My dad is a reasonable man, and so he respected it.” Kevin knew she hadn’t taken the decision lightly, and he was proud that she knew her own mind. “If that’s who she is that’s who she is and that that's fine by me,” he said. Linda still isn’t “overly impressed”, according to Megan. The household has settled on a kind of detente. Unlike other homes on the estate, theirs had no election poster in the window. “We just don't talk about it, do we?” says Linda. “I mean, if something like Question Time is on, we sort of have - not disagreements. But I start saying something, and Megan just goes…” She raises her finger to her lips. “I do not do that,” says Megan. “You do!” says Linda. “You put your finger up and you tell me: ‘Shhh,’ like that.” “If someone’s talking across Question Time I will sort of gesture and say: ‘Shh, please,’” Megan admits. “I’d like to listen to what’s being said.’” Matteo Bergamini spent two days looking at his postal ballot before filling it in. Once the 25-year-old from Harrow, north London, wouldn't have been in any doubt - he’d been a Liberal Democrat, and an active one at that. But now he was torn between his old party and Labour. “I was sitting there looking at the two boxes, thinking about it,” he says. At the age of 16, Matteo had joined the Lib Dems. He’d liked their socially liberal policies and their pledge to scrap tuition fees. Above all, he liked the fact they looked different from the other parties. “Labour and the Conservatives I saw as very similar,” he says. After a decade in government, the former in particular looked tired and shop-worn. “It was the sort of New Labour leftovers, essentially.” He canvassed and leafleted for the Lib Dems in the run-up to the 2010 election. Unlike some others in the party, he wasn’t troubled at first when the coalition was announced – they were in power now, after all. But then the party broke its pledge not to vote for any rise in tuition fees. The policy affected Matteo directly – he was about to start a politics degree at Brunel University, and cancelled his plan for a gap year to avoid the extra expense. His faith in the Lib Dems was shattered, too. It was quite a shock for me. I thought: ‘Is this what politics is? Why am I getting involved with this?’” Gradually he stepped back from his involvement in the party, then cancelled his membership altogether. But in 2015 he voted Lib Dem again, albeit without a great deal of enthusiasm. They were the “best of a bad bunch”, he thought. By now, Matteo had left university, and life in the real world was proving tough. He wanted to buy a flat, but it dawned on him that astronomical property prices meant it would never happen. His friends had insecure jobs on zero-hours contracts. He’d set up his own business, and it angered him that companies like Google weren’t paying their fair share of tax while start-ups like his own were paying the full rate. “I started to realise how the next generation are royally screwed. I started to realise how much easier the previous generation had it.” Since the election, pundits have focused on the role of students in pushing up the Labour vote. But according to Prof Ben Lauderdale of the London School of Economics, 25-to-44-year-old voters like Matteo made a bigger difference. Matteo hadn’t taken much notice of Jeremy Corbyn when he was elected Labour leader: Corbyn looked like a bumbling idiot from the way the media were portraying him.” But then he went to see Corbyn speak for himself, and he was impressed with what he heard. “It wasn't the Ed Miliband, Tony Blair Labour,” he says. “I think Jeremy Corbyn's Labour recognises there's a big issue with housing. They realise that there's a small group that makes huge profits and pay very little into society.” As the 2017 election campaign wore on, Corbyn no longer looked like a liability to Labour and Theresa May no longer appeared strong and stable. “It was like they flipped,” says Matteo. He had a decision to make. Matteo’s pen hovered over the ballot paper. Something needed to be done for his generation, he thought, something radical and urgent. And then put a cross next to the Labour candidate’s name. In her Edinburgh flat, Tomiwa Folorunso watched the election results with a mixture of emotions. Tomiwa was a committed Labour supporter. She had overcome her misgivings about Jeremy Corbyn and was overjoyed the party had bucked predictions of electoral collapse. But she hadn’t voted Labour. Tomiwa, 22, had just finished a history degree at Edinburgh University. She had grown up in a scholarly family - her parents had moved to Scotland from Nigeria so her father could study for his PhD. My dad, like other academics, tended to be left-wing or socialist in his thinking.” Her support for Labour was instinctive. Labour were against the Tories, and the Tories were elitists who didn’t care about the poor. There was no way she could ever support them. In the 2014 independence referendum she had voted No, seeing independence as a leap into the unknown. But unlike many No voters, she saw the referendum as a positive experience. “It definitely opened a debate and a conversation about Scottish politics in general,” she says. “I think that was a good thing.” The following year’s general election saw a surge of support for the Scottish National Party (SNP). Many former Labour voters who thought independence offered a chance to end Conservative rule from Westminster, switched sides. But Tomiwa wasn’t among them. It made me deeply sad to see all these left-wing people deserting the Labour party.” She disagreed with the SNP on independence and was critical of its record running Scotland’s education system. Tomiwa admired Ed Miliband, disliked what she saw as his unfair treatment by the media, and on that occasion cast her ballot for Labour. She had reservations about the rise of Jeremy Corbyn, though. “I was like: ‘It's great we have this leader and I like a lot of his policies and I like the fact he sticks to his guns - but people are not going to vote for him.’” But after Theresa May called her snap election, and the polls started shifting in Corbyn’s favour, Tomiwa was overjoyed at the possibility that “someone that left-wing could win in this country”. Many other graduates appear to have been thinking the same thing. According to YouGov, Labour beat the Conservatives among those with a university degree by 49% to 32%. Tomiwa had moved her electoral registration to her student flat near Edinburgh’s Meadows, just south of the university campus. She assumed she lived in Edinburgh South - at the time the only Labour seat in Scotland - and looked forward to voting for her preferred party. But then she realised she was wrong – she lived in Edinburgh East, which was held by the SNP. The newspapers were reporting a surge in support for the Scottish Conservatives, and Tomiwa feared voting Labour here would let the Tories in. Whatever her disagreements with the SNP, they were nothing compared to her dislike of the Conservatives. On 8 June, she put a cross next to the name of the SNP candidate. “It was really weird,” she says. That night it turned out that the swing to the Tories in Edinburgh East was smaller than Tomiwa had feared, and Labour remained in second place after the SNP. “I felt bad switching my allegiance, but I wanted my vote to matter,"" she says. ""If a Tory had got in I would have felt a lot worse.” Mark Francos never imagined he'd end up voting Tory. In Washington, just outside Sunderland, there were two main strands of opinion, he remembers: “Labour till we die, or apathy.” Everyone said the Tories had closed down the shipyards and the coal mines. Plus, thought Mark, George Osborne looked like he was enjoying the cuts too much. Labour, the establishment in the North East, didn’t appear any more attractive. But UKIP – UKIP were a different matter. Mark had always been suspicious of the European Union. His grandfather was a Latvian refugee who had fled his homeland when it was annexed by the Soviet Union. “He was always like: ‘Protect your own country and never give in to something bigger,’ because he’d seen his country being absorbed in something bigger without its choice.” At Northumbria University, Mark made friends from around the world, and he thought it was unfair that someone from the EU could enter the UK freely and work, while someone from India couldn’t. “They had to jump through so many different hoops compared with someone from Europe,” he says. “I didn't see how that was right.” Mark started watching videos on YouTube about the evils of the EU. The Tories, he thought, were “very wishy-washy” on Europe. Soon he was a UKIP member. UKIP were more to the right on some issues and more to the left on others, certain economic issues.” This suited Mark. He wanted out of the EU but he thought the railways should be nationalised. He’d watched his mum die of cancer when he was 16, and thought UKIP would spend more on the NHS. There were plenty of other UKIP voters in Washington, but lots who strongly disliked the party, too. When he shared pro-UKIP stories on Facebook, people would call him a Nazi. This didn’t put him off. What did, however, were his fellow UKIP members. “The big issue, it always has been, it always will be, is the people,” he says. You’d have some barmy, barmy person somewhere who’d just say the most ridiculous thing - some ridiculously racist thing or something homophobic, 'Gay people are responsible for flooding,' or something like that - and it would get rid of any legitimacy the party would have.” And then Brexit actually happened. “It was all well and good being opposed to the EU beforehand,” says Mark. “But we also needed to work out what was next.” The court challenges to Brexit concentrated his mind. Labour looked too divided on the issue, and anyway he didn’t like Jeremy Corbyn’s record on Northern Ireland. So he was left with the Tories. “They’re not perfect. But I think if you’re agreeing entirely with a party, I think there’s something wrong with you. They’re saying the right things and at least they want to get along with it.” BBC Newsnight’s Chris Cook has observed that the Conservatives gained on Labour in seats where UKIP did well in 2015 and stood again in 2017. This is what happened in Mark's constituency of Washington and Sunderland West. A few days before the election, as Mark sat on a bench in Sunderland’s Mowbray Park, across the pond from the Winter Gardens, he considered the abuse he might get for voting Tory. It couldn’t be worse than the venom he experienced as a UKIP member, he thought. “That’s probably made it possible for people to now change to the Conservative Party,"" he says. ""It's kind of like a gateway. It's now made it actually almost acceptable to vote that way.” Built with Shorthand"
Tower block fires: Did government act on advice?,"In the wake of the disaster at a west London tower block in which 30 people have been confirmed dead so far, there have been accusations that the government has ignored lessons from previous tower block fires. Over the past few decades, successive governments have made changes to fire regulations for residential premises, to try to reduce deaths. Modern high-rise buildings in England, Scotland and Wales must be fitted with sprinklers, but calls for more to be done to improve safety in older tower blocks increased following major fires in south London in 2009 and in Southampton in 2010. Following the disastrous fire at Grenfell Tower in west London this week, which quickly engulfed the 24-storey block, the government has been accused of failing to ensure sprinklers were fitted to older blocks and of failing to update building regulations. Ministers have stressed that at this stage, the exact cause of the Grenfell Tower fire is not known, but Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC that following such a high number of deaths: ""Clearly something has gone disastrously wrong ... something needs to change"". The former Conservative housing minister Mark Prisk told BBC Radio 5live that clearly not enough time had been spent reviewing fire safety in recent years and ministers ""need to do more"". There has been criticism that warnings were ignored from a coroner's report in March 2013 following a deadly 2009 fire in south London - at Lakanal House in Southwark. CoronerFrances Kirkham wrote to then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles,external, flagging up several areas of concern. She did not say sprinklers must be installed in all high-rise blocks but recommended that the government ""encourage"" housing providers responsible for high rise flats ""to consider the retro-fitting of sprinkler systems"". She said there was ""insufficient clarity"" on advice given to high-rise residents about what to do in case of a fire - and recommended the government publish new guidance about how advice to ""stay put"" should be seen in relation to the ""get out and stay out"" policy. Fire safety notice for residents in Grenfell Tower included the ""stay put"" advice On building regulations, the coroner said one of the documents - Approved Document B, which relates to fire safety - was ""a most difficult document to use"" and recommended it be reviewed. In particular it says the section relating to ""external fire spread"", regulation B4, should ""provide clear guidance"" with regard to ""the spread of fire"" over the outside of a building and whether ""attention should be paid to whether proposed [building] work might reduce existing fire protection"". Shadow housing secretary John Healey has said the government should ""start to act now"" on the coroner's report by ""installing sprinklers in the high-risk blocks"", overhauling the building regulations and ""make sure people do have clear advice and information when they live in high-rise blocks like this about what to do when there's a fire"". He has accused the government of having previously ""rejected out of hand even encouraging the retrofitting of these sprinkler systems in other high-rise blocks"". A major fire at the Lakanal House flats in 2009 killed six people, i Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC ""all recommendations were actioned"" following the coroner's report. His predecessor, Sir Eric Pickles,responded to the coroner,externalthat he was committed to making the safety of high-rise residents a ""priority"". He said ""detailed national guidance"" had been issued to councils over fire safety advice and about ""encouraging"" housing providers to ""consider"" fitting sprinklers to older blocks, following another coroner's recommendation. On the need to review fire safety building regulations, he said he had ""noted"" concerns and research had been commissioned which would ""feed into a future review"" which was expected to result in a new version of regulations to be published in 2016/17. No new laws were brought in to require landlords to ""retro-fit"" older high-rises with sprinklers. Since 2007 all new tower blocks in England over 30m high must be fitted with sprinklers by law. In Scotland, buildings over 18m high, must be fitted with sprinklers to meet building regulations introduced in 2005. In Wales, all new homes must have sprinklers. Before the coroner's report, in 2011, the Lib Dem DCLG minister Andrew Stunnelltold MPs,external:  ""It is the chief fire and rescue adviser's view that it would not be economically viable or practical to fit sprinklers to all existing high-rise residential buildings"" and it was up to individual landlords to decide if they were needed. The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association (BAFSA), the trade body for the fire sprinkler industry, said retrofitting Grenfell Tower with sprinklers might have cost Â£200,000. This is the figure for installing a sprinkler system but does not include potential maintenance fees or costs associated with the wider redevelopment of a building. Costing will of course vary from building to building. After the Shirley Towers fire in 2010, it cost the council Â£1m to install sprinklers in three tower blocks. The cost can be high because in blocks made of concrete and steel like Grenfell, the process is difficult and time-consuming. So the focus has been on other measures which would contain a fire to stop it spreading. A review of building regulations relating to fire safety was promised in 2016 but has not yet been published. Then housing minister Gavin Barwell - now Theresa May's chief of staff -said part B of the regulations would be reviewed,externalfollowing the Lakanal House fire. The DCLG has said it was ""simply not true"" to suggest ministers had ""sat"" on the review and work was continuing, after Labour MPs accused the government of kicking the issue ""into the long grass"". Ronnie King, the Labour chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety said the regulations ""badly need updating"" and ""three successive ministers have not done it"". He said he believed the government viewed the regulations as ""red tape"" that would place a burden on business. A report to the Home Office in the early 1990s, by the architect Sam Webb reportedly warned that many buildings did not meet basic standards. Areport by the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee published in 2000,externallooked at how fire could spread via external cladding systems. It concluded that the evidence did not suggest most cladding posed a serious fire risk but added: ""We do not believe that it should take a serious fire in which many people are killed before all reasonable steps are taken towards minimising the risks"".

The schoolteacher fighting Manny Pacquiao,"Horn's last defeat was on points against Ukraine's Denis Berinchyk at the London Olympics In the classroom he's known as Mr Horn. But in the ring, call him ""The Hornet"". A relatively unknown physical education (PE) teacher from Australia is weeks away from taking on Manny Pacquiao for boxing's world welterweight title. If 29-year-old Jeff Horn - the ""fighting schoolteacher"" as promoters have dubbed him - can match the reigning champion, his life could change forever. Eleven years ago, Horn was a self-described nerd from Brisbane who walked into a boxing club to learn self-defence. He read books, played board games in the library at lunchtime, and was often the victim of bullying. The only fighter in the family was his grandfather, Ray Horn, who put on exhibition matches in outback Queensland in the 1930s. His dad, Jeff Horn Sr, is a builder. His mum, Liza Sykstra, works for the St Vincent de Paul Society. ""I got into a few fights at high school,"" Horn told the BBC. ""I didn't win the majority of those fights either."" Jeff Horn is scheduled to fight Manny Pacquiao on 2 July But his trainer, Glenn Rushton, told Horn he could become an Australian champion and set about teaching him an unpredictable boxing style - ""broken rhythm pressure fighting"". In 2012, Horn made the Olympic boxing quarterfinals while studying for his education degree. He then turned professional. Working as a substitute teacher, Horns won prize purses sometimes as low as A$2,000 (Â£1,100, $1,500). Until recently, he taught students at Pallara State School in Brisbane. But now his full-time job is being the second-best welterweight boxer in the world - behind only Pacquiao. ""I'm a month out from the biggest fight of my life,"" Horn said, earlier in June. ""I've been getting messages from past students wishing me luck."" It has taken months of negotiations to bring about what's been hyped as the ""Battle of Brisbane"", scheduled for 2 July. An earlier proposed fight between Pacquiao and Britain's Amir Khan fell through. The event has, at least temporarily, rekindled Australia's interest in boxing. More than 50,000 people are expected to fill Queensland's Suncorp Stadium, with tickets selling for hundreds of dollars per seat. It will be televised in more than 150 countries, according to Horn's sports manager Jim Banaghan. Pacquiao has lost three of his last eight fights but is said to be keen for a knockout The boxer's wife and parents have even been pulled into some of the media attention. ""They're happy for me but they're nervous as well. They don't want to see me get hurt,"" Horn said. After Pacquiao's fight with Floyd Mayweather in 2015 became themost lucrative in history, the Australian bout may be regarded as something of a sideshow. Pacquiao may meet Mayweather for an anticipated rematch. Pacquiao, 38, is also a serving senator in his native Philippines. During a series of promotional news conferences in Australia in April, Pacquiao appeared more interested in his phone than his opponent. It was a scene to disappoint fans of boxing trash-talk: two clean-cut fighters speaking politely and respectfully about one another. Pacquiao is the only boxer in history to win world titles in eight weight divisions ""I know what my opponent is feeling right now is hunger,"" Pacquiao said. ""I've been there. I've been there in that situation. When I was starting, when I was young, even at night before I went to sleep, I was thinking about the fight."" Whatever the result, the fight will change Horn's life. Overnight he will become a millionaire. A victory could go down as one of most important in Australian sporting history. Legendary promoter Bob Arum, who notably worked with Muhammad Ali, said the huge hometown crowd could hand Horn the advantage to stage a monumental upset. ""If his fight with Pacquiao was in Vegas or Madison Square Garden in New York, I wouldn't give him much of a chance because I think nerves would take over,"" he told the Courier-Mail newspaper. ""But the fact that Jeff is going to be fighting in front of so many of his countrymen will calm his nerves and I think he will give a great account of himself."" If Horn wins his career-defining fight, Pacquiao will be granted a customary rematch Australian fighter Anthony Mundine, himself a three-time world champion, said an upset was possible but warns that 38-year-old Pacquiao is still a force to be reckoned with. ""Even though he is at his end and past his prime, I believe he is still a dangerous fighter,"" he told the Australian Associated Press. ""But anything can happen in boxing."" Horn has been training six days a week before the match, visualising the ring surrounded by thousands of screaming fans and sidestepping inside it with Pacquiao. Superficially, it's hard to imagine two more different fighters. Pacquiao spent his childhood living in poverty in the Philippines, and entered politics. Horn grew up in relative prosperity in Australia, and became a teacher. Do they have anything in common? ""We're both nice guys by the sound of it - except in the ring,"" Horn said. ""We're going to be throwing leather trying to finish each other off.""

How quilting got ripped apart by American politics,"A traditional-style quilt made by the artist Eric Suszynski, who has found himself at the centre of a row between liberal and conservative quilters Social media has breathed life into many hobbies and skills that once might have seemed old-fashioned, and quilting is one prime example. But now, in a symptom of America's divisive political climate, online communities devoted to this traditional American art form have been ripped apart. It started with political chat and ended up with abusive messages, calls for boycotts and an online civil war between liberals and conservatives. A familiar story, perhaps - only this time it happened in the world of quilting. The traditional American hobby has - like knitting, baking and other skills - been given a new lease of life by social media, throughReddit discussions,external, online commerce and the ease of spreading tips and knowledge via digital videos. But in recent weeks, online communities and bloggers have been discussing a series of screenshots which appear to show socially conservative quilters organising campaigns and hurling insults about other enthusiasts who don't share their political beliefs. The screenshots come from a Facebook group called ""Conservative with a Common Interest"", although its name has changed over the past few weeks. It's a secret group - it doesn't show up in search results and only members can see posts. Facebook has different privacy levels for different types of groups Over the past few months, members of the group discussed President Donald Trump, organised quilts for charity projects and supported members through difficult personal circumstances. But as time went by, the leaked screenshots show that discussions took a different turn. Members organised a drive to send complaints to an exhibition which had put out a call for quilts protesting against the Trump presidency. They contacted the sponsors of one liberal quilter to suggest that she should be dropped because of her opposition to Trump. They sent homophobic messages to gay artists and contacted quilting trade shows, asking organisers to cancel classes run by quilters they thought were too liberal. And they suggested boycotting certain quilters, or reporting them to the IRS - the American tax authorities - so that they would be tied up in tax investigations. Targets were chosen because of their support for things like Planned Parenthood and and women's rights, among other liberal causes. Members of ""Conservative with a Common Interest"" sometimes publicly remained friends with the people they were discussing. A quilt by the artist Frank Palmer, who discovered that his work was being discussed by a secret quilting club. The private messages came to light whenEric Suszynski,external, a quilter with liberal views from Chicago, posted them on his blog. He was sent the screenshots by a friend. ""I was surprised by the conversations these people were having,"" he tellsBBC Trending radio. ""I wanted people to see that there was this problem in the quilting community, that these people were just bullies."" But his actions were not met with universal praise. ""I have gotten people who thanked me for exposing this hate group, people who shamed me for exposing this hate group,"" he says, ""[Also] people who told me I was perpetuating hate towards them for being hateful. ""But the number one response I got was, 'Let's not talk about it, let's move past it. Let's ignore this problem and get back to quilting.'"" Listen to more about the quilting warson BBC Trending radio BBC Trending reached out to members of the conservative group. Several members tell us it started as a safe space for professional quilters to discuss their twin passions of politics and quilting without the fear that they would alienate potential clients who might not share their beliefs. Although none of the conservative quilters would agree to an interview, members of the group were keen to stress that the messages which are causing the furore are being taken out of context. They claim that none of the homophobic messages appeared on the group before it was ""exposed"", and strongly reject suggestions that they are spreading abuse or hate. And they said they have no plans to close the group, although its membership has recently decreased. This ""equal rights"" quilt was created by the Chicago quilter Eric Suszynski, who uncovered the conservative group. One of the people being discussed in the secret group wasFrank Palmer,external, a gay quilter from Florida who said the liberal quilting faction wasn't necessarily keen to fight back. ""The people who were targeted are some of the nicest people in the industry and had a lot to lose if they were to lash out,"" Palmer tells BBC Trending radio. ""Some of us already knew this contentiousness existed. Those who haven't been on the receiving end of it are generally blind to the hostility experienced by those who just don't 'fit in'. ""My only surprise was that there were people in that group who were pretending to be my friends. That was heartbreaking,"" he says. Quilting and politics Although it might seem like a rather sedate hobby, the history of quilting is actually steeped in politics.Marsha McDowell,external, an art history professor and curator at Michigan State University, is not surprised to see bitter divisions erupting in the quilting community. ""Many people think of quilts as a warm, fuzzy domestic art,"" she says. ""Yet we see time and time again artists have used this particular medium to make strong statements that address human rights issues."" Nedra Bonds: The quilter who fights for civil rights in America. Quilty pleasures: Six amazing quilts to inspire you to Get Creative BBC Quilting Masterclass One of the most famous pieces of cloth is theAids Memorial Quilt,external, an enormous patchwork dedicated to victims of the disease. ""In the US, there are quilt artists who use their art to talk about gun control and Aids. But it is an art form used by individuals regardless of political persuasion. In fact there have been people who have made quilts to support the Ku Klux Klan,"" McDowell says. But for artists like Frank Palmer, the actions of the conservative quilters are just the latest in a series of challenges he feels the quilting community as a whole is failing to confront. ""I would love for the dust to settle and everything to go away, but in all likelihood, it won't,"" he says. ""People will say, 'Let's just quilt' and 'This is not the time to talk about this', and that's why it continues.""

The video games taking inspiration from Trump,"The Cat in the Hijab places you at the centre of racial and faith discrimination Christopher Jarvis says his motivation to makea game that tackles fake news,externalis reenergised each time he leaves his home in New York. ""I live in Trump Tower. This is how I reconcile it with myself,"" he jokes, before turning a little more serious. ""I'm moving out soon."" At E3's indie game corner, where the multi-million dollar budgets are replaced with games made on a shoestring, politics is the driving force behind many new ideas. ""There's been a social political trend that we're seeing in the games,"" says Stephanie Barish, the chief executive of Indiecade, the a company that promotes independent developers, much like a film festival. ""It was kind of amazing to think how personal, and thoughtful, and political, and meaningful developers are trying to make their games. ""They're using the medium of game making the way an artist would use their paintbrush to express what they're thinking and how they're feeling about the current political climate. There's a sense of resisting against a feeling of oppression or tyranny."" In March Indiecade backed #ResistJam, an event billed as a creative response to the ""rise of fascism"" in the US and elsewhere. Over seven days, attendees produced a number of basic but emotive games. Several of them are on display at E3, includingThe Cat in a Hijab,external- a point-and-click mini-adventure that has you playing the role of a cat (in a hijab) who boards a subway train. You're then faced with a barrage of comments. Some aggressive, others naively ignorant - and it's up to you to defuse the situation (or not) with your response. Borders is intended to show how difficult it is to cross the US-Mexico border illegally ""Our hairball-in-chief is going to send you back to your own country soon,"" reads one attack. Another: ""He's going to make our country great again."" More from E3: Mario cap's Nintendo's comeback Xbox's vanishing virtual reality strategy Nightmares come alive in VR hospital Wiggling fingers shoot virtual weapons On another table, Gonzalo Alvarez is demonstratingBorders,external, his simple but fiendishly difficult game in which you control a man trying to run over the border from Mexico into the US. ""My Dad crossed the border when he was 17,"" Mr Alvarez tells me. ""A lot of [his] stories are in the game. The border control, the helicopter that comes out later in the game."" As you navigate your character through the map, avoiding border guards, you pass the ""skeletons"" of other players that have tried the game. ""My dad saw the skeleton of another human being on the way here."" Mr Alvarez said the game wasn't about encouraging people to try and cross the border illegally, but to demonstrate how difficult it is. ""Look at how many people die. Building a bigger wall isn't an answer to what's happening here."" Mr Jarvis' game - Polititruth - uses a swipe-left, swipe-right Tinder-like interface to help decipher fake news. If you think a statement such as ""millions will lose health insurance"" is fake news, swipe left. If you think it's true, swipe right. The decision over what's true or not is powered byPolitifact,external, the Pulitzer-winning fact checking organisation. Eventually the hope is to integrate the idea into Facebook directly to help people distinguish fact from alternative fact. But the challenge that faces the app, and all of the games on show here, is in getting the title in front of the people who perhaps most need to see it. ""It might be a slow process,"" says Indiecade's Ms Barish. ""I don't think millions of people are going to play these games and change their minds. But I think it's empowering a group of creators, and I do think there's enormous potential there."" With Borders, Mr Alvarez took his idea direct to his target audience. He created an arcade booth and installed it in a gallery in Port Arthur, Texas. The presidential election vote in the area was tight - with President Trump winning over Hillary Clinton by just 0.5%. ""Putting it in an installation, that'll bring you a group of people who may be conservative - so that's at least a target I can market at. ""Having it in a public setting, not sitting on someone's computer, I think really helps it become approachable."" In a divided city, not everyone welcomed the concept of Mr Alvarez's game. ""People wanted me to make a game to control the other side, wanting to shoot people in the game,"" he says. ""To me that's a disgusting thought process. They said they wanted me to get kicked back to Mexico. ""They might have a problem with that since I'm from New York."" Though not on show at E3, there are also several pro-Trump indie games available. This Pro-Trump title has sold tens of thousands of copies Make America Great Again: The Trump Presidency,externalis a ""simulation"" (to use the term very loosely) of the President's regular day-to-day activities (with the exception of playing golf). You control the president as he flies around the world in a helicopter, and make decisions as to whether to drill oil, install the controversial Dakota pipeline, or ""beat ISIS"". At the top of the screen, a ticker shows the national debt falling, but also the world getting more ""angry"" at he US. As anger builds, a progress bar starts to fillâ¦ you're headed to World War 3. The game, you'd presume/hope, isn't designed to be taken seriously, but as a gameplay concept there's no denying it looks much more fun than other the other games I've mentioned here. And that's the big challenge in creating games with an activist message, says Mr Alvarez. ""I didn't want to make something preachy. That's not fun. Making something that was fun was my top priority."" It's fair to say the major games publishers steer clear from even remotely controversial political messages. In an industry where making a lead character a woman is a talking point, anything more daring is avoided - boycotts can be costly. ""A lot of it has to do with the diversity of the people making the games,"" says Indiecade's Ms Barish. ""From the top down, I think it's an uphill battle. ""Because as you can see people are really risk-averse. It's a year where they all have new consoles. The market for those is hardcore gamers and they're focusing on that particular market and so they're not taking the risk."" There are signs this could change, however - with the latest Far Cry title straying into political territory with its storyline of a town overrun with religious fanatics.Its creative director told Radio 1 Newsbeatthat the games industry should ""mature"" and take on such topics.

At least 58 presumed dead in tower fire,"A total of 58 people are dead or missing, presumed dead, following the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower in west London, police have said. Commander Stuart Cundy said that number ""may increase"". The BBC understands it could be about 70 people in total. The recovery operation at the burnt-out block of flats has resumed and could take weeks, he said. Meanwhile, PM Theresa May admitted support for families in the ""initial hours"" was ""not good enough"". The statement came after Mrs May met volunteers and some of the people made homeless by the fire. As they left Number 10, one representative spoke to reporters briefly, saying they would not make a full statement yet. ""We will be making this in the community, with the community,"" he said. ""We have had two-and-a-half hours with the prime minister in the last 48 hours and spoke about demands and what we expect."" Council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown said ""lessons must be learned"", adding that he was ""heartbroken by the tragic fire and the appalling loss of life"" Victims of the Grenfell Tower block fire and volunteers met the prime minister in Downing Street Earlier, residents caught up in the fire condemned the relief effort as ""absolute chaos"". In her statement, Mrs May said: ""Frankly, the support on the ground for families who needed help or basic information in the initial hours after this appalling disaster was not good enough."" She said phone lines would be better staffed and more staff would be deployed in the area. They would wear high-visibility clothing so they could easily be found, dispense advice and ensure the right support is provided, she added. Mrs May said she expected to announce the name of the judge for a public inquiry within the next few days. The inquiry will report back to the prime minister. She has told councils to complete urgent safety checks on similar tower blocks. Latest updates: Anger mounting Relative cites 'lack of co-ordination' 'Outrageous' lack of help for victims What we know so far May 'distraught' about fire Trauma counselling for tower firefighters Who are the victims? Lily Allen and the row over the death toll Mr Paget-Brown said: ""Kensington and Chelsea council is working closely with the government, charities, volunteer and resident groups and the emergency services to help re-house and assist all those affected,"" he said. ""Of course, people rightly have questions about the causes of the fire and why it spread so quickly and these will be answered."" Commander Cundy appealed for anyone who managed to escape from the building to let authorities know they were safe. This video can not be played Commander Stuart Cundy from the Metropolitan Police gives an update on the investigation Pictures and footage showing the inside of the tower would be released on Sunday to help people understand why the search was taking so long, he said. The search of the building was briefly stalled for safety reasons but resumed on Saturday. ""As soon as we can, we will locate and recover loved ones,"" he said.

In other developments: A minute's silence was observed by the Queen at the Trooping the Colour parade to remember the victims Mrs May's new taskforce, made up of central government and Kensington and Chelsea council representatives, met Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, led an adoration and Mass in memory of the victims at St Pius X Church The Circle line and Hammersmith and City underground lines, which run close to the tower, are partly suspended due to a ""short-term risk of some debris falling onto the tracks"" Protesters marched on Whitehall on Saturday afternoon Mrs May has come in for a barrage of criticism over her response to the disaster, including being jeered when she visited the North Kensington estate on Friday. On Saturday afternoon, hundreds of protesters gathered in Whitehall, to call for her resignation. First Secretary of State Damian Green has defended the prime minister, saying she was as ""distraught as we all are"". The government has committed Â£5m for clothes, food and emergency supplies for the victims.

Some residents said they no longer wanted Kensington and Chelsea council to be involved in any way. He added: ""They do not believe they are capable of managing the response. Such is the total and utter lack of trust."" Reverend Mike Long, from Notting Hill Methodist Church, said people in the community were angry and bewildered, and had lots of questions.

May 'given 10 days to save premiership',"Four days after the devastating fire that engulfed Grenfell Tower, The Sunday Times says senior staff at Kensington and Chelsea council have beenordered by the government to stay at home,external. Instead, it says that the British Red Cross has been drafted in. TheSunday Mirror,externaland theSunday People,externalsays the charity will coordinate volunteers, while a task force of executives from other London councils will handle the official relief effort. It follows fears raised in the Sunday Express thatmasses of undistributed donations could go to waste,external. The Sunday Times,externalquotes the Labour MP Ian Austin saying: ""Isn't it a good job we've got charities... when Britain's richest council can't sort out its mess."" The Royal Family's contributions dominate several front pages. ""Queen calms shaken nation,"" declares theSunday Express,external. The Sunday Mirror hails the Duke of Cambridge, who is pictured comforting a survivor, whose husband remains missing, as thePrince of Compassion,external. The Sunday People praises him for abandoning royal protocol, a warmth it contrasts with Theresa May's response. The prime minister is""fighting for her political life on two fronts"",,externalaccording to the Mail on Sunday. Not only has she delivered what it calls a ""mea culpa"" over her handling of the blaze, but the paper says she also faces a rebellion from her MPs over Brexit. The Sunday Times believes she has been given10 days to save her premiership,external. It says up to a dozen MPs are ready to demand a vote of no confidence. Writing in the paper, Adam Boulton says when the Queen is our chief consoler, you know the PM is lost. ButNigel Nelson,externalspeculates in the Sunday People that ""she could just get away with staying on"". TheSunday Telegraph,externalsays Mrs May has a new nickname, ""the caretaker prime minister"". However, it suggests that most factions in the party believe keeping her in post ""serves their short-term interests"". TheSunday Express,externaloffers its support, saying the prime minister has shown ""leadership"" in the face of considerable adversity. So great is the ""crisis"" facing Mrs May, the Sun on Sunday says, the ""embattled"" PM isholding private prayer sessions with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby,external. The vicar's daughter is said to have found great comfort from the meetings. She's not the only one turning to the Church. According to theSunday Telegraph,externalnew research suggests figures for practising young Christians are far higher than previously thought. The study showed that 13% of 11 to 18-year-olds say they're regular churchgoers - double the numbers from a decade ago. The findings are said to have ""shocked"" the Church of England's national youth evangelism team, which has also learned that youngsters are being attracted by visiting churches rather than their youth groups. The Olympic swimmer, Michael Phelps, might consider saying a little prayer before he embarks on his latest challenge. TheSunday Mirror,externalandSunday People,externalboth report that he's to race ""Jaws"" - or a great white shark. The race, to be shown on television, is being promoted as Great Gold versus Great White. Although Phelps' top speed of 6mph beats the shark's cruising pace, its attack rate can reach 25mph. So best not to upset it, cautions the Sunday Mirror.

Fan steals Trump's thunder,"Teacher Nikos Giannopoulos giving it some attitude in his official White House photo It takes a certain something to steal the limelight when standing next to the world's most powerful man. Luckily, Nikos Giannopoulos knew exactly what that something would be when he walked into the Oval Office: a fan. And thanks to that one, rather unusual object, the photo of the special education teacher, the US president and the first lady has gone viral. The 29-year-old had travelled to Washington from his home after being named Rhode Island Teacher of the Year. Along with teachers from every state, he was invited to the White House to meet Donald Trump - and he made very specific decisions about what to wear. In a Facebook post, he revealed he wore a rainbow pin, in ""gratitude to the LGBTQ community"", a blue jacket and black fan to ""celebrate the joy and freedom of gender nonconformity"", and an anchor necklace in honour of the Rhode Island. It was the fan - which belonged to Mr Giannopoulos's partner - which really stole the show. He told NPR,externalthat, despite the president's immediate appreciation for the fan, which he praised as ""stylish"", Mr Giannopoulos was told by White House staff to put it away for the official picture. But he decided to quietly keep it by his side until it was time for the photo. ""I just asked the president, 'Do you mind if I use the fan for the photo?' He said, 'Absolutely go for it.' So I popped my fan and did my pose."" The result? Aviral photo,externalwhich has been ""liked"" thousands of times. Fashionista stands out in Kibera slum Kiwis bid to reclaim haka world record.

'Illegal immigrants' found in 'hot' lorry,"Trinity Methodist Church was used as a refuge centre for the suspected illegal immigrants Eighteen suspected illegal immigrants from Iraq, Syria and Iran have been found in the back of an ""exceptionally hot"" lorry. The people inside waved to catch the attention of passing motorists, who flagged down the driver on the A22 in East Grinstead just before 09:30 BST. A man and a woman were taken to hospital suffering from dehydration, but later discharged. The driver was arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration. The 63-year-old driver pulled over in a bus stop close to the junction with Dorset Avenue. The nearby Trinity Methodist Church was then used as a refuge centre until immigration enforcement officers arrived. Six people claiming to be children were passed to social services to have their age assessed. A Home Office spokesman said: ""All will be processed in line with immigration rules."" Sgt William Keating-Jones, of Sussex Police, said: ""The vehicle was exceptionally hot and it was important we reacted quickly.

But in a statement the LA coroner said the exact cause was unknown. Sleep apnoea is a common condition in which a person stops breathing during sleep, either for a few seconds or minutes. As well as listing sleep apnoea as a cause of death, the coroner's statement cited other factors, including heart disease and drug use. In a statementreleased to People magazine,externalafter the coroner's ruling, Fisher's daughter Lourd said: ""My mom battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life. She ultimately died of it. ""She was purposefully open in all of her work about the social stigmas surrounding these diseases.""

Judge declares mistrial in Bill Cosby case,"This video can not be played A former guest star on the Bill Cosby show, Lili Bernard, called Cosby ""a lying coward"" A US judge has declared a mistrial in the Bill Cosby sex assault case after the jury remained deadlocked for days. The seven men and five women were unable to reach a unanimous decision after some 53 hours of deliberations in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Mr Cosby, 79, is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004. His lawyers had argued the sex was consensual. The US comedian could now face new proceedings. He walks away from court a free man, but the prosecution has already said it is pursuing a fresh trial. Dozens of women say he assaulted them, but statute of limitation rules mean he was allowed to be tried for Ms Constand's allegation only. Cosby's diehard fans stick by fallen idol Bill Cosby: 'America's Dad' under fire The ticking clock for rape survivors The veteran entertainer could have faced up to a decade in prison if found guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault, which allegedly took place at his Philadelphia home 13 years ago. Announcing the decision, Pennsylvania judge Steven O'Neill reminded Mr Cosby that he remains charged and on bail, despite the mistrial. One of Mr Cosby's lawyers, Brian McMonagle, applauded the decision, saying: ""The judge is right - justice is real."" ""We came here looking for an acquittal. But like that Rolling Stones song says, 'you don't always get what you want'. Sometimes you get what you need."" The district attorney who brought the charges, Kevin Steele, told reporters that the prosecution was seeking a retrial. ""We will evaluate and review our case. We will take a hard look at everything involved and then we will retry it. As I said in court, our plan is to move this case forward as soon as possible."" This video can not be played District Attorney Kevin Steele says he will review the case and ask for a retrial A lawyer representing many of Mr Cosby's accusers, Gloria Allred, said she was hoping the prosecution would try the case again. ""We can never underestimate the blinding power of celebrity, but justice will come."" As we had become accustomed to, Bill Cosby sat in court with his head bowed and his fist resting against his chin. He showed no emotion, first as the jury announced it could not come up with a unanimous verdict, and then as the judge declared a mistrial. After more than 50 hours of deliberating, it was what most had been expecting. The only audible gasps in court came as prosecutors immediately said they would be seeking a retrial. But emerging from the courthouse, it was clear which side considered this a victory. Supporters chanted and cheered on the street as Bill Cosby came out smiling and waving, yet on the steps of the building some of the many women who had accused him of assault were left looking visibly upset and emotional. One protester screamed in rage, saying this result had been another blow to women's rights in America. His reputation has undoubtedly been tarnished. Many will have seen all those other women who couldn't bring their cases to trial - nearly 60 - with claims that there are many more who never spoke out because they don't want to disrupt their lives. There's no question those stories have been read, and will have seeped into people's consciousness here in America. In a strongly worded statement read by an aide, Bill Cosby's wife, Camille, took aim at the prosecutor, who she called ""heinously and exploitatively ambitious"", and the judge who she described as ""overtly arrogant"". The jury had been instructed by the judge to work into the weekend to reach a verdict, after jurors first revealed that they were deadlocked on the case on Thursday. But the panel returned again on Saturday to tell the judge they were still deadlocked on all three counts. Andrea Constand (centre) was the only person to take Bill Cosby to trial over the sexual assault allegations due to the statute of limitations Some of the many women who accused Mr Cosby of drugging and assaulting them over a 40-year time span were present in court last week awaiting the verdict. The accuser, Andrea Constand, took the stand during the trial, telling the court the assault had left her feeling ""humiliated"" by someone she considered a friend and mentor. At the time of the incident, she was the director of women's basketball at Temple University, where Mr Cosby was on the board of trustees. This video can not be played Ahead of the jury's announcement, Mr Cosby thanked the jury for their ""honest work"" Ms Constand, who was then 31, said he had offered her unidentified pills one night that left her unable to stop his advances. In a 2005 deposition, Mr Cosby said he had given her the antihistamine Benedryl to relieve stress and went on to have consensual relations. Prior to the court case, Ms Constand had been barred from sharing her story in public because of a confidential settlement reached with Mr Cosby in 2006. When the deposition was unsealed by a federal judge two years ago, it was revealed he had previously admitted giving young women sedatives in the past. Mr Cosby, who faces at least four separate civil lawsuits, did not testify at the trial. The case is seen as the biggest US celebrity court case since the murder trial of former American footballer OJ Simpson in 1995.

London fire: Who are the victims?,"Some of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Police believe at least 80 people died when fire engulfed Grenfell Tower, in North Kensington, London in the early hours of 14 June. Eighteen people have been formally identified by the coroner, but not all names have been released. Police say the final death toll may not be known until at least the end of the year, when the search and recovery operation is over. Other people, while not yet formally identified, have been confirmed as among the dead or missing by family or friends. In an attempt to identify those who might have died, police say they have spoken to at least one person from 106 of the 129 flats in the tower block. Det Ch Supt Fiona MacCormack said there remained 23 flats where ""despite huge investigative efforts, we have been unable to trace anyone"". ""We presume no-one survived,"" she said. Six-month-old Leena was found dead in her mother's arms. She died alongside her father, Omar Belkadi, and mother, Farah Hamdan, in a stairwell outside their flat on the 20th floor. Malak Belkadi, eight, died in hospital after she was recovered by firefighters in the building. The family are survived by six-year-old Tazmin who was found alive in hospital. Farah's cousin Adel Chaoui told the BBC that Farah called her sister while the fire was raging to ask for advice. ""When we told them to get out, Farah said she was told to stay put, not to go anywhere. That was the last we heard"" he said. Anthony Disson, described as the ""heart and soul"" of his family, was a 65-year-old retired lorry driver who lived on the 22nd floor of Grenfell Tower.

Mr Gottardi, from a town near Venice, had called his father during the fire, telling him the flat was full of smoke. Ms Trevisan, 26, from the city of Padua, had told her mother they were unable to leave because they could see flames coming up the stairs and the smoke was getting more intense. The opening of an inquest into her death heard Ms Trevisan was found in her flat. The cause of her death was ""consistent with the effects of fire"" and she was identified by her dental records. Mr Gottardi's inquest is yet to open. Appeals have been made on social media for news of missing friends and family, and posters have been pinned up around the neighbourhood.

She has heard nothing since then, and Jessica's aunt Ana Ospina says they have been calling hospitals as they believe she may have been taken in for treatment.

""We haven't had any news and don't know if she's been rescued and in hospital."" Marjorie and Ernie Vital are also thought to live on the 19th floor of Grenfell Tower. Marjorie's brother Macleod says it has been an intense time for the family who are very distressed and concerned. He said he had been visiting hospitals and centres to try to locate his sister and nephew. Amal Ahmedin (also known as Samia) and three-year-old daughter Amaya were in the building visiting friends or family to break their Ramadan fast. Mo Tuccu, Amal's husband and Amaya's father, was confirmed on 26 June to have died. Mother and son Brkite and Biruk Haftom lived in flat 155 of Grenfell Tower. Family friend Dejan Araya says Brkite's sister and friend have been searching hospitals for news of their whereabouts and are inconsolable. Dejan Araya said the last time there was any contact with them was at around 22:00 BST on the night of the fire. Two sisters from the same family have not been since the fire. Sakineh Afrasehabi lived on the 18th floor. Her sister Fatima Afrasiabi went to visit her on Tuesday night. Their family believe they went up to the 23rd floor to escape smoke from the fire.

A family member, Mr Nurul Islam, expressed his anger that he feels the council and government are providing insufficient help and resources on the ground at Grenfell Tower. ""Where are government officials? Where are council officials?"" he said. ""There isn't any leadership or co-ordination - the Red Cross and Muslim Aid are here, but they are charities, they are not people who've been elected to support us in times of need.""

'Where is the council?' asks frustrated relative,"Nurul Islam has been to North Kensington for three days in a row, looking for news of his family members As anger mounts over the Grenfell Tower fire, many relatives are finding it hard to get the information they are desperate for. One man told the BBC of his frustration at the official response. He is looking for information - any information - about five members of his family. Nurul Islam's uncle, aunt and three cousins were on the 17th floor when the tower block caught fire early on Wednesday morning. He fears the worst. On Thursday, Friday and again on Saturday, he drove to North Kensington from his home in Hertfordshire and joined the throngs of people walking the streets around Latimer Road. But with no central place to go, and no-one obvious to ask, he has been left frustrated. This video can not be played ""The not knowing is killing me"": Relatives of Husna Begum on their despair The BBC spoke to Mr Islam within view of the charred tower block, just outside the cordon. Although the streets were busy with volunteers, church groups and people leaving tributes and messages, there was no central relief tent or place to go. While there were police officers and some health workers there, the help that was visible in terms of donations and food being distributed was coming from various groups of volunteers. Mr Islam says he called the Met Police information line on Thursday night and left his details expecting a call back, but it never came. 'Outrageous' lack of help for Grenfell Tower victims Latest updates: Anger mounting What we know so far May 'distraught' about fire Trauma counselling for tower firefighters Victims of Grenfell Tower fire named Lily Allen and the row over the death toll He heard a rumour that a doctor who had been on the 17th floor had a list of the people found there - but has been ""on a wild goose chase"" trying to find the doctor. Even trying variations of the name he was given, he was not able to find anyone who had heard of her. He spoke to a Red Cross representative, who he says told him: ""If you come across a list, please let us know."" ""There's no one here to co-ordinate,"" he said. ""There's no-one giving us information. There's no-one to talk to."" ""It's just the charities. Where are the government officials, where are the council officials?"" He says he appreciates that the building is dangerous to go inside but wants those in authority to ""come down and co-ordinate something, show you actually care"". He is worried that the anger felt on the ground could turn into riots, and does not want his relatives' names to be remembered in conjunction with that. The BBC has asked the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea for an interview but has received no response. Outside the Westway sports centre where some tower residents are understood to be staying, a council media spokeswoman said only: ""We are very pleased with all the donations we have received. We have had to stop accepting donations."" The family members Mr Islam wants to find information about are his uncle Kamru Miah, aunt Rebeya Begum, and three cousins Mohammed Abdul Hamid, Mohammed Abdul Hanif, and Husna Begum. ""We are not really hopeful,"" he said. But he wants to have someone to ask. What happened at Grenfell Tower?

How did Otto Warmbier end up in a coma?,"This video can not be played Otto Warmbier, fourth from right, is seen shortly before his arrest Everyone in frame is smiling and laughing in the North Korean cold. Otto Warmbier, like the other tourists, launches a snowball, captured in slow motion on what appears to be a camera phone. It's the kind of innocent fun you expect to be captured on a tour group holiday. Otto turns to his right, mouth wide open, laughing. ""This is the Otto I know and love. This is my brother,"" wrote Austin Warmbier, who released the video, which was shot during a three-night North Korea tour at the end of 2015. Two months later, Otto would again appear on video, but in very different circumstances. Head bowed and clutching a prepared ""confession"", the 21-year-old student walked out in front of North Korean TV cameras to speak, explaining why he had been arrested at the end of that tour, when everyone else had been allowed to leave. Otto (centre, with others on the trip) was ""bright, intelligent and likeable"", according to Danny Gratton, who met him on the North Korea trip Looming over him were the oversized portraits of North Korea's former supreme leaders, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. He wore a cream-coloured jacket and tie. Before speaking, he got up and offered a low bow. Otto thanked the North Korean government for the ""opportunity to apologise for my crime, to beg for forgiveness and to beg for any assistance to save my life"". He said he tried to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel as a ""trophy"" for a US church with the ""connivance of the US administration"" in order to ""harm the work ethic and motivation of the Korean people"". Weeks after the group pictures were taken, Otto ""confessed"" in front of North Korean media Later, he would break down in tears: ""I have made the single worst decision of my life, but I am only human."" On 13 June, Otto Warmbier returned to the US after 17 months of captivity in North Korea. But he was in a coma, could not communicate and had severe brain damage. One week later, he was dead. His family blamed the ""awful torturous mistreatment"" they say he received from North Korea. Much remains unknown about how Otto's health deteriorated. Doctors at Cincinnati Medical Center say they saw no sign he was physically abused but they and his family also don't buy North Korea's story that he contracted botulism and fell into a coma after taking a sleeping pill. This video can not be played Otto said he was ""a poor scapegoat"" But how did a brilliant student from an Ohio suburb with hopes of becoming an investment banker end up imprisoned in a pariah state? The Warmbiers hail from a small suburb called Wyoming in Cincinnati, Ohio, where father Fred owns a small company. Otto attended the best high school in the state, and was prom and homecoming king. He was not only popular but also studious - he graduated as Salutatorian (the second-highest ranking student in his year) - and a talented athlete. His football coach has said he was a gifted player and a natural leader. Otto went on to study economics and commerce with a minor in global sustainability at the University of Virginia and flourished there, according to the Washington Post. Danny was the last person to see Otto (far right), witnessing the moment he was marched away The newspaper interviewed Otto's classmates at their graduation ceremony in May, where #FreeOtto stickers were handed out. The 22-year-old was in his third year of university when he was detained in North Korea. This should have been his graduation too. Friends described him as a ""sports fan who can reel off stats about seemingly any team, a friendly Midwesterner who can break down underground rap lyrics (and craft some of his own), a deep thinker who would challenge himself and others to question their place in the world, a guy from an entrepreneurial family who ate half-price sushi, an insatiably curious person with a strong work ethic and a delight in the ridiculous,"" the paperreported,external. Otto is said to have known long before his college peers what he wanted to pursue as a career: investment banking. According to his LinkedIn profile, he sat on the committee of a student investment fund and travelled to London in 2015 to complete a course in advanced econometrics at the London School of Economics. Danny made a joke - not realising how serious the situation was for his new friend His studiousness - and interest in travel - were what took him to Asia. Otto had been set to study at a university in Hong Kong on a study abroad programme in January 2016 and decided to stop in North Korea on the way. He went through a China-based company called Young Pioneer Tours, which boasts of providing ""budget travel to destinations your mother would rather you stayed away from"". Danny Gratton, from Staffordshire in the UK, shared a room with Otto during the three-night trip - they were the only two members of the tour group who were there on their own. ""From the second I met him we hit it off. He was very bright, intelligent and likeable,"" he told the BBC. The night Otto is said to have tried to take the sign from within a staff-only area of the 1,000-room Yanggakdo International Hotel was New Year's Eve 2015, the second night of the tour. Otto - pictured in ear muffs - was in ""the wrong place at the wrong time"", says Danny Earlier, the group had taken a trip to the border with South Korea before returning, having a meal and taking a coach to Pyongyang's main square, where there was a big fireworks display. They had food and drank beer, Mr Gratton said. However there was no rowdy behaviour - ""It wasn't that sort of holiday,"" Mr Gratton said. ""We toed the line."" He said there was ""no indication at all"" that Otto had taken the hotel propaganda sign and he had not mentioned it. The North Korean government has releasedgrainy video footage,externalshowing a dark figure whose face cannot be seen removing a sign in a corridor. Otto was taken away by guards as the pair went through immigration control at Pyongyang International Airport on 2 January 2016. Otto is accused of stealing a sign from the Yanggakdo hotel, seen on the left - but Danny told the BBC it ""wasn't that sort of holiday"". ""We toed the line,"" he said ""We were the last two people to go through passport control. We handed over our passports and the guy pointed at Otto and pointed to the door. Two security guards came over and ushered him away,"" said Mr Gratton. ""I made an ironic comment. I actually said 'Well we won't be seeing you again'. He sort of laughed at me and that was the last we saw of him. ""They made the decision to take an American. It was just his time, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time."" Later, once the remaining group arrived in Beijing, one of the tour guides is reported to have spoken to Otto on the phone, who said he had a ""severe headache and wanted to be taken to the hospital"", the Postreports,external, citing another passenger. Otto is transferred from a medical transport plane to an ambulance in Cincinnati Troy Collings from Young Pioneer Tours told the BBC none of its employees had direct contact with Otto after he was escorted away. One guide stayed in Pyongyang to try to make contact and offer assistance but was unable to do so, he said. Otto's detention was the only time the North Korean legal authorities had taken issue with anyone on a tour, Mr Collings added. In a statement after his death, Young Pioneer Tours said it would no longer be taking Americans to North Korea. ""The way his detention was handled was appalling and a tragedy like this must never be repeated,"" it said in a statement. ""Despite constant requests, we were denied any opportunity to meet him or anyone in contact with him in Pyongyang, only receiving assurances that he was fine."" North Korea only confirmed that Otto had been arrested weeks later, on 22 January. He gave his televised statement in late February and was given 15 years' hard labour, for crimes against the state, in March. Observers said the sentence seemed unusually high for a foreigner and could be related to deepening tensions between North Korea and the US over the former's nuclear programme. It's unclear what happened to Otto between his sentencing and the announcement of his release on 14 June by the US government. But his father Fred says he slipped into the coma ""the day after he was sentenced"" - well over a year ago. Otto's father Fred wore his son's jacket as he spoke to journalists Speaking at a press conference wearing the same jacket worn by his son on the day he ""confessed"" in Pyongyang, he said the North Korean government had ""brutalised and terrorised"" Otto. North Korea says it released him on ""humanitarian grounds"". Intelligence agencies in the North might have kept the state of his health under wraps, including from top officials, out of fear, says Stephan Haggard, director of the Korea-Pacific Programme at the University of California, San Diego. At some stage, someone would have realised ""that the worst of all possible worlds is for the guy to die in custody"", kickstarting a frantic diplomatic effort to get him out, he told the AFP news agency. How harsh is prison in North Korea? Local businesses in Wyoming have also shown their support Dr Daniel Kanter, one of those looking after Otto in Cincinnati, said last week that he was in ""a state of unresponsive wakefulness"". He had not spoken but had ""spontaneous eye opening and blinking"", he said. Respiratory arrest is believed to be the cause of the brain damage, but it remains unclear what caused it. There are no signs that Otto was beaten. When the plane carrying Otto touched down last week, people gathered at the airport cheered. ""It's just been so long that he's been there that to hear he is actually coming home was incredible,"" his college roommate Emmett Saulnier told CNN before Otto arrived. He was carried out with a tube attached to his nose, and sent straight to hospital by ambulance. Dr Kanter (C) says Otto is in a state of ""unresponsive wakefulness"" The University of Virginia welcomed his return, but President Teresa Sullivan said the community was ""deeply concerned and saddened"" to learn of his condition. ""I knelt down by his side and I hugged him and I told him I missed him and I was so glad he made it home,"" Fred Warmbier said. ""These things are tough to process but he's with us and we're trying to make him comfortable and we want to be a part of his life."" But on 19 June, the Warmbier family announced that Otto had ""completed his journey home"" and died in hospital surrounded by his family. They repeated their insistence that North Korea had killed him. ""The awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today.""

How new Ireland PM Varadkar embodies social change,"I don't think there was any dancing in Dublin to mark Leo Varadkar's installation as taoiseach (prime minister). But there was some in Mumbai, from where his father, Ashok, hails. No-one lives in the family home at the moment, but local people took part in a one-and-a-quarter mile (2km) long procession to a Hindu Temple to pray for Mr Varadkar when he was elected as the leader of Republic of Ireland's biggest party, Fine Gael. Politics, to some extent, runs in the family. Two of Mr Varadkar's uncles were imprisoned for campaigning - peacefully - for Indian independence. Ireland became a republic in the late 1940s, around the same time as Britain withdrew from India. The countries were two of the British Empire's most turbulent territories, but until the last few years, no-one thought they would be united in the person of the taoiseach. Ashok met his wife, Miriam, while working in a hospital in the UK. She was a nurse from County Waterford in Ireland and after a spell in India, they settled in Dublin, where Leo was born in 1979. His political ambitions were clear from a very young age. When he was eight, a shopkeeper asked him what he wanted to do when he grew up. Leo replied that he wanted to be the minister for health. Mr Varadkar succeeded Enda Kenny as Ireland's prime minister He demonstrated his commitment to getting that job when he was at university, first standing for election while he was studying for a medical degree at Trinity College in his home city. Ten years ago he was elected to the Irish parliament. While moving through ministerial positions - including health - he gained a reputation as a ""sharp-shooting, straight-talking media darling"", in the words of one journalist. He chimed with the mood of modern Ireland, as the embodiment of deep social change. Leo Varadkar becomes Republic of Ireland's taoiseach Enda Kenny: From bust to boom to Brexit Brexit's hard Irish border questions DUP leader calls for 'sensible Brexit' When Mr Varadkar was a young child, stereotypes of Ireland still prevailed abroad - novels and films had featured thatched cottages drenched in drizzle and church steeples shrouded in mist. The reality was different, but the country was one of the poorest in Western Europe and there were relatively few immigrants. But in the 1990s, the Celtic tiger became a global phenomenon. Low corporate tax rates and financial deregulation meant the Irish economy became more associated with Apple and Google than with agriculture and Guinness. With wealth came secularisation. While the change was more obvious among younger people in the cities, it affected the whole nation. The Roman Catholic Church, which had been the most powerful force in the country, was weakened by child abuse scandals and divorce and homosexuality were legalised. Ireland's economic transformation has seen companies like Apple move there When Mr Varadkar became the first Irish cabinet minister to come out as gay in 2015, he said: ""It's not a big deal for me any more and I hope it isn't for anybody else - it shouldn't be."" That has basically proved to be the case. The international headlines about Mr Varadkar have focused on his sexuality, ethnicity and age. But in Ireland itself, those factors haven't been mentioned much during the race to succeed Enda Kenny as prime minister. Instead the debate has focused on economics. While he leans to the left on social issues, Mr Varadkar's opponents are trying to portray him as a right-wing ideologue because of his economic policies. During his party leadership campaign he said Fine Gael should represent people who get up early, although more recently, he has positioned himself in the political centre ground, saying he wants ""a republic of opportunity"". If you ask your average person in Ireland what is most surprising about Mr Varadkar's ascent to high office, they'll probably say it's the fact he's under 40. In this much stereotyped and once socially conservative country, there has been a rapid revolution in attitudes.

Major search for seven US navy crew,"This video can not be played USS Fitzgerald damaged by the crash A major search operation is under way for seven missing US sailors after their ship collided with a merchant vessel off the coast of Japan. Several Japanese and US boats and aircraft have been deployed, with the search continuing into the night. An investigation into how the USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine-registered container ship in the early hours of Saturday morning has begun. The ship's commanding officer was among three people aboard to be hospitalised. The incident took place some 56 nautical miles (104km) south-west of the Japanese port city of Yokosuka, at about 02:30 local time on Saturday (17:30 GMT Friday). The Navy ship's starboard side was heavily damaged in the collision, but the vessel later managed to slowly return to its base in Yokosuka, with the assistance of US navy tug boats. USS Fitzgerald crash: In pictures The collision occurred near Yokosuka, which is home to the US 7th Fleet that comprises up to 80 submarines and ships, including the USS Fitzgerald. It is unclear where the 154-metre (505ft) guided missile destroyer ship was heading at the time. The US destroyer was guided back to base by US Navy tug boats The ACX Crystal, a 222-metre (730ft) Filipino-flagged container ship, was travelling between the Japanese cities of Nagoya and Tokyo. Marine traffic records suggest the ACX Crystal made a sudden U-turn roughly 25 minutes before the collision with the USS Fitzgerald. It is not clear why it changed course. Marine traffic records suggest it was travelling at 14.6 knots (27km/h) at the time of the collision. The ACX Crystal appeared to make a U-turn before the collision, before rapidly adjusting course and setting off to Tokyo Marine traffic records for the USS Fitzgerald are not publicly available. Japan's coastguard is co-ordinating the search with US teams for the seven missing crew members, who have not yet been publicly identified. It has sent half a dozen vessels, a number of aircraft and rescue personnel to the scene. The USS Dewey escorted the Fitzgerald back to Yokosuka, and a US P-8 Poseidon aircraft has joined search and rescue efforts,the 7th Fleet said in a statement,external. It is not yet known where the missing sailors were when the collision happened. The US navy says several compartments were severely damaged - including the ships radio room, and two berthing compartments, the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports from Tokyo. Some of the seven missing sailors may have been asleep in those compartments when the collision happened, our correspondent adds. The collision left a huge gash down the right-hand side of the ship The damage to the ACX Crystal was less serious than to the Navy ship The Navy ship's commanding officer, Cdr Bryce Benson, is in a stable condition after being transferred by helicopter to US Naval Hospital Yokosuka, according to Navy officials. Two others were flown to hospital, and were said to be awake and under observation. The ACX Crystal is 223m long and capable of carrying nearly 40,000 tonnes, much bigger than the 154m USS Fitzgerald. It sustained lighter damage to its port bow, and has now reached Tokyo. The Associated Press agency said there were no injuries reported among the 20 Filipino crew members on board the container ship. Relatives of those on board the USS Fitzgerald have been posting on the US 7th Fleet's Facebook page, requesting information on their loved-ones. An information hotlinehas been set up,external. Ina statement,external, 7th Fleet commander Vice Admiral Joseph P Aucoin was quoted as saying ""this has been a difficult day"". ""I am humbled by the bravery and tenacity of the Fitzgerald crew. Now that the ship is in Yokosuka, I ask that you help the families by maintaining their privacy as we continue the search for our shipmates."" US President Donald Trump tweeted: ""Thoughts and prayers with the sailors of USS Fitzgerald and their families. Thank you to our Japanese allies for their assistance."" The collision took place in waters that get heavy traffic and that have experienced prior collisions, Japanese broadcaster NHK said. Ships travelling to and from Tokyo, as well as crossing the Pacific in both directions, pass through the bay where the crash happened. NHKsaid that,externalan association of commercial ship captains is calling for the creation of east-west lanes in the area to avoid collisions. The area where the collision took place is extremely busy, with shipping heading in and out of Tokyo bay. However, the USS Fitzgerald is one of the most advanced warships in the world - with highly sophisticated radars systems. At the moment the focus is on the search for the missing sailors. Later will come the investigation into how one of the world's most sophisticated warships failed to avoid colliding with a 30,000-tonne cargo ship on a calm, clear night.

'Outrageous' lack of help for Grenfell tower victims,"Residents are still looking for answers and information near the Grenfell Tower site There are many things fuelling the anger felt here. The catastrophic loss of life is the primary factor, of course. But there is also the fact that people are finding it very difficult to get any information. There does not appear to be any central official point here on the ground where people can go to get answers and support. No marquee with ""help centre"" written on the side. No officials with lanyards guiding confused and desperate people to counsellors. There has been a huge voluntary response, with local churches and others helping people. Donations have flooded in - too many now - such is the public response. And unseen officials are caring for those in hospital and working to find empty accommodation in which to house those left homeless. And yet on the ground people speak of a total lack of coordination from the government andKensington and Chelsea council,external. Local residents' association representatives say some families are still sleeping on floors in centres around the Grenfell Tower four days after the fire. They talk of absolute chaos. And they say what they regard as the inability of the local council to respond to their needs and concerns is ""symptomatic of why we had this disaster"". Such is the total and utter lack of trust between residents and the officials in charge. One of the things fuelling the anger here - perhaps the main thing - is the lack of a central point of contact for answers. Residents demonstrate outside Kensington Town Hall Crisis management at disasters around the world swings into action at varying speeds. But even in remote areas, international bodies have normally set up obvious local centres of support fairly soon after the event. It has not happened in North Kensington. Twenty-four hours after the 2010 Haitian earthquake, I arrived to find no international response to speak of. But within another 24 hours that response was arriving and was significant there three days after the disaster - teams from around the world flying in, crisis centres and the United Nations in control of feeding points and housing solutions. Yes, there were problems. There always are. But the centralised and visible response was in place days later in a relatively remote area. That is what appears to be missing in the richest borough in one of the world's leading cities. Kensington and Chelsea council's website refers to a ""Family and Friends Reception"",externalat the Westway Sports Centre, staffed by police. People need to be taken care of, says one former resident People need visible and accessible emotional psychological and physical help and right now they say they are not getting it. Many people here believe an affluent Conservative council failed to look after its poorest residents. But one angry former resident of the tower, who moved out in October, said: ""Right now the residents need housing and taking care of. The council have failed to do so. ""This is not about politics. It is about getting people what they need and deserve. It is an outrage."" There has been little trust between residents and the council over the years. They say their concerns about safety in the Grenfell Tower were not listened to - not acted upon. Right now that lack of trust is deepening. And so is the anger. First Secretary of State Damian Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:  ""Kensington council are absolutely doing their best. ""People want answers, people want someone on the ground. The new recovery taskforce that the prime minister is chairing has people from central government as well as from the council on the ground to answer all those perfectly reasonable questions. ""It was decided to do it yesterday, it is happening today,"" he added. Matthew Price reports for theToday programme on BBC Radio 4.

Grenfell fire victims meet prime minister,"Victims of the Grenfell Tower block fire and volunteers met the prime minister in Downing Street Victims of the Grenfell Tower fire have met the prime minister in Downing Street to discuss their ""demands"" amid growing anger in the wake of the blaze. A man representing the group, said they would make a full statement ""in the community"" about their ""demands and what we expect"". Theresa May met the residents, victims, volunteers and community leaders on Saturday afternoon. She earlier chaired a government ""taskforce"" to respond to the disaster. Earlier, First Secretary of State Damian Green said the prime minister was as ""distraught as anyone"" about the fire. He described criticism of Mrs May's response to the disaster as ""terribly unfair"". The prime ministerfaced cries of ""coward"" and ""shame on you""when she returned to the scene on Friday, having not met victims on her first visit. Mr Green said: ""She has the same degree of sympathy and horror at these events that we all have."" Hundreds of protesters have gathered in Whitehall, calling for the prime minister's resignation. Shadow minister Angela Rayner was among those addressing the crowd. Protestors marched on Whitehall on Saturday afternoon On Friday, protesters gathered outside Downing Street shouting ""May must go"", ""justice for Grenfell"" and ""blood on your hands"" Hundreds of protesters also marched on Whitehall on Friday, angry at the government's handling of the disaster. Chris Imafidon, whose home overlooks Grenfell Tower, addressed the crowd and held up a poster of a missing child and a piece of scorched cladding. ""I'm not here because I support the Tories, Labour or Liberals,"" he said. ""I'm here because this child... on Tuesday went to bed and now nobody knows where this child is."" Another protesterdescribed Mrs May as ""cold like a fish"". This video can not be played ""Cold, cold like a fish"": One protester on Theresa May In an interview with BBC Newsnight, on Friday, Mrs May said the government was doing all it could to help. ""The government is making money available, we are ensuring we are going to get to the bottom of what has happened, we will ensure that people are re-housed. We need to make sure that actually happens."" This video can not be played Theresa May says Â£5m will be available for survivors, and the cause of the Kensington fire is being looked at Mr Green said a Â£5m fund would be for the immediate needs of victims, adding that ""other money may be needed longer term"". A chairperson for the public inquiry will be appointed ""in days"" and residents ""will have a voice in stating the terms of reference"" for it. Mr Green rejected complaints that the prime minister had not understood the mood of the nation. ""I think she has done everything that could have been asked... listening to residents' concerns and, above all, acting on those concerns as quickly as possible. That is what a prime minister should do and that is what she has done. ""She is as distraught as anyone, as all of us are, we all feel the sadness, we all recognise the anger and can see why people are that angry and the prime minister feels that as much as anyone,"" he added. Former Conservative minister Michael Portillo said on Thursday that, although she had met in private with members of the emergency services, she should have met Grenfell Tower residents, as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn did.

A tale of two tower blocks,"London is increasingly becoming a city of high-rise living. There are more than 700 tower blocks, ranging from brand new luxury developments to the post-war council-owned buildings seen as a quick fix to cure problems caused by crumbling and unsanitary 19th Century hovels. About 8% of Londoners now live in tower blocks. Some flats are bought for millions; others are relatively low-cost social housing rented from a local council at a fraction of the private rate. Grenfell Tower itself was designed in 1967, started in 1972 and finished in 1974. Originally built as municipal housing as part of the slum clearances of the 1960s, it had 120 one- and two-bedroom flats over 20 of its 24 storeys, and was renovated in 2016. It's in a neighbourhood ranked among the most deprived 10% in England. Just two miles away - or four stops along the Circle/Hammersmith and City line - is 3 Merchant Square, a 21-storey tower that is part of a new development around Paddington Basin. The contemporary block was finished in 2016 and holds 60 apartments over 15 storeys. It's a different world. The penthouse apartment was sold for Â£7.5m. One-bedroom flats are at least Â£1m. Surrounded by restaurants and bars, workers and residents can lounge on deckchairs on a newly-built floating park. Lunchtime yoga sessions are held and there's a luxury fitness club. There's an enormous fountain and a bridge created by renowned designer Thomas Heatherwick, a nursery and winter garden. But nice though these peripheries undoubtedly are, they don't keep people safe from fire. For that, we must have a look at the specifications of the apartments in the tower. Once you get past the sales brochure description of 3 Merchant Square's walnut cutlery drawer inserts and integral wine coolers, the adjustable mood lighting and heated bathroom walls, you come to the fire safety details: Every flat has not only ceiling mounted smoke detectors but sprinklers. The International Fire Sprinkler Association (IFSA) says that automatic fire sprinkler systems are the single most effective fire protection measure available, and are able to make up for a wide range of other fire protection deficiencies. There has never been a multiple loss of life from a fire developing in a building protected by a properly designed, installed and maintained fire sprinkler system. While fire sprinkler systems have been required in new high-rise residential buildings in England since 2007, it is not compulsory to retrofit them into existing buildings. So Grenfell Tower had none. Former chief fire officer Ronnie King, honorary secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety and rescue - which had recommended fitting sprinklers to buildings to save lives - said the regulations ""badly need updating"" and ""three successive ministers have not done it"". ""My own thinking is there was the red tape challenge and they don't really want to put regulation on to businesses, adding a burden. ""It's one of those that if you bring in a new regulation, you have got to give three up to get it."" A2012 report by the British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association,external(BAFSA) concluded that fire sprinklers could be retrofitted with tenants in place at a cost of about Â£1,150 a flat. Since the 24-storey Grenfell Tower contained 120 flats, it would have worked out at Â£138,000. That's significantly less than theÂ£2.6m spent on the cladding and replacement windows,external. Do you live in a tower block with similar cladding to Grenfell Tower? Let us know by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Architect and fire expert Sam Webb said: ""We are still wrapping post-war high-rise buildings in highly flammable materials and leaving them without sprinkler systems installed, then being surprised when they burn down. ""I really don't think the building industry understands how fire behaves in buildings and how dangerous it can be. The government's mania for deregulation means our current safety standards just aren't good enough."" Some of these issues were raised in a report following afatal fire at a tower block in 2009in Camberwell, in which six people were killed. Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid said his predecessor in the role had accepted the report's recommendations and put them into action. ""The coroner did not recommend new planning regulations. The coroner recommended a change in the guidance. There is a lot of information out there and it is right that it is independently looked at by a judge-led inquiry,"" Mr Javid said. When asked whether the government would retrofit sprinkler systems to tower blocks, he said: ""I don't think we can immediately jump to the conclusion that sprinklers is the issue here. We will do whatever it takes."" The Grenfell Action Group complained about uncollected rubbish in corridors, pointing out it was a fire risk Another factor adding to the building's fire risk, according to the Grenfell Action Group, was the fact that in the past rubbish, having accumulated in the hallways of the tower, was not collected. At one point, the only emergency exit to the building was cluttered with an old mattress, sheets of cardboard and a broken heater. It's hard to imagine residents in 3 Merchant Square having to put up with rubbish filling the corridors. An associate pastor of Notting Hill Community Church, Danny Vance, says ""the poor are constantly neglected"" in the city. ""The disparity between rich and poor in this city is disgusting,"" he said. ""This would not have happened to the Â£5m flats around the corner."" Live coverage of the Grenfell fire aftermath What we know so far about Grenfell Tower Six questions for the investigation The average salary in the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea, in which the tower block stands, is Â£123,000: the highest in the UK. But the median average - the midpoint of all salaries in the area - is Â£32,700. No other local authority in the country has such a large gap between these two averages, pointing to a huge contrast between high and low earners. There is a similarly large gap when measuring the total income for people in the area. The average is Â£158,000, but the median is Â£38,700. Again, no other local authority in the UK reports such a difference. In laymen's terms, it means that the total income in the area, if distributed among the local population, would be Â£123,000 per resident, the highest in the UK.  Yet half of the population there earns less than Â£32,700, highlighting the extreme disparity between top earners and those at the lower end of the spectrum. Source:Department for Communities and Local Government, the Office for National Statistics, and Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs. Hannah Mansell, chair of the Passive Fire Protection Forum and trustee of the Children's Burns Trust, said: ""I regularly sit in meetings with fire safety professionals, and their fury and frustration at the inaction of local councils and social landlords is palpable. ""We have been warning about the risks of a fire like this for years. ""'What we need to get people to take notice is a huge fire in a tower block' they say. ""Well, here it is. There's an endemic fire safety problem in this type of housing stock."" As Ronnie King says, ""it's sad that we always have to go to stable-door legislation"" after a tragedy.

'Illegal immigrants' found in back of lorry,"Trinity Methodist Church was used as a refuge centre for the suspected illegal immigrants Eighteen suspected illegal immigrants from Iraq, Syria and Iran have been found in the back of an ""exceptionally hot"" lorry. The people inside waved to catch the attention of passing motorists, who flagged down the driver on the A22 in East Grinstead just before 09:30 BST. A man and a woman were taken to hospital suffering from dehydration, but later discharged. The driver was arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration. The 63-year-old driver pulled over in a bus stop close to the junction with Dorset Avenue. The nearby Trinity Methodist Church was then used as a refuge centre until immigration enforcement officers arrived. Six people claiming to be children were passed to social services to have their age assessed. A Home Office spokesman said: ""All will be processed in line with immigration rules."" Sgt William Keating-Jones, of Sussex Police, said: ""The vehicle was exceptionally hot and it was important we reacted quickly.

Pension savers 'missing out on top-ups',"Workers are missing out on pension top-ups from their employers by only saving at a minimum level, research suggests. Many larger firms offer to ""match"" additional pension saving by their employees, by adding a contribution when workers save more. But insurer Royal London said that many workers were unaware of the option, and failed to take advantage. This could make a difference of hundreds of pounds in retirement income, it said. Despite having to make a number of assumptions in calculations, Royal London has estimated that an estimated Â£2bn of employer pension contributions would be available if workers took up the option of saving to a maximum rather than minimum level. It estimated that 3.2 million workers could receive an extra Â£650 per year each. That would mean somebody on average earnings who chose to take up an additional 3% matched contribution to their pension pot would receive a retirement income of Â£22,500 rather than Â£19,050, thanks to the extra contribution and tax relief. The Nationwide Building Society has changed its default level to a maximum, rather than a minimum contribution. Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and now director of policy and Royal London, said more could be done to make workers at other businesses aware that their employer might add to their pension if they were willing to contribute at a higher level. ""At a time when money is tight for many people and pay rises may be limited, getting your employer to contribute more to your pension can be a very cost-effective strategy,"" he said. ""When individuals are thinking about where to put their money to get the best return, the chance to more than double your money through an employer contribution and tax relief from the government takes a lot of beating."" Graham Vidler, director of external affairs at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, said; ""If your employer offers a workplace pension, you should certainly consider joining and putting in as much as possible as if you don't you will miss out on free money in the form of employer contributions as well as the tax relief. ""This research highlights how much UK employees could be missing out on each year. It is also vitally important that people start saving into a pension as soon as possible as the longer you save, the bigger your final pot is likely to be and the more you can benefit from your employers 'matching' contributions.""

May 'distraught' about Grenfell Tower fire,"Victims of the Grenfell Tower block fire and volunteers met the prime minister in Downing Street Victims of the Grenfell Tower fire have met the prime minister in Downing Street to discuss their ""demands"" amid growing anger in the wake of the blaze. A man representing the group, said they would make a full statement ""in the community"" about their ""demands and what we expect"". Theresa May met the residents, victims, volunteers and community leaders on Saturday afternoon. She earlier chaired a government ""taskforce"" to respond to the disaster. Earlier, First Secretary of State Damian Green said the prime minister was as ""distraught as anyone"" about the fire. He described criticism of Mrs May's response to the disaster as ""terribly unfair"". The prime ministerfaced cries of ""coward"" and ""shame on you""when she returned to the scene on Friday, having not met victims on her first visit. Mr Green said: ""She has the same degree of sympathy and horror at these events that we all have."" Hundreds of protesters have gathered in Whitehall, calling for the prime minister's resignation. Shadow minister Angela Rayner was among those addressing the crowd. Protestors marched on Whitehall on Saturday afternoon On Friday, protesters gathered outside Downing Street shouting ""May must go"", ""justice for Grenfell"" and ""blood on your hands"" Hundreds of protesters also marched on Whitehall on Friday, angry at the government's handling of the disaster. Chris Imafidon, whose home overlooks Grenfell Tower, addressed the crowd and held up a poster of a missing child and a piece of scorched cladding. ""I'm not here because I support the Tories, Labour or Liberals,"" he said. ""I'm here because this child... on Tuesday went to bed and now nobody knows where this child is."" Another protesterdescribed Mrs May as ""cold like a fish"". This video can not be played ""Cold, cold like a fish"": One protester on Theresa May In an interview with BBC Newsnight, on Friday, Mrs May said the government was doing all it could to help. ""The government is making money available, we are ensuring we are going to get to the bottom of what has happened, we will ensure that people are re-housed. We need to make sure that actually happens."" This video can not be played Theresa May says Â£5m will be available for survivors, and the cause of the Kensington fire is being looked at Mr Green said a Â£5m fund would be for the immediate needs of victims, adding that ""other money may be needed longer term"". A chairperson for the public inquiry will be appointed ""in days"" and residents ""will have a voice in stating the terms of reference"" for it. Mr Green rejected complaints that the prime minister had not understood the mood of the nation. ""I think she has done everything that could have been asked... listening to residents' concerns and, above all, acting on those concerns as quickly as possible. That is what a prime minister should do and that is what she has done. ""She is as distraught as anyone, as all of us are, we all feel the sadness, we all recognise the anger and can see why people are that angry and the prime minister feels that as much as anyone,"" he added. Former Conservative minister Michael Portillo said on Thursday that, although she had met in private with members of the emergency services, she should have met Grenfell Tower residents, as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn did.

Paris Airshow: Boeing and Airbus under pressure,"The market for civil airliners is far less frothy than it used to be The Paris airport of Le Bourget was once a pretty glamorous place. It was here that aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh landed after his solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927, and it was a gateway to the French capital for Hollywood legends such as Audrey Hepburn for many years. Those days are long gone. Surrounded by drab suburbs and urban motorways it now caters mainly for private jets, whose passengers spend as little time as possible amid its rather bleak and windswept surroundings - although it does have a rather good aviation museum. But for the next week Le Bourget will become the beating heart of the global aerospace industry. Scores of politicians - including newly elected President Macron - generals and chief executives will be among the hundreds of thousands of visitors, braving horrendous traffic and negotiating tight security to attend the 52nd Paris Air Show. Boeing is set to announce a new version of its 737 airliner at this year's show So what will be the main talking points in the plush chalets and teeming exhibition halls this year? Traditionally, the headlines are dominated by big order announcements from home favourite Airbus and the US aerospace giant Boeing, but the market is far less frothy than it used to be. Global aircraft orders have declined by about half since their peak in 2014. Low oil prices mean that airlines are under less pressure to replace old aircraft with newer, more efficient models. So we may see fewer announcements. That isn't a huge problem in itself - both manufacturers already have bulging order books, and both have struggled with supply chain problems, causing delays on the production line. So a reduction in demand may be no bad thing. Airbus has halved the production rate of its A380 super jumbos because of a lack of orders However that doesn't apply across the board. The giant A380 superjumbo is the flagship of the Airbus fleet - and its appearance is usually a highlight of the air display.  But it isn't selling well and last year the company halved its annual production. It would doubtless love to announce further orders in Paris but that seems very unlikely. In fact, some are questioning whether the aircraft has a future at all. In the circumstances, Airbus could well find itself upstaged by its American rival. Boeing is expected to set out details of a planned new mid-sized aircraft, a super-efficient model which will sit between the largest 737 and the smallest 787 in its range. Meanwhile the latest in a series of heavily upgraded 737 models - the Max 10 - is likely to be formally launched at the show. Yet the two established giants could be forgiven for looking nervously over their shoulders. Brazil's Embraer is hoping to attract attention with its latest E195 regional jet China's Comac and Russia's Irkut have both begun testing new airliners over the past few weeks. Neither the C-919 nor the MC-21 will be at the show - but they will certainly be talked about. The market for smaller jets is about to become a lot more crowded. While most of the actual business at Le Bourget is done in the chalets and exhibition halls, the flying display allows companies to show off their latest multi-billion dollar technology. Among the highlights this year will be the F-35 Lightning II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter. It is the product of the world's most expensive defence programme, an international effort led by the US contractor Lockheed Martin - and one which has been beset by delays and cost overruns. It badly needs some good PR, so it can be expected to put on a spectacular show. Lockheed Martin's F-35 flying display is expected to be one of the highlights of the show And there is also likely to be a good showing from the Rafale: maker Dassault hopes to start talks later this year on further sales of the jet to India Elsewhere, much of the talk will focus on new technology. Outwardly, aircraft may have changed little over the past few decades. But the way in which they are designed, built, maintained and operated has been transformed. That trend is likely to accelerate. Many of the exhibitors will be showing how virtual reality, augmented reality and 3D printing are already having a major impact on different parts of the industry - and suggesting how their potential could be exploited even further. For some the future lies in Big Data; analysing huge reams of information to detect patterns, create models and to predict future performance. Away from traditional displays, like that of France's Patrouille de France, Big Data will be key for many ""The amount of data this industry generates is massive and growing,"" says John Schmidt, managing director of Accenture's aerospace and defence business. ""A single flight by a Boeing 787 generates enough data to fill about 200 DVDs"", he says. ""But very little of that data is actually used."" Big data, he thinks, can transform the way aerospace companies operate. Beside hosting the Paris Airshow, Le Bourget is also home to France's main aviation museum The organisers of the show, Gifas, are also keen to show off their futuristic credentials. For that reason, they have set up an ""Air Lab"" dedicated to new technology and ideas, from both established companies and start-ups. With a rather nice touch, they've put it inside Le Bourget's Concorde Hall - an area dominated by two models of the supersonic airliner that was once ahead of its time, is now obsolete, but still manages to look outrageously futuristic.

Queen reflects on 'sombre national mood',"Protesters took to the streets to call for action in the wake of the fire The Queen has said it is ""difficult to escape a very sombre national mood"" following tragedies in London and Manchester in recent weeks. The monarch said the UK had ""witnessed a succession of terrible tragedies"" Hermessage,externalcomes as residents caught up in the Grenfell Tower fire which killed at least 30 people, condemned the ""chaotic"" relief effort. Some say they no longer want Kensington and Chelsea council involved in any way. The statement from the Queen on her official birthday came after Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to ""get to the bottom"" of the west London tower block fire. Mrs May was jeered when she visited the North Kensington estate on Friday, and is facing mounting criticism for her response to the disaster. She is now meeting victims, volunteers and community leaders in Downing Street, while hundreds of protesters have gathered in Whitehall, calling for her resignation. Latest updates: Anger mounting What we know so far May 'distraught' about fire Trauma counselling for tower firefighters Victims of Grenfell Tower fire named Lily Allen and the row over the death toll The Queen and Duke of Cambridge had earlier met volunteers, residents and community representatives during a visit to the Westway Sports Centre. She also visited some of those injured in hospital following the bomb at Manchester Arena little under a month ago. In an unprecedented statement, the Queen said she had been ""profoundly struck by the immediate inclination of people throughout the country to offer comfort and support to those in desperate need"". ""Put to the test, the United Kingdom has been resolute in the face of adversity,"" she said. ""United in our sadness, we are equally determined, without fear or favour, to support all those rebuilding lives so horribly affected by injury and loss."" A rallying cry for unity By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent This video can not be played The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh lead a minute's silence at the Trooping the Colour parade In a long reign, the Queen has issued countless statements. They can sometimes be formulaic and lack the ability to resonate. This is not one of them. After the attacks in Manchester and London, the Queen - and more importantly her senior advisers - have grasped quickly that the reaction to the Grenfell Tower fire has not just been one of shock and grief. There's also intense anger.  It has been focused on the divide between rich and poor and it has been directed at an establishment that includes the monarchy, though the institution itself has not been the subject of criticism. In such circumstances, as Head of Nation - a focal point at times of tragedy - the Queen has decided she cannot remain silent. She, and those around her, will be acutely aware of the potential for growing disquiet in the days ahead. And so, a 91-year-old monarch with little concrete power but considerable patronage and status, has decided to act. This is a regal rallying call for unity. The fire broke out at the 24-storey block, which contained 120 one and two-bedroom flats, shortly before 01:00 BST on Wednesday. It tore through all floors of the building and took more than 200 firefighters 24 hours to bring it under control. Cladding installed on the tower during a refurbishment in 2015 had a polyethylene - or plastic - core instead of an even more fireproof alternative,the BBC's Newsnight understands. The Department for Communities and Local Government said that cladding made up of aluminium panels over a polyethylene core ""would be non-compliant with current Building Regulations guidance"" and should not be used on buildings taller than 18m. It said it could not comment on the type of cladding used on Grenfell Tower. That would be subject to investigations, it said. Search and rescue officers photographed inside Grenfell Tower on Saturday Protests were held in London on Friday as residents demanded more support for those affected by the fire. Between 50 and 60 people stormed Kensington and Chelsea Town Hall, as members of the public said the homeless needed help ""right now"". There were also angry scenes outside the Clement James Centre, in North Kensington. Dozens of demonstrators surged towards the entrance and scuffles broke out outside as organisers appealed for calm.

Such is the total and utter lack of trust."" Reverend Mike Long, from Notting Hill Methodist Church,told BBC Radio 4's Todaythat people in the community were furious. ""People are incredibly angry, they're bewildered, they're confused, they have lots and lots of questions,"" he said. ""They feel they're not being listened to and what they have been saying has not been listened to, and they don't know how to be able to express those things at the moment."" Hundreds gathered, arm in arm, and raised candles as they observed a two-minute silence Mrs May has faced criticism for not meeting survivors in the immediate aftermath, unlike Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Mr Corbyn has called for empty local homes to be requisitioned if necessary. The prime minister has committed Â£5m for clothes, food and emergency supplies but was heckled with chants of ""coward"" after meeting survivors of the fire on Friday. First Secretary of StateDamian Green has defended her, saying the criticism was ""unfair"" and she was ""as distraught as all of us"". This video can not be played Theresa May says Â£5m will be available for survivors, and the cause of the Kensington fire is being looked at The Â£5m Grenfell Tower Residents' Discretionary Fund includes the aim to re-house residents within three weeks as close to where they lived before as possible, to pay for temporary housing in the meantime and to provide extra financial assistance. On Friday night, hundreds of mourners stood arm in arm at a vigil and held a two-minute silence for victims of the fire. Many wept openly as candles illuminated the road outside the Latymer Christian Centre, yards from the site of the blaze. A vigil has been set up near to the site of the disaster It came after emergency services spent a third day searching for bodies in the burnt-out tower in North Kensington.

"London fire: '58 missing, presumed dead'","A total of 58 people are dead or missing, presumed dead, following the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower in west London, police have said. Commander Stuart Cundy said that number ""may increase"". The BBC understands it could be about 70 people in total. The recovery operation at the burnt-out block of flats has resumed and could take weeks, he said. Meanwhile, PM Theresa May admitted support for families in the ""initial hours"" was ""not good enough"". The statement came after Mrs May met volunteers and some of the people made homeless by the fire. As they left Number 10, one representative spoke to reporters briefly, saying they would not make a full statement yet. ""We will be making this in the community, with the community,"" he said. ""We have had two-and-a-half hours with the prime minister in the last 48 hours and spoke about demands and what we expect."" Council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown said ""lessons must be learned"", adding that he was ""heartbroken by the tragic fire and the appalling loss of life"" Victims of the Grenfell Tower block fire and volunteers met the prime minister in Downing Street Earlier, residents caught up in the fire condemned the relief effort as ""absolute chaos"". In her statement, Mrs May said: ""Frankly, the support on the ground for families who needed help or basic information in the initial hours after this appalling disaster was not good enough."" She said phone lines would be better staffed and more staff would be deployed in the area. They would wear high-visibility clothing so they could easily be found, dispense advice and ensure the right support is provided, she added. Mrs May said she expected to announce the name of the judge for a public inquiry within the next few days. The inquiry will report back to the prime minister. She has told councils to complete urgent safety checks on similar tower blocks.

Afghan soldier attacks foreign troops,"An Afghan soldier opened fire at a base in the north. Pictured: Soldiers outside the base in April An Afghan soldier has attacked US troops at a military base, wounding seven. The US soldiers were evacuated after the ""insider attack"" in the northern Balkh province on Saturday, a spokesman for the US military command said. The Nato-led Resolute Support mission said one Afghan soldier was killed and another injured in the incident at Camp Shaheen, in Mazar-e Sharif city. But earlier reports of American soldiers being killed were dismissed. It is not clear whether the soldier killed was also the attacker. The Taliban have said the shooting was carried out by a man loyal to them, according to Reuters. Resolute Support said the attack, which took place at about 14:00 local time (09:30 GMT), was under investigation. It comes a week after an Afghan army commandoshot dead three US special forces soldiersin eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban claimed to be behind that attack. The Taliban also said they were behind another attack in Mazar-e Sharif in April, whenmore than 100 Afghan soldiers were killedor wounded at the base, home to the Afghan army's 209th Corps. The army said insurgents targeted those leaving Friday prayers at the base's mosque and others in a canteen.

'Hairy rebel' pleased to be Sir Billy,"This video can not be played Billy Connolly said he would not believe until people in Glasgow called him Sir Billy Scottish comedian Billy Connolly said he was ""pleased and a little embarrassed"" to get a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours List. The 74-year-old Glaswegian said he did not know much about what it would mean. The star told BBC Scotland: ""It won't really dawn on me until Glasgow people start calling me 'Sir Billy' or whatever they come up with."" He said it felt strange to be welcomed into the establishment as he still thought of himself as a ""hairy rebel"". Tennis coach Judy Murray, pop star Emeli Sande and Harry Potter author JK Rowling are among otherwell-known faces in Scotland to have received awards. Jack Vettriano's portrait is on a wall end in Dixon Street Sir Billy worked in Glasgow's shipyards and played banjo in folk bands before branching out into comedy in the early 1970s. His appearances on the Michael Parkinson show made him one of the UK's top stand-up comedians. But he is also an accomplished actor, winning praise for his role opposite Dame Judi Dench in Mrs Brown in 1997, as well as The Man Who Sued God and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. In recent years he has done numerous travel programmes. John Byrne's portrait is showcased in Osborne Street in Glasgow city centre In 2013 he disclosed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's and prostate cancer on the same day. However, he has since been given the all-clear from the cancer but admits that the Parkinson's is ""a pain in the arse"". Last week, a BBC Scotland documentary celebrating his 75th year unveiled three huge murals on the walls of buildings in his home city. Rachel Maclean's digital print is on display in Gallowgate Glasgow murals leave Billy Connolly 'flabbergasted' Billy Connolly: Portrait of a lifetime on iplayer On his knighthood, he said: ""I have an ordinary background and it was never on the horizon when I was growing up that I might get this."" He said his sister Flo, who died last year, would have loved him getting the honour and he wished his parents had been around to see it. ""I'm not big on pride but whatever the equivalent of pride is that is a bit decent, I've got that,"" he said. ""I'm a little embarrassed but deep within me I'm very pleased."" Connolly starred in the 1997 film Mrs Brown, for which Judi Dench won a Bafta and was nominated for an Oscar The comedian and actor, who was made a CBE in 2003, said he was not sure if ""Sir Billy"" was impressive enough. ""I feel as if I should be called Lancelot or something,"" he said. ""Sir Lancelot would be nice. Sir Billy does not have the same ring. ""I don't know if you get invited to the Round Table. I don't know anything about it."" He said the knighthood would not change him. ""It may change the way other people think of me,"" he said. ""But it won't change me at all. I'm too late to change."" Sir Billy said he felt comfortable accepting the honour, despite there being a mixed reaction in the past when he had been involved with the Royal family. He said: ""It always feels strange to be welcomed into the establishment. It is not a place I relish. ""Over the years, any time I've been associated with Royalty or anything like that it's been kind of jagged edged comments about it. ""But the way I saw it was if I was invited by those people to do things, the least I can do is respond nicely. It's the way I was brought up. ""It's an honour and I'll accept it honourably.""

Seven US Navy crew missing after crash,"This video can not be played USS Fitzgerald damaged by the crash Seven US Navy crew members are missing after their ship collided with a merchant vessel off the coast of Japan. Among the injured is the USS Fitzgerald's commanding officer, who was taken to hospital by helicopter. The destroyer collided with the container ship about 56 nautical miles (104km) south-west of Yokosuka. Aerial images showed heavy damage to the Navy ship's starboard side after the collision at about 02:30 local time on Saturday (17:30 GMT Friday). The collision occurred near Yokosuka, a Japanese port city that is home to the US 7th Fleet, which comprises up to 80 submarines and ships and including the USS Fitzgerald. It is unclear where the 154-metre (505ft) guided missile destroyer ship was heading at the time. The ACX Crystal, a 222-metre (730ft) Filipino-flagged container ship, was travelling between the Japanese cities of Nagoya and Tokyo. Marine traffic records suggest the ACX Crystal made a sudden U-turn roughly 25 minutes before the collision with the USS Fitzgerald. It is not clear why it changed course. Marine traffic records suggest it was travelling at 14.6 knots (27km/h) at the time of the collision. USS Fitzgerald crash: In pictures The ACX Crystal appeared to make a U-turn before the collision, before rapidly adjusting course and setting off to Tokyo Marine traffic records for the USS Fitzgerald are not publicly available. Japan's coastguard is co-ordinating the search with US teams for the seven missing crew members. As of late afternoon local time, the 7th Fleet said the crew members were still unaccounted for. The Navy ship's commanding officer, Cdr Bryce Benson, was in a stable condition after being transferred to US Naval Hospital Yokosuka, according to Navy officials. Two other sailors were flown to hospital by helicopter for treatments for ""lacerations and bruises"", the 7th Fleetsaid on Twitter,external. By mid-afternoon local time, it said that all flooding on board the USS Fitzgerald was under control. It is not at risk of sinking. The ship has now returned to Yokosuka - under its own power, but with limited propulsion. The damage to the ACX Crystal was less serious than to the Navy ship The Japanese coastguard said the ACX Crystal had a gross tonnage of nearly 30,000, about three times that of the USS Fitzgerald. It sustained lighter damage to its port bow, and has now reached Tokyo. The Associated Press agency said there were no injuries reported among the 20 Filipino crew members on board the container ship. Relatives of those on board the USS Fitzgerald have been posting on the US 7th Fleet's Facebook page, requesting information on their loved-ones. An information hotlinehas been set up,external. The collision took place in waters that get heavy traffic and that have experienced prior collisions, Japanese broadcaster NHK said. Ships travelling to and from Tokyo, as well as crossing the Pacific in both directions, pass through the bay where the crash happened. NHKsaid that,externalan association of commercial ship captains is calling for the creation of east-west lanes in the area to avoid collisions. In a statementreleased on social media,external, US Navy operations chief Adm John Richardson said: ""As more information is learned we will be sure to share it with the Fitzgerald families and when appropriate the public. [...] All our thoughts and concerns are with the Fitzgerald crew and their families."" The area where the collision took place is extremely busy, with shipping heading in and out of Tokyo bay. However, the USS Fitzgerald is one of the most advanced warships in the world - with highly sophisticated radar systems. At the moment the focus is on the search for the missing sailors. Later will come the investigation into how one of the world's most sophisticated warships failed to avoid colliding with a 30,000-tonne cargo ship on a calm, clear night.

'Chaos' on the ground in Grenfell relief effort,"Residents are still looking for answers and information near the Grenfell Tower site There are many things fuelling the anger felt here. The catastrophic loss of life is the primary factor, of course. But there is also the fact that people are finding it very difficult to get any information. There does not appear to be any central official point here on the ground where people can go to get answers and support. No marquee with ""help centre"" written on the side. No officials with lanyards guiding confused and desperate people to counsellors. There has been a huge voluntary response, with local churches and others helping people. Donations have flooded in - too many now - such is the public response. And unseen officials are caring for those in hospital and working to find empty accommodation in which to house those left homeless. And yet on the ground people speak of a total lack of coordination from the government andKensington and Chelsea council,external. Local residents' association representatives say some families are still sleeping on floors in centres around the Grenfell Tower four days after the fire. They talk of absolute chaos. And they say what they regard as the inability of the local council to respond to their needs and concerns is ""symptomatic of why we had this disaster"". Such is the total and utter lack of trust between residents and the officials in charge. One of the things fuelling the anger here - perhaps the main thing - is the lack of a central point of contact for answers. Residents demonstrate outside Kensington Town Hall Crisis management at disasters around the world swings into action at varying speeds. But even in remote areas, international bodies have normally set up obvious local centres of support fairly soon after the event. It has not happened in North Kensington. Twenty-four hours after the 2010 Haitian earthquake, I arrived to find no international response to speak of. But within another 24 hours that response was arriving and was significant there three days after the disaster - teams from around the world flying in, crisis centres and the United Nations in control of feeding points and housing solutions. Yes, there were problems. There always are. But the centralised and visible response was in place days later in a relatively remote area. That is what appears to be missing in the richest borough in one of the world's leading cities. Kensington and Chelsea council's website refers to a ""Family and Friends Reception"",externalat the Westway Sports Centre, staffed by police. People need to be taken care of, says one former resident People need visible and accessible emotional psychological and physical help and right now they say they are not getting it. Many people here believe an affluent Conservative council failed to look after its poorest residents. But one angry former resident of the tower, who moved out in October, said: ""Right now the residents need housing and taking care of. The council have failed to do so. ""This is not about politics. It is about getting people what they need and deserve. It is an outrage."" There has been little trust between residents and the council over the years. They say their concerns about safety in the Grenfell Tower were not listened to - not acted upon. Right now that lack of trust is deepening. And so is the anger. First Secretary of State Damian Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:  ""Kensington council are absolutely doing their best. ""People want answers, people want someone on the ground. The new recovery taskforce that the prime minister is chairing has people from central government as well as from the council on the ground to answer all those perfectly reasonable questions. ""It was decided to do it yesterday, it is happening today,"" he added. Matthew Price reports for theToday programme on BBC Radio 4.

In pictures: Entertainment honours,"A host of leading figures from the world of arts and entertainment have been recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours. They include two Connollys, a winner of the Eurovision Song Contest and a veteran Hollywood actress who turns 101 this year. Here are pictures of and quotes from some of those honoured. Billy Connolly, the Scottish comedian and actor known to millions as 'The Big Yin', receives a knighthood for services to entertainment and charity. The 74-year-old told the BBC he was ""very pleased"" by an honour that was ""never on the horizon"" when he was growing up in Glasgow in the 1940s and '50s. ""It's so odd for someone from that background to get [a knighthood],"" said the former welder who began his show-business career as a folk singer. ""It always feels strange to be welcomed into the establishment but I feel completely comfortable with it,"" he continued. Ed Sheeranhas even more reason to be cheerful, having been made an MBE for services to music and charity. The chart-topping singer-songwriter released his third album, Divide, earlier this year and will be the headline act on the last night of the Glastonbury Festival next weekend. Julie Walters, an actress whose long career in film, television and theatre has shown her to be as adept as comedy as she is with drama, has been made a dame. Much-loved for her TV collaborations with the late Victoria Wood, she has starred in such films as Educating Rita, Billy Elliot and the Harry Potter series and was recently seen in Channel 4's National Treasure. June Whitfield, another actress with a long history of beloved television comedy, has also been made a dame. The 91-year-old star of Terry and June and Absolutely Fabulous told the BBC the honour had come as ""a great surprise"". ""I never in a million years thought I would become a dame,"" said the actress, who received an OBE in 1985 and a CBE in 1998. ""I've met some of the other dames and it's absolutely wonderful to join the club."" Former BeatleSir Paul McCartneyand authorJK Rowlinghave become companions of honour alongside designer Sir Terence Conran and cookery expert Delia Smith. ""I'm very happy about this huge honour and with the news coming on my birthday weekend and Father's Day it makes it colossal!"" said Sir Paul, who turns 75 on Sunday. ""I'm deeply honoured and proud to be nominated for this honour for services to literature and philanthropy and to be included in the distinguished and diversely talented company of the other Companions of Honour,"" said Harry Potter creator Rowling. Olivia de Havilland, the veteran Hollywood actress who played Scarlett O'Hara's sister-in-law in Gone with the Wind, receives a damehood just a few weeks before she turns 101. The double Oscar winner, who was born in Tokyo to British parents on 1 July 1916, becomes the oldest woman to become a dame since the modern-day honours system began. ""I am extremely proud that the Queen has appointed me a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire,"" said the star of such films as The Heiress, The Snake Pit and The Adventures of Robin Hood. ""To receive this honour as my 101st birthday approaches is the most gratifying of birthday presents."" He's a best-selling author, a judge on Britain's Got Talent and he's swum both the English Channel and the length of the Thames for Sport Relief. Now comedian and writerDavid Walliamshas been made an OBE for services to charity and the arts - something he says will be cherished most by his mother Kathleen. ""The news made me happy, but nobody is happier than my mum,"" the 45-year-old Little Britain star told the Press Association. She's always been a smooth operator. Now sultry singer-songwriterSade- real name Helen Folasade Adu - has a CBE to add to the OBE she received in 2002. Emeli Sande, meanwhile, becomes an OBE for services to music. The Scottish singer memorably performed at both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Olympics. Author and illustratorRaymond Briggs, creator of The Snowman and and Fungus the Bogeyman, becomes a CBE at the age of 83. This picture, taken in London's Hyde Park in 2008, shows him and a friend seated next to a deckchair adorned with perhaps his best-loved character. BroadcasterGloria Hunnifordbecomes an OBE for services to cancer charities through breast screening services and cancer support. The 77-year-old sadly lost her daughter Caron to cancer in 2004. June Spencer, another broadcasting veteran, becomes a CBE. The 98-year-old actress, who plays Peggy Woolley on The Archers, is the only original cast member who can still be heard on Radio 4's long-running rural soap. Spencer said her CBE was ""an unexpected and great honour"", while Huw Kennair-Jones, editor of The Archers, said it was ""incredibly well deserved"". Patricia HodgeandSarah Lancashireboth become OBEs for services to drama. Hodge is known for such shows as Miranda, Rumpole of the Bailey and The Life and Loves of a She-Devil, while former Coronation Street star Lancashire won a Bafta this year for the BBC's Happy Valley. BothTony HawksandNatasha Kaplinskyare known to millions for their radio and television work. Yet both have been recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours for their activities outside the studio. Hawks becomes an MBE for services to disadvantaged children in Moldova, while Kaplinsky has been made an OBE for services to Holocaust commemoration. Kaplinsky is a member of the United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Foundation advisory board and has spent the past 15 months voluntarily interviewing 112 British survivors. ""Obviously this is a huge honour to receive an OBE but it gives me an opportunity to talk about the extraordinary people that I've met throughout this project,"" said the ITV newsreader and former Strictly Come Dancing winner. ActressGugu Mbatha-Rawhas been made an MBE, as has writer and directorAmma Asante. The pair worked together on 2013 film Belle, which told the real life story of a mixed-race woman who was brought up as an aristocrat in 18th Century London.

9 stars who turned down great film roles,"Reynolds' role in 1972's Deliverance made him a star Hollywood legend Burt Reynolds,who died on Thursday, had a long list of impressive films to his name, including Smokey and the Bandit, Deliverance and Boogie Nights. But he could have had even more. During his 60-year career, he claimed to have turned down several huge roles, including James Bond and Han Solo. Obituary: Burt Reynolds Reynolds was eyed up as the replacement for Sean Connery's Bond, buttold USA Today in 2015,externalthat he turned down the part because he thought the public wouldn't accept an American 007. ""It was a stupid thing to say, I could've done it and I could've done it well,"" he said. He could have also been Han Solo in Star Wars, a part that was eventually played by Harrison Ford. Reynolds said in hindsight he regretted turning it down. He toldBusiness Insider in 2016,external: ""I just didn't want to play that kind of role at the time."" If that's not enough, he also decided against starring alongside Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, leaving the door open for Richard Gere. He also said John McClane in Die Hard wasn't for him either, with Bruce Willis eventually taking that role. Here are other actors who turned down some pretty stellar roles. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio turned down Brokeback Mountain, Van Sant said Brokeback Mountain was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, but producers struggled to cast any major actors in the film. Before the movie went to Ang Lee to direct, another director, Gus Van Sant, had been working on the project in its early stages. Van Sant wanted big stars, but recentlytold IndieWire,external: ""Nobody wanted to do it. ""I asked the usual suspects: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Ryan Phillippe. They all said no."" Producer and screenwriter Diana Ossana confirmed: ""Yes, all those young gentlemen turned down the project, for various reasons."" Heath Ledger eventually stepped up to the role of farmer Ennis and received an Oscar nomination and much praise for his performance. John Lithgow auditioned to play The Joker, eventually played by Jack Nicholson John Lithgow as The Joker? It's not as crackpot as it appears - the star of The Crown was once in the frame to play the comic book supervillain. Correction: The lanky 71-year-old was actually tapped to play Batman's cackling nemesis TWICE - first in a Joe Dante movie that never got made, and again in Tim Burton's 1989 blockbuster. ""My worst audition was for Tim Burton for Batman,""Lithgow revealed,externalahead of the Tony Awards in 2017. ""I tried to persuade him I was not right for the part, and I succeeded."" Jack Nicholson went on to play The Joker and ending up making a cool $100m (Â£78.5m) in profit participation. Emma Watson and Emma Stone with their respective MTV Movie award and Oscar for Beauty and the Beast and La La Land Emma Stone may have won an Oscar for La La Land, but it was another Emma who was originally attached to star in Damien Chazelle's Los Angeles-set romance alongside Whiplash's Miles Teller. ""There was a moment where Emma Watson and Miles Teller were doing it,"" the directorrevealed last year,external. ""Neither of those casting things wound up lasting or working out."" ""It's one of these frustrating things where names get attached to projects very early on as a way to build anticipation for something that's coming before anything is really actually agreed,"" is how Watsonexplained the situation in March,externallast year. The Harry Potter actress still got a chance to sing and dance though, thanks to her role as Belle in Disney's Beauty and the Beast remake. Sir Sean's confusion was Sir Ian's gain ""You shall not pass!"" bellows Gandalf in the first Lord of the Rings film. But Sir Sean Connery did indeed pass on the chance to play Tolkien's beardy wizard. ""I never understood it,"" Sir Seanhas been quoted as saying,external. ""I read the book. I read the script. I saw the movie. I still don't understand it."" ""The films would have been very different if it had been Sean Connery,""said Sir Ian McKellen,external, who ended up as Gandalf in The Fellowship of the Ring and got nominated for an Oscar for his efforts. ""Gandalf would have come from Scotland for a start!"" Christina Applegate said Witherspoon ""did a much better job"" than she would have The role of Elle Woods in Legally Blonde suited Reese Witherspoon so well it's hard to believe she wasn't first choice. But no - a host of other actresses were considered before she came on board, among them Christina Applegate of Anchorman and Married with Children fame. Having played a scatty blonde in the latter TV show, Applegate passed - allowing Witherspoon to land the role for which she would be nominated for a Golden Globe. ""I got scared of kind of repeating myself,"" Christinarevealed in 2015,external. ""What a stupid move that was, right?"" John Travolta and Tom Hanks pose with their respective wives, Kelly Preston (second from right) and Rita Wilson, in 1995 Life is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're going to get. What few people know, though, is that we could have gotten John Travolta as Forrest Gump instead of the Oscar-winning Tom Hanks. Travolta was offered the title role in Robert Zemeckis's film, but he turned it down and ended up making Pulp Fiction instead. Gump and Pulp would eventually go up against each other at the 1995 Oscars, where Forrest won six awards compared to Fiction's one. Warren Beatty's departure opened the door for David Carradine in Tarantino's film Quentin Tarantino may have secured Travolta's services for Pulp Fiction, but he was less successful at persuading Warren Beatty to take the title role in Kill Bill. Beatty had reservations about the amount of time Tarantino would spend shooting in China and withdrew from the project, enabling David Carradine to take on the part. ""I didn't want to leave my kids,"" is how Beatty explained his departure from QT's two-part opus on MTV'sHappy Sad Confused podcast,externallast year. ""Warren was a good choice and would have been wonderful in the movie,""said Tarantino in 2004,external, insisting that ""there was no animosity"" over how the situation played out. Will Smith and Keanu Reeves in pictures from their Men in Black and Matrix franchises Another actor Quentin Tarantino got a big fat no from was Will Smith, who was up for the title role in Django Unchained before Jamie Foxx. The one that really got away, though, was the role of Neo in The Matrix - a project Smith later claimed he would not have been right for anyway. ""The Matrix is a difficult concept to pitch,"" Smithtold Wired in 2004,external. ""In the pitch, I just didn't see it. ""I watched Keanu's performance - and very rarely do I say this - but I would have messed it up. At that point I wasn't smart enough as an actor to let the movie be."" Will's wife Jada would go on to work with Reeves in the second and third films in the Matrix trilogy, while Keanu would work with their son Jaden in The Day The Earth Stood Still. Julia Roberts won an Oscar for Erin Brockovich two years after Gwyneth Paltrow won hers for Shakespeare in Love Some years before it became an Oscar-winning film, Shakespeare in Love was all set to be a glossy vehicle for the star of Pretty Woman. Yet Roberts wanted Daniel Day-Lewis to be her Shakespeare, and when he turned the project down, so did she. ""Daniel wasn't interested, so Julia withdrew and the whole thing fell through just six weeks before filming was due to begin,""revealed cast member Simon Callow,externalin 2014. Gwyneth Paltrow would eventually win an Academy Award - and give a famously emotional acceptance speech - for playing the role Roberts turned down. Mickey Rourke and Nicholas Cage appeared together in 1983 film Rumble Fish Mickey Rourke was director Darren Aronofsky's first choice to play Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson - the over-the-hill subject of his 2008 film The Wrestler. Unfortunately Rourke was box office poison at the time, so Nicolas Cage was offered the role instead. But after accepting the part, Cage had second thoughts. ""The character is a wrestler who's in trouble because of steroids,""he explained in 2009,external. ""It occurred to me I wasn't going to be able to achieve the look without resorting to steroids, which I would never do - so I resigned from the movie."" Aronofsky eventually got Rourke, who wound up with a Golden Globe, a Bafta and an Oscar nomination. A version of this feature was originally published in June 2017.

Caught in the crossfire in Colombia,"Many of the houses are built on stilts to prevent them being flooded when the rivers rise ""You get so nervous you don't know if to run and hide or what to do; we went into the kitchen and hid behind the freezer in the hope that it would protect us,"" MarÃ­a (not her real name) recalls of the time she and her family were caught in the crossfire between two armed groups. Like every weekend, MarÃ­a was visiting her parents in IscuandÃ©, a municipality on Colombia's Pacific coast. MarÃ­a and her relatives were in the family's stilt house, typical for this region criss-crossed by rivers, when a speedboat carrying armed men came up the river. MarÃ­a does not know who the armed men in the boat were, but she does know who started shooting at them from the hill behind her family home: ELN rebels. The ELN, or National Liberation Army, is Colombia's second-largest guerrilla group, and despite being engaged in peace talks with the government, the group is still very much active. About 50 ELN rebels had surrounded the family home without MarÃ­a noticing. ""I had never seen a shot being fired before, I had heard [shots fired], but had never seen bullets flying; they passed underneath my house, by the sides, everywhere."" ""The children were crying, my father, too, we were all crying,"" MarÃ­a says. She started praying but the ELN rebels came into the house and took her and her family up into the hills. ELN peace talks: What are the challenges? Why is there a rise in activists' murders? The rebels accused her of stashing weapons for the armed group in the speedboat, which MarÃ­a denied. ""They put a rifle to my head, to my father's head, to the children's heads."" Eventually, four hours after the shoot-out had started, the rebels let the family go. Scared of returning home, the family moved from their home on stilts to the main town, along with 31 other families from the area where the shoot-out happened. MarÃ­a and nine other members of her family now live in two rented rooms and share two mattresses. Her father has not been able to work because it is too dangerous to go back to the forest where he made a living logging. ""I am worried, I don't know how we will survive,"" MarÃ­a says. And she is not the only one. Dozens more families here have been forcibly displaced by a surge in violence in areas formerly controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). People in IscuandÃ© are concerned about armed groups trying to take over the illicit businesses of the Farc The Farc signed a peace deal with the government last year and their members are demobilising in ""transition zones"", where they are handing over their weapons to United Nations monitors. But with the Farc no longer in control, other armed groups are trying to take over their profitable cocaine smuggling and illegal gold mining rackets. The groups clash with each other and the security forces. ""A war has started in the areas where the Farc used to be,"" says local government official Luis Enrique Sinisterra. Luis Enrique Sinisterra says IscuandÃ© is suffering higher levels of violence now Nationwide, the levels of violence may have dropped as a result of the Farc peace deal, but the picture here is a different one. Mr Sinisterra says he is not surprised by the rise in violence in IscuandÃ©. He argues that what is needed is a stronger presence by the national government. He is not just speaking of the security forces but of investment in education, health, housing and infrastructure. Local residents say there is not enough police presence His prediction of what might happen if that investment should not be forthcoming is a bleak one: ""The war will continue for a long time and lots of people will have to lose their lives."" And it is not just IscuandÃ© which feels abandoned by the government. The Pacific coast is one of Colombia's poorest areas. It is the area to which slaves brought from Africa escaped to until slavery was abolished, and the heart of the present-day Afro-Colombian community. Now it is is seeing a new and menacing influx, one of armed groups keen to take hold where the Farc retreated. ELN peace talks: What are the challenges?

Call for sex book ban at temples lined with erotic art,"The temples of Khajuraho feature a wide variety of erotic sculpture Some social media users in India are seething over a Hindu group's demand to ban a famous ancient book on love and sex in temples which are widely known for their erotic sculptures. The leader of the little-known Bajrang Sena group was outraged at the reading material being hawked inside the world-famous Khajuraho temples. ""These temples have religious significanceâ¦. How can you allow Kamasutra to be sold in the sacred premises?"" Jyoti Agarwal toldthe Hindustan Times,external. ""What sort of moral values are we passing on to our younger generation?"" The group asked the police to step in, arguing that selling the book in a holy place is an affront to Indian culture. But Twitter users were quick to point out an apparent contradiction: the Khajuraho temples are widely known for their sculptures, including stone carvings of men and women in various sexual positions. ""Did they look at the walls of the Khajuraho temple before asking for this?"" asked one Twitter user. Another posted a picture of some of the statues with the message: ""That awkward moment when those protesting the sale of Kamasutra books at Khajuraho look up at the temples."" When asked by the Hindustan Times, Agarwal said she wasn't opposed to the sculptures remaining in the temples, but argued that they shouldn't be heavily promoted. Her view didn't stop thousands of critics of Bajrang Sena, a right-wing nationalist group, from tweeting about the controversy, many using the hashtag ""Khajuraho"". A Unesco world heritage site, the Khajuraho temples attract millions of tourists from across the world. The group of about 20 temples in India's central Madhya Pradesh state were built over a thousand years ago and belong to two different religions - Hinduism and Jainism. The debate over erotic art is the latest episode in India's culture wars, with some arguing that Hindu nationalist groups have become bolder since the arrival of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the national scene in 2014. But amid all the outrage, there were plenty of jokes. ""Sexual reproduction is against Indian culture,"" Facebook user Vageesh Vishnoi sarcastically wrote. ""Please use morally approved techniques like parthenogenesis and binary fission."" ""Could it be that the only purpose of sites like Khajuraho was pornographic?"" tweeted @CholericCleric.

That is what a prime minister should do and that is what she has done.

Cuba denounces Trump's rollback,"This video can not be played Has Trump really 'cancelled' Cuba deal? Cuba's government has denounced US President Donald Trump's decision to roll back on policy changes towards the island nation. However, it says it will still co-operate with its larger neighbour. Speaking earlier in Miami, Florida, Mr Trump said he was reimposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by the Obama administration, condemning a ""completely one-sided deal"". But he is not reversing key diplomatic and commercial ties. ""The government of Cuba denounces the new measures toughening the embargo,"" Cuban state TV said. But it also reiterated ""its willingness to continue the respectful dialogue and cooperation"". Barack Obama attempted to thaw relations by loosening trade and tourism bans. Four takeaways from Trump's Cuba policy The new Cuba policy: What's at stake? Trump accused of Cuba embargo breach President Trump says his new policy will tighten rules on travel and on sending funds to Cuba. This video can not be played What is Trump changing with Cuba? Announcing the changes on Friday, he cited human rights concerns, saying doing a deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government was ""terrible"" and ""misguided"". Later that night, Cuban state news was also talking tough. ""Any strategy aimed at changing the political, economic and social system in Cuba - whether by pressure or imposition or through more subtle means - is destined to fail,"" it said. However, President Trump is not rowing back on all parts of Obama's deal. He will not close the US embassy in Havana, commercial flights from the US will continue, and Americans will still be able to return home with Cuban goods. Santiago Portal (L), Jose Nadal (C) and Cathy Henderson (R) ""The embargo should continue. Why give credit to a country where the people donÂ´t see a penny? They are still starving and there is no freedom whatsoever. Why should we keep feeding the people who are on top when they repress their own people.""Jose Nadal ""I  am 100% Republican. I agree 150% with everything Trump says and does. They should impose more sanctions against Cuba. When Obama made the agreement and restored relations with the Cuban government, he gave them everything they asked for. We received nothing from the Cuban government. This is why Trump wants to strengthen the sanctions.""Cathy Henderson ""I am against the embargo. The Cuban tyranny uses the embargo as a pretext to justify that it has failed. Everything bad that happens in Cuba, they blame the embargo.""Santiago Portal Courtesy of BBC Mundo 1959:Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro leads a guerrilla army into Havana overthrowing the Batista regime. 1960:In response to Castro's communist reforms, US breaks off diplomatic relations with Cuba and imposes a trade embargo. 1962:Castro agrees to allow the Soviet Union to deploy nuclear missiles on the island bringing the US and the USSR to the brink of nuclear war.

Protests held as fire anger increases,"This video can not be played Angry protesters stormed Kensington Town Hall, demanding answers Protests were held in London as residents demanded support for those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. Between 50 and 60 people stormed Kensington and Chelsea Town Hall as members of the public said the homeless needed help ""right now"". Crowds gathered outside a hall where PM Theresa May met survivors and protests were also held at Downing Street. Mrs May sanctioned Â£5m for clothes, food and emergency supplies, as the death toll rose to at least 30. The BBC understands those missing could number about 70, with the 30 likely to be among that number. Three of those who diedhave been identified. There was nothing to suggest the fire was started deliberately, police said. Between 50 and 60 protesters rushed into the council building Hundreds of mourners stood arm in arm at a vigil and held a two-minute silence for victims of the fire. Many wept openly as candles illuminated the road outside the Latymer Christian Centre, yards from the site of the blaze. The fire broke out shortly before 01:00 BST on Wednesday. It tore through all floors of the building and took more than 200 firefighters 24 hours to bring it under control. Mahad Egal, who escaped his fourth floor flat with his family, said: ""At first it seemed it was controllable, but really quickly the fire started to rise as the cladding caught fire. It is incredible we survived."" Emergency services spent a third day searching for bodies in the burnt-out Grenfell Tower in North Kensington. A vigil has been set up near to the site of the disaster Hundreds gathered arm in arm and raised candles as they observed a two-minute silence This video can not be played An angry crowd chanted to Theresa May: ""Shame on you!"" The first protest began at around 15:00 at the town hall and scores later joined it. At about 16:30, people began to rush up the steps and make their way into the building. One member of the public said: ""Nobody knows what is happening. People are so angry. Those people shouldn't be sleeping in the street."" Mustafa Al Mansur, who organised the protest, read a statement from the council which promised to re-house as many people locally as they could and to provide funding for those affected. But he called the response ""flimsy"" with ""no concrete answers"" - especially on the question of number of residents who lived in the flats. Latest updates: Death toll expected to rise What we know so far 'The working class aren't being listened to' How one Grenfell Tower resident escaped May faces criticism over Grenfell visit ""The people were not satisfied with the answers,"" he told BBC News. ""The people were getting frustrated and they walked towards the building. They did not force themselves inside. They got inside the main building and were in the foyer, just speaking."" Police then arrived on the scene and formed a barricade, which Mr Al Mansur said led to ""physical confrontation"" between the two sides. There were then angry scenes outside the Clement James Centre, in North Kensington, where the meeting with the prime minister and residents of the tower had been held. Police surrounded a car outside the church and community centre Dozens of demonstrators surged towards the entrance and there were scuffles outside as organisers appealed for calm. Mrs May had faced criticism for not meeting with survivors in the immediate aftermath, unlike Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Fragile government facing huge challenge Asked about the reaction of the crowd, Mrs May defended the government's response. ""What I am now absolutely focused on is ensuring we get that support on the ground,"" she said. This video can not be played Theresa May says Â£5m will be available for survivors, and the cause of the Kensington fire is being looked at ""The government is making money available, we are ensuring we are going to get to the bottom of what has happened, we will ensure that people are re-housed. We need to make sure that actually happens."" Mr Corbyn wrote an open letter to the prime minister, calling for the public inquiry to ensure ""all necessary lessons are learned"". The Labour leader added:  ""[The inquiry] must be empowered to consider all the steps that were, or were not, taken leading up to and contributing to this most terrible incident. ""It must also identify the urgent steps that need to be taken in relation to fire safety standards for other buildings of this nature."" Families appeal for missing relatives Sense of community shines through Requisition houses, urges Corbyn Grenfell Tower wall of condolence - read the tributes Large crowds of people also gathered in Westminster and made their way to Downing Street. The crowd was heard chanting, ""Justice for Grenfell"", along with ""May must go"" and ""blood on your hands"". A peaceful march started making its way down Whitehall and was halted by police outside Downing Street, before moving to Oxford Circus, where demonstrators carried out a sit-down protest. The march continued up Regent Street, where they held a minute's silence outside the BBC's headquarters, and continued towards Marble Arch and Notting Hill, ending at Lancaster Gate. Protesters begin marching from Parliament Square The Â£5m Grenfell Tower Residents' Discretionary Fund, announced by Mrs May, includes the aim to re-house residents within three weeks as close to where they lived before as possible, to pay for temporary housing in the meantime and to provide extra financial assistance. During her meeting with survivors, the PM also said they would be consulted on the terms of the public inquiry announced on Thursday and receive state funding for legal representation. Mrs May said: ""Everyone affected by this tragedy needs reassurance that the government is there for them at this terrible time - and that is what I am determined to provide."" The Queen and Duke of Cambridge also met volunteers, residents and community representatives during a visit to the Westway Sports Centre. The Queen paid tribute to the ""bravery"" of firefighters and the ""incredible generosity"" of volunteers now offering support.

Seven US Navy crew missing after collision,"This video can not be played USS Fitzgerald damaged by the crash Seven US Navy crew members are missing after their ship collided with a merchant vessel off the coast of Japan. Among the injured is the USS Fitzgerald's commanding officer, who was taken to hospital by helicopter. The destroyer collided with the container ship about 56 nautical miles (104km) south-west of Yokosuka. Aerial images showed heavy damage to the Navy ship's starboard side after the collision at about 02:30 local time on Saturday (17:30 GMT Friday). The collision occurred near Yokosuka, a Japanese port city that is home to the US 7th Fleet, which comprises up to 80 submarines and ships and including the USS Fitzgerald. It is unclear where the 154-metre (505ft) guided missile destroyer ship was heading at the time. The ACX Crystal, a 222-metre (730ft) Filipino-flagged container ship, was travelling between the Japanese cities of Nagoya and Tokyo. Marine traffic records suggest the ACX Crystal made a sudden U-turn roughly 25 minutes before the collision with the USS Fitzgerald. It is not clear why it changed course. Marine traffic records suggest it was travelling at 14.6 knots (27km/h) at the time of the collision. USS Fitzgerald crash: In pictures The ACX Crystal appeared to make a U-turn before the collision, before rapidly adjusting course and setting off to Tokyo Marine traffic records for the USS Fitzgerald are not publicly available. Japan's coastguard is co-ordinating the search with US teams for the seven missing crew members. As of late afternoon local time, the 7th Fleet said the crew members were still unaccounted for. The Navy ship's commanding officer, Cdr Bryce Benson, was in a stable condition after being transferred to US Naval Hospital Yokosuka, according to Navy officials. Two other sailors were flown to hospital by helicopter for treatments for ""lacerations and bruises"", the 7th Fleetsaid on Twitter,external. By mid-afternoon local time, it said that all flooding on board the USS Fitzgerald was under control. It is not at risk of sinking. The ship has now returned to Yokosuka - under its own power, but with limited propulsion. The damage to the ACX Crystal was less serious than to the Navy ship The Japanese coastguard said the ACX Crystal had a gross tonnage of nearly 30,000, about three times that of the USS Fitzgerald. It sustained lighter damage to its port bow, and has now reached Tokyo. The Associated Press agency said there were no injuries reported among the 20 Filipino crew members on board the container ship. Relatives of those on board the USS Fitzgerald have been posting on the US 7th Fleet's Facebook page, requesting information on their loved-ones. An information hotlinehas been set up,external. The collision took place in waters that get heavy traffic and that have experienced prior collisions, Japanese broadcaster NHK said. Ships travelling to and from Tokyo, as well as crossing the Pacific in both directions, pass through the bay where the crash happened. NHKsaid that,externalan association of commercial ship captains is calling for the creation of east-west lanes in the area to avoid collisions. In a statementreleased on social media,external, US Navy operations chief Adm John Richardson said: ""As more information is learned we will be sure to share it with the Fitzgerald families and when appropriate the public. [...] All our thoughts and concerns are with the Fitzgerald crew and their families."" The area where the collision took place is extremely busy, with shipping heading in and out of Tokyo bay. However, the USS Fitzgerald is one of the most advanced warships in the world - with highly sophisticated radar systems. At the moment the focus is on the search for the missing sailors. Later will come the investigation into how one of the world's most sophisticated warships failed to avoid colliding with a 30,000-tonne cargo ship on a calm, clear night.
