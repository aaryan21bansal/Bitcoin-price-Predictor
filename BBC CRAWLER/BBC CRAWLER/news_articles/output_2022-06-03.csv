London's iconic Camden Market put up for sale,"London's historic Camden Market has been put up for sale. The market's billionaire owner is reportedly hoping a deal will net him as much as Â£1.5bn. Investment bank Rothschild & Co is overseeing the sale process, the BBC understands. The 16-acre patchwork of more than 1,000 stalls, bars, shops, and cafes, in north London is a popular tourist destination. But it has long been associated with counter-cultural movements, from punks to hippies, priding itself on the breadth of independent retailers selling fresh produce, trinkets, and arts and crafts. Fire hits London's Camden Lock Market Camden fire: 'It's our heart and soul' The market sprung up out of a run-down timber yard in 1972, after it was purchased by two childhood friends. Now, it claims to attract 28 million visitors a year, and could be the subject of a potential bidding war as its Israeli owner, Teddy Sagi, looks to offload it after eight years of ownership. Made up of three separate zones - Camden Lock Market, Stables Market, and Buck Street Market - the estate also includes housing, co-working spaces, and a 35,000-sq-ft, three-floor leisure centre called Babylon Park. A selection of bidders have been contacted in the past week,according to the Financial Times,external, which first reported on the deal, with Mr Sagi - who made his money by founding and selling an online gambling company - hoping to field offers as high as Â£1.5bn for the area. Since 2014, when Mr Sagi first acquired property in Camden Market, many of the independent sellers have left the area, being replaced by more well-established brands. Drawn in by the youthful, anti-establishment atmosphere, waves of corporate giants from MTV to Santander have moved to the area in recent decades, changing the face of the neighbourhood. The site was originally put up for sale by Mr Sagi in 2019 but was later taken off the market as the pandemic hit. The businessman's latest venture in Camden is the Hawley Wharf redevelopment, which opened in August 2021 and promised to hark back to the area's golden days. The corporate website for Camden Market describes it as a ""brand new new waterside destination of retail, leisure and food traders"", which ""reboots and restores Camden's chaotic charm"".

Anger of fishermen at closure of safety pontoon,"The pontoon, which has helped fishermen get their catch to shore, has closed partly due to storm damage Fishermen have said they are scared for their lives and livelihood after a safety pontoon was closed. The commercial fishermen said the pontoon on Patch beach, near Cardigan, Ceredigion, was used to help collect and deliver their catch to land. It was closed due to ""safety reasons"", but fishermen claimed there was more of a risk without it. Ceredigion council said it would look at the options surrounding its future in both the short and long term. Patch beach is some two miles downstream from Cardigan and although it's an idyllic part of the estuary, it is notorious for being dangerous. Over the years many people have been caught out by the tide and some have died. Ancient fishing tradition 'destroyed by rules' Welsh fishermen 'devastated' by Brexit trade deal Fishermen criticise giant tuna catching plan delay However, it is also an ideal location for access to Cardigan Bay for commercial fishermen. Aaron Walters says the pontoon was introduced for safety, but has been taken away from fishermen who need it The pontoon was built on the beach more than 16 years ago to offer protection from the elements and some safety, according to Aaron Walters, who uses the pontoon to get his catch on shore. ""You can have four to five knots of tide on the river as the water shoots through,"" he said. ""You've got the sandbanks as well - if the tide pushes you onto the sandbanks you'll get stuck. If there's a southerly gale the weather here can be very dangerous. ""Last summer, there were two young boys playing here. The tide was starting to go out and they got washed into the middle of the river. We went after them in the dinghy. They didn't know what had happened. ""This pontoon is massive in terms of safety. If you have bad weather you can come in behind the pontoon and it's quieter. If we haven't got this here we just have big waves crashing on the beach."" Len Walters says a lot of children fish in the area and it puts them at risk Usually the fishermen would be able to bring their vehicles onto the pontoon to collect their catch but storms over the last year have caused too much damage. Part of the pontoon has blown up onto dry land which didn't exist before the storms, the tracking boards were blown away and had to be tied down with rope by the fishermen. When they turned up recently the pontoon was closed with tape preventing entry as the council had closed it due to safety concerns. However, fisherman Len Walters said it came without warning and the seven businesses who use it have been affected. He said: ""Two boats go out on trips - 24 people every time, every hour. ""Throughout the summer it's packed with children fishing for green crabs. It's a fantastic asset for the area. But something is going to happen again - someone is going to drown out there."" He added one day people will ""give up, they won't have much choice"". ""If you're going to spend two to three hours to get your catch off the boat and then another hour to meet the lorry afterward the fish will be dead. ""How do you get equipment on the boat? Bags of rope, the pots, pot weights. You'll be back and forth all day. You can only take so many pots in one go. You just can't do it."" Teifi Estuary can be seen from Patch beach and is popular with children in the summer, say the local fishermen Ceredigion council said the tenant, Afon Teifi Fairways Ltd (ATFL), has operational responsibility for the pontoon. Following consultation with the local authority, ATFL said it had taken reasonable steps to restrict access to the pontoon. Following a report undertaken by the company that originally supplied the pontoon, the council said it will look to work with stakeholders to look and consider options for its future.

Imperial measures push will add costs - Asda boss,"The UK government's push to revive imperial measurements is ""utter nonsense"" and will cost businesses, a leading retail boss has said. The government haslaunched a review,externalof how traders can use the UK's traditional weighing system for goods. British shops had to use metric measurements under EU rules, with the option to show imperial equivalents - pounds and ounces - alongside. But critics say the review is nostalgic and could burden businesses. Asda chairman and Tory peer Lord Rose said promoting the use of imperial measurements post-Brexit would only please a ""small minority who hark for the past"". ""It's complete and utter nonsense and it will add cost to those people who have to put it into place,"" Lord Rose told Times Radio. He added: ""We have got serious problems in the world and we're now saying let's go backwards. Does anybody in this country below the age of about 40 know how many ounces there are in a pound?"" Lord Rose headed the anti-Brexit Stronger in Europe campaign ahead of the 2016 referendum. Imperial measurement review to mark Jubilee Imperial units just part of Brexit revamp - No 10 Did the EU ban crown marks on pint glasses? Under EU rules from 2000 copied over after Brexit, traders can use imperial measurements alongside metric, but they cannot be more prominent. In September, the government said it would review these rules as part of broader plans to reshape UK law after Brexit, and legislate ""in due course"". On Friday - the second day of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations -the government launched a consultation,externalon ""how to implement a change to the law on weights and measures"". The consultation would help ministers consider whether goods should be ""sold in pounds only, or in pounds with a less prominent metric equivalent"", the government said. ""There is no intention to require businesses to change their existing practices and so this will not place greater costs on businesses"", the government said. The government said the announcement was ""not just about pounds and ounces, but about where the UK's laws are made"". As part of the announcement, the government also published guidance for businesses who want to put a crown symbol on pint glasses. The symbol used to show that a glass accurately measured a pint in the UK. In 2006, EU legislation implemented the CE mark as the symbol of an accurate measure on pint glasses. Business Minister Paul Scully said restoring the crown symbol to pint glasses would be a ""fitting tribute"" to the Queen. Butin new guidance,external, the government admitted the crown symbol would only be a ""decorative measure"", with glasses still required to have legal conformity markings. It is also the case that pint glasses were allowed to have ""stylised"" crowns in addition to the CE legal marking when the UK was a member of the EU. Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesperson Christine Jardine said the renewed focus on imperial measurements was a ""deflection tactic"". ""Businesses are really struggling to cope with soaring energy bills and staff shortages after a tough couple of years during the pandemic,"" Ms Jardine said. ""They need real targeted support to stay afloat, not a push towards imperial measurements or a different symbol on a glass."" A Labour spokesperson said the party would cut costs for businesses and consumers, instead of making changes to measurement rules. ""Labour backs British firms and will make Brexit work for them and consumers,"" the spokesperson said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed support for reviving imperial units Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who won a landslide election victory in 2019 after campaigning for Brexit, has long backed a revival of imperial units. His leadership has come under pressure in recent days since the publication ofa highly critical report about lockdown parties,externalin Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic. The report, by senior civil servant Sue Gray, criticised ""failures of leadership"" and examined parties attended by Mr Johnson, who was fined by the police for attending one event in June 2020. Twelve Conservative MPs have publicly called on Mr Johnson to quitsince the release of the report, bringing the total to almost 30. On Friday, the prime minister received a mixed reception of boos and cheers from crowds outside St Paul's Cathedral, where he attended a thanksgiving service for the Jubilee.

Marriott hotel chain to leave Russia after 25 years,"Marriott The Marriott hotel chain has announced it is leaving Russia after 25 years, saying Western restrictions made it ""impossible"" to keep operating there. The company closed its Moscow office and paused investment in Russia in March, following the invasion of Ukraine. However, its 22 hotels in the country are owned by third parties and remained open. Marriott said the process of suspending operations in Russia was ""complex"". But in a statement, it said: ""We have come to the view that newly announced US, UK and EU restrictions will make it impossible for Marriott to continue to operate or franchise hotels in the Russian market."" The company said it remained ""focused on taking care of our Russian-based associates"" and had been supporting individuals in Ukraine and Russia to secure employment with Marriott outside countries affected by the conflict. ""We continue to join our associates and millions of people around the world in wishing for an end to the current violence and the start of a path towards peace,"" it added. Marriott joins McDonald's, Starbucks and other companies in heading for the exits in recent weeks as the war in Ukraine continues and Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically tighten. Public outcry over Vladimir Putin's invasion also put pressure on Western brands to distance themselves. Hotel brands drew attention for being among the slowest to respond. ""The process to suspend operations in a market where Marriott has operated for 25 years is complex,"" the company said in a statement. Marriott did not provide further details about its exit. French carmaker Renault's assets in the country were nationalised, while burger giant McDonald's sold its restaurants, many of which were directly owned by the company, to an existing franchisee.

How Champions League final trouble unfolded,"This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris French authorities and Uefa blamed late arrivals and fraudulent tickets for chaotic scenes outside the Stade de France before Saturday's Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid. But Liverpool fans who spoke to the BBC described organisational failures, overcrowding and heavy-handed policing. On Monday, Uefacommissioned an independent reportinto the decision-making, responsibility and behaviour of all parties involved in the final. Here is what we know so far about how events unfolded. Michael Carter was among tens of thousands of Liverpool supporters gathered in a fan zone in the south-west of Paris ahead of the Champions League final. He recalled a ""top class"" atmosphere, without any trouble. As early evening approached, he and others with tickets travelled to the Stade de France in the north of the city, ahead of the scheduled kick-off at 21:00. Fans had been warned to get there early and Merseyside police, who had officers deployed as observers, would later describe the behaviour of most as ""exemplary"", saying they arrived in plenty of time and queued as directed. One of the train lines serving the stadium, the RER B, was not working, meaning many fans had to take the RER D. This meant they ended up at a single checkpoint at the perimeter outside the stadium. Mr Carter said the trouble started to begin when fans leaving the station were ""squeezed"" into a ""narrow alley"". Thegates opened at 18:00 local time(17:00 BST) but Liverpool fan Suzanne Gower, who arrived at 18:15, told the BBC that crowds were already so big it took them 35 minutes to move 100 metres (328 feet) at this point. The route from the Stade de France-St Denis RER stop to the stadium involves crossing two motorways, cramming fans into narrow underpasses. Some fans said they were searched multiple times, further adding to the delays, while police vans blocked part of the route to funnel supporters towards a ticket stop. Liverpool fan Matt Lomas said he saw people without tickets turned away at this point, but it took two hours to move 40 yards (36m). Michael Carter told the BBC that people further back in the queue ""were lifting each other up and over the walls because they were being crushed"". By the time he got to the police barricade, there were ""no ticket checks, they were just letting people through"" - including local youths who had been trying to snatch fans' bags and other possessions, he said. Thousands of fans were crammed into underpasses, taking hours to reach the stadium Mr Carter said at one point, people at this checkpoint were doused indiscriminately in what was thought to be pepper spray, causing the crowd to stampede backwards and leaving some of them vomiting as others rushed for water from neighbouring bars to ease the pain. Real Madrid fans on social media also reported long queues before kick-off, as well as disruption by local youths and an overwhelmed police force. When they finally reached the gates, fans described more chaotic scenes. Mr Carter said people were being manhandled through the turnstile without their tickets being scanned as the crowd pressed in on them, while videos showed others trying to jump the barriers. It got to the point where staff were pulling out women and children from the crowd to prevent them being crushed, he said. ""It shouldn't have to be 'save the women and children first' at a football match,"" Mr Carter said. Gates X and Y, two of the main entrances for Liverpool fans, were closed altogether at one point, said BBC News reporter Nick Parrott, who was at the stadium as a fan. He said about 1,500 to 2,000 people were waiting outside each gate. This video can not be played BBC reporter describes his experience entering the stadium for Champions League final Some people tried to get through gates A and B, but locals without tickets tried to force their way in at the same time, he said. He saw police punch one fan, who did not react, while using the spray on others. ""The safest place was to be in the ground, that's why the fans were trying to get in so much,"" Mr Parrott said. ""The police just seemed to go after anyone who moved."" While eyewitnesses felt police tactics were heavy-handed, a spokesperson for a police union said officers on the ground were overwhelmed. But Mathieu Valet, from senior police officers' union the SICP, told the BBC's Newshour the main issue was not ticketless fans or fake tickets, but ""three or four hundred French and undocumented delinquents who were there on the concourse of the Stade de France"". ""It's clear that we needed more police - we didn't have enough on the ground,"" Mr Valet said. A police officer is photographed spraying a cannister towards a Liverpool fan outside the gates He confirmed the use of tear gas, saying it ""unfortunately does not discriminate"". ""It's clear that families, children, mainly English supporters, were inconvenienced by tear gas, I know it's not part of your culture but it allows us to repel attackers,"" he said. Liverpool fans also said many of the crowd troubles were caused by locals, describing gangs of young people who tried to steal from the travelling football fans and rush the gates. Steve Rotherham, mayor of Liverpool City Region, was one of their victims. ""Like too many others, I had my phone and other belongings stolen by dippers [pickpockets] on the approach to the stadium,"" he said on Monday. Some eyewitnesses described gangs of young people hanging around outside the station after the match, saying they were mugging people and assaulting them without being challenged by police. Others said local trouble-makers made it inside the stadium. Mr Carter said that inside the Stade de France, several French youths attempted to steal Liverpool fans' seats. Inside the stadium, Suzanne Gower had arrived with nearly two hours to go before kick-off. ""The Liverpool side had no fans and the Madrid end was really full so you know something outside was happening,"" she said. Five minutes before kick-off was due,at 20:55 local time, Uefa announced that the start of the match was delayed""for security reasons"" until 21:15. Inside the stadium, signs said the delay was ""due to the late arrival of fans at the stadium"". Notices inside the stadium blamed the late arrival of fans for the delayed kick-off Thenat 21:14 Uefa announced a further delayto kick-off. Eventually,the match got underway at 21:36. Even then, there were many empty seats in the Liverpool end, with some fans reporting they were not able to get into the stadium until half-time. Liverpool fans say police lined up in front of them before the final whistle - but ignored the Real Madrid supporters' section. Chaos erupted again when the exit gates were opened, with Mr Carter saying local youths rushed the gates, while police fired what appeared to be tear gas into the crowd. Riot police lined up in front of Liverpool fans before the final whistle French interior minister Gerard Darmanin said the disruption was due to ""thousands of British 'supporters', without tickets or with counterfeit tickets"" who ""forced entry and sometimes assaulted the stewards"". But Ms Gower, a lawyer who worked on the inquests intothe Hillsborough disaster, said: ""The way this event was being policed was all wrong and incredibly dangerous."" And fan Adrian Tempanyreflected later,external: ""My experience at Stade de France on Saturday was the 2nd worst I've had at a football match, after Hillsborough."" ""In my opinion, French police and Uefa nearly caused a disaster,"" he added. The French government has suggested there were between 30,000 and 40,000 ticketless Liverpool fans who attempted to gain entry to the stadium. Mr Darmanin described it as ""massive, industrial-level ticket fraud"". There were several reports of legitimate tickets failing to scan or being rejected at the turnstiles, however. Peter Hooton, singer of Liverpool band The Farm, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he was attending as a guest of broadcaster BT Sport in a neutral part of the ground, where French, Spanish and British attendees all saw their mobile tickets repeatedly rejected. Uefa declined to give details of the anti-fraud measures used on the tickets at the Champions League final, saying: ""Tickets contain a number of security features and the design is different for every single competition."" But Prof Clifford Stott from Keele University, an expert in crowds and policing, cast doubt on the French authorities' claim. He said on Monday there was no apparent evidence for what would have been ""the largest-ever criminal conspiracy to produce and supply forged tickets at football"".

Russia achieving success in Ukraine's Donbas - MoD,"Homes have been badly damaged in strikes on cities such as Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine Russia now appears to have the initiative over Ukraine in the battle for the Donbas, in the country's east, the UK's Ministry of Defence has said. On the war's 100th day, the UK said Russia holds 90% of the Luhansk region - half of the Donbas - and is likely to complete control of it in two weeks. It said these tactical successes had been achieved ""at significant resource cost"" with the concentration of forces. But it said none of Russia's original war objectives had been achieved. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that Moscow's forces are now in control of 20% of Ukrainian territory, with a front line that extends for more than 1,000 km (621 miles). On Thursday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Western nations must be prepared to support Ukraine over the long haul, as the conflict becomes a ""war of attrition"". Five ways Russiaâs war in Ukraine may play out Russia has seized a fifth of Ukraine - Zelensky The Russian soldiers refusing to fight in Ukraine Kyiv defiant after 100 days of war In its most recent count of civilian casualties on 2 June, the UN said it had recorded 4,169 deaths and 4,982 injuries - including 67 deaths of children. But it said the true total was likely to be considerably higher as it has not yet been able to confirm deaths in some regions where the fighting is intense - such as Mariupol in southern Ukraine, where officials estimate 21,000 civilians have been killed. Assessing the 100-day conflict so far, the UK's Defence Intelligence, part of the Ministry of Defence, said Moscow had failed in its initial objectives of seizing Ukraine's centres of government and the capital, Kyiv. ""Staunch Ukrainian resistance"" and the failure to secure Hostomel airfield near the capital during the first 24 hours led to the Russian assault being pushed back, the intelligence update said. It also said Russian forces suffered from ""false planning assumptions"" and ""poor tactical execution"". But since it changed its strategy to focus on the Donbas, the region in south-eastern Ukraine where Russian-backed separatist groups have been fighting for eight years, Moscow has begun ""achieving tactical success"", the UK said. ""Russian forces have generated and maintained momentum and currently appear to hold the initiative over Ukrainian opposition,"" the intelligence update said. ""Russia controls over 90% of Luhansk Oblast and is likely to complete control in the next two weeks."" This video can not be played Watch: How Russian TV has reported the 100 days of the Ukraine war The UK intelligence assessment said Russia had not been able to ""generate momentum or movement"" on other fronts and is on the defensive in other parts of the conflict. Achieving ""any form of success"" in the war will require ""continued huge investment of manpower and equipment"" and is likely to take a considerable amount of time, the assessment concluded.

""No football fan should be put in that situation, and it must not happen again,""said a Uefa statement.,external ""Uefa wishes to sincerely apologise to all spectators who had to experience or witness frightening and distressing events in the build-up to the Uefa Champions League final at the Stade de France on 28 May 2022 in Paris, on a night which should have been a celebration of European club football."" French president Emmanuel Macron said ticket holders who were blocked from entering the stadium by security staff must be reimbursed ""as fast as possible"". Macron said: ""I have a thought for the families who have been pushed around, who have not been able to access the seats they had paid for. ""I have asked the government to clarify what happened, to determine the responsibilities and to explain them in detail to our compatriots, the British and the Spanish."" Harrowing accounts of post-match violence spark debate French minister says only English fans posed problems France blames 'massive' ticket fraud as policing row rages What happened at the Champions League final? European football's governing bodyhad previously announced that an independent reviewof what happened in the build-up to the final, and what lessons should be learned, would be led by Dr Tiago Brandao Rodrigues from Portugal. French authorities and Uefa had blamed late arrivals and fake tickets for chaotic scenes outside the Stade de France, which caused the match to be delayed by more than half an hour. Police used tear gas and pepper spray on some fans. It has also emerged that supporters were targeted by local gangs. France's interior minister, Gerald Darmanin, said only English fans had caused problems at the final. ""The review will seek to establish a full picture and timeline of what occurred during the day, both within the stadium and the surrounding areas, including examining spectator flows to the stadium via the various access points,"" added Uefa's statement. Liverpool legend Sir Kenny Dalglish said the apology was ""a start"" but added: ""There is still a long way to go. ""This apology doesn't cover the false message about the late kick off, events at the fan park, or what happened in the aftermath."" A message on the screen inside the Stade de France originally stated the ""late arrival of fans"" was to blame for the kick-off being delayed Earlier on Friday, Real Madridissued a statementasking for answers about ""unfortunate events"" at the game, which the Spanish team won 1-0. They also want to know why the Stade de France was chosen for the game and who was ""responsible for leaving the fans abandoned and defenceless"". ""Football has transmitted an image to the world which is far away from the values and goals which it should pursue,"" said the statement. Real Madrid cited ""unfortunate events"" which took place ""in the surroundings of and at access points to the Stade de France, and even inside the stadium itself"" and added their fans ""fell victim to said events"". They added: ""We would like to know the reasons which led to this venue being chosen to host the final and the criteria used, taking into account the experiences of the day. ""Furthermore, we call for answers and explanations in order to determine those responsible for leaving the fans abandoned and defenceless. Fans who in general terms showed exemplary conduct at all times. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Ukraine lifts interest rate to highest in EuropeIn a bid to fight off high inflation, the war-torn country's central bank has lifted borrowing costs.Business","The hryvnia, Ukraine's currency, has fallen sharply in value since Russia invaded Ukraine's central bank has more than doubled its interest rate to 25% to the highest level for any European country. The move is intended to slow soaring inflation and prevent a further collapse of its currency following Russia's invasion in February. Businesses have been forced to close and key supply chains have been cut off since the war began. The World Bank predicts that Ukraine's economy could shrink by as much as 45% this year. The rate of inflation - or the cost of living - has risen to 17% in Ukraine and is on track to hit 20% this year, according to the country's central bank. The National Bank of Ukraine said the benchmark interest rate increase - from 10% to 25% - would help protect citizens' savings from being eaten by soaring inflation. Ukraine's currency, the hryvnia, has also come under heavy pressure since Russia's invasion, falling sharply in value. The central bank said it hoped the rate rise would ease some of that strain and stabilise the currency. It is Ukraine's first rate increase since the war broke out, with the bank signalling it would move to reduce rates again once inflation was back under control. More than $100bn of infrastructure damage to Ukrainian cities has been caused by artillery fire and airstrikes, according to the Kyiv School of Economics, while 14 million citizens have been forced to flee their homes. To mount its military defence, and support citizens who have lost their livelihoods, the government has rapidly increased its spending, pushing the budget deficit up 27% month on month to $7.7bn in May, according to Kyiv-based investment bank Dragon Capital. Banks have also been forced to accept that loans made to businesses in territory now controlled by Russia will probably never be repaid, another huge financial blow to the country's economy. ""The most likely scenario is that nearly all corporate and retail loans in the territories that are still occupied will be lost,"" said Vitaliy Vavryshchuk, head of macro research at asset manager Investment Capital Ukraine. Friday marks 100 days since Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine, with 4,500 civilians killed since fighting broke out. Hospitals and schools have been devastated, while ports have been blockaded, cutting Ukraine off from the exports that form the backbone of its economy. Around 50% of the world's supply of neon gas, critical for making the microchips that power smartphones and cars, comes from just two Ukrainian companies. In addition, more than 18% of global barley exports, 16% of corn, and 12% of wheat, come from Ukraine's fields. A farmer shovels grain in Ukraine ""The food crisis really threatens up to 1.4 billion people that are going to experience food shortages and even famine in some places,"" Amin Awad, the UN crisis coordinator for Ukraine told the BBC's Today programme. ""The food is stranded in Ukraine. It produces 85 million tonnes of grain every year."" With another large harvest coming up in July and August this year, Mr Awad warned that if grain silos - currently full with food - can't be cleared, crops would rot in the fields because there would be no place to store them. Egypt, which prior to the war received around 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, is currently experiencing shortages, and warned that ""millions"" could die globally. Meanwhile, inTurkey inflation surgedto a 24-year high of 73.5% in the year to May, driven by the war in Ukraine, a weak currency and high energy prices. Food costs have skyrocketed by 92% over the past year in Turkey, making basic goods unaffordable for many despite government interventions.

JK Rowling firm in row over right-to-roam accessWalkers claim access to a historical right-of-way is hampered by the Harry Potter author's firm.,"JK Rowling owns Thistlelane Ltd, which has two big forestry estates in the Borders A firm controlled by Harry Potter author JK Rowling has been accused of preventing access to paths on forestry estates in the Scottish Borders. Walkers and mountain-bikers claim that navigating a historical six-mile right-of-way has been hampered by the firm. Thistlelane Ltd owns the 290-hectare Sheperdscleuh estate as well as the 306-hectare Wardlaw estate. Agents for Thistlelane rejected accusations that right-to-roam legislation had been breached. Ramblers enjoying the views from the Captain's Road before the access problems The agents, Scottish Woodlands, confirmed that talks were ongoing with community groups and access officers over ""issues"". Walkers and community leaders claim Rowling's company erected no-access signs at gates on the trail known as Captain's Road, blocked efforts to erect way-markers, threatened to lock gates, and even planted trees across the route. Mountain bike enthusiast Paul Collins, who lives in the Yarrow Valley, said ""We can't now walk or cycle the original Captain's Road because of forestry, and they keep raising concerns about using the nearby forestry road as an alternative route. ""We're now at the stage where we can't follow the Captain's Road because of the action of the landowners."" Mr Collins said forestry companies at nearby Glentress were opening up great swathes of land for walkers and mountain bikers but this small right-of-way over the hills above St Mary's Loch appeared to have been closed down. No access signs have been put on gates along the route Thistlelane Ltd is under the sole directorship of JK Rowling's husband, Dr Neil Murray, and lists the person with significant control - having at least three-quarters of the shares - as the author by her married name of Joanne Kathleen Murray. The Captain's Road, which links two droving inns, Tibbie Shiel's and Tushielaw, was one of the earliest metalled roads connecting the Ettrick and Yarrow valleys. It is named after a Napoleonic War captain, called Napier, who bought and farmed the same hills in the early 19th Century. Gordon Harrison at a section of the route for planting Following the arrival of modern-surfaced roads in the early 20th Century, it gradually became overgrown. With the growth in popularity of rambling and off-road biking the Captain's Road began to be used more regularly as a way up into the hills from the Ettrick and Yarrow valleys. In 2019 a missing link was re-established, with public and grant funding from the local authority and other organisations. The opening saw around 30 walkers cross the six-mile route - and over the following months many more hikers and bikers followed in their footsteps across the scenic pass. But during the Covid pandemic ""no access"" signs appeared. Gordon Harrison, who is a former chair of the Ettrick and Yarrow Community Council, took part in the original negotiations with landowners when re-establishing sections of the Captain's Road. He said: ""The Captain's Road has been there for a long time and when the community decided to signpost it and resurface a section, the discussions with landowners were favourable. A lengthy section of the route through a peat bog has been âmoundedâ for saplings ""We wanted to encourage people to visit the area and either walk or cycle the route between Tushielaw and St Mary's Loch - there are some spectacular views."" But Mr Harrison added: ""Something has happened and I don't know what, but more recently there has been continuous hurdles put up to prevent people using the route. ""The latest is them planting saplings across the right-of-way and not offering any alternative routes - those saplings will quickly become large trees and it will be impossible to walk or cycle through there."" Frank Garton was also heavily involved with the project to re-establish the lost section of the Captain's Road. He said: ""We are now at the stage where you can't use the right-of-way and we are not allowed to sign-post any alternative routes. ""The entire project to connect the two paths, as well as all the grant and public funding, has been a waste of time."" The right-of-way as identified by Scottish Borders Council Scottish Borders Council's access officers are currently in negotiations with Thistlelane's agents, Scottish Woodlands, about the right-of-way issues. A site visit is also due to take place between the agents and community leaders in the coming days. Charlotte Cavey-Wilcox, from Scottish Woodlands, denied that access rights had been breached. She said: ""We are currently liaising closely with Scottish Forestry, Scottish Borders Council and the Ettrick and Yarrow Community Development Company to try and resolve the issues. ""Members of the public have a right to responsible access under Scottish legislation and the terms of the Scottish Outdoor Access code and these rights have not been restricted within Shepherdscleuch Forest.""

Real Madrid ask for Champions League final answers,"This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris Real Madrid have asked for answers into the ""series of unfortunate events"" at the Champions League final against Liverpool in Paris on 28 May. They also want to know why the Stade de France was chosen for the game and who is ""responsible for leaving the fans abandoned and defenceless"". ""Football has transmitted an image to the world which is far away from the values and goals which it should pursue,"" said a Real Madrid statement. The Spanish side won the final 1-0. However, the match was delayed by more than half an hour and Liverpool fans have described heavy-handed policing, organisational chaos and overcrowding at the showpiece game, which was moved to the Stade de France from St Petersburg following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. French minister says only English fans posed problems France blames 'massive' ticket fraud as policing row rages What happened at the Champions League final? Liverpool chief executive Billy Hogancalled the comments by France's interior minister Gerald Darmanin blaming English fans as ""disgraceful"" and that, having spoken to his Real Madrid counterpart, the Spanish club's supporters also had issues. In their statement, Real Madrid cited ""unfortunate events"" which took place ""in the surroundings of and at access points to the Stade de France, and even inside the stadium itself"" and that their fans ""were victim to said events"". They added: ""We would like to know the reasons which led to this venue being chosen to host the final and the criteria used, taking into account the experiences of the day. ""Furthermore, we call for answers and explanations in order to determine those responsible for leaving the fans abandoned and defenceless. Fans who in general terms showed exemplary conduct at all times."" European football's governing body, Uefa,has commissioned an independent reportinto what happened at the final. French authorities have blamed ticket fraud and accused Liverpool football club of failing to control their fans, although it has also emerged that supporters were targeted by local gangs. ""We believe something which should have been a wonderful festival of football for all fans who attended the game, quickly turned into a series of unfortunate events which have caused a sense of outrage around the world,"" said Real Madrid. ""As was evident in the revealing images published by the media, several fans were attacked, harassed, assaulted and robbed in violent fashion. ""These occurrences continued as they moved in their cars or busses, causing concern for their physical wellbeing. Certain fans even had to spend the night in hospital as a result of injuries."" The club added: ""Our fans and supporters deserve a response and those responsible to be held accountable in order for events like these to be eradicated from football and sport in general.""

The 'oversized potatoes' that stole the Queen's heart,"The Queen pictured with Susan at Balmoral Castle, in 1952 - the year she became Queen 1959: Queen Elizabeth II, aged 32 and a mother of two, sits designing a gravestone for her dog. Susan showed up on her 18th birthday, and would gatecrash her honeymoon a few years later, smuggled beneath a rug in the royal carriage after her wedding to Prince Philip. ""I had always dreaded losing her,"" the Queen wrote in her grief, ""but I am ever so thankful that her suffering was so mercifully short."" That Susan bit the royal clock winder and a young palace sentry is a matter of record, though her epitaph leaves out such indiscretions. She was buried in the pet cemetery at Sandringham, started by famously committed mourner Queen Victoria. Susan's gravestone stands in the pet cemetery at Sandringham, the Queen's Norfolk estate An ending for one Pembroke Welsh corgi - but certainly not for Her Majesty, who was only just getting started. Over the next six decades, she would own more than 30 of Susan's descendants, single-handedly create a mass market for this stunted Welsh cattle dog, and accidentally invent the dorgi with the help of Princess Margaret's amorous dachshund, Pipkin. Why corgis? The answer, which may resonate with parents, is that some friends had one in 1933 when Princess Elizabeth was seven years old, and she wanted one too. Pembroke corgis were a familiar sight in Wales, but fairly new to England. The Duke of York, Elizabeth's father, approached a respected breeder named Thelma Gray who brought the family three puppies from her Rozavel kennels in Surrey to choose from. They settled on a little corgi officially named Rozavel Golden Eagle, because he was the only one with a small stump of tail to wag - and they wanted to know when he was pleased. But the pup became known as Dookie, reportedly after the kennel staff heard the Duke of York was going to be his owner, and the nickname stuck. Dookie was horribly behaved, biting courtiers and visitors with abandon - but that didn't stop a press photo of Elizabeth and the tiny tyrant charming the public and raising the Pembroke corgi's profile. Princess Elizabeth pictured at Glamis Station with Dookie just after he joined the family Another puppy, Lady Jane, arrived from the same breeder a few years later. Christmas 1936 then saw a royal PR coup in the form of a saccharine children's book - Our Princesses and Their Dogs - which styled the Yorks and their pets as ""one very human family"". The book, brimming with dog pictures and family values, went on sale just days before the Duke's elder brother abdicated, making him the new king. Buckingham Palace is extremely tight-lipped about anything to do with the Queen's dogs because they're seen as a ""private matter"". But it's clear the royals cottoned on early to the softening effect of a well-timed corgi. Princess Elizabeth with her first corgis - Dookie and Jane - at her childhood home in Piccadilly, London, July 1936 Kennel Club figures show a clear spike in Pembroke corgi registrations in 1936, and another in 1944, the year Princess Elizabeth got Susan. She had made corgis cool, while they made her look warm. ""People - breeders - were servicing the market for a dog that has suddenly become very popular. It's the 101 Dalmatians effect,"" notes Ciara Farrell, the Kennel Club's Library and Collections Manager. ""You see it with advertising as well - the old English sheepdog on the Dulux advert in the 70s and 80s."" Likewise, the Andrex puppy, a marketing masterstroke that's run for half a century. Away from the cameras, Princess Elizabeth and Susan were inseparable. Add to that a royal's awareness of lineage, and it's no surprise she turned to Thelma, provider of her childhood puppies, to find Susan a mate. Rozavel Lucky Strike was the dog for the job, and founded a line of Windsor Pembroke corgis which continued for 14 generations. As well as being the Queen's much-loved pets, the corgis are a connection to her father, and a more carefree time. Every puppy after Susan was a way of keeping part of that with her, and a reminder that life and dynasties go on. While her husband Prince Philip spent a lifetime walking a little behind his wife, the corgis scamper ahead - revelling in a freedom denied to the Queen herself. Princess Diana is said to have coined the phrase ""a moving carpet"" to describe the jumble of dogs that preceded her. But the Queen herself calls them ""the girls"" and ""the boys"". In all her years of breeding, she has never sold any of her puppies. All stayed with her, or were given to breeders, relatives or friends. Two of the Queen's dogs escort her through the door, as she greets a visiting New Zealand rugby team at Buckingham Palace in 2007 The corgis must go where the Queen goes - from palace to palace. This includes on helicopters, trains, and in limousines. At Christmas at Sandringham they each have their own stocking, filled by the Queen herself. Buckingham Palace has 775 rooms, but the corgis sleep inside the Queen's private apartment. As royal author Penny Junor writes in her book All The Queen's Corgis: ""There is a special corgi room where they have raised wicker baskets lined with cushions to keep draughts away."" Walking them every day was a part of her routine before the mobility issues which have affected her in recent months. And in bygone years, she liked nothing more than piling the pack into an elderly Vauxhall estate, donning a headscarf, and setting off for a drive. This video can not be played WATCH: Hammy and Olivia's owner on the breed's unique appeal A typical dog's life doesn't feature thousands of acres to roam, or lavish meals - prepared in the royal kitchens - of steak, chicken breast, vegetables and rice. But Junor believes that in some ways, corgis have given the Queen a precious point of contact with everyone else. She writes: ""Dogs and horses are her passion and it is with them, and the people who share that passion, that she truly relaxes. Horses are a rich man's game but dogs are not. They are a great leveller, they attract people from all walks of life and, over the years, the Queen has had strong and genuine friendships with many of her fellow dog enthusiasts."" In some cases, when loved ones died she has even adopted their dogs. This included the Queen Mother's three corgis in 2002, and another - Whisper - who belonged to her former head gamekeeper at Windsor, Bill Fenwick, and his wife Nancy. The latter was a dear friend who helped with the Queen's corgi breeding for five decades, and one of the very few people whose calls were always put through to her no matter what. Junor also observes that the Queen, ""essentially a very shy woman"" who's required to talk confidently to strangers, uses the dogs to reduce her discomfort. ""Her family refers to it as 'the dog mechanism' [â¦] If the situation becomes too difficult she will sometimes literally walk away from it and take the dogs out. Prince Andrew is said to have taken three weeks to fight his way past the dogs to tell his mother that his marriage to Sarah Ferguson was in trouble,"" she writes. Which dog lover hasn't - at some point - declared them easier to deal with than people? (Pictured in 1970) The Queen also deploys the dogs to put others at ease. War surgeon Dr David Nottdescribedhow the monarch got him through a lunch at Buckingham Palace when he had just returned from Aleppo, in war-torn Syria, and found himself unable to speak to her due to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The Queen sensed something was wrong and said, ""Well, shall I help you?"" before calling for her corgis, Dr Nott said. ""All of a sudden the courtiers brought the corgis and the corgis went underneath the table."" The Queen opened a tin of biscuits. ""And so for 20 minutes during this lunch the Queen and I fed the dogs. She did it because she knew that I was so seriously traumatised."" Between 1933 and 2018, the Queen always owned at least one corgi - but mostly it was many more than that. Prince Philip, who never shared his wife's fondness for the breed, was apparently heard to complain: ""Bloody dogs! Why do you have to have so many?"" And then there were the dorgis - initially the result of an illicit liaison between Princess Margaret's dachshund, Pipkin, and a corgi named Tiny in the 1970s. The Queen and Princess Margaret were so charmed by the outcome that they mated the dogs again, and about 10 dorgi pups were born over the years. They've varied in appearance, with some ears pointing up, corgi-like, and others hanging down. But all of them had long tails and were smaller than pedigree corgis. When a royal photographer asked how the mechanics worked given the height difference between corgis and dachshunds, the Queen replied: ""It's very simple. We have a little brick."" The Queen strokes her dorgi Candy, as she looks at memorabilia from her Golden and Platinum Jubilees in January 2022 The Queen has received puppies as gifts in recent years, and based on an interview with Angela Kelly, the Queen's dresser and personal assistant, it appears she now has two young corgis named Muick and Sandy to keep her company. She was also pictured with her dorgi, named Candy, back in February. The royal household's breeding programme is no longer running, however. The Queen is said to be unwilling to leave young dogs behind when she dies. If monarchy knows anything, it's that time comes for us all. Her Majesty is now 96 years old, meaning there are millions of people old enough to own dogs who have only ever seen her as a grey-haired grandmother and great-grandmother. As a result, corgis came to be viewed as an old person's breed for a time. Their ascendency peaked in the 1960s with almost 9,000 puppy registrations, as the public cooed over pictures of the Queen with her young family and dogs. But from the late 1990s in particular the decline is marked, and 2014 was their annus horribilis. With just 274 new registrations, Pembrokes trotted into the Vulnerable Native Breed category in the UK. But then came Netflix, and salvation in the form of The Crown, whose first season in 2016 turned the clock back to the start of the Queen's reign. Sympathetically played by Claire Foy, whose nuanced performance includeda litany of expressive ways to say the word ""ohâ¦"",external, the youthful royal was frequently surrounded by a pack of corgis, as was Olivia Colman, her successor in the role. Olivia Colman in character as the Queen, with her co-stars Foy told Vanity Fair how the on-set dogs were bribed with treats and especially loved cheese, mulling: ""You sort of worry that they're going to have a heart attack when you're giving it to them. These Corgis are cheesed up to the max - they're eating like a whole block of cheddar every day. It's scary."" Numbers rebounded, with corgi puppy registrations up by 16% in 2017 after the first season aired, and 47% in 2018 after the second. It wasn't just about The Crown. The James Bond skit starring the Queen and three royal corgis at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony also saw them tummy-roll back into the public consciousness. Allow YouTube content?

Even Bridgerton - Netflix's wildly popular Regency romp - inserted ahistorically improbable,externalcorgi into series 2. Co-star reviews included ""doesn't move if he doesn't have a treat"", but audiences loved him. Social media has also been vital to the corgi renaissance, as Chris Equale, owner of TikTok stars Hammy and Olivia, knows well. Chris, 34, launched a viral sensation pretty much accidentally in April 2020, with a video of his corgi Olivia barking at the vacuum cleaner. ""It got 250,000 views in just under 20 minutes,"" he remembers. Two years and seven million followers later, he's made more than 700 talking corgi skits. They include a running joke about the dogs' war with ""the dragon"" (their dust-blitzing nemesis), and the vacuum company has piled in to sponsor content. Asked what it is about corgis that charms people, he replies: ""There's something very unique about a corgi - it's just a dog you really want to root for. They're the greatest herders you'll ever see! But if you look at them at first glance it's like, is it a dog, is it a loaf of bread? There's something so lovable about them."" The Kennel Club's Ciara Farrell agrees corgi anatomy is central to their kitsch appeal. ""One of the things is that people love a big ear - something you can lean into if you're making a soft toy. They're a spitz breed, so pointy in the face, brings that foxiness in. They look sort of tough but cute."" Mr Equale sees the Queen as ""the pioneer of the breed"" which he describes as looking like an oversized potato, enthusing: ""I've only had these two [Hammy and Olivia] for likeâ¦ seven years? So to do that 10 times over is just fascinating. We're big fans of the Queen. If you're a fan of the corgi, you have some direct or indirect fandom. ""At a dog park it's always the first thing that comes out of a passer-by's mouth: 'Oh you know those are the Queen's dogs!'"" Corgis and the Queen: A branding partnership known the world over But if the breed is inextricably tied to the monarchy in the public imagination, it seems the royals don't all see it that way. Prince Charles - the Queen's heir - once quipped that he prefers labradors, and is a long-time owner of jack russell terriers. The Duke and the Duchess of Cambridge, William and Catherine, have a cocker spaniel. Can the breed expect another dip in popularity? ""I would hope not,"" says Ms Farrell. ""I think corgis have made great progress in recent years. They're always going to be the Queen's iconic dog. Even when she is no longer with us, people are going to see them and think of her."" But she believes that the more potential owners see corgis online, the less vital a royal association will be. ""There's going to be a generation of people who use social media who will find them characterful and fun. I think they're here to stay, definitely.""

The 'oversized potatoes' that stole the Queen's heartHow a young princess's love for her dog turned into a life's passion.UK,"The Queen pictured with Susan at Balmoral Castle, in 1952 - the year she became Queen 1959: Queen Elizabeth II, aged 32 and a mother of two, sits designing a gravestone for her dog. Susan showed up on her 18th birthday, and would gatecrash her honeymoon a few years later, smuggled beneath a rug in the royal carriage after her wedding to Prince Philip. ""I had always dreaded losing her,"" the Queen wrote in her grief, ""but I am ever so thankful that her suffering was so mercifully short."" That Susan bit the royal clock winder and a young palace sentry is a matter of record, though her epitaph leaves out such indiscretions. She was buried in the pet cemetery at Sandringham, started by famously committed mourner Queen Victoria. Susan's gravestone stands in the pet cemetery at Sandringham, the Queen's Norfolk estate An ending for one Pembroke Welsh corgi - but certainly not for Her Majesty, who was only just getting started. Over the next six decades, she would own more than 30 of Susan's descendants, single-handedly create a mass market for this stunted Welsh cattle dog, and accidentally invent the dorgi with the help of Princess Margaret's amorous dachshund, Pipkin. Why corgis? The answer, which may resonate with parents, is that some friends had one in 1933 when Princess Elizabeth was seven years old, and she wanted one too. Pembroke corgis were a familiar sight in Wales, but fairly new to England. The Duke of York, Elizabeth's father, approached a respected breeder named Thelma Gray who brought the family three puppies from her Rozavel kennels in Surrey to choose from. They settled on a little corgi officially named Rozavel Golden Eagle, because he was the only one with a small stump of tail to wag - and they wanted to know when he was pleased. But the pup became known as Dookie, reportedly after the kennel staff heard the Duke of York was going to be his owner, and the nickname stuck. Dookie was horribly behaved, biting courtiers and visitors with abandon - but that didn't stop a press photo of Elizabeth and the tiny tyrant charming the public and raising the Pembroke corgi's profile. Princess Elizabeth pictured at Glamis Station with Dookie just after he joined the family Another puppy, Lady Jane, arrived from the same breeder a few years later. Christmas 1936 then saw a royal PR coup in the form of a saccharine children's book - Our Princesses and Their Dogs - which styled the Yorks and their pets as ""one very human family"". The book, brimming with dog pictures and family values, went on sale just days before the Duke's elder brother abdicated, making him the new king. Buckingham Palace is extremely tight-lipped about anything to do with the Queen's dogs because they're seen as a ""private matter"". But it's clear the royals cottoned on early to the softening effect of a well-timed corgi. Princess Elizabeth with her first corgis - Dookie and Jane - at her childhood home in Piccadilly, London, July 1936 Kennel Club figures show a clear spike in Pembroke corgi registrations in 1936, and another in 1944, the year Princess Elizabeth got Susan. She had made corgis cool, while they made her look warm. ""People - breeders - were servicing the market for a dog that has suddenly become very popular. It's the 101 Dalmatians effect,"" notes Ciara Farrell, the Kennel Club's Library and Collections Manager. ""You see it with advertising as well - the old English sheepdog on the Dulux advert in the 70s and 80s."" Likewise, the Andrex puppy, a marketing masterstroke that's run for half a century. Away from the cameras, Princess Elizabeth and Susan were inseparable. Add to that a royal's awareness of lineage, and it's no surprise she turned to Thelma, provider of her childhood puppies, to find Susan a mate. Rozavel Lucky Strike was the dog for the job, and founded a line of Windsor Pembroke corgis which continued for 14 generations. As well as being the Queen's much-loved pets, the corgis are a connection to her father, and a more carefree time. Every puppy after Susan was a way of keeping part of that with her, and a reminder that life and dynasties go on. While her husband Prince Philip spent a lifetime walking a little behind his wife, the corgis scamper ahead - revelling in a freedom denied to the Queen herself. Princess Diana is said to have coined the phrase ""a moving carpet"" to describe the jumble of dogs that preceded her. But the Queen herself calls them ""the girls"" and ""the boys"". In all her years of breeding, she has never sold any of her puppies. All stayed with her, or were given to breeders, relatives or friends. Two of the Queen's dogs escort her through the door, as she greets a visiting New Zealand rugby team at Buckingham Palace in 2007 The corgis must go where the Queen goes - from palace to palace. This includes on helicopters, trains, and in limousines. At Christmas at Sandringham they each have their own stocking, filled by the Queen herself. Buckingham Palace has 775 rooms, but the corgis sleep inside the Queen's private apartment. As royal author Penny Junor writes in her book All The Queen's Corgis: ""There is a special corgi room where they have raised wicker baskets lined with cushions to keep draughts away."" Walking them every day was a part of her routine before the mobility issues which have affected her in recent months. And in bygone years, she liked nothing more than piling the pack into an elderly Vauxhall estate, donning a headscarf, and setting off for a drive. This video can not be played WATCH: Hammy and Olivia's owner on the breed's unique appeal A typical dog's life doesn't feature thousands of acres to roam, or lavish meals - prepared in the royal kitchens - of steak, chicken breast, vegetables and rice. But Junor believes that in some ways, corgis have given the Queen a precious point of contact with everyone else. She writes: ""Dogs and horses are her passion and it is with them, and the people who share that passion, that she truly relaxes. Horses are a rich man's game but dogs are not. They are a great leveller, they attract people from all walks of life and, over the years, the Queen has had strong and genuine friendships with many of her fellow dog enthusiasts."" In some cases, when loved ones died she has even adopted their dogs. This included the Queen Mother's three corgis in 2002, and another - Whisper - who belonged to her former head gamekeeper at Windsor, Bill Fenwick, and his wife Nancy. The latter was a dear friend who helped with the Queen's corgi breeding for five decades, and one of the very few people whose calls were always put through to her no matter what. Junor also observes that the Queen, ""essentially a very shy woman"" who's required to talk confidently to strangers, uses the dogs to reduce her discomfort. ""Her family refers to it as 'the dog mechanism' [â¦] If the situation becomes too difficult she will sometimes literally walk away from it and take the dogs out. Prince Andrew is said to have taken three weeks to fight his way past the dogs to tell his mother that his marriage to Sarah Ferguson was in trouble,"" she writes. Which dog lover hasn't - at some point - declared them easier to deal with than people? (Pictured in 1970) The Queen also deploys the dogs to put others at ease. War surgeon Dr David Nottdescribedhow the monarch got him through a lunch at Buckingham Palace when he had just returned from Aleppo, in war-torn Syria, and found himself unable to speak to her due to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The Queen sensed something was wrong and said, ""Well, shall I help you?"" before calling for her corgis, Dr Nott said. ""All of a sudden the courtiers brought the corgis and the corgis went underneath the table."" The Queen opened a tin of biscuits. ""And so for 20 minutes during this lunch the Queen and I fed the dogs. She did it because she knew that I was so seriously traumatised."" Between 1933 and 2018, the Queen always owned at least one corgi - but mostly it was many more than that. Prince Philip, who never shared his wife's fondness for the breed, was apparently heard to complain: ""Bloody dogs! Why do you have to have so many?"" And then there were the dorgis - initially the result of an illicit liaison between Princess Margaret's dachshund, Pipkin, and a corgi named Tiny in the 1970s. The Queen and Princess Margaret were so charmed by the outcome that they mated the dogs again, and about 10 dorgi pups were born over the years. They've varied in appearance, with some ears pointing up, corgi-like, and others hanging down. But all of them had long tails and were smaller than pedigree corgis. When a royal photographer asked how the mechanics worked given the height difference between corgis and dachshunds, the Queen replied: ""It's very simple. We have a little brick."" The Queen strokes her dorgi Candy, as she looks at memorabilia from her Golden and Platinum Jubilees in January 2022 The Queen has received puppies as gifts in recent years, and based on an interview with Angela Kelly, the Queen's dresser and personal assistant, it appears she now has two young corgis named Muick and Sandy to keep her company. She was also pictured with her dorgi, named Candy, back in February. The royal household's breeding programme is no longer running, however. The Queen is said to be unwilling to leave young dogs behind when she dies. If monarchy knows anything, it's that time comes for us all. Her Majesty is now 96 years old, meaning there are millions of people old enough to own dogs who have only ever seen her as a grey-haired grandmother and great-grandmother. As a result, corgis came to be viewed as an old person's breed for a time. Their ascendency peaked in the 1960s with almost 9,000 puppy registrations, as the public cooed over pictures of the Queen with her young family and dogs. But from the late 1990s in particular the decline is marked, and 2014 was their annus horribilis. With just 274 new registrations, Pembrokes trotted into the Vulnerable Native Breed category in the UK. But then came Netflix, and salvation in the form of The Crown, whose first season in 2016 turned the clock back to the start of the Queen's reign. Sympathetically played by Claire Foy, whose nuanced performance includeda litany of expressive ways to say the word ""ohâ¦"",external, the youthful royal was frequently surrounded by a pack of corgis, as was Olivia Colman, her successor in the role. Olivia Colman in character as the Queen, with her co-stars Foy told Vanity Fair how the on-set dogs were bribed with treats and especially loved cheese, mulling: ""You sort of worry that they're going to have a heart attack when you're giving it to them. These Corgis are cheesed up to the max - they're eating like a whole block of cheddar every day. It's scary."" Numbers rebounded, with corgi puppy registrations up by 16% in 2017 after the first season aired, and 47% in 2018 after the second. It wasn't just about The Crown. The James Bond skit starring the Queen and three royal corgis at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony also saw them tummy-roll back into the public consciousness. Allow YouTube content?

Even Bridgerton - Netflix's wildly popular Regency romp - inserted ahistorically improbable,externalcorgi into series 2. Co-star reviews included ""doesn't move if he doesn't have a treat"", but audiences loved him. Social media has also been vital to the corgi renaissance, as Chris Equale, owner of TikTok stars Hammy and Olivia, knows well. Chris, 34, launched a viral sensation pretty much accidentally in April 2020, with a video of his corgi Olivia barking at the vacuum cleaner. ""It got 250,000 views in just under 20 minutes,"" he remembers. Two years and seven million followers later, he's made more than 700 talking corgi skits. They include a running joke about the dogs' war with ""the dragon"" (their dust-blitzing nemesis), and the vacuum company has piled in to sponsor content. Asked what it is about corgis that charms people, he replies: ""There's something very unique about a corgi - it's just a dog you really want to root for. They're the greatest herders you'll ever see! But if you look at them at first glance it's like, is it a dog, is it a loaf of bread? There's something so lovable about them."" The Kennel Club's Ciara Farrell agrees corgi anatomy is central to their kitsch appeal. ""One of the things is that people love a big ear - something you can lean into if you're making a soft toy. They're a spitz breed, so pointy in the face, brings that foxiness in. They look sort of tough but cute."" Mr Equale sees the Queen as ""the pioneer of the breed"" which he describes as looking like an oversized potato, enthusing: ""I've only had these two [Hammy and Olivia] for likeâ¦ seven years? So to do that 10 times over is just fascinating. We're big fans of the Queen. If you're a fan of the corgi, you have some direct or indirect fandom. ""At a dog park it's always the first thing that comes out of a passer-by's mouth: 'Oh you know those are the Queen's dogs!'"" Corgis and the Queen: A branding partnership known the world over But if the breed is inextricably tied to the monarchy in the public imagination, it seems the royals don't all see it that way. Prince Charles - the Queen's heir - once quipped that he prefers labradors, and is a long-time owner of jack russell terriers. The Duke and the Duchess of Cambridge, William and Catherine, have a cocker spaniel. Can the breed expect another dip in popularity? ""I would hope not,"" says Ms Farrell. ""I think corgis have made great progress in recent years. They're always going to be the Queen's iconic dog. Even when she is no longer with us, people are going to see them and think of her."" But she believes that the more potential owners see corgis online, the less vital a royal association will be. ""There's going to be a generation of people who use social media who will find them characterful and fun. I think they're here to stay, definitely.""
