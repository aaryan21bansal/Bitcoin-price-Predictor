Mum 'cannot forgive laughing killers',"Roseann Taylor said she wanted to donate her son's organs, but could not because his body was ""evidence"" The mother of a teenager who was stabbed to death said she cannot forgive his killers after they ""laughed and joked"" at their trial. Azaan Kaleem, 18, was with his girlfriend in Luton in March when a group of strangers ""piled out of a car"" and stabbed him. He died in hospital. Four men were convicted over his death on Thursday at the Old Bailey. Roseann Taylor, who switched off her son's life support, said: ""They had no remorse or regard for what they did."" Mr Kaleem, who was Ms Taylor's only child, was ""viciously attacked"" after a disagreement. Ms Taylor said Azaan was sweet-natured and would walk away from an argument Two men aged 18 and 19, who cannot be named, and Harrison Searle, 18, of Derwent Road, Luton, were convicted of murder. Reece Bliss-McGrath, 20, of Exton Avenue, Luton, was found guilty of manslaughter. All four will be sentenced next month. Ms Taylor sat through their four-week trial, in which CCTV footage of the fatal attack was repeatedly played. ""What I saw was like a pack of animals - rounding up, seeking something, finding it and stalking it - and that's what they did to my son. Azaan Kaleem died in hospital, his mother by his side Ms Taylor said she had hoped to find her son sitting on the kerb in Hartsfield Road ""I had to watch the CCTV of my son being murdered and all the while I was keeping my composure, the defendants laughed and joked and had fun. ""Azaan was just a person to them, he was just a name."" She said she got a call about the attack in Hartsfield Road and had hoped her ""accident-prone"" son would be [sitting] on the kerb, moaning about his latest scrape. Instead, he was prone on the pavement, surrounded by paramedics. He had been attacked at 17:20, in full daylight. ""I was blocked by a police officer,"" she said. ""That was soul-destroying - to know your child is lying on the floor and you know it's serious and you can't get to them."" Azaan Kaleem's killers are due to be sentenced in December Asked about her last memory of her son, she said: ""Switching his machine off. ""It was horrific. To stand behind your child and stroke their hair, and kiss their forehead and wait while a policeman has to watch for his heart to stop beating. ""They [the killers] even stole that moment, because it wasn't private. ""I wanted Azaan's organs to be given away because he was a healthy 18-year-old, and I wanted to give the gift of life to someone else. ""But Azaan became evidence we weren't allowed to do that."" She added:  ""It's changed my life for ever. No-one will ever call me mum again. ""I will get there one day, I will forgive them, but not yet.""

Ukraine activist dies after acid attack,"A prominent Ukrainian anti-corruption activist has died, three months after she was injured in an acid attack. Kateryna Handzyuk, 33, suffered burns over 40% of her body and severe eye damage as a result of the assault on 31 July in the southern city of Kherson. Ms Handzyuk, who was also a Kherson city council member, had undergone 11 operations in the capital Kiev. President Petro Poroshenko on Sunday called for the killers to be punished. Five suspects are already in custody. Can Ukraine stand its ground in 'war on corruption'? The exact cause of Ms Handzyuk's death was not immediately known, but reports in local media suggested it was a blood clot. In September, the activist - who also campaigned against Russian-backed separatism - posted a video in which she urged Ukrainians to fight rampant corruption. ""I know I look bad now. But at least I'm being treated,"" she said. ""And I definitely know that I look much better than justice in Ukraine. Because nobody is treating it."" The death of the activist on Sunday triggered an avalanche of reactions on social media in Ukraine, with many users expressing shock. Ukraine arrests 'corrupt' officials.

Italy river surge kills nine in home,"The flooded house where the tragedy occurred Two families have been wiped out in Italy after a river burst its banks submerging their house in Sicily. Nine people died in the incident in Casteldaccia - from children aged one, three and 15 to their grandparents. Only three people who were outside the house at the time survived. Three other people died when their cars were swept away on the southern island. Days of heavy rain and winds have killed at least 17 other people in Italy, mainly in the north and west. Some of the worst damage was to roads around Belluno in the northern Veneto region, after days of storms had dislodged mud, rocks and water. Deadly storms hit Italy, flooding Venice Six regions remain under alert - from Veneto to Sicily and Sardinia in the south. The tragedy in Casteldaccia occurred overnight on Saturday. This video can not be played Trees were torn down across a swathe of northern Italy Twelve members of two families had gathered to spend the night when water from river Milicia swamped the house. Three of those on the premises had lucky escapes. A father and daughter had gone out on an errand at the time. The third - another father of two - survived by climbing onto a tree. In addition to the three children, the dead included the mother of two of them, her brother, sister and their parents - and the mother of one of the surviving fathers. One of the neighbours described the scene minutes before the incident. ""I heard the dogs barking. It was around 22:30 [21:30 GMT]. I told my husband to go out to see what was happening. He opened the door and water filled the house,"" said Maria Concetta Alfano. Water from a river that had never posed a problem before swamped the house Town mayor Giovanni Di Giacinto spoke of a ""frightening tragedy"" - given the Milicia was only a small river that had never had much water. ""It has never presented a threat to Casteldaccia, and it wasn't a very rainy day, anyway,"" he added. Elsewhere in Sicily: A man and a woman died when their hired car was swept away in Cammarata A petrol station worker's body was found in his jeep in Vicari And rescuers are looking for a doctor who was heading into Corleone hospital to start his shift. His car has been found abandoned in a part of the road hit by flooding and landslides.

Bugle marks centenary of war poet's death,"Grace Freeman from the Wilfred Owen Association with the bugle the poet took from a dead German soldier The centenary of the death of World War One poet Wilfred Owen was marked on Sunday with the sounding of a bugle he took from the battlefield. The instrument was played at his graveside in Ors, northern France. Elizabeth Owen, the widow of his nephew Peter, was among those who attended the ""moving"" ceremony. Owen died on 4 November 1918, seven days before peace was declared. Wreaths were laid in his memory at the service. It followed a dawn visit to the site where the soldier was killed during the battle to cross the Sambre-Oise canal. French locals and members of the Wilfred Owen Association gathered to hear The Last Post played on the bugle. Owen took the instrument from a dead German soldier during the war and made reference to it as ""loot"" in a letter to his brother in 1917. War poet's work inspires sculpture Danny Boyle's beach memorial to honour WW1 soldiers Musician Heather Madeira Ni said she was grateful for the opportunity to play the instrument on such a historic occasion. She said: ""The bugle is such a piece of history and a great chance for me to get to know Owen and his poetry. ""It's such an important part of British history."" Some of Owen's poetry, which explored the brutal reality of war, was also recited and his final letter home was read out. Fiona MacDonald from the Wilfred Owen Association described the service as moving. ""There is just something really special about being here and hearing Owen's bugle played,"" she said. Thousands of torches lit up the moat of the Tower of London on Sunday evening Later around 10,000 flames were lit in the empty moat surrounding the Tower of London to mark the centenary of the end of the war. Representatives from the armed forces and volunteers took around 45 minutes to light the torches, which then burned for four hours. The spectacle was accompanied by a specially commissioned sound installation featuring choral music, as well as words from war poet Mary Borden's Sonnets To A Soldier. The ceremony, which members of the public can watch for free, will be repeated each night until the final showing on Remembrance Sunday. The first torch was lit by the Yeoman of the Guard Volunteers then used the flame to ignite thousands of other torches Walk commemorates WW1 poet's death War poet's work inspires sculpture.

"Baudelaire suicide letter sold at auctionThe French poet, 24 and short of cash, wrote to his lover before trying and failing to kill himself.Europe","The letter was written when the budding poet had money problems A letter by the French 19th-Century poet Charles Baudelaire announcing he would kill himself has sold at auction for â¬234,000 (Â£204,000; $267,000). The note, dated 30 June 1845, was addressed to Baudelaire's lover Jeanne Duval. The poet, who was 24 years old at the time, attempted to commit suicide on the same day - but survived. The French auction website Osenat said the letter sold to a private buyer for three times the estimated price. In the letter, Baudelaire informed his mistress of his intention to take his own life. ""By the time you receive this letter, I will be dead,"" it said. ""I am killing myself because I can no longer live, or bear the burden of falling asleep and waking up again."" Baudelaire is regarded as one of the greatest French poets of all time Baudelaire, who had money problems after squandering his inheritance, stabbed himself in the chest but suffered no serious injuries. He lived for another 22 years, writing in that time the volume that established his reputation, Les Fleurs du Mal (The Flowers of Evil). His works influenced generations of French poets. He died racked by syphilis in 1867.

The 2006 film The Last Holiday starred Queen Latifah while Phat Girlz, also from 2006, starred Mo'Nique. Some people online also mentioned the fact that both films were led by women of colour. Mo'Nique and Queen Latifah both starred in the film Bessie Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The captain said over the tannoy, the original problem had come back,"" said Ms Wilson. ""They had to drop the landing gear, lose fuel to make the plane lighter and divert to New York - it was the roughest one-and-a-half hours on a flight I'd ever experienced, made worse as I suffer from travel sickness.

""One mother asked where she could get formula for her seven-month-old baby and the reply was 'it would be difficult to find anywhere at this hour'. She was in tears. ""Children were sleeping on floors in JFK's Terminal 7 but my husband found a hotel in Queens for us to sleep for a few hours but we paid ourselves.

Pro-betting MPs more persuasive - Crouch,"Ex-sports minister Tracey Crouch has said MPs interested in the betting industry are behind ""delays"" to new laws on fixed-odds betting machines. Ms Crouchresigned from her postafter Chancellor Philip Hammond said the cut in stakes from Â£100 to Â£2 would come into force in October 2019. Ms Crouch said it was a ""fact"" that some MPs are ""very interested in the bookmaking industry"". She added: ""Clearly they were more persuasive in their arguments."" Currently, people can bet up to Â£100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette. Ms Crouch said she had been working under the assumption that the new maximum stake of Â£2 every 20 seconds would be introduced in April 2019. 16 MPs receive free tickets from betting firms High stakes for fixed-odds betting machines 'I lost Â£250,000 on betting machines' Betting machine stakes to be cut to Â£2 In her first interview since resigning, Ms Crouch told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""There have been conversations that have taken place with many members of Parliament with different interests and, as I say, on this occasion, clearly I wasn't as persuasive as some of my other colleagues."" Ms Crouch was asked abouta newspaper report,externalsuggesting she believed a meeting between Conservative MP Philip Davies and Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Jeremy Wright was key to the delay. She refused to confirm the details of the report, saying: ""All meetings are registered. I'm sure it will all come out anyway."" She added Mr Davies was ""very vocal in Parliament on behalf of the betting industry"". Anti-gambling campaigners say the machines let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems. Fixed-odds betting terminals generate Â£1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry,according to the Gambling Commission,external, and taxes of Â£400m for the government. This video can not be played What are fixed-odds betting terminals? Ms Crouch also voiced her disappointment that the proposed sale of Wembley Stadium had not materialised. Shahid Khan, who owns Premier League club Fulham and NFL side the Jacksonville Jaguars,withdrew a Â£600m offerdue to a lack of support from FA council members. Ms Crouch said she hoped the deal could be resurrected to provide ""opportunities to get a significant investment"" into grassroots football. She added the sale of the England national team stadium could also bring about the possibility of an NFL franchise in London and therefore a ""Â£100m per annum economic boost"".

Ex-civil service chief Sir Jeremy Heywood dies,"Sir Jeremy, pictured to the left of PM Theresa May in 2016 Sir Jeremy Heywood, the former cabinet secretary and civil service head, has died of cancer aged 56, just two weeks after stepping down from government. Sir Jeremy was cabinet secretary from 2012 until 2018 and head of the civil service between 2014 and 2018. PM Theresa May said ""he worked tirelessly to serve our country"" and is a ""huge loss to British public life"". His wife Suzanne paid tribute to a ""wonderful father"" who ""crammed a huge amount into his 56 years"". PM leads tributes to civil servant Heywood 'I will miss him more than I can say' Heywood to take break for cancer treatment In a statement released on Sunday via Downing Street, she said: ""He could light up any room or conversation. ""For me, he was my wonderful partner for 22 years. We shared everything and I will miss him more than I can say"". Sir Jeremy was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 2012 Sir Jeremy first joined the civil service in 1983 as an economist for the Health and Safety Executive before moving to the Treasury, where he worked under chancellors Ken Clarke and Gordon Brown. He had a long career at the top of government, serving four prime ministers in different roles while also spending four years in the banking sector working for Morgan Stanley. In January 2012, Sir Jeremy was knighted and made cabinet secretary - a position sometimes described as the second most powerful person in the government after the prime minister. Cabinet secretaries keep a low public profile but they sit next to the PM at cabinet meetings - and it is their job to ensure policies are put into action and offer advice on running the machinery of government. He managed former Labour PM Tony Blair's differences with his chancellor, organised Gordon Brown's Downing Street, helped to hold the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition together, and, finally, supported Mrs May's minority administration. Former Treasury minister Yvette Cooper said Sir Jeremy had done ""a lot to hold government together at very difficult times"". Mr Brown described him as a ""leader of exceptional ability and ""unquestioned integrity"". ""Jeremy Heywood was the most dynamic civil servant of his generation, a leader who inspired confidence, whose expertise was recognised by all and and whose impartiality was never in doubt."" Mr Blair said Sir Jeremy had been ""a quite outstanding public servant and someone I came to have enormous respect for both as a professional and as a person"". Sir Jeremy first joined the civil service in 1983 and Sir Mark Sedwill, his successor as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, described him as an ""exemplary public servant"". ""We will miss him more than we can say,"" Sir Mark said, adding the country ""will be the poorer without his advice, leadership and extraordinary insight"". Allow Twitter content?

Mrs May described the news as ""extremely sad"" and said her thoughts were with Sir Jeremy's family. Sir Jeremy had been Cabinet Secretary since 2012 and previously served as principal private secretary to prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, chief of staff to Mr Brown and Downing Street permanent secretary to former Conservative prime minister David Cameron. He revealed earlier this year that he had been diagnosed with cancer in June 2017, but remained in post during a summer of political upheaval triggered by the shock general election result. He took a leave of absence in June and announced on 24 October that he was stepping down. Sir Jeremy was nominated for a peerage by Mrs May as Lord Heywood of Whitehall after his retirement, in recognition of his distinguished service to public life. Allow Twitter content?

His career was not without controversy, however. He was given the nickname ""Sir cover-up"" by tabloid newspapers after it emerged he had blocked the release of letters and phone calls between Mr Blair and then US president George Bush in the run-up to the Iraq war. He said he felt ""frustrated"" by the label and argued that he had been the most transparent cabinet secretary ever. He found himself at the centre of a number of political crises during his career - he was at Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont's side when the pound crashed out of the European Exchange Rate mechanism in 1992. He also faced criticism for breaking protocol by not taking minutes of key meetings between Mr Blair and officials, which was revealed in evidence to the inquiry into the death of the weapons inspector Dr David Kelly.

Ice Age evidence bulldozed from beach,"The huge boulders on the beach gave vital insights into how glaciers behaved A ""critically important"" site of scientific interest has been ""destroyed"" by council workers on an Anglesey beach, it has been claimed. Huge boulders dating back to the end of the last Ice Age were moved as flood relief work was carried out on Lleiniog beach at Llangoed, residents said. They also claimed post-glacial peat beds were ruined by bulldozers. Natural Resources Wales said it was investigating but Anglesey council said it had a licence for the work. Gareth Phillips, a member of Friends of Llangoed Community Group, said: ""It's one of the most daft and tragic things I have ever seen done in the UK."" Shaped blocks of limestone which have now been moved Lleiniog beach, which runs along the Anglesey shore of the Menai Strait, was strewn with huge boulders which gave vital information on how glaciers behaved. Natural Resources Wales says the site provides ""some of the clearest evidence in north Wales for an incursion of Irish Sea ice during the Late Pleistocene"", the last Ice Age. It describes Lleiniog as an important site for studies of the quaternary period, the most recent period in geological time when the Ice Age occurred. Anglesey county council workers had a licence to clear out the mouth of a small river to prevent flooding of a nearby road. Large diggers on the beach moved the boulders But after working on the mouth of the stream, ""they went down 200 yards on the beach and scooped up boulders of scientific interest"", Mr Phillips said. ""They had no reason and no licence to be there,"" said the retired health professional with a keen interest in archaeology and geology. ""The local community has been distraught about it."" Euros Jones, operations manager for north west Wales at Natural Resources Wales, said the Welsh Government and Natural Resources Wales were investigating reports of damage to the site and looking into whether the work breached the conditions of the licence. It is also investigating whether the works damaged important features of the site. An Isle of Anglesey County Council spokesperson said: ""A Marine Licence from Natural Resources Wales was in place to undertake these works. We also confirmed to Gwynedd Archaeological Planning Service that we were not working in the area marked protected on their maps referencing the scheduled monument fish weirs.""

French territory rejects independence,"Supporters of independence remained defiant despite the result Voters in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia have rejected a bid for independence. Final results showed that 56.4% chose to remain part of France while 43.6% voted to leave - a tighter result than some polls had predicted. Turnout was about 81%. The vote was promised in a 1988 deal that put an end to a violent campaign for independence. President Emmanuel Macron said it showed ""confidence in the French republic"". ""I have to tell you how proud I am that we have finally passed this historic step together,"" he added. The referendum passed peacefully but some unrest was reported after polls closed. Cars and a shop were set ablaze in the capital, NoumÃ©a, local media reported, and the high commissioner's office said some roads were closed by protesters. There were some disturbances after the result became clear New Caledonia has large deposits of nickel, a vital component in manufacturing electronics, and is seen by France as a strategic political and economic asset in the region. This video can not be played The New Caledonia referendum is the climax of 20 years of peace It is one of the UN's 17 ""non-self governing territories"",external- where the process of decolonisation has not been completed. About 175,000 people were eligible to vote in Sunday's referendum New Caledonia, east of Australia, where indigenous Kanaks make up 39.1% of the population. French nationalism is strong among the territory's ethnic Europeans - constituting 27.1% of the population - and observers say even some Kanaks back staying part of France. The remaining third of the population of New Caledonia's 268,000 inhabitants are also largely said to oppose independence. New Caledonia profile The remote islands receive about â¬1.3bn (Â£1.1bn; $1.5bn) from the French government every year. Pro-independence groups said they wanted ""a multicultural, peaceful nation"" President Emmanuel Macron, in a televised speech, said the result was ""a sign of confidence in the French republic"" During a visit to NoumÃ©a in May, Mr Macron said that France would be ""less beautiful without New Caledonia"". France first claimed the islands in 1853 and once used them as a penal colony. In the 1980s there were deadly clashes between French forces and Kanaks. The climax of that conflict came when Kanak separatists killed four French gendarmes and took another 23 hostage in a cave. The subsequent French assault cost the lives of 19 Kanaks and two soldiers. About 80% of those eligible voted In 1988 representatives from the both pro- and anti-independence camps agreed to end the violence and eventually hold a self-determination referendum. A No vote may not spell the end of the independence drive. Two further referendums on independence can still be held before 2022. A Yes vote would have made New Caledonia the first French territory to break away since Djibouti (1977) and Vanuatu (1980).

Man is first to swim around Great Britain,"This video can not be played Ross Edgley said he had to swim hard against the tide to reach Margate, but it was amazing to hear the crowd An adventurer from Grantham has become the first person to swim 1,780-miles around Great Britain. Ross Edgley, 33, was joined by 300 swimmers for the last mile before he arrived in Margate at about 09:00 GMT. Edgley left the Kent town on 1 June, and has not set foot on land since, swimming for up to 12 hours a day and eating more than 500 bananas. He has battled strong tides and currents in cold water, braved storms, jellyfish and swimming in late autumn. The effort has taken its toll on his body, resulting in shoulder pain, wetsuit chafing and his tongue has partially disintegrated from salt water exposure. Ross Edgley has spent 155 days making the journey around the coast Back on dry land, Edgley told the BBC that despite needing to learn to walk again after so long in the water he is still ""not quite bored of swimming"" and looking for his next challenge. Supported in his swim by Cornish sailor Matthew Knight from his catamaran Hecate, Edgley revealed that at times the tides helped him to swim at speeds of up to 8.7 knots. ""That's a dolphin's cruising speed,"" he laughed. Jellyfish and chafing: Open water swimming Cold water swimming to treat depression Swimmer warned over 9ft shark in Cornwall The swimmer held back tears as scores of supporters who had turned out to greet him in Margate gave him a rousing cheer. He said getting that kind of reception made it all worthwhile, adding: ""There's not many places you come in and people are asking you to sign bananas."" Scores of people turned out for Edgley's arrival in Margate - and many joined him in the water Edgley set a new record 74 days into his challenge, for the longest staged sea swim, according to the World Open Water Swimming Association. He is already in the Guinness Book of World Records after completing a rope climb the equivalent height of Mount Everest in 19 hours in April 2016. That was two months after doing a marathon while pulling a car. But an attempt in 2017 to swim the 24.8 miles between Martinique and St Lucia while pulling a 100lb tree trunk ended in disappointment.

Children hurt in inflatable slide fall,"This video can not be played Carl Baccus told the BBC that the slide looked dangerous and he refused to let his children go on An investigation is under way after eight children fell from an inflatable slide at a fireworks display. Woking Park in Surrey was evacuated and a major incident declared after the children - all under the age of 16 - fell at about 19:30 GMT on Saturday. Seven were discharged from hospital overnight, with an eighth kept in for observation, with injuries ""not believed to be significant"". The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is investigating. The site was evacuated at about 20:00 to allow the helicopter to land and ""multiple crews"" from the South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) to help the injured. Fireworks organiser Michael Holden, of Woking District Rotary, said it appeared the children had fallen to the ground from the top of the slide. He said:  ""We don't still know yet what exactly happened but eight children appear to have come off near the top of the slide and landed on the floor alongside it."" He estimated about 5,000 people were in the park at the time. One eyewitness told BBC News correspondent Simon Clemison there were ""about 40 children"" on the slide, which is about 30ft (9m) high when fully inflated. An eyewitness told the BBC the inflatable - seen here on the right - was overcrowded Chris Tierney said he removed his three children from the slide ""a couple of minutes before the incident"" as he ""felt the slide had become overcrowded"". He said his daughter was ""getting bundled on by bigger children... kids were getting injured and crying. It was a disaster waiting to happen."" By Tom Pugh, BBC News Amid the merry-go-rounds, win-a-prize stalls and bumper cars at Woking Park lies the deflated inflatable at the centre of Saturday night's incident. The park remained sealed off on Sunday morning as police maintained a low-key presence at the scene. One witness, Andy Datson, 23, described seeing children being tended to by emergency crews. Another described hearing an announcement over the public-address system which first alerted visitors to a ""serious"" incident. Thousands of people are said to have been here on Saturday night to enjoy what should have been a fun night. Later, scene-of-crime officers arrived at Woking Park to carry out inquiries. All the children injured were aged under 16, Secamb said. Those taken to London hospitals were treated at St George's Hospital and King's College Hospital, while one was treated at St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey, a spokeswoman said. The fireworks display was abandoned shortly after the children were injured. A firework event was due to take place before the children were injured Eyewitness Oliver Trimble told the BBC a message went over the event's loudspeakers announcing the evacuation shortly before 20:00. He said he saw victims being treated by medics, adding: ""It was quite a horrendous sight to see. ""This is one of Woking's biggest events of the year, thousands of people come to see the fireworks,"" he said. Local musician Anna Neale said she had planned to take her daughters, aged 10 and six, on the giant slide after the fireworks. ""We saw all the blue lights and saw the air ambulance arriving. We all evacuated very calmly. Everyone was just shocked,"" the 36-year-old said. ""Multiple crews"" from South East Coast Ambulance Service were at the scene Police have launched an investigation into the incident Mr Holden said: ""We have used this funfair operator for a number of years. We have never had any problems before. [The operator] is as upset as we are. ""We are very shocked and distressed by the whole thing, but we are relieved to hear this morning that seven out of the eight children have been discharged from hospital."" The park will remain closed on Sunday while police investigate the cause of the incident, the club added. John Edwards, of Edwards Amusements, who hired the slide on behalf of the rotary club, described it as an ""unfortunate accident."" He told the BBC: ""I do not know what happened"", but said the slide did not collapse, the children fell. He said the slide had been removed by the HSE and he was now dismantling the rest of the fairground. The funfair was put under police cordon and investigators were inspecting other attractions, including the crooked house and the Ferris wheel. A Woking Borough Council spokesman said: ""We will be working with the police and relevant authorities to understand and explain what happened."" Officers have appealed for any eyewitnesses or those with video or photos of what happened to contact them. The fairground was cordoned off while investigations took place on Sunday Mark John, from Airquee, an organisation that inspects inflatables, said the items should go through rigorous checks to ensure they are safe. ""Inspections can take anything from a minimum of 45 minutes right up to several hours,"" he said. ""As people are aware lately there's a lot of emphasis on making sure the anchor points are in place and intact as they should be for protection against gusts of wind or strong winds.""

Met police still looking at Leave campaigns,"Vote Leave is one of the groups fined by the Electoral Commission Police are ""carefully"" assessing more than 900 documents to determine whether or not crimes were committed by Leave campaigns during the EU referendum. Met Police chief Cressida Dick said they had received a ""huge amount of material"", which was being considered. It would be wrong to comment on whether a police inquiry would be launched at this early ""scoping"" stage, she said. The Electoral Commission has referred both Vote Leave and Leave.EU to police over potential electoral law breaches. Leave.EU, which was backed by then UKIP leader Nigel Farage, lost out to Vote Leave, which included Michael Gove and Boris Johnson among supporters, in the battle to become the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum. Both groups have denied wrongdoing and accused the commission of a politically-motivated attack. On Thursday, the National Crime Agencyconfirmed it was investigating Leave.EU and its co-founder Arron Banksand chief executive Liz Bilney over separate allegations that it had breached electoral law by accepting loans from ""impermissible sources"". Mr Banks said he welcomed the investigation and was confident it would ""put an end to the ludicrous allegations"". In May, the Commission fined Leave.EU Â£70,000, saying it had exceeded its spending limit by at least 10% by failing to include at least Â£77,380 in its spending return. It referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police. Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 for breaking electoral law Vote Leave broke electoral law, says watchdog The BBC's EU referendum special report Brexit: All you need to know In July, the elections watchdog fined Vote Leave Â£61,000 and referred the campaign to the Met, saying it had exceeded its Â£7m spending limit by funnelling Â£675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. The Met hasdenied reported claims,externalthat ""political sensitivities"" had delayed the Met's probe. The force says it was not until 7 September that it received ""over 900 documents"" relating to both referrals from the Electoral Commission. On Friday, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have been passed by the Electoral Commission, on two separate occasions, a huge amount of material."" Arron Banks says allegations against his campaign are politically-motivated ""They pass us material when they think it may be a matter for the police, there may have been some crime committed and we are assessing that material and we are doing that carefully. ""It's just at a scoping stage so it would be wrong for me to say, before we know what we have got properly in the material and what it amounts to, whether there is any criminal investigation there or not. At the moment we are just assessing that and we will do that properly."" Vote Leave said the Electoral Commission's report was ""wholly inaccurate"" and politically motivated, accusing it of basing its conclusions on ""unfounded claims and conspiracy theories"". Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks has described the Commission's findings as a ""politically motivated attack"" and said he would challenge them in court. Some Remain supporters have suggested Brexit should be put on hold pending the outcome of the National Crime Agency inquiry. The UK's referendum in June 2016 was about whether the UK should Remain or Leave the European Union. The result was that the UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU. This departure is due to happen on 29 March 2019.

Banks challenged over Leave.EU funds,"This video can not be played Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks tells the BBC all the money he donated to it was UK-generated Businessman Arron Banks has been challenged to explain where the money for his Brexit campaign came from. Mr Banks is the subject of a police probe into claims he was not the ""true source"" of Â£8m loaned to his Leave.EU campaign in the 2016 EU referendum. The Electoral Commission referred the case to the National Crime Agency, which said potential criminal offences may have been committed. Mr Banks told the BBC's Andrew Marr the money came from his UK businesses. Police probe Banks's Brexit vote spending Met police still looking at Leave campaigns Foreign donations to political campaigns are banned under UK law. Mr Banks has faced claims that money to fund Leave.EU came from Russian sources - something he has repeatedly denied. ""There was no Russian money and no interference of any type. I want to be absolutely clear about that,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. ""The money came from Rock Services which was a UK limited company."" Mr Banks was also asked abouta report in the Sunday Times,externalthat he would back Remain if the 2016 referendum were re-run. He replied: ""What I said was that the corruption I have seen in British politics, the sewer that exists and the disgraceful behaviour of the government over what they are doing with Brexit and how they are selling out, means that if I had my time again I think we would have been better to probably remain and not unleash these demons."" The Bristol-based insurance tycoon, who was born in Cheshire, was a Lloyd's underwriter before starting his own firms The twice married father-of-five has been a close friend and supporter of Nigel Farage Mr Banks was a Conservative supporter until 2014 when he defected to UKIP, giving them Â£1m He is said to be one of the biggest political donors in UK history, thought to have given up to Â£9.6m to Leave.EU - which he co-founded - and UKIP Leave.EU, which was backed by then UKIP leader Mr Farage, lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum His Leave.EU campaign targeted its message at voters angry about EU immigration The Electoral Commission says it suspects the money came from Rock Services parent company Rock Holdings, which is registered in the Isle of Man and so ""could not lawfully make any donation or be a party to any loan to Leave.EU"". The Commission referred the case to the National Crime Agency because it has the ability to investigate financial transactions in the Isle of Man, something that is beyond the scope of the electoral watchdog. Mr Banks denied Rock Services was a ""shell company"" that did not have sufficient funds to be the source of the money for Better for the Country (BFTC), which ran Leave.EU. Inits report on the case,external, the Electoral Commission said: ""We have reasonable grounds to suspect that Rock Services did not fund the payments of Â£8m it is said it made to BFTC from its UK-generated income"". Mr Banks has given two apparently different explanations about the role of Rock Services. Inhis evidence to the Culture Media and Sport Committee,externalin June, Mr Banks described Rock Services as ""just a service company"". He told MPs: ""The actual loan came from one of my companies that was delivered in."" In his Andrew Marr interview he again described Rock Services as a ""service company"" but said it was a UK limited company and the Â£8m donation came out of ""insurance business written in the UK"". He said: ""We turn over Â£250m of premiums, it's a sizeable business"" and added Rock Services has ""all sorts of revenues"" but did not detail them. Labour MP Ian Lucas, a member of the Commons culture committee that questioned Mr Banks in June, told BBC News: ""There are a number of contradictions that arise from the interview today but I think, fundamentally, the question is that Mr Banks still hasn't given us a proper explanation of where this money came from."" Manveen Rana, BBC Today reporter In interviews and at select committee hearings, Arron Banks likes to be seen as cheeky and unflappable, almost as if he relishes these appearances. He didn't seem to be enjoying the experience today, often looking rattled during heated exchanges. The money trail was at the heart of the interview. Mr Banks looked most uncomfortable when probed about the relationship between his companies. Despite repeated questions, he insisted the funding he provided for the Brexit campaign came from his UK based company, Rock Services. But when Andrew Marr highlighted Mr Banks' own evidence to a committee of MPs - which apparently differed from this account - he appeared flustered. ""I haven't seen the actual transcript of that. I will go back and look at that, but I'm telling you that the source of the funding was Rock Services, "" he said.. Although Arron Banks insisted that he had disclosed the accounts of his Isle of Man company, Rock Holdings, to the BBC, Andrew Marr replied that they were ""redacted"" and showed very little. The questions about where the Â£8m donation came from will linger. Arron Banks denies all wrongdoing, but as the criminal investigation now gets under way, he can expect an uncomfortable few months of financial scrutiny. The National Crime Agency said: ""This is now a live investigation, and we are unable to discuss any operational detail."" Separately, the Metropolitan Police is examining whether to launch a criminal investigation into whether Leave.EU broke its Â£700,000 spending limits, after a file was handed to it by the Electoral Commission. The Met is also examining electoral law breaches by the official Vote Leave campaign. Damian Collins has accused Mr Banks of misleading his committee And, in another development, Mr Banks has been accused of misleading Parliament over links between Leave.EU and his insurance businesses. The Observer says it has seen internal emails,externalleaked by former employees of Eldon Insurance, another of Mr Banks's companies, and Rock Services that show they worked on the Leave.EU campaign from their company offices. Conservative MP and chairman of the culture media and sport committee, Damian Collins, told The Observer the leaked e-mails appeared to ""flatly contradict"" what Mr Banks had told his committee in June. Mr Banks told Andrew Marr: ""I can say that was reported to the Electoral Commission, and people who did work for Eldon were transferred over on short-term contracts legally, and it was reported through the Electoral Commission in the right way. ""You are talking about emails that were stolen from us."" The Electoral Commission said Leave.EU ""did not report spending on or donations from Eldon"". On Tuesday, the Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, will appear before the culture committee to announce the outcome of an inquiry into claims that Eldon shared customer data obtained for insurance purposes with Leave.EU, potentially breaking data protection laws. ""We are also investigating whether Eldon Insurance Limited's call centre staff used customer databases to make calls on behalf of Leave.EU in contravention of the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations 2003,""the ICO said in an interim report in July,external.

"Sir Jeremy a ""wonderful partner""","Suzanne Heywood thanked everyone who has supported the couple through Sir Jeremy's illness Former head of the civil service, Sir Jeremy Heywood, has died of cancer at the age of 56, days after retiring through ill health. Here, his wife Suzanne pays tribute to his work, his love for his family and devotion to Manchester United. ""My Jeremy, It is with huge sadness and enormous loss that I share the news of the death of my husband, Jeremy John Heywood, who passed away peacefully early this morning, Sunday 4 November. Jeremy crammed a huge amount into his 56 years. He loved his work as a civil servant and was hugely proud of his colleagues while always believing that they - and he - could and should do more, that there had to be a better way, a new way of looking at things or a fresh approach which would bring differing sides together. Those who worked with him found it a challenging, inspiring and rewarding experience. He saw it as a huge privilege to work so closely with four Prime Ministers and two Chancellors and was unwavering in his efforts to help each of them reach their goals. He was always conscious of the need for civil servants to see the world through ministers' eyes while at the same time respecting the boundaries between politicians and civil servants. Away from his work, he inspired admiration, respect and affection in his many and diverse group of friends and returned it to them. Jeremy could light up any room or conversation and loved hosting a good party. He supported Manchester United through all their ups and increasingly frequent downs, kept enough space in his brain for limitless sporting trivia and adored his music, which spanned many genres. He was a wonderful father, treasuring both time at home and travelling with our children, sharing with them his love of discovering new places, which he gained during his two years in Washington. He gave them a mix of challenge, a little teasing, total devotion and deserved praise. And he was a devoted son and a beloved and loving brother and uncle, always finding time to help, encourage and inspire. For me, he was my wonderful partner for 22 years. We shared everything and I will miss him more than I can say. I would like to thank everyone who supported us through these difficult months, making what could have been unbearable often uplifting and joyous. Jeremy was hugely touched by the response he received to the news of his retirement and we owe a debt in particular to the medical staff who looked after him so well throughout his illness and to his private office for their constant support. There will be a small private funeral in the coming weeks and a memorial service open to all at a later date. Goodbye, Jeremy.""

PM pays tribute to Sir Jeremy,"Sir Jeremy, pictured here on the left of PM Theresa May in 2016 Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have led tributes to the UK's top civil servant who is stepping down due to ill health. Sir Jeremy, cabinet secretary since 2012 and head of the civil service since 2014, was already on a leave of absence while being treated for cancer. Mrs May said he had ""made a contribution to public life few in our country can match"". Mr Corbyn said he was an ""impressive, well-informed and dedicated public servant"". Sir Jeremy is being succeeded by Sir Mark Sedwill, who had been standing in for him since June. The cabinet secretary is the prime minister's principal adviser, and as head of the civil service is in charge of 500,000 public servants across the country. In a statement announcing his decision to step down, Sir Jeremy said the job had been ""the greatest privilege of my career"". By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent You may not have heard of Sir Jeremy Heywood, but over the past two decades he has had a huge influence over how you have been governed. As one of the most powerful public servants in the land, he served four prime ministers - managing Tony Blair's differences with his chancellor, organising Gordon Brown's occasionally chaotic Downing Street, holding the Tory-Lib Dem coalition together, and finally supporting Theresa May's minority administration. To his many admirers, Sir Jeremy was the chief engineer of the ship of state, the Whitehall fixer with a huge brain who sorted problems and made things happen. To his critics, he was Sir Cover Up, an establishment figure who resisted official transparency. Either way, Sir Jeremy's departure leaves a huge hole at the heart of the British state. It is a hole that his successor must now fill as the civil service faces the enormous challenge of governance that is Brexit. Mrs May said: ""Jeremy has given exemplary service to the public in his civil service career. He has worked constantly to improve our country's future and to deliver for the public, serving prime ministers and ministers of all parties with distinction in the finest traditions of the civil service. ""I am personally grateful to him for the support he has given me as prime minister. He has made an enormous contribution to public life in our country and will be sorely missed.""

Sir Jeremy Heywood to take break for cancer treatment Top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood treated for cancer Profile: Jeremy Heywood - the next Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy, who joined the civil service as an economist in the Health and Safety Executive 35 years ago, said he still had the ""desire to serve my country and to make a positive difference"". ""It is with great sadness therefore that, on medical advice, I must now retire,"" he said. ""Since joining the civil service, I have had the privilege of supporting, at close quarters, four prime ministers, two Conservative and two Labour, and the first coalition government for decades, with its first full-time deputy prime minister. ""Throughout my career, I have seen it as my responsibility to look for fresh angles, to challenge lazy thinking and to work with colleagues to find solutions rather than simply identifying problems and obstacles that everyone can admire."" Sir Jeremy Heywood, pictured left of then PM David Cameron, in 2015 Sir Mark Sedwill, left, is the new cabinet secretary Notable issues Sir Jeremy worked on were the response to the 1990s exchange rate mechanism crisis and the 2008-09 credit crunch and financial crisis.

Uber launches US subscription service,"Taxi-hailing firm Uber has launched a membership scheme dubbed Ride Pass, for passengers in five US cities. The deal allows passengers to avoid price surging, when costs rise at rush hour and other in-demand times. The fixed-fare plan costs $24.99 (Â£19) a month in Los Angeles and $14.99 in Austin, Denver, Miami, and Orlando. Uber plans to expand the scheme to other US cities in 2019, but says it has no plans at present to introduce it in London or other UK cities. The firm is also hoping the initiative will convince passengers that it is more economical to use Uber, and to give up their own cars, ""One thing we hear a lot from riders is that changes in price - however small - can make it tough to plan their day with Uber,"" said product manager Dan Bilen. ""The daily commute is a classic example, and it goes something like this: you pay one low price for the ride to work, only to find the ride back home is a different story."" He added: ""We want to make Uber a reliable alternative to driving yourself - an affordable option people can use for their everyday transportation needs."" He said Ride Pass was a way to lock in consistent prices, on any ride, anywhere in a city, any time of day, for a monthly fee. Uber estimates users can save up to 15% a month on their current spending. Ride Pass offers discounted, fixed, rates on all their UberX, Uber Pool and Uber Express Pool rides in a given month. The Los Angeles fare package will eventually include e-bike and scooter access.

Prince Charles 'made me pick up litter',"Prince Charles turns 70 on 14 November The Prince of Wales took his sons litter-picking during their school holidays in Norfolk, his eldest son the Duke of Cambridge has revealed.

PM leads tributes to civil service chief,"Sir Jeremy, pictured here on the left of PM Theresa May in 2016 Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have led tributes to the UK's top civil servant who is stepping down due to ill health. Sir Jeremy, cabinet secretary since 2012 and head of the civil service since 2014, was already on a leave of absence while being treated for cancer. Mrs May said he had ""made a contribution to public life few in our country can match"". Mr Corbyn said he was an ""impressive, well-informed and dedicated public servant"". Sir Jeremy is being succeeded by Sir Mark Sedwill, who had been standing in for him since June. The cabinet secretary is the prime minister's principal adviser, and as head of the civil service is in charge of 500,000 public servants across the country. In a statement announcing his decision to step down, Sir Jeremy said the job had been ""the greatest privilege of my career"". By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent You may not have heard of Sir Jeremy Heywood, but over the past two decades he has had a huge influence over how you have been governed. As one of the most powerful public servants in the land, he served four prime ministers - managing Tony Blair's differences with his chancellor, organising Gordon Brown's occasionally chaotic Downing Street, holding the Tory-Lib Dem coalition together, and finally supporting Theresa May's minority administration. To his many admirers, Sir Jeremy was the chief engineer of the ship of state, the Whitehall fixer with a huge brain who sorted problems and made things happen. To his critics, he was Sir Cover Up, an establishment figure who resisted official transparency. Either way, Sir Jeremy's departure leaves a huge hole at the heart of the British state. It is a hole that his successor must now fill as the civil service faces the enormous challenge of governance that is Brexit. Mrs May said: ""Jeremy has given exemplary service to the public in his civil service career. He has worked constantly to improve our country's future and to deliver for the public, serving prime ministers and ministers of all parties with distinction in the finest traditions of the civil service. ""I am personally grateful to him for the support he has given me as prime minister. He has made an enormous contribution to public life in our country and will be sorely missed.""

Sir Jeremy Heywood to take break for cancer treatment Top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood treated for cancer Profile: Jeremy Heywood - the next Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy, who joined the civil service as an economist in the Health and Safety Executive 35 years ago, said he still had the ""desire to serve my country and to make a positive difference"". ""It is with great sadness therefore that, on medical advice, I must now retire,"" he said. ""Since joining the civil service, I have had the privilege of supporting, at close quarters, four prime ministers, two Conservative and two Labour, and the first coalition government for decades, with its first full-time deputy prime minister. ""Throughout my career, I have seen it as my responsibility to look for fresh angles, to challenge lazy thinking and to work with colleagues to find solutions rather than simply identifying problems and obstacles that everyone can admire."" Sir Jeremy Heywood, pictured left of then PM David Cameron, in 2015 Sir Mark Sedwill, left, is the new cabinet secretary Notable issues Sir Jeremy worked on were the response to the 1990s exchange rate mechanism crisis and the 2008-09 credit crunch and financial crisis. On Brexit, he said he was ""particularly proud of the work Whitehall has done in seeking to bring clarity, shape and practical options to the table for ministers to discuss"".

Life sentence for Bahrain opposition leader,"Sheikh Ali Salman, pictured in 2014, has been in prison since 2015 Bahrain's opposition leader, Sheikh Ali Salman, has been handed a life sentence after the Court of Appeal found him guilty of spying for Qatar. The ruling comes just months after the Bahraini High Court of First Tier acquitted Salman of the charge of ""colluding"" with the rival state. Bahrain cut ties with Qatar in 2017. Human rights group Amnesty has described the decision as a ""travesty of justice"" amid Bahrain's ""continued crackdown on dissent"". ""This verdict... demonstrates the Bahraini authorities' relentless and unlawful efforts to silence any form of dissent,"" Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director Heba Morayef said. ""Sheikh Ali Salman is a prisoner of conscience who is being held solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression."" Saudi-led allies stand firm on Qatar Qatar crisis: What's it about? Why Qatar is the focus of terrorism claims Ali Salman, who led the now outlawed Al-Wefaq movement, was accused of plotting with Qatar to stoke anti-government unrest in 2011, along with fellow opposition leaders Hassan Sultan and Ali al-Aswad. They have also received life sentences. Bahrain's public prosecutor said the three men were jailed for ""acts of hostility"" against Bahrain and ""communicating with Qatari officials... to overthrow constitutional order"", according to news agency AFP. But the accusations, which date back seven years, only came to light last year - after Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt cut links with Qatar. The allies accused the emirate of supporting terrorist groups and of being too close to Iran - allegations the emirate has vigorously denied. At the time, Wefaq said the allegations were  an attempt by the Bahraini government to smear it and prolong the imprisonment of its leader, who has been in custody since 2015. Demonstrators - mainly led by the majority Shia community - took to the streets in February 2011, demanding more democracy as part of pro-democracy uprisings across the Arab world. But the royal Al Khalifa family, who hold most of the political and military posts, managed to suppress the protests with the help of neighbouring countries, most importantly Saudi Arabia. The unrest left at least 30 civilians and five policemen dead. Ever since, the Sunni-ruled Bahrain has been wracked by unrest. In response, Bahrain - a key ally of the United States and the UK, which both have naval bases in the country - has outlawed opposition groups, while hundreds of government critics have been jailed. By Yolande Knell, BBC News Most people in the tiny Gulf country are Shia Muslims but it is ruled by a Sunni Muslim royal family that controls top government posts. As leader of the main Shiite opposition party, Sheikh Ali Salman was among those calling for democratic reforms including a constitutional monarchy and elected prime minister. Al-Wefaq had the biggest bloc in parliament before the 2011 protests but its members resigned when those were suppressed.  Later the party was banned - along with other religious and secular opposition groups. Dozens of clerics and activists have been jailed.  Before this verdict, Sheikh Ali Salman was already imprisoned on charges of inciting hatred. Human rights groups accuse the international community of failing to speak out about abuses in Bahrain because of its strategically important location and value as a defence and security hub.

Glowing chemical 'could aid cancer surgery',"The chemical causes tumours to glow pink under UV light A chemical that makes brain tumours glow pink could help surgeons to remove the cancer safely, a trial suggests. Scientists gave people with suspected glioma a drink containing 5-ALA, a substance known to accumulate in fast-growing cancer cells. The pink glow the chemical causes was found in people with the most aggressive cancers. Researchers hope it will make it easier for surgeons to distinguish between cancer cells and healthy brain tissue. Common virus to help fight brain cancer 'Kinder' care hope for child brain cancer Extra cancer funding in Tessa Jowell tribute Treatment for glioma, the most common form of brain cancer and the one that killed ex-Labour cabinet minister Dame Tessa Jowell, usually involves surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible, and the prognosis for patients is often poor. For this new trial, 99 patients with suspected high-grade (fast-growing) gliomas were given a drink containing 5-ALA before surgery. Research has previously shown that 5-ALA ends up in fast-growing cancer cells, because they lack an enzyme needed to break down the chemical. Surgeons used microscopes to help them look for fluorescent tissue while removing tumours from the patients' brains. During their operations, surgeons reported seeing fluorescence in 85 patients. Of these, 81 were confirmed by pathologists to have high-grade disease, one was found to have low-grade disease and three could not be assessed. In the 14 patients in whom surgeons did not see any fluorescence, seven tumours were found to be low-grade gliomas while the other seven could not be assessed. Study author Dr Kathreena Kurian, associate professor in brain tumour research at the University of Bristol, said: ""There's an urgent need to have something while the patient is on the table, while the neurosurgeon is operating, which will guide them to find the worst bits. ""The beauty of 5-ALA is that they can see where high-grade glioma is, while they're operating."" Dame Tessa Jowell died in May this year The researchers caution that the study looked at patients who were already suspected to have high-grade tumours, and a larger study in which more patients have low-grade disease would provide more information on the use of this technique. Other types of markers may need to be tested for detecting low-grade glioma cells, they say. Next steps could include testing the 5-ALA in children with brain tumours, or to help surgeons distinguish between tumour tissue and scar tissue in adult patients, whose brain cancers have recurred following treatment. Dr Paul Brennan, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""Highlighting the more aggressive tumour cells in real-time could help doctors achieve the delicate balance between removing as much of the tumour as possible while preserving surrounding healthy tissue. ""The fluorescent marker may also ease the burden of follow-up treatment, as cancer cells left behind after surgery require additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy."" The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence approved the use of 5-ALA for patients with brain tumours, prior to surgery, earlier this year. The research is being presented at the 2018 NCRI Cancer Conference in Glasgow from 4 to 6 November.

"Man is first to swim around Great BritainRoss Edgley, 33, consumed more than 500 bananas during his 1,780-mile journey around Great Britain.UK","This video can not be played Ross Edgley said he had to swim hard against the tide to reach Margate, but it was amazing to hear the crowd An adventurer from Grantham has become the first person to swim 1,780-miles around Great Britain. Ross Edgley, 33, was joined by 300 swimmers for the last mile before he arrived in Margate at about 09:00 GMT. Edgley left the Kent town on 1 June, and has not set foot on land since, swimming for up to 12 hours a day and eating more than 500 bananas. He has battled strong tides and currents in cold water, braved storms, jellyfish and swimming in late autumn. The effort has taken its toll on his body, resulting in shoulder pain, wetsuit chafing and his tongue has partially disintegrated from salt water exposure. Ross Edgley has spent 155 days making the journey around the coast Back on dry land, Edgley told the BBC that despite needing to learn to walk again after so long in the water he is still ""not quite bored of swimming"" and looking for his next challenge. Supported in his swim by Cornish sailor Matthew Knight from his catamaran Hecate, Edgley revealed that at times the tides helped him to swim at speeds of up to 8.7 knots. ""That's a dolphin's cruising speed,"" he laughed. Jellyfish and chafing: Open water swimming Cold water swimming to treat depression Swimmer warned over 9ft shark in Cornwall The swimmer held back tears as scores of supporters who had turned out to greet him in Margate gave him a rousing cheer. He said getting that kind of reception made it all worthwhile, adding: ""There's not many places you come in and people are asking you to sign bananas."" Scores of people turned out for Edgley's arrival in Margate - and many joined him in the water Edgley set a new record 74 days into his challenge, for the longest staged sea swim, according to the World Open Water Swimming Association. He is already in the Guinness Book of World Records after completing a rope climb the equivalent height of Mount Everest in 19 hours in April 2016. That was two months after doing a marathon while pulling a car. But an attempt in 2017 to swim the 24.8 miles between Martinique and St Lucia while pulling a 100lb tree trunk ended in disappointment.

Blasphemy case husband pleads for asylum,"Many called for the death penalty to be reinstated following Asia Bibi's acquittal The husband of a Pakistani Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy after eight years on death row has pleaded for asylum from the UK, US or Canada. Asia Bibi's husband, Ashiq Masih, said they were in great danger in Pakistan. The Supreme Court overturned her conviction on Wednesday, saying the case against her was based on flimsy evidence. But she has yet to be freed. Her acquittal sparked violent protests, and the government has now agreed to try to stop her leaving the country. On Saturday, her lawyer, Saif Mulook, fled Pakistan, saying he feared for his life. Pakistan's 'historic' Asia Bibi ruling Why Pakistan's Christians are targeted Blasphemy laws around the world Asia Noreen - commonly known as Asia Bibi - was convicted in 2010 of insulting the Prophet Muhammad during a row with neighbours. Several countries have offered her asylum. In a video message, Mr Masih said he feared for his family's safety. ""I am requesting the prime minister of the UK help us and as far as possible grant us freedom,"" he said. He also called on Canadian and US leaders for help. Asia Bibi's husband and daughter say they fear for their safety Earlier,in an interview with German broadcaster DW, he said he and his family were ""frightened"",externalafter Pakistan's authorities struck a deal with the hardline Tehreek-i-Labaik (TLP) party in order to end protests over Asia Bibi's acquittal. As part of the agreement, officials will start proceedings to bar her from leaving the country. The government will also not prevent protesters legally challenging the Supreme Court decision to release her. ""The agreement has sent a shiver down my spine,""  Mr Masih told DW. ""It is wrong to set a precedent in which you pile pressure onto the judiciary."" ""The current situation is very dangerous for us. We have no security and are hiding here and there, frequently changing our location."" He added: ""My wife, Asia Bibi, has already suffered greatly. She has spent 10 years in jail. My daughters were dying to see her free, but now this review petition will prolong her plight."" UK MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee in Parliament, said he had asked the Home Office for an ""urgent evaluation of the situation"", the Guardian reported.

Meanwhile, Pakistan's Information Minister Fawad Chaudry told the BBC that security had been ""beefed up"" to protect Asia Bibi. ""Yes, there is a situation and we are dealing with it, but I assure you that her life is not in danger,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. He described the government's deal with the protesters as ""firefighting"", saying it helped to ""resolve the situation without resorting to violence"". The trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi had with a group of women in June 2009. They were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean. This video can not be played Asia Bibi's escape from Pakistan death row Prosecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response. She was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation. In Wednesday's ruling, the Supreme Court said that the case was based on unreliable evidence and her confession was delivered in front of a crowd ""threatening to kill her"". Islam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong. Hard-line politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base. Christians: Pakistan's 'forgotten minority' The last hours of a Christian sanitary worker in Pakistan But critics say the laws have often been used to get revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence. The vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community, but since the 1990s scores of Christians have been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population. The Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance. Since 1990, at least 65 people have reportedly been killed in Pakistan over claims of blasphemy. Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted? Pakistani Christians fear blasphemy laws.

French territory votes on independenceThe Pacific islands of New Caledonia have voted in a referendum on whether to stay part of France.Asia,"Supporters of independence remained defiant despite the result Voters in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia have rejected a bid for independence. Final results showed that 56.4% chose to remain part of France while 43.6% voted to leave - a tighter result than some polls had predicted. Turnout was about 81%. The vote was promised in a 1988 deal that put an end to a violent campaign for independence. President Emmanuel Macron said it showed ""confidence in the French republic"". ""I have to tell you how proud I am that we have finally passed this historic step together,"" he added. The referendum passed peacefully but some unrest was reported after polls closed. Cars and a shop were set ablaze in the capital, NoumÃ©a, local media reported, and the high commissioner's office said some roads were closed by protesters. There were some disturbances after the result became clear New Caledonia has large deposits of nickel, a vital component in manufacturing electronics, and is seen by France as a strategic political and economic asset in the region. This video can not be played The New Caledonia referendum is the climax of 20 years of peace It is one of the UN's 17 ""non-self governing territories"",external- where the process of decolonisation has not been completed. About 175,000 people were eligible to vote in Sunday's referendum New Caledonia, east of Australia, where indigenous Kanaks make up 39.1% of the population. French nationalism is strong among the territory's ethnic Europeans - constituting 27.1% of the population - and observers say even some Kanaks back staying part of France. The remaining third of the population of New Caledonia's 268,000 inhabitants are also largely said to oppose independence. New Caledonia profile The remote islands receive about â¬1.3bn (Â£1.1bn; $1.5bn) from the French government every year. Pro-independence groups said they wanted ""a multicultural, peaceful nation"" President Emmanuel Macron, in a televised speech, said the result was ""a sign of confidence in the French republic"" During a visit to NoumÃ©a in May, Mr Macron said that France would be ""less beautiful without New Caledonia"". France first claimed the islands in 1853 and once used them as a penal colony. In the 1980s there were deadly clashes between French forces and Kanaks. The climax of that conflict came when Kanak separatists killed four French gendarmes and took another 23 hostage in a cave. The subsequent French assault cost the lives of 19 Kanaks and two soldiers. About 80% of those eligible voted In 1988 representatives from the both pro- and anti-independence camps agreed to end the violence and eventually hold a self-determination referendum. A No vote may not spell the end of the independence drive. Two further referendums on independence can still be held before 2022. A Yes vote would have made New Caledonia the first French territory to break away since Djibouti (1977) and Vanuatu (1980). New Caledonia is represented in the French parliament by two deputies and two senators. It has a congress which elects an executive with powers over some policy areas - notably policing, education and local laws. New Caledonia profile Independence vote - where parties stand.

Saudi Arabia frees detained princePrince Khaled bin Talal was held for months after criticising a crackdown on corruption.Middle East,"Princes and other senior figures were held at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Riyadh last year over corruption allegations A Saudi prince arrested for criticising a crackdown on corruption is reported to have been freed from detention. Relatives of Prince Khaled bin Talal shared pictures on social media, purportedly taken this weekend, showing the prince greeting his family. The prince, who was held for nearly a year, is a nephew of King Salman. Prince Khaled's brother, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, was among dozens of princes and other senior figures held in a corruption drive late last year. The latest move comes amid intense pressure on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman overthe murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Analysts say Saudi authorities appear to be trying to defuse the crisis by shoring up support from within the royal family. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Life inside Saudi Arabia's 'five-star prison' Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed? Is the Saudi crown prince finished? ""Thank god for your safety,"" tweeted Prince Khaled's niece, Princess Reem bint Alwaleed, posting images of him with other family members. Other pictures shared by relatives showed the prince kissing and embracing his son, who has been in a coma for several years. The Saudi government has given no official explanation for his detention, or for his apparent release. This video can not be played Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal gives tour of luxury 'jail' But the Wall Street Journal reported that he was held for 11 months for criticising last year's mass detention of more than 200 princes, ministers and businessmen over allegations of corruption. They were held in hotels in the capital Riyadh, including in the five-star Ritz-Carlton. Analysts suggested that operation was an attempt by the crown prince to consolidate power. At the end of January the Saudi prosecutor general's office said more than $100bn (Â£77bn) had been recovered following financial settlements with those being held.

Business leaders call for new Brexit voteSeventy leaders sign a letter to the Sunday Times backing a vote on the terms of the UK's EU exit.UK Politics,"Authors of the letter say the original ballot did not reflect the choices now facing the UK More than 70 business leaders have signed a letter to the Sunday Times calling for a public vote on the UK's Brexit deal. The chief executive of Waterstones and former Sainsbury's boss Justin King are among those saying a ""destructive hard Brexit"" will damage the UK economy. A group called Business for a People's Vote will launch on Thursday. A Downing Street source told the BBC the Prime Minister was clear that there would be no new referendum. The letter was coordinated by The People's Vote campaign, which wants a ballot on whether to accept the terms of the UK's departure from the European Union. Richard Reed, co-founder of Innocent Drinks and Martha Lane Fox, the founder of Lastminute.com - who both campaigned for Remain - signed the letter, as did Lord Myners, the former chairman of Marks and Spencer. How will Parliament vote on a final deal? All you need to know about Brexit It reads: ""The business community was promised that, if the country voted to leave, there would continue to be frictionless trade with the EU and the certainty about future relations that we need to invest for the long term. ""Despite the Prime Minister's best efforts, the proposals being discussed by the government and the European Commission fall far short of this. ""The uncertainty over the past two years has already led to a slump in investment."" The letter concludes: ""We are now facing either a blindfold or a destructive hard Brexit. ""Given that neither was on the ballot in 2016, we believe the ultimate choice should be handed back to the public with a People's Vote."" Waterstones chief executive James Daunt told the BBC: ""All the paper we use is imported. We rely on just-in-time methods and now there are multiple uncertainties."" Prime Minister Theresa May has said asking the public to vote again would be a betrayal of the public's trust. The Downing Street source told the BBC: ""The Prime Minister has been clear - no second referendum. ""We had a people's vote, it was in June 2016.""

Sister Patricia Fox, 72, has angered President Rodrigo Duterte by repeatedly denouncing his administration's violent campaign against the drugs trade. Her missionary visa was downgraded to a temporary tourist visa last month. Speaking as she was preparing to leave on Saturday, she said Mr Duterte should listen to ""the cry of small people"". ""Not just the military, not just the business people, but the urban poor, the workers, the indigenous peoples,"" she added, addressing supporters who had come to Manila airport to see her off.

Saudi Arabia frees detained prince,"Princes and other senior figures were held at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Riyadh last year over corruption allegations A Saudi prince arrested for criticising a crackdown on corruption is reported to have been freed from detention. Relatives of Prince Khaled bin Talal shared pictures on social media, purportedly taken this weekend, showing the prince greeting his family. The prince, who was held for nearly a year, is a nephew of King Salman. Prince Khaled's brother, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, was among dozens of princes and other senior figures held in a corruption drive late last year. The latest move comes amid intense pressure on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman overthe murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Analysts say Saudi authorities appear to be trying to defuse the crisis by shoring up support from within the royal family. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Life inside Saudi Arabia's 'five-star prison' Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed? Is the Saudi crown prince finished? ""Thank god for your safety,"" tweeted Prince Khaled's niece, Princess Reem bint Alwaleed, posting images of him with other family members. Other pictures shared by relatives showed the prince kissing and embracing his son, who has been in a coma for several years. The Saudi government has given no official explanation for his detention, or for his apparent release. This video can not be played Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal gives tour of luxury 'jail' But the Wall Street Journal reported that he was held for 11 months for criticising last year's mass detention of more than 200 princes, ministers and businessmen over allegations of corruption. They were held in hotels in the capital Riyadh, including in the five-star Ritz-Carlton. Analysts suggested that operation was an attempt by the crown prince to consolidate power. At the end of January the Saudi prosecutor general's office said more than $100bn (Â£77bn) had been recovered following financial settlements with those being held.

Man escaping 'aggressive' seals rescued,"The man was rescued from the cliffs on Friday evening after getting stuck An angler has been rescued from a cliff face which he scaled in a bid to escape from a colony of ""aggressive"" seals. The man was walking along the beach in Green Stane, near Eyemouth, on Friday evening when he encountered about 50 seals and their young pups. They became agitated and in order to avoid them he scrambled up the cliff but became trapped. Coastguard teams, an RNLI lifeboat and police were sent to the scene after he raised the alarm at about 19:40. Ropes were used to lower a coastguard rescue officer to the man and he was then lifted to the lifeboat waiting below. He was uninjured but had minor cold exposure. The man got into difficulty on cliffs in the Green Stane area Coastguard teams from Dunbar, Berwick, North Berwick and Eyemouth, as well as the RNLI Eyemouth lifeboat, assisted with the rescue. Senior coastguard operations officer Jonathan Mustard said: ""Anyone who encounters a seal or a colony of seals on the beach or coastline is advised to move away at the first sign of agitation. ""Aggressive seals are not a common occurrence and in this case they may have been protecting or defending their natural habitat and their young. ""Remember to take a fully charged mobile when walking on the coast and call 999 and ask for the coastguard if you get into difficulty.""

'Haunted house made rugby player cry',"This video can not be played What goes bump in the night at Llancaiach Fawr manor house? A housekeeper burned to death and a six-year-old boy who plummeted 40ft to his doom - welcome to the 16th Century manor house that reduced an international rugby player to tears. Llancaiach Fawr manor house claims to be one of the most haunted in the UK. Dating back to about 1550, the house in Nelson, Caerphilly county, was built for Dafydd ap Richard. By the mid-1600s it had become a tenanted farm house and stayed that way until it was bought in 1979 by the then Rhymney Valley District Council, who decided to turn it into a museum. So with 450 years, and no doubt many deaths within its four walls, what is it like to work in what is said to be one of Wales' most haunted houses? Historical interpreter Lee Jessup, who leads ghost tours at the manor, said the home's most infamous previous resident was Mattie, a housekeeper who lived there in the late 18th and early 19th Century. She is thought to have died after being burned in an accident and it is her bedroom that brings out strange reactions in visitors. Not the best place for a good night's sleep: Children's laughter has reportedly been heard at Llancaiach Fawr ""Many years ago we were visited by the South Africa under-21 rugby squad - they came to Wales to play friendly matches and exhibition matches,"" said Lee. ""We took them on a tour, as they went into Mattie's room, the captain - who must have been 6ft 8, he was an enormous fella - he just broke down in floods of tears with no explanation. ""As soon as he left the room again, he was fine - he was greatly embarrassed by it."" The 'haunted' object giving Post Malone bad luck England's spookiest castle Which celebrity had the best Halloween costume? Phantom menace: Lee Jessup's record is 15 people walking out of a ghost tour in fear inside 10 minutes Another apparition said to be seen and heard is that of a young boy who was killed when he fell from an opening on the first floor on to flagstones below in 1906. ""He has certainly been experienced on ghost tours. I've never seen him, I've heard footsteps when somebody claimed to have seen him behind me,"" said Lee. Working in a haunted house for 13 years means Lee has had his fair share of spooky sightings - including the figure of a hooded girl on the cellar steps while he was in the kitchen. A couple of years after that close encounter, a woman on a ghost tour who claimed to be a medium said to him: ""You know there's a girl who follows you around this house? ""I said 'really? Can you describe her?' And she gave the exact description of the girl I'd seen stood at the bottom of the cellar steps... it was spooky."" So how has working in what Lee says is ""reported to be one of the most haunted houses in Wales if not the whole country"" made him feel about the supernatural? ""I've always classed myself as an open-minded person. I believe people see things... I certainly believe what is termed the paranormal exists - I don't say I believe it's the spirits of the dead, I don't know what it is. ""I've experienced enough in this house to make me believe something exists."" Sker House (pictured here in 1998) was originally a grange of Neath Abbey This 800-year-old mansion sits on the coast in Kenfig, Bridgend county. It was made famous in the 1872 novel The Maid of Sker by R D Blackmore and is based on the story of Elizabeth Williams, said to have died of a broken heart after being locked in a room in the house by her father to stop her from marrying her lover. Her spirit is said to haunt Sker,external, along with the captain of a ship which was wrecked on nearby Sker Point. But these ghostly goings-on did not deter a private buyer from purchasing the house in 2003 after a restoration project. Anyone hoping to get a glimpse of the spectre of Elizabeth Williams is out of luck - part of the sale meant the new owners had to open the house to the public for 28 days a year, but that arrangement came to an end in 2013. You might get more than one kind of spirit in this pub It seems Kenfig is a haunted hotspot as this pub, just a few hundred yards from Sker House is another where ghost hunters would have a field day. Landlord Dave Stone, 37, took over the pub three months ago, but in his short tenure has seen and heard things he cannot quite explain. The Grade II-listed inn was built in the 1400s and has been used as a town hall, court house and a mortuary for sailors whose bodies washed up on nearby beaches. ""We've seen glasses fall off shelves, chairs turn around, laughter when there's no-one else in the pub,"" said Dave. ""One poor boy heard laughter in the toilets when doing night checks - a few days later he put a chair on the table, turned around and when leaving the room, the chair was facing a different direction. ""The lady who lives upstairs came down to make a cup of tea after hours and heard cutlery rustling, we watched on CCTV and saw nothing, but a split second before [the noise] you could see her dressing gown get pulled. ""I can't explain the dressing gown move or the chair turning round. The laughter could be misheard, items spinning could be a draft, I don't know - I'm open-minded, but not convinced.""

Magic Mournes make for the perfect office,"This video can not be played An office in the Mournes Imagine if your office was 220 square miles of mountains and forests, or your commute to work was a two-hour hike into the hills. For those who work in the Mourne Mountains this is a daily experience, so commonplace it is hardly worth remarking on - other than to say how happy you are not to be confined to a desk. Stones airlifted for Mourne repairs Mourne Mountains get dedicated weather service Not all are in jobs you might expect - for every farmer and forester there is a moth counter and a bee keeper. Would you swap your office for this? Veronica, a summer volunteer from Texas who was working on repairing the Glen River Path up Slieve Donard, was delighted to be there - even as she wrestled with boulders and vainly swatted away the clouds of midges. The team is working to repair the Glen River path ""The worst thing is, sometimes, you get these boulders the whole way out and then you go 'no, don't need that, that is not the one,'"" she said. ""I really love working outdoors, like this is one of the best offices in the world. I could not be happier right now, I never wanted to work in a cubicle."" She added: ""You come home and you think you have only done a little thing, but you have made the world a better place."" Katie Taylor, who works as a ranger and was part of the team repairing the path, is more philosophical about how ineffective her cap has been against the midge onslaught. The workers have to constantly battle swarms of midges ""Every season has its challenges - midges in the summer - they own that spot and you know you can't deny them."" Stonemason Andy Rooney is also part of a team taking advantage of the summer sunshine to carry out repair work. He is from a family who are the fifth generation of stonemasons working on the Mourne wall. It is a 22-mile-long, hand-cut dry stone wall that passes over 15 mountains. Andy Rooney is following in his family's footsteps as a stonemason The skills are passed down from father to son. ""Our grandfather would have worked on this wall and our great-grandfather as well,"" said Mr Rooney. ""You have to admire them, the conditions would not have been great then. ""They would have probably stayed up here until maybe midweek, back down for supplies, so it would not have been easy."" He added: ""They would not have had the gear or the footwear or the waterproofs that we have nowadays."" Andy Crory is single-minded in his devotion to working in the great outdoors. Andy Crory does not let birthdays or Christmas stop him from moth recording He is a moth recorder in the Murlough Nature Reserve. ""I'll be down here Christmas Eve, Christmas morning, New Year's Day, New Year's Eve,"" he said. ""Does not matter - wife's birthday, my birthday, kids' birthdays. ""How are you going to get a handle on the numbers of these things if you don't trap?"" There are 700 types of butterfly and moth on the reserve and Mr Crory feels some kinship with them. ""It's like a party and you see the same friends every day. These are the people I see every day. ""I have just called moths people... oh dear."" Donald Whiteside, a wildlife ranger for the Forest Service for almost four decades, has also developed a close connection with the landscape. During the filming of the series he was carrying out a deer survey in Tollymore, where there is a herd of about 150 fallow deer. Donald Whiteside has regular chats with the trees in the forest ""To me, trees are art of my life. Trees basically have spirits. ""They are a living part of mankind and relate back to when cavemen were about. ""Believe it or not, trees normally talk to me - strangely.""

Has stadium rock been unplugged?,"For many, imagining a sell-out stadium show conjures up the image of the classic rock band line-up; the posturing frontman, the charismatic lead guitarist, the perfect partnership between drums and bass keeping the heavy melodies rolling. The music itself can range from the hair metal kings of Guns N' Roses and AC/DC, through to the British institutions of The Rolling Stones or Queen. It is that unit, those domineering guitars and those anthemic sing-alongs, that define the ""stadium rock"" sound. And today tickets go on sale for the original hair rockers Bon Jovi, returning to the stage at Wembley Stadium for the first time in 18 years. But after a decade of pop acts dominating the hallowed ground - the only artists to have headlined this year being Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran - is it too late? Has the era of stadium rock been unplugged and relegated to smaller venues? Or can the rock and roll bands of the future still dream big? Chris Robertson, the lead singer of US hard rock band Black Stone Cherry, dreams of dominating the stage. The four-piece was founded in the early 2000s and plays arenas both at home and abroad. It was seeing his idols perform for an entire stadium that first made Chris want to play for thousands more. ""These are the bands that every kid aspires to be when they first pick up a guitar,"" he says. ""You want to be Slash, Angus Young, Steven Tyler... all these iconic acts."" Chris Robertson says it was stadium bands that inspired him to start playing There is no tinge of jealousy in Chris' voice - he's gearing up for a UK arena tour in December - just admiration and the belief that the talent of these bands demands huge stages. ""Their music, it connects with people,"" he says. ""And that is the goal - to have your music connect with as many people as possible."" For the lead singer of Danish band Volbeat, Michael Poulsen, it's the draw of those massive stadium bands he has to thank for his own success. 'We hated being a heavy metal band' - Black Sabbath Ageing metalheads escape care home for moshing Bands, denim and leather - the fans Heavy metal legends Metallica fell in love with Volbeat's unique blend of metal and rockabilly, and took them out on the road, leading to success in their own right, playing arenas and festivals. Michael Poulsen [left] wonders who the next generation of stadium bands will be But Michael does wonder if they will ever grab the stadium headline slot. ""It is going to be interesting to see what will be left when the big stadium bands say goodbye,"" he says. ""Those huge bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden, AC/DC, Ozzy Osborne... who is there to be the next generation?"" Finnish metal group Nightwish often play to crowds of 80,000 upwards in Europe when they feature on festival bills, and they are due to play at UK arenas later this year. But they still have not headlined a stadium. Like many before him, it was a big stadium show with Metallica and Guns N' Roses that opened the doors of rock music to their lead songwriter, Tuomas Holopainen. But for him, the dream is about playing live, not the size of the crowds. ""It has never been a thing for me,"" he says, ahead of a headline slot at Bloodstock Festival. ""Our manager tells us these are the gigs that you're going to play, then at some point you realise you are playing just before Iron Maiden. Really? Wow! ""I think it's an inspiration, not a frustration."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Thunder have been there, seen it and got the band t-shirts more than a decade before many of these bands even started playing. Formed in 1988 at the height of the hair metal revolution, the five piece have toured the world with huge hits like Love Walked In, and played some of the biggest stadiums on offer. But like their younger counterparts, it was seeing other acts play those huge venues that motivated them. ""The first time we played a stadium, it felt a little bit alien, but it also felt like where we should be,"" says Luke Morley, the band's guitarist and songwriter. ""It was the next extension of putting the hard work in."" Danny Bowes says bands still find their way to the big venues Some critics have hit out at old school acts that still dominate the big stages, and who might block newer bands from reaching dizzying heights. However, Thunder think their success also acts as an inspiration for upcoming groups. ""Everyone still has to find a way,"" says Danny Bowes, the band's lead singer. ""Look around, there's loads of young bands, they're all aspiring and I think they should be inspired by seeing other bands further up the bill. ""There's no reason they can't be there and the old bands are not going to last forever."" How did we do this? We looked back at every concert or event in Wembley's history since 1980 and gave it a value as a ""pop"" or ""rock"" event.  Shows with the same performers playing over multiple nights were counted separately. For some events, such as 2007's Live Earth, where a mixture of rock and pop acts performed, we assigned the value which best fitted the majority of artists. Alexander Milas, the former editor in chief of Metal Hammer magazine, still believes rock acts are a big part of the stadium circuit, but a change in the industry has made it harder to reach the top. ""When it comes to new acts, it isn't just about the next big thing these days,"" he says. ""More frequently it's about the next mid-sized dozen things, or the next really-small-but-absolutely-brilliant hundred things you've heard about via your friends."" He also says the phenomenon of the established bands' back catalogue - now exceeding the sale of new records for the first time - puts another hurdle in the way of younger bands. ""That's a radical shift and a whole new world,"" said Alexander. ""The era of getting signed as a route to fortune certainly seems to be over but for a very precious few."" Tuomas Holopainen says crowds want to hear music ""live and loud"" Wembley Stadium, the iconic London venue, says if the bands can attract the fans (up to 98,000 for a sell-out show) they are welcome at the venue - whatever their sound. Stadium senior commercial manager James Taylor says: ""While the 80's and 90's were a particularly strong period for rock music both at Wembley and around the world, there is undoubtedly still a place for this genre at the stadium. ""In recent years... the feedback shows there is still an appetite for this to continue and music is a high priority for this venue."" For the bands, they believe people are always going to want to hear music ""live and loud"". ""That is never ever going to change,"" says Nightwish's Tuomas. And he welcomes the variety of acts taking up the mantle. Wembley Stadium can house up to 98,000 people for one of its concerts ""Look at Ed Sheeran,"" he says. ""It is not my cup of tea, but he is filling stadiums all around the world with just a guitar. ""If one guy with one guitar can fill up Wembley Stadium for four nights, that is amazing."" Volbeat's Michael definitely sees stadium music as a spectrum now, rather than just its classic rock roots. ""You can have stadium pop, you can have stadium rock, and you can have an extreme band like Slipknot fill a stadium,"" he said. ""It is impressive."" And the ambition is still there. ""You want to be a band that conquers the world,"" says Black Stone Cherry's Chris. ""There is still the potential for bands to get to that level."" He admits it is harder to reach those heights, ""even to reach the larger theatres and arenas, so stadiums seem like a far cry"". But he adds: ""When you play, you have got to have that mentality that you can get there - not cockiness, but determination that anything is possible.""
