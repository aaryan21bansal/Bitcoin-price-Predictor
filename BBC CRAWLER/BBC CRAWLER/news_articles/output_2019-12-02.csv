Developments from day 27 of the campaign included:  We'll be back in the morning - join us then. The Sun leads on the PM's warning that his main rival in the election, Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, is a ""security risk"" The Daily Telegraph says Labour must ""come clean"" about how it got hold of documents it says ""proves"" the NHS is for sale At the summit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to call for Nato unity, amid growing tensions within the military bloc. The summit will mark the founding of the 29-member defence alliance 70 years ago. The two-day gathering is overshadowed by a bitter row between France and Turkey over the Syrian conflict. Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron described Nato as ""brain dead"", saying alliance members were no longer co-operating on a range of key issues. Read the full story here. As the election campaign enters its final days, Donald Trump has arrived in the UK for a meeting of the defence alliance Nato. The US president's plane, Air Force One, landed at Stansted airport ahead of the three-day visit. Mr Trump is set to attend a reception for world leaders hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. The summit marking the 70th anniversary of Nato starts in Watford on Wednesday. His last UK two visits attracted protests and more demonstrations are expected during this stay. Read more here. The father of London Bridge attack victim Jack Merritt writes on the front page of the Guardian that his death has been used to reinforce a world view that he fought against The Metro leads with an image of Jack's girlfriend, Leanne, and father, Dave, at a vigil in Cambridge Party president Mary Lou McDonald previously said Boris Johnson's Brexit deal was a ""least worst option"" Sinn Fein has unveiled its manifesto ahead of the 12 December general election. The full document,which can be viewed here,external, focuses on Sinn Fein's approach to Brexit, as well as Irish unity, the restoration of Stormont and other issues. The party has a long-standing policy of abstentionism, meaning its MPs do not take their seats at Westminster, and it argues that by not doing so it is fulfilling the mandate given to it by it voters. The party's manifesto says Sinn Fein has been more effective arguing outside of Westminster - including in Dublin, Brussels and Washington - than it would have been if it had taken its seats. This video can not be played As we told you a few moments ago, the Labour leader has written to President Trump to ""clarify"" whether or not the NHS is on the table as part of post-Brexit trade talks. Mr Corbyn says there would be ""no deal"" with the US, under a Labour government, if it insisted the NHS was included in post-Brexit trade talks Jeremy Corbyn has said he would walk away from trade negotiations if the US insisted on including the NHS as part of a trade deal. President Trump and the first lady left the White House earlier for the Nato summit in London earlier Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to US President Donald Trump to ask him to âurgently clarify that our NHS is
genuinely off the table in UK-US trade talks and that it will not be exposed
to higher costs from US drug companies"". Speaking ahead of
President Trumpâs visit to London for a Nato summit, Mr Corbyn says Labour would ânegotiate a trade arrangement with the EU that means we will protect our manufacturing industries' primary market, and weâll have to trade with rest of the world of course. But weâre not putting our public services on any negotiating table in any circumstances"". Mr Corbyn hasclaimed government papers he released last week are ""proof"" that the NHS was at riskunder a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the claims are ""nonsense"" and the NHS would not be part of trade talks. Mr Corbyn says there would be âno dealâ with the US, under a Labour government, if it insisted the NHS or other public services were included in trade talks. In his letter to Mr Trump, Mr Corbyn added: âI am sure you understand that our coming general election on 12 December means the British public need urgent clarity that our NHS is genuinely off the table in UK-US trade talks and will not be exposed to higher costs from US drugs companies.â Mr Corbyn says he would
be âvery happy to talk to Mr Trumpâ. His message to the president, he says, is âfirstly, welcome"" - but, ""secondly, our public services
will not be included in in any trade deal with the United States. Our NHS is
not for sale and weâre not going to allow the extension of medicine patents
that will push up drug prices in this country"". Read our full story here. Mr Corbyn says this 451-page dossier showing initial talks between the UK and the US proves the NHS is ""for sale"" It's that time of the evening again - we've been sent the first of Tuesday's front pages. The Financial Times splashes with a picture of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, at Guildhall Yard, London, to honour the victims off the London Bridge terror attack. The faces of Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn are all over the i's front page, too, in a busy collage of headlines and articles. ""The media won't decide this election,"" the paper says. The Christian Peoples Alliance is anti-abortion The Christian Peoples Alliance is fielding 29 candidates
across the UK. The centrepiece of its manifesto is a pledge to give all
newly-weds a Â£12,000 grant when they marry and a further Â£6,000 on the birth or
adoption of their first child. Opposite sex couples only would be eligible for the
financial support. The move would be funded by a new Â£3bn annual sales tax on
high-tech companies. On Brexit, the party supports another referendum but not
until five years after the UK has left the EU. It says the UKâs decision to
leave must be honoured but there should be a âmechanismâ to go back if the UK
does not make a success of leaving. Other pledges include:  The party's leader Sid Cordle has also vowed to maintain the partyâs
âuncompromisingâ anti-abortion stance â by repealing the 1967 law legalising
abortion and giving full legal protection to the unborn child. You can readthe Christian Peoples Alliance manifesto here,external- and ourfull policy guide comparing various parties' pledges here. Swaledale, Yorkshire The partyâs manifesto, entitled Yorkshire Deserves Better,
calls for a radical shake-up in the relationship between Westminster and
Yorkshireâs 5.4 million residents. Its main goal is a new devolved assembly for the region,
which it says would empower business and end the current situation where
Yorkshire is left fighting for âscraps from the tableâ. Transport is a key focus, with a pledge to build a new
ânorthern powerhouseâ railway line linking Hull, York, Leeds, Bradford and
Sheffield with Newcastle, Liverpool and Manchester. Other pledges include:  The party, which is fielding 28 candidates this time, did
not campaign either way in the Brexit referendum. While it says the Leave vote must be honoured, it wants to
maintain a close economic relationship with the EU and as few barriers to trade
as possible. Party leader Chris Whitwood says the possibility of the UK
joining the European Free Trade Association in the future should not be ruled
out, while the UKâs exit provides an opportunity for powers repatriated from
Brussels to be handed to the region. You can readthe Yorkshire Party's manifesto here,external- and ourfull policy guide comparing various parties' pledges here. Formed by a breakaway group of Labour and Conservative MPs
in February, the party is fielding only three candidates after other key
figures either joined the Lib Dems or decided to retire. The trio â former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, former
Tory minister Anna Soubry and ex-Labour MP Mike Gapes â say they are flying the
flag for âcentre ground valuesâ and a politics rooted in âfairness,
responsibility, truthfulness, opportunity and long-termismâ. Their nine-page policy statement, entitled 2020 Vision For
Change, has at its heart a commitment to hold another Brexit referendum and to
campaign to remain in the EU. Rather than publishing an âexhaustiveâ manifesto, the party
says the abbreviated document contains only policies that are âcompelling,
appropriate and deliverableâ and reflect its values. Its pledges include:  If it succeeds in returning MPs to Westminster, TIG says it
will push for cross-party working âto become the normâ in Parliament and
challenge the âcartelâ of the big parties over election rules. You can readTIG's manifesto here,external- and ourfull policy guide comparing various parties' pledges here. Now that Mr Corbyn's Labour rally and Mr Johnson's Conservative event are over, let's take a look at some of the smaller parties you might not have heard so much about in the election campaign so far. Over the next few minutes we'll profile the Yorkshire Party, the Christian Peoples Alliance and the Independent Group for Change. There's a big cheer from the Conservative-supporting crowd when Johnson says his âget Brexit doneâ line for the first time in this speech. He then moves on to compare the various plans his party has for the country if it wins a majority on 12 December. He says the Tories' understanding of the UK economy is why ""this party is more trusted on health now, and on education, than the Labour Party"". He continues to lay into Labour's record on the economy. ""It would be comical if it weren't so tragic,"" he adds, attacking the spending pledges made in the opposition's main campaign. On education, Mr Johnson says the choice is ""stark"". ""You can come with us - a party that supports fantastic education for every pupil. Or go with Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party who actually want to abolish Ofsted."" You can view the main policies of the Conservative and Labour parties - as well as the other main parties in this election - in our policy guide here. The PM's speech is littered with metaphors as usual - this ""dog in the manger"" Parliament is like a bus ""slap bang in the middle of the yellow box junction, stopping the traffic in every direction"". He says the people of this country are like the ""AA"" - they will fix the broken-down country. ""And we can do it... in just 10 days' time, we can get out of the rut we've been in for the last three and a half years [since the EU referendum],"" he adds. He's applauded as he says that once Brexit is delivered, a Tory government will bring in legislation to stop the automatic early release of serious and violent offenders - ""not to speak of terrorists"" he adds. This line comes after the PM faced criticism for what some have called ""politicising"" Friday's London Bridge attack, where a convicted terrorist stabbed two people to death. Mr Corbyn says he wants to ""lead a government that is serious about
dealing with injustices"". He says he has been asked whether the country can afford Labour's manifesto promises. ""Are you sure the country cannot afford it?"" he says he replied. ""Unless we invest for the future where will the jobs of
tomorrow be?"" He goes on to talk about the NHS, calling it ""Labourâs greatest achievement"". He says he has ""studied"" the papers that detail meetings the UK government has been having with the US Department of Trade in the last two years. ""Itâs frightening,"" he says. ""They are discussing extending the patents on medicines for
export to the British market. ""Discussing access to our health service by American pharmaceuticals and others."" He adds: ""My simple message to Donald Trump and Boris Johnson is - our NHS is not for sale."" Here's our Reality Check on what those documents tell us about the talks. Mr Corbyn criticises the ""abuse thrown at people"" campaigning for Labour and the ""media investigations into them"". ""When they go low and attack us with personal abuse and the rest of us,"" he says. ""When they go low we go high. ""We are better than them."" You may recognise these words - they were first utteredin the 2016 US presidential campaign by former first lady Michelle Obama,externalwho said this when talking about Hillary Clinton's detractors. In a schedule clash that's keeping us busy, the prime minister is on stage in Colchester at the same time as Mr Corbyn is in Hastings. Mr Johnson is speaking at a rally in the Tory-held seat in northern Essex. He starts by thanking his supporters for all the campaigning they've helped with. ""We had no choice"" but to have an election, he says, blaming the poll on the ""Brexit-blocking Parliament"". His speech follows words from his close allies, party chairman James
Cleverly and Home Secretary Priti Patel. The
Conservatives held the Colchester seat in 2017 with 5,677 more votes than
second-placed Labour. You can see a list of all of the candidates in the constituency here. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn begins his speech in the marginal seat Hastings & Rye, in Sussex. He says he has been asked what his priorities are. ""My absolute priority is dealing with the situation facing rough sleepers and the homeless,"" he says. ""There is something morally wrong about a wealthy country that tolerates people sleeping rough."" Labour lost out to the Tories by a mere 346 votes in Hastings & Rye in the 2017 election. You can see a list of all of the candidates in the constituency here. Our political correspondent's thoughts from the Tory campaign bus... Ben WrightBBC political correspondent Itâs an old story but Iâll tell it anyway. During the 1964
general election campaign Harold Wilson was trumpeting his support for the navy at a
vast public meeting in the dockyard town of Chatham. âAnd why am I saying all
this?"" he asked rhetorically. ""Because you're in Chatham!â shouted a
voice from the crowd. A famously fine heckle from an era where prime ministers
had to contend with the electorate face to face. They still do from behind
their TV studio podiums of course but the public meeting and town centre
walkabout has mostly gone. Weâre 10 days from polling day and from my perch in
the Tory campaign Iâve yet to hear a heckle. Not one. Today Boris Johnson
turned up at a deserted cruise liner terminal at Southampton docks to plug his
partyâs policies for border control after Brexit. He chugged around the quiet
port in a boat and did a quick television interview on his response to Fridayâs
terror attack before heading off to a rally for Tory activists
this evening. The PM was in and out before the cityâs voters
twigged he was there. Itâs the same wherever Mr Johnson goes. The Conservative
campaign feels efficient, focused and sterile. Clips for broadcasters are
provided, Tory social media content is recorded and pictures of the prime minister in different bits of Britain are taken that will appear online and in
tomorrowâs newspapers. But spontaneous encounters between the PM and the general public hardly ever happen. Itâs now impossible to imagine Boris Johnson copying John Majorâs 1992
campaign and plunging into the crowd to argue his case. During the 2016
referendum, Mr Johnson seemed to relish the chaotic cut and thrust of town to
town campaigning but thereâs none of that now. The Tory battle bus still
ploughs up and down the countryâs motorways carrying the media from one event
to the next but it feels the real electioneering is happening somewhere else. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Child life expectancy projections cut by years,"Years have been knocked off official projections of children's life expectancies in the UK, an Office for National Statistics (ONS) report shows. A baby girl born in 2019 is now expected to celebrate three fewer birthdays on average, than under previous calculations. Official 2014 data thought that girl would make it to 93.6. Now the figure is 90.4. The report also slashed the likelihood of children reaching 100. Although life expectancies have been and are still improving, experts say previous estimates were too high. The improvement is much smaller than previously thought, as part of a widely acknowledged slowdown in life expectancy since 2011. In 2018, life expectancy growth stalledfor the first time in more than 30 years. This has led statisticians to re-evaluate their assumptions about future improvements in life expectancy, resulting in the figures released today. The ONS report calculates,externalthe impact of this less-rosy picture on children's prospects of a long life. So a boy born in 2019 is now expected to live for 87.8 years. But the 2016 data thought he would reach 89.7 and the 2014 data said 91.1. And looking to the future, to children born in 2043, there is a dramatic drop in the chances of reaching 100. The latest report says: 20.8% of newborn boys are expected to reach 100 26.1% of newborn girls are expected to reach 100 But the projections two years ago thought: 34.1% of newborn boys would reach 100 40.2% of newborn girls would reach 100 The ONS said: ""There has been considerable public debate about the causes of the slowdown in life expectancy improvements. ""Researchers have suggested a range of possible explanations for the slowdown... several factors are at play, none of which can be singled out as being the most important with any certainty."" Many reports,including by Public Health England,externalandthe Health Foundation,externalthink tank, have attempted to get to the bottom of the issue. Why aren't we living longer? A lack of a recent blockbuster moment in medicine could be an issue. Life expectancy in the 20th Century improved with the creation of the NHS, falls in smoking, childhood immunisation (the last case of polio in the UKwas in 1984,external) and medical advances particularly for the big killers - heart disease, stroke and cancer. But now dementia is listed as the leading cause of death and it is incurable. Dementia: The greatest health challenge of our time Public Health England says a more elderly population - with dementia and other long-term health problems - may also be more vulnerable to diseases like flu. But there are issues affecting life expectancy well before old age. Deaths from drug misuse, with Scotland having the highestdrug death rate in the EU, are also quoted. One of the most politically charged questions has been around austerity - the programme of government cuts that coincides with the slowdown in life expectancy. The evidence either way is hotly contested. But Public Health England's report says the poorest people have felt the impact on life expectancy the hardest and that ""could indicate a role for government spending"". Follow Jameson Twitter,external. Stalling life expectancy in the UK has attracted plenty of attention from academics, but they offer no definitive answers on the causes. When you are talking about shifts in predictions of lifespans, it needs more than a few years of data. But there is concern about why it's a different story to that in most other developed economies. An analysis by the ONS last year concluded that the slowdown in life expectancy growth in the UK since 2011 was one of the largest of the countries analysed. That's led to speculation on UK specific factors. Cuts in government spending in the policy period dubbed by some as ""austerity"" might, according to some commentators, have been a factor. It's worth noting, though, that cuts in social care in England were not replicated to the same extent in other parts of the UK. The decline in living standards and the reduced ability of some households to pay for heating and food in the decade since the financial crisis in 2008 have also been mentioned. The gap between life expectancy in the richest and poorest neighbourhoods in England has increased according to research last year. Ministers have strongly denied that Government policy played a part. The debate will continue though it may take a while before firm trends and causes can be identified. Why aren't we living longer?

US readies retaliation to French tech tax,"The Trump administration is threatening to slap import taxes on $2.4bn worth of French goods, including cheese, champagne, make-up and handbags. The planned tariffs come in response to a new French digital services tax that would affect companies including Google, Amazon and Facebook. France, along with several other European countries, wants to limit the tech giants' ability to avoid taxes. But trade officials in Washington say US firms are being unfairly targeted. French minister Bruno Le Maire called the US threat to impose tariffs in response to the tax ""unacceptable"" and suggested France would be prepared to retaliate. France has long been concerned that US technology giants are avoiding taxes in the European Union. France says taxes should be based on where the digital activity - browsing the page - takes place, not where firms have their headquarters. It is not the only country to raise concerns and a group of nations are drawing up new multilateral rules via the OECD. But France does not want to wait for that to bear fruit, so this summer drew up its own tax. It is imposing a 3% tax on any digital company with revenue of more than â¬750m ($850m; Â£670m), of which at least â¬25m is generated in France. The tax will be back-dated to early 2019, and is expected to raise about â¬400m this year. About 30 companies are expected to pay it, mostly US firms such as Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon has already responded by raising fees for French businesses by 3%. Robert Lighthizer, the US Trade Representative (USTR), has publisheda list of French products that could face tariffs,external, including champagne and sparkling wine, Roquefort and other cheeses, make-up, handbags, and homeware such as porcelain and bone china. Some of the tariffs are as high as 100% of the import price, and are likely to push up the price of these products for US consumers. However, before the tariffs are confirmed, there will now be what the US calls a period for public comment, including a hearing in Washington in January. The US says the French tax unfairly targets some US multinationals. Mr Lighthizer said the threat of tariffs  was intended to deter other countries from taking similar steps. The trade official said the move ""sends a clear signal that the United States will take action against digital tax regimes that discriminate or otherwise impose undue burdens on US companies"". Mr Lighthizer warned that the US intended to look into digital taxes introduced by Austria, Italy and Turkey. US attacks UK plan for digital services tax on tech giants France tech tax: What's being done to make internet giants pay more? A digital sales tax has long been on the UK agenda too. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's flagship election pledge -to give every home and business in the UK free full-fibre broadband by 2030- was to be funded, at least in part, by a tax on ""multinationals"". In the party's press release about the plans last month, ""Amazon, Facebook and Google"" were mentioned specifically. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also backed the idea, calling out the so-called ""FAANG"" stocks - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google - as paying ""virtually nothing"". The Tory manifesto pledges its own Digital Services Tax to fund improvements in broadband infrastructure, among other things. Both leaders are capitalising on the growing momentum in Europe to tax tech firms based on their sales in a country - rather than profits, which are often funnelled through counties with a lower tax rate, such as Ireland. But while promising a ""Google tax"" sounds great on the campaign trail, it only strengthens the view in Washington that American success stories are being unfairly targeted. And the move today suggests the US is ready to start fighting back. Here's what might happen next: France has said it would drop its digital tax if Europe could, as a bloc, come up with an alternative that's consistent across the Union; a strength-in-numbers move that would be more difficult for the US to counteract. But the UK, post-Brexit, would be on its own - and needs to stay in Washington's good graces. The US reaction to France's digital services tax suggests it would not go down well if the UK were to follow suit. Earlier this year, US firms were at pains to make it clear to the US Trade Representative that any such UK digital tax would be a big concern for them, with some even suggesting it would need to be dealt with before trade negotiations could go ahead. The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam says the issue has split the UK government, with some in the current cabinet believing the tech tax would be an obstacle to a future US trade deal. While the matter has not yet been openly discussed, in the recently leaked trade documents UK negotiators clearly anticipate that the issue would emerge during later parts of the process. The US technology sector has welcomed the Trump administration's tougher stance, although it still hopes for a negotiated settlement before the tariffs are imposed. Jennifer McCloskey, vice-president for policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include the major US tech firms, said the French tax was ""discriminatory"" and welcomed the USTR's ""strong trade response"". However, the US move has unnerved investors. Mr Lighthizer's comment that he sees the French tax as part of a ""growing protectionism of EU member states,"" raised concerns that this latest spat could be part of a wider trade war with the EU that has drawn in car companies and planemaker Airbus. Shares in leading French luxury-goods companies fell on Tuesday, with LVMH, Kering and Hermes down 1.4% to 1.5% in early trading. Some US business lobby groups have warned against tariffs because of fears of escalating another trade fight, despite their opposition to the French law. The US Chamber of Commerce, for example, had said tariffs ""may elicit additional rounds of retaliatory measures that represent a substantial risk to US economic growth and job creation"".

Triple killer not guilty of murder due to insanity,"Alexander Lewis-Ranwell was arrested twice in the two days before he killed the three men A man who killed three elderly men because he wrongly believed they were paedophiles has been cleared of murder. Exeter Crown Court heard Alexander Lewis-Ranwell battered his victims - all in their 80s - with a shovel and a hammer in a ""whirlwind of destruction"". He has paranoid schizophrenia and was having delusions about saving girls from a paedophile ring, jurors heard. The 28-year-old was found not guilty by reason of insanity after jurors decided he ""did not know it was illegal"". Twins Richard and Roger Carter, 84, and Anthony Payne, 80, werebludgeoned on 10 February. The court heard Lewis-Ranwell was arrested and released by police twice in the lead-up to the killings. The man who killed three times after police bailed him He began the first fatal attack just three hours after he had been released from police custody, where he had been held for wounding a farmer with a saw. It was his second arrest in the space of 24 hours and came just seven hours after he was arrested over an attempted burglary at another farm. Anthony Payne was killed at his home near Exeter St David's station Three psychiatrists agreed Lewis-Ranwell was insane when he battered his victims. But the prosecution had argued the defendant bore some responsibility for what happened. The court heard evidence of Lewis-Ranwell's interaction with various health professionals during his three spells in custody between 8 and 11 February. After his first arrest, on 8 February, his mother phoned police expressing ""grave concerns should he be released"" but he was charged and bailed. Following his second arrest, at about 16:00 on 9 February, a police inspector reviewing his detention found he ""potentially presents as a serious risk to the public if released"". Two-and-a-half hours later, a forensic medical examiner - a doctor employed by G4S Health Services - deemed Lewis-Ranwell was not ""acutely unwell"" and a full mental health assessment was not carried out. This video can not be played Stasys Belevicius says Alexander Lewis-Ranwell attacked him at the hotel he was managing Lewis-Ranwell was released from Barnstaple police station at about 09:30 on 10 February and travelled to Exeter. He entered Mr Payne's home at about 12:30 and bludgeoned the pensioner to death with a rusty hammer. Less than three hours later he scaled the wall of the Carter brothers' home in Cowick Lane, took a spade from the garden and beat them both to death with it. After his final arrest the defendant told a psychiatrist at Broadmoor secure hospital: ""I cannot believe no-one helped me - they let me out twice when I was unwell."" In sentencing, Mrs Justice May described the case as ""disturbing... on so many levels - three dead, two injured at the hands of someone floridly psychotic at the time and therefore not criminally responsible"". She said she would be making a hospital order with restrictions to ensure Lewis-Ranwell ""won't be allowed into the community until agencies are absolutely content it is OK for him to be released"". The judge informed the court that, prior to returning their verdicts, the jury had passed her a note raising concerns about the ""state of psychiatric services in Devon and the failings in care in Alexander Lewis-Ranwell's case"". Lewis-Ranwell caught on CCTV on the day of the killings In a statement, the head of custody for G4S Health Services, Jon Allen, said the company ""stood by their decision"" that ""Lewis-Ranwell was not suicidal and did not meet the requirements of a full Mental Health Act assessment in the out-of-hours period"". Head of major crime at Devon and Cornwall Police, Det Supt Mike West, said: ""We fully accept our responsibilities to look after those detained in our custody units. ""However, it is unreasonable to suggest that police officers or staff, in these circumstances, should have over-ridden decisions made by those who are trained, qualified and skilled in health care."" Following the trial Mr Payne's family said they were ""still profoundly shocked"" and described the victims as ""gentle, kind and caring gentlemen"". The family of the Carter brothers said they were ""quiet"" twins who ""loved the outdoors, wildlife and bird watching"" and ""were born, lived and died at the house in Cowick Lane"".

'Cruel' Super Bowl bomb hoaxer jailed,"Andreas Dowling admitted 30 counts of communicating false information with intent at a previous hearing A computer enthusiast who made 107 hoax bomb threats to targets including schools, the Palace of Westminster and the Super Bowl, has been jailed. Andreas Dowling from Torpoint, Cornwall admitted 30 counts of communicating false information with intent. He was sentenced at Exeter Crown Court to four years and five months. Judge Mrs Justice May said the 24-year-old's actions were ""pernicious and nasty"" and calls targeting Jewish schools were racially motivated. Dowling made threats to about 70 schools in the UK, affecting more than 44,000 pupils, and various locations in the US and Canada. He was fascinated by computers from the age of six and studied network and software development at Cornwall College. The court was told he also had a good knowledge of security systems. His motivations varied and included racism, punishing the US Government for perceived corruption, and closing schools for pupils in return for payment, the court heard. He lived with his mother and used software to disguise his voice. In 2015 he made repeated bomb threats to the Super Bowl in Arizona but the event went ahead. The following year he targeted the Palace of Westminster - his only non-education target in the UK - saying a bomb was attached to a parked vehicle and there was 30 minutes to evacuate, but it was correctly identified as a hoax. The court heard Jewish schools were ""over-represented"" as targets in the UK-based hoaxes and were selected ""based on racial or religious identity of the students"". The prosecution said threats to the Jewish schools referred to bombs going off at ""4.20pm"", which was a reference to Adolf Hitler's birthday of April 20. Sentencing, Mrs Justice May said: ""One has only to imagine the extreme anxiety head teachers must have felt receiving news of a bomb threat and how pernicious and cruel it was to make those calls"".

Why Estonian pupils shine in global testsEstonian teenagers are among the top performers in the OECD's influential Pisa education rankings.Family & Education,"This video can not be played Why do Estonian children start school at seven years old? Estonia is Europe's newest education powerhouse. It outperforms the major European economies, including the UK, in influential global education tests. These Pisa tests measure the ability of 15-year-olds to apply their skills and knowledge to real-life problem-solving in reading, maths and science. The OECD has run the tests since 2000, and most middle and higher income countries take part. The latest results are published on Tuesday. In the Pisa results published in 2016, Estonia came third in science while the UK was ranked 15th, and in reading Estonia was ranked sixth - far above the UK's 22nd place. UK spending on education is relatively high compared to the average across larger economies,  but the same is not true of this small Baltic state. Estonia has made high quality early years education a priority. It's drop-off time at Kelmikula kindergarten in the capital, Tallinn. Mums Kristin Talvik and Elvira Uustalu both have six-year-old children in the oldest group. That means they'll start compulsory schooling next year at the age of seven, so parents rely on kindergarten to get them ready. ""It's very important because learning will be so fast. He'll need to ask teachers questions, raise his hand, be brave"" says Kristin. ""The most important thing is that he is socially ready. "" Almost every child in Estonia comes to Kindergarten from the age of three, or even earlier. Parents have to make a contribution, but it is capped as a proportion of the minimum wage. So, for these Tallinn mums Kristin and Elvira, that means up to â¬80 (Â£70, $90) a month per child. Kindergartens expect children to learn through play directed by teachers, with some more formal learning gradually introduced. Elvira tells me education is important but ""it's also important to do it in a way that they enjoy"". This is where Estonia begins to level up the attainment of all children, by making sure as many as possible are emotionally and physically ready to learn. That result, according to the Pisa tests, in a smaller gap between rich and poor by the time they're teenagers. The kindergarten manager, Riina Lall, says they don't grade children against tests when they leave. This video can not be played Branwen Jeffreys explains what Pisa results are ""The children get a school readiness card describing their skills, their development and what more they need to do."" It is a world away from England, where at a similar age children are getting ready for their first national tests in Years 1 and 2. Pupils sit phonics tests in Year 1 and standardised tests in reading, writing and maths in Year 2. The results for the Year 2 tests are no longer used for league tables, and from 2023 they will be optional. In the meantime it's not unusual for a six or seven-year-old to be sent home with past test papers to practise. Estonia's system is quite different, but by the age of 15 its students are significantly outperforming the UK in every single subject domain of the Pisa tests. In Estonia the universal basic education is in schools where pupils stay from age 7 to 16, with some students staying on to prepare for higher study. Rando Kuustik, is the principal of Jakob Westholmi Gumnaasium in the Estonian capital, with almost 1,000 pupils and around 80 staff. ""If you teach them by different level of abilities you segregate them. Why would we do that in schools?"" Estonian pupils have performed well in previous Pisa tests He's explaining to me why every subject in his school is taught in all-ability classes. Putting students in different groups by subject or overall attainment, known as sets or streams in the UK, is very rare in Estonia. Teachers are expected to find ways of levelling up pupils from all backgrounds within a couple of years. There is a national curriculum, but relatively few measures to hold schools to account through results. Could subjects soon be history in Finland? Why do Finnish pupils succeed with less homework? Teachers have a relatively high level of freedom to take risks in how they design lessons, says Rando Kuustik. ""I think the teachers are the main reason why we are doing so well, with the freedom to make their lessons, and the students are eager to learn. "" When Estonia regained independence from Russia, it looked to its neighbour Finland for education ideas. Minister for Education and Research Mailis Reps says they have aimed for a Nordic level of equity, and that has a cost. Apart from kindergarten, parents are not expected to contribute. ""Free in Estonia really means free. You don't pay for textbooks, you don't pay for the school lunches, you don't pay for school transportation."" Education, the minister argues, has always been valued in Estonia, but now it is in the context of an entrepreneurial and fast-growing economy. ""So what we have today is a tradition to study a lot, a little bit like Asian countries. We study for many many hours."" That means a lively and continuing debate among parents about whether there is too much homework. Back at the school, that striving culture is clear when I sit down for lunch with some older students. They are growing up in an economy where digital innovation is at the forefront. Voting in general elections is now online. Segregation warning for Estonian capital Rats trip up Estonia's e-economy How Estonia became E-stonia Martin explains they have an e-school system, by which he means a lot of their homework is done and graded online. Books are borrowed electronically too, which helps with the large amount of work they expect to do at home. ""As a small country, maybe we have a feeling that we need to prove ourselves. We have to be educated to get on,"" says Katja. There are changes underway. The government is trying to persuade more schools to test pupils at the ages of 10, 13 and 16 to track their progress. It will have to balance this against the very high level of freedom that schools have now. There are challenges too. Many of Estonia's teachers are nearing retirement age and, despite a big recruitment push, not enough are joining the profession. In a system that values its teachers highly, it is the biggest risk to maintaining the remarkable progress its made. What are PISA results? Video, 00:01:09What are PISA results?

Corbyn: No US trade deal unless NHS is excluded,"This video can not be played President Trump talks about the UK's National Health Service Donald Trump has insisted the US wants ""nothing to do"" with the NHS in post-Brexit trade talks as he sought to repudiate opposition claims that the health service would be ""up for sale"". On a visit to the UK, the US President claimed he had no interest in increased market access to the NHS for US firms even if handed on a ""silver platter"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he still had ""very serious concerns"". And the SNP said MPs should pass a law to exclude the NHS from discussions. Boris Johnson said the Conservative election manifesto had ""categorically ruled out"" any NHS services, or drug prices, being up for negotiation. In June,the US president suggested the health service would form part of negotiationsover a possible future trade deal after the UK leaves the EU, saying: ""When you're dealing in trade, everything is on the table."" Live: Latest from the campaign trail Donald Trump arrives in UK for Nato summit Row over Labour's 'NHS for sale' claim Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? But speaking on Tuesday morning as he and other world leaders prepared for a summit to mark the 70th anniversary of Nato, he issued a different message. ""I don't even know where that rumour started,"" he told journalists. ""We have absolutely nothing to do with it. If you handed it [the NHS] to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it."" Mr Trump's visit comes at hugely sensitive time, with less than 10 days to go before the election - and with the issues of Brexit and the NHS having largely dominated the campaign so far. The US President insisted he would be ""staying out"" of the election. While he remained a ""fan of Brexit"" and thought Mr Johnson was ""very capable"", he said he would be prepared to ""work with anybody"" in No 10. This video can not be played Corbyn: ""Our NHS will not be put up for sale to anybody"" This video can not be played Jo Swinson: Trump is ""not someone who shares our values"" In October, he suggested Mr Corbyn would be ""bad"" for the UK and declined an offer to meet the Labour leader during his state visit. Mr Corbyn has repeatedly claimed that the NHS would be ""up for sale"" if the Conservatives hold onto power. At a campaign event last week, the Labour leader showed an unredacted report that gave details of meetings between US and UK officials. The document shows the US is interested in discussing drug pricing - mainly extending patents that stop cheaper generic medicines being used - and refers to the US policy of making ""total market access"" a starting point in any trade talks. The Labour leader welcomed Mr Trump's latest comments but said he was far from reassured by them. ""I'm pleased that he's said that but, if that's the case why have these talks gone on for two years?"" he told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show. ""Why have they been kept secret? I think there is very very legitimate grounds for very very serious concern here."" Mr Corbyn said if he was introduced to Mr Trump at a reception at Buckingham Palace later, which both are attending, he would impress on him how ""precious"" the NHS was to the British people and make clear a Labour government would discontinue trade talks if it was not excluded. On a trip to Salisbury, the prime minister described the opposition's claims as ""pure Loch Ness Monster, Bermuda triangle stuff"". ""I can categorically rule out any part of the NHS will be on the table in any trade negotiation... including pharmaceuticals."" And Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab suggested Labour was only raising the issue because it had ""no plan for Brexit and no plan for the economy"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Raab ruled out any privatisation of the NHS ""under the Conservatives' watch or this prime minister's watch"". Trade decisions would be made by the next government ""in the best interest of patients and consumers"", he added. This video can not be played Nigel Farage says Donald Trump should comment on the NHS The Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, said Mr Trump's comments should be taken ""with a lorry load of salt"". He added: ""Trump has repeatedly made clear in the past that everything including the NHS will be on the table in future negotiations."" Five things we learned from leaked trade papers And SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said its MPs would be pressing for legislation to ringfence the NHS from any involvement in a future deal. ""I don't want the future of our NHS to be dependent on trusting the word of Boris Johnson or Donald Trump,"" she said at a campaign rally in Perth. ""Let's have legislation that explicitly and in statute takes any risk of trade negotiations to the NHS away, and make absolutely clear that the NHS not just will not be on the table but could not be on the table in any trade negotiations."" Nigel Farage called on the US president to challenge the ""complete fib"" that the Tories would ""sell the NHS"" to him in a trade deal. ""He has been accused by the Labour Party of wanting to buy the National Health Service,"" the Brexit Party leader told BBC Breakfast. ""It isn't true, I know it isn't true, and I think it would be wholly appropriate for him to say that.""

Why has Wales under-performed in school tests?Pisa results will be published on Tuesday - what are they and why has Wales done poorly in the past?Wales,"The latest international test results for teenagers - Pisa - have been published. There is a keen eye on how students in Wales have performed, but why? Here is our guide. Pisa's full title is Programme for International Student Assessment - the main tests are in maths, reading and science and are run every three years by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Tests take about two hours and all are done on computer. In 2018, they were taken by 600,000 15-year-old pupils in 79 countries and regions. In the last results, Singapore outperformed all other participating countries. Japan, Estonia, Hong Kong and Canada were also among the top performers. This time around, four Chinese provinces finished top in all areas. This was the fifth time Wales has taken part - results in 2010 saw Wales slip below average performance in all three subject areas and was described by the then-education minister as ""unacceptable"" and ""alarming"".But the 2018 tests have brought improvements, if Wales is still trailing England in particular, of the other UK nations. Wales has moved closer to the international average. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""We have caught up, we are continuing to improve in all areas and as a nation we must be determined to keep up this momentum."" In reading, latest tests showed a significant increase in the scores of higher achieving pupils in Wales since 2015 but the scores of lower achieving pupils have not changed significantly. In science, back in 2015, there were 28 countries with mean scores higher than Wales; that figure is now 19 countries. The study also said Wales had made ""encouraging progress"" in mathematics, and was close to the OECD average for the first time. There is no single reason, but one factor identified by the OECD was the need improve the quality of teaching. Former education minister Leighton Andrews said the Welsh Government may have taken its ""eye off the ball"" in the 2000s when it scrapped testing and league tables. The report into the 2015 tests found only 6% of the variation in student performance in Wales could be put down to their socio-economic background. The results also showed Wales' highest performers were achieving lower scores than the OECD average and top performers in other parts of the UK. Andreas Schleicher, head of education and skills at the OECD, saidthe nation had under-performed and the education system had ""lost its soul"" by not focusing on high-quality teaching. He said reforms in Wales were on the right lines but it will take a while for these to have an impact. They have become an increasingly influential indicator of global education performance since they were introduced in 2000. Some argue that major businesses look at Pisa scores before making investment decisions, but there are plenty of sceptics who say too much emphasis has been placed on Pisa by politicians. There are also questions about how useful it is to compare 15-year-olds in such varied education systems and cultures across the world. In Wales, ministers have made improving Pisa scores a top priority over the past decade and said they tested the skills young people will need in future. 500-score Pisa target dropped in Wales Wales still worst in UK in world education tests What can Wales learn from Poland? A video was shown to pupils promoting ""team Wales"" and how to make a mark in education before the tests were sat last year Education is going through a period of major reforms, many of which have been influenced by Pisa. Some were introduced after the 2010 results, including a renewed focus on literacy and numeracy. There have also been changes to teacher training. Reformed GCSEsare also more aligned with the skills Pisa tests assess. The last results highlighted concerns more able and talented pupils were not being stretched so the Welsh Government has invested Â£3m to boost their performance. The biggest reform of all is theongoing development of a new curriculumwhich will be introduced in classrooms from 2022. The OECD welcomed the changes, but said improvements in results would take time. In 2015, Singaporean children scored on average 535 for reading - in Wales it was 477 In Singapore,which had the best performance last time, education expert Dr Pak Tee Ng said it was about resources and investment. ""It's not just about investing money, it is investing in teachers, investing in professional development, investing so that the schools will be places, safe places and places for children to learn and to grow,"" he said. ""Not only that, I think we play a lot of attention to making sure that we have a much more positive narrative of education. That is to say we would like people to know that good things are happening in the schools and to us teachers are nation builders. ""The right spirit for education should be that for the sake of our children, for the sake of our country, we will improve regardless of where we stand in international comparative tests."" When asked about creating a more positive narrative in Wales, Dr Pak said: ""Let's not make any international comparative tests into some kind of world cup - children's education is not about competition like a world cup of some sorts. ""I would say it is right and proper for any country to improve the education system with or without international comparative tests."" Prof Alma Harris, head of Swansea University's school of education, said: ""Pisa does exactly what it says on the tin. ""It looks at the performance of 15-year olds in three different subjects every three years but an education system is way more dynamic than that and therefore looking at issues of mental health in young people, well-being, inclusion, equity - these are all things that Pisa can't measure but they're very important to any education system - it's what gives it excellence and equity. ""So I'd say that Pisa is one dimension, one indicator that we should take account of - of course - policy-makers will take account of it whatever we say - but to recognise that it is really one very small indicator amongst many others that would give a more contextualised picture of how a system is performing. ""Pisa of itself is not problematic, it's what people do with Pisa and how they interpret Pisa and I think where it's been most unhelpful is where it's changed the policy discourse in a country, away from the way the country may have been going."" Prof Harris said Pisa was problematic if it distracted a country from reform and Wales was ""on a very clear reform trajectory.""

Martial arts expert 'killed man with two blows',"Mark Bloomfield died two days after being found injured outside a pub in Swansea A charity worker died after being struck by a martial arts expert with two ""ferocious"" blows following an argument in a pub, a court has heard. Mark Bloomfield, 54, who had previously worked as a special assistant to Mother Teresa, was found injured outside the Full Moon pub on the High Street in Swansea in July. He died two days later. Colin Payne, 61 and from the city, denies murder but has admitted manslaughter. Swansea Crown Court heard Mr Bloomfield had been sitting on a stool at the bar near Mr Payne and his partner. Man denies murdering charity worker The jury was shown CCTV of a can of alcohol Mr Bloomfield was holding touching the back of Mr Payne's partner, and Mr Payne is then seen arguing with Mr Bloomfield before grabbing him by the throat and throwing him to the floor. He then kicked him in the head ""for good measure"", prosecuting barrister Christopher Clee QC said. He told the jury it will be up to them to decide whether Mr Payne ""overreacted."" Mr Bloomfield is then seen sitting back in his seat while Mr Payne's partner attempts to keep him away from the charity worker. Mr Payne then follows Mr Bloomfield outside. A second CCTV clip shown to the jury showed Mr Bloomfield arguing with Mr Payne outside the premises. Mr Clee said the footage shows Mr Payne ""spoiling for a fight"" before ""delivering two powerful blows in quick succession to Mark Bloomfield's face"" which knock him to the ground. The court heard Mr Payne then returned to the pub while Mr Bloomfield was treated by paramedics. Mr Clee says it was ""immediately apparent"" Mr Bloomfield had sustained a ""very serious head injury"". ""Blood was coming from inside his nose, his mouth, and very significantly, his ear,"" Mr Clee said, adding he sustained a ""traumatic brain injury and multiple fractures across his face"". The incident took place in Swansea's High Street Mr Payne gave ""no comment"" answers during his first police interview but in the second he said he did not intend to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Bloomfield, the court heard. Mr Payne said he was ""acting in self-defence of another"" when he threw Mr Bloomfield to the floor and kicked him, ""inadvertently"" striking him on the head. He said Mr Bloomfield ""offered to fight me outside"" and, concerned he may have had a weapon such as a glass, followed him. In his statement, Mr Payne said he threw two punches as he thought Mr Bloomfield was about to strike him. Mr Clee said the claims of self defence were ""desperate attempts to cover up what he'd done"" and his ""martial arts expertise means he knew how to hurt somebody.""

Why Estonian pupils shine in global testsEstonian teenagers are among the top performers in the OECD's influential Pisa education rankings.,"This video can not be played Why do Estonian children start school at seven years old? Estonia is Europe's newest education powerhouse. It outperforms the major European economies, including the UK, in influential global education tests. These Pisa tests measure the ability of 15-year-olds to apply their skills and knowledge to real-life problem-solving in reading, maths and science. The OECD has run the tests since 2000, and most middle and higher income countries take part. The latest results are published on Tuesday. In the Pisa results published in 2016, Estonia came third in science while the UK was ranked 15th, and in reading Estonia was ranked sixth - far above the UK's 22nd place. UK spending on education is relatively high compared to the average across larger economies,  but the same is not true of this small Baltic state. Estonia has made high quality early years education a priority. It's drop-off time at Kelmikula kindergarten in the capital, Tallinn. Mums Kristin Talvik and Elvira Uustalu both have six-year-old children in the oldest group. That means they'll start compulsory schooling next year at the age of seven, so parents rely on kindergarten to get them ready. ""It's very important because learning will be so fast. He'll need to ask teachers questions, raise his hand, be brave"" says Kristin. ""The most important thing is that he is socially ready. "" Almost every child in Estonia comes to Kindergarten from the age of three, or even earlier. Parents have to make a contribution, but it is capped as a proportion of the minimum wage. So, for these Tallinn mums Kristin and Elvira, that means up to â¬80 (Â£70, $90) a month per child. Kindergartens expect children to learn through play directed by teachers, with some more formal learning gradually introduced. Elvira tells me education is important but ""it's also important to do it in a way that they enjoy"". This is where Estonia begins to level up the attainment of all children, by making sure as many as possible are emotionally and physically ready to learn. That result, according to the Pisa tests, in a smaller gap between rich and poor by the time they're teenagers. The kindergarten manager, Riina Lall, says they don't grade children against tests when they leave. This video can not be played Branwen Jeffreys explains what Pisa results are ""The children get a school readiness card describing their skills, their development and what more they need to do."" It is a world away from England, where at a similar age children are getting ready for their first national tests in Years 1 and 2. Pupils sit phonics tests in Year 1 and standardised tests in reading, writing and maths in Year 2. The results for the Year 2 tests are no longer used for league tables, and from 2023 they will be optional. In the meantime it's not unusual for a six or seven-year-old to be sent home with past test papers to practise. Estonia's system is quite different, but by the age of 15 its students are significantly outperforming the UK in every single subject domain of the Pisa tests. In Estonia the universal basic education is in schools where pupils stay from age 7 to 16, with some students staying on to prepare for higher study. Rando Kuustik, is the principal of Jakob Westholmi Gumnaasium in the Estonian capital, with almost 1,000 pupils and around 80 staff. ""If you teach them by different level of abilities you segregate them. Why would we do that in schools?"" Estonian pupils have performed well in previous Pisa tests He's explaining to me why every subject in his school is taught in all-ability classes. Putting students in different groups by subject or overall attainment, known as sets or streams in the UK, is very rare in Estonia. Teachers are expected to find ways of levelling up pupils from all backgrounds within a couple of years. There is a national curriculum, but relatively few measures to hold schools to account through results. Could subjects soon be history in Finland? Why do Finnish pupils succeed with less homework? Teachers have a relatively high level of freedom to take risks in how they design lessons, says Rando Kuustik. ""I think the teachers are the main reason why we are doing so well, with the freedom to make their lessons, and the students are eager to learn. "" When Estonia regained independence from Russia, it looked to its neighbour Finland for education ideas. Minister for Education and Research Mailis Reps says they have aimed for a Nordic level of equity, and that has a cost. Apart from kindergarten, parents are not expected to contribute. ""Free in Estonia really means free. You don't pay for textbooks, you don't pay for the school lunches, you don't pay for school transportation."" Education, the minister argues, has always been valued in Estonia, but now it is in the context of an entrepreneurial and fast-growing economy. ""So what we have today is a tradition to study a lot, a little bit like Asian countries. We study for many many hours."" That means a lively and continuing debate among parents about whether there is too much homework. Back at the school, that striving culture is clear when I sit down for lunch with some older students. They are growing up in an economy where digital innovation is at the forefront. Voting in general elections is now online. Segregation warning for Estonian capital Rats trip up Estonia's e-economy How Estonia became E-stonia Martin explains they have an e-school system, by which he means a lot of their homework is done and graded online. Books are borrowed electronically too, which helps with the large amount of work they expect to do at home. ""As a small country, maybe we have a feeling that we need to prove ourselves. We have to be educated to get on,"" says Katja. There are changes underway. The government is trying to persuade more schools to test pupils at the ages of 10, 13 and 16 to track their progress. It will have to balance this against the very high level of freedom that schools have now. There are challenges too. Many of Estonia's teachers are nearing retirement age and, despite a big recruitment push, not enough are joining the profession. In a system that values its teachers highly, it is the biggest risk to maintaining the remarkable progress its made. What are PISA results? Video, 00:01:09What are PISA results?

Donald Trump arrives in UK for Nato summit,"This video can not be played Reporters ask the US president his thoughts on the upcoming UK general election US President Donald Trump has said he could ""work with anybody"" in No 10 - nine days ahead of a general election. Speaking on a three-day visit to the UK, Mr Trump said he would ""stay out of the election"", that he was a ""fan of Brexit"" and he thought PM Boris Johnson was ""very capable"". Mr Trump is in the UK for a Nato summit being held in Watford on Wednesday. He attended a reception hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace and later went to an event at Downing Street. The US president's comments in a press conference came moments after he told reporters that he was staying out of the election on 12 December ""because I don't want to complicate it"". Trump and Macron clash at tense Nato summit Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing? Troubled Nato not in party mood for 70th birthday This video can not be played President Trump talks about the UK's National Health Service The US wanted ""absolutely nothing to do with"" the NHS, when asked if it would form any part of future trade talks. He said he wouldn't touch it even if it was handed to his administration ""on a silver platter"", adding: ""Never even thought about it, honestly"" He himself was ""a very easy person to work with"" The passersby who tackled a man during a ""terrible attack"" on London Bridge on Friday did ""an amazing job"". He said: ""I was very proud of those people who grabbed him"", referring toUsman Khan who killed two people and injured three othersbefore armed police shot him dead French President Emmanuel Macron was ""very disrespectful""for suggesting Nato was ""brain dead"" OnPrince Andrew stepping down from royal duties,he said: ""I don't know Prince Andrew, but that's a tough story, it's a very tough story."" The Duke of York has been facing questions over his ties to disgraced financierJeffrey Epstein.Mr Trumpmet the duke,externalon his last visit to the UK in June President Trump is visiting the UK to attend a Nato summit commemorating the 70th anniversary of the transatlantic organisation. He had a breakfast meeting with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the US ambassador's residence in London. Mr Trumpheld separate talkswith French President Emmanuel Macron. Later, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were kept waiting for around 40 minutes before the US president and First Lady Melania Trump arrived at the prince's residence, Clarence House, for afternoon tea. Mr Trump and his wife went on to join other Nato leaders and senior royals at a Buckingham Palace reception, hosted by the Queen. The first couple later attended a reception at Downing Street with other world leaders. Melania and Donald Trump had tea with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at Clarence House They later met the Queen at a Buckingham Palace reception It is unclear whether Mr Trump will hold a one-on-one meeting with Mr Johnson during his visit to the UK. The US president said he would be meeting the British prime minister during his visit, adding: ""I have meetings set up with lots of different countries"". Mr Johnson said he would be discussing Syria, Russia and China during discussions with Nato leaders. Boris Johnson at the reception at Buckingham Palace after hosting Mr Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at No 10 Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who held a meeting with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - said arrangements for such bilateral meetings were ""always quite fluid"". BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said the Conservatives' HQ is not keen on such a meeting ""to avoid pictures that could be used by his (Boris Johnson's) opponents"" in the upcoming general election. Mr Johnson and Mr Trump did speak on Saturday, when Mr Trump expressed his condolences after the London Bridge attack. There'll be an almighty shuddering sigh of relief reverberating around the walls of Downing Street. Because there was real apprehension in No 10 about exactly what the president might say. In fact, he's given Boris Johnson an almighty helping hand in this election. Most importantly, we heard Donald Trump seeking to counter what has become one of the main attack lines of the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn during this campaign, that if you re-elect Boris Johnson he will ensure that the NHS is on the table in trade talks with the US. And yet we heard Mr Trump being pretty unequivocal that he's not interested in the NHS, even if it was presented to him on a silver platter and also suggesting he didn't know why it was being raised as an issue, even though, in fact, it was Mr Trump who first raised it as an issue when he was here in June at a news conference saying everything should be on the table. Be that as it may, I think Team Johnson will be mightily relieved that he has, as it were, provided them with a get-out-of-jail-free card to Labour claims that the NHS would be on the table. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who called for Mr Trump to be treated ""with respect and politeness"" during his visit, wrote to Mr Trump ahead of his visit, demanding assurances that theNHS will be ""off the table""in any post-Brexit US-UK trade talks. Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Jeremy Vine show that he would seek assurances from Mr Trump at the Buckingham Palace reception later. What we learned from Trump's last visit to the UK ""I will say, look, welcome to this country. I hope you'll understand how precious our national health service is,"" he said. ""And in any future trade relationship with the USA, none of our public services are on the table, none of our public services are for sale."" Mr Trump has previously been criticised for voicing his opinions of British political leaders. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the UK and US  ""traditionally don't get involved in each other's elections"" The US president was warned against getting involved in the upcoming general election by Mr Johnson last week. Nigel Farage said it was ""awkward"" that his ""friend"", Mr Trump, had arrived during the election campaign, adding that he didn't intend to speak to him. The Brexit Party leader said if there were ""personal exchanges"", they would be ""purely personal"" and he would keep them private. Scotland Yard has saidroad closures will be in place in central London,externalduring the summit. Protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square, before heading to Buckingham Palace ahead of the reception for Nato leaders. BBC journalist Charlotte Gallagher, who was at the protest, said it was a real mixture of people ""but they all had one thing in common - an intense dislike of President Trump"". ""There were people with concerns about the future of the NHS, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, while others were demanding the release of Julian Assange."" She said she also spoke to several US tourists who decided to come to the protest to show how unhappy they were with their own president. The mother of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn was among the protesters. Mr Dunn's death has led to a diplomatic row between the US and UK after a suspect over his death returned to America, claiming diplomatic immunity. Charlotte Charles said the response from other protesters outside the palace to her campaign for justice had been ""heart-warming"". The Foreign Office said Mr Raab raised ""UK concerns"" about the case with his US counterpart at a meeting earlier. Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing?

Sinn FÃ©in hits out at DUP's 'crazy Brexit agenda',"Mary Lou McDonald attacked the DUP for its Brexit policy The Sinn FÃ©in president has accused the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of using its ""crazy"" Brexit agenda as a badge of honour at Westminster. Mary Lou McDonald was speaking at the unveiling of herparty's general election manifesto,externalin Londonderry. The party's 15-page document focuses mainly on Brexit and Irish unity. Addressing the manifesto event, Ms McDonald attacked the claim the solution to Brexit would only be found in the House of Commons. DUP 'will still seek changes' to Brexit deal A simple guide to Sinn FÃ©in What's at stake in Northern Ireland? ""The farce of a notion that you go into the house of chaos at Westminster... [with] Jacob Rees-Mogg as he reclines on the green benches and snoozes off is fanciful,"" she said. Sinn FÃ©in is the second largest party in Northern Ireland after the DUP and it secured seven MPs at the last general election in 2017. Its representatives do not take their seats at Westminster due to its policy of abstentionism. The party's core belief is that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should be united as a single independent republic. Sinn FÃ©in won in seven constituencies at the last Westminster election In its manifesto, Sinn FÃ©in claims credit for securing special status for Northern Ireland and no hardening of the Irish border. It also highlights other areas of focus related to the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, including protecting the Good Friday peace agreement and ensuring automatic re-entry to the EU through Irish unity. The manifesto features polls that the party says show the demand for Irish unity and it calls on the Irish government to prepare for a referendum on unity. Defending her party's abstentionism policy, Ms McDonald said Sinn FÃ©in's ""relentless representation"" had been heard in Dublin, Brussels and Washington and had helped shape the EU's negotiation. ""The voice of the north has been heard loud and clear - not only heard, it has been heeded and acted on,"" she said. Some of the party's key manifesto pledges include: Protect the Good Friday Agreement in future Brexit negotiations Continue push for Irish unity referendum Restore a credible Stormont executive Deliver an Irish language act and reform the petition of concern Implement theStormont House Agreement Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and the Green Party have reached a pact in the interestof boosting the anti-Brexit votein certain constituencies in the election. Defending her party's decision to stand aside in some constituencies, Ms McDonald said Brexit ""had the effect of uniting improbable allies amid real threats to people's livelihoods"". ""We have come together, set aside very significant political differences and said it is important that people use and lend and borrow votes from others to ensure that - loud and clear again - it is heard that the north has not consented to Brexit,"" she said. Ms McDonald also highlighted the party's desire to see a ""credible"" Stormont executive restored. Speaking at the manifesto event, Sinn FÃ©in's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said the Stormont parties faced the challenge of rebuilding the public's faith in politics. ""Confidence in politics in the north is broken and we need to rebuild that confidence,"" she said.

The US president said he would be meeting the British prime minister during his visit, adding: ""I have meetings set up with lots of different countries"". Mr Johnson said he would be discussing Syria, Russia and China during discussions with Nato leaders. Boris Johnson at the reception at Buckingham Palace after hosting Mr Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at No 10 Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who held a meeting with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - said arrangements for such bilateral meetings were ""always quite fluid"". BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said the Conservatives' HQ is not keen on such a meeting ""to avoid pictures that could be used by his (Boris Johnson's) opponents"" in the upcoming general election. Mr Johnson and Mr Trump did speak on Saturday, when Mr Trump expressed his condolences after the London Bridge attack. There'll be an almighty shuddering sigh of relief reverberating around the walls of Downing Street. Because there was real apprehension in No 10 about exactly what the president might say. In fact, he's given Boris Johnson an almighty helping hand in this election. Most importantly, we heard Donald Trump seeking to counter what has become one of the main attack lines of the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn during this campaign, that if you re-elect Boris Johnson he will ensure that the NHS is on the table in trade talks with the US. And yet we heard Mr Trump being pretty unequivocal that he's not interested in the NHS, even if it was presented to him on a silver platter and also suggesting he didn't know why it was being raised as an issue, even though, in fact, it was Mr Trump who first raised it as an issue when he was here in June at a news conference saying everything should be on the table. Be that as it may, I think Team Johnson will be mightily relieved that he has, as it were, provided them with a get-out-of-jail-free card to Labour claims that the NHS would be on the table. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who called for Mr Trump to be treated ""with respect and politeness"" during his visit, wrote to Mr Trump ahead of his visit, demanding assurances that theNHS will be ""off the table""in any post-Brexit US-UK trade talks. Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Jeremy Vine show that he would seek assurances from Mr Trump at the Buckingham Palace reception later. What we learned from Trump's last visit to the UK ""I will say, look, welcome to this country. I hope you'll understand how precious our national health service is,"" he said. ""And in any future trade relationship with the USA, none of our public services are on the table, none of our public services are for sale."" Mr Trump has previously been criticised for voicing his opinions of British political leaders. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the UK and US  ""traditionally don't get involved in each other's elections"" The US president was warned against getting involved in the upcoming general election by Mr Johnson last week. Nigel Farage said it was ""awkward"" that his ""friend"", Mr Trump, had arrived during the election campaign, adding that he didn't intend to speak to him. The Brexit Party leader said if there were ""personal exchanges"", they would be ""purely personal"" and he would keep them private. Scotland Yard has saidroad closures will be in place in central London,externalduring the summit. Protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square, before heading to Buckingham Palace ahead of the reception for Nato leaders. BBC journalist Charlotte Gallagher, who was at the protest, said it was a real mixture of people ""but they all had one thing in common - an intense dislike of President Trump"". ""There were people with concerns about the future of the NHS, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, while others were demanding the release of Julian Assange."" She said she also spoke to several US tourists who decided to come to the protest to show how unhappy they were with their own president. The mother of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn was among the protesters. Mr Dunn's death has led to a diplomatic row between the US and UK after a suspect over his death returned to America, claiming diplomatic immunity. Charlotte Charles said the response from other protesters outside the palace to her campaign for justice had been ""heart-warming"". The Foreign Office said Mr Raab raised ""UK concerns"" about the case with his US counterpart at a meeting earlier. Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing?

"Prince Andrew must testify in court, lawyer says","This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew have very different accounts of what happened in March 2001 - so how do they differ? Five women who accuse Jeffrey Epstein of abusing them say Prince Andrew witnessed how people were given massages at the sex offender's homes. The lawyer for the women has toldBBC Panoramahe plans to serve subpoenas to force the Duke of York to testify as a witness in all five cases. He says the prince could have important information about sex trafficking. The prince says he did not witness or suspect any suspicious behaviour during visits to Epstein's homes. Epstein took his own life in a jail cellin August, aged 66, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The lawyer for victims of the US financier, David Boies, said: ""One of the things that we have tried is to interview Prince Andrew and to try to get what his explanation is. He was a frequent visitor. They ought to submit to an interview. They ought to talk about it."" The subpoenas - court summonses to give testimony - have been prepared for all five cases and would have to be signed off by a judge once the prince was on US soil. He would then be able to challenge the subpoena in court if he did not want to give evidence. Another lawyer, Spencer Kuvin, who questioned Epstein a decade ago and now represents several of his unnamed alleged victims, made a personal plea for Prince Andrew to give a sworn testimony. ""Be a man, stand up for what you believe and what you're saying is the truth and come forward,"" said Mr Kuvin on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Kuvin said he is not planning to serve a subpoena but added: ""If he truly wants to help these victims, then step forward."" Letter casts doubt on when duke met Epstein Six things we learned from the duke's interview Panorama also uncovered new information about the infamous photo of Prince Andrew with his arm around 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre - then called Virginia Roberts. She said that she, the prince, Epstein and his then girlfriend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, went to Tramp nightclub in London. Ms Giuffre said that in the car on the way back ""Ghislaine tells me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey and that just made me sick"". When they got back to the house, she said she asked Epstein to take a picture of her to show her family. She then carried out the instructions to entertain the prince. ""Well there was a bath and it started there and then it led into the bedroom and it didn't last very long, the whole entire procedure. ""It was disgusting. He wasn't mean or anything, but he got up and he said thanks and walked out."" Prince Andrew emphatically denies any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Giuffre and says any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation. He said he has no recollection of ever meeting her. On Tuesday, lawyer Lisa Bloom - who represents five other Epstein accusers - told ITV's This Morning that she has a witness who says she was at Tramp nightclub on the night when the alleged incident happened, and ""saw Prince Andrew with Virginia"". ""She remembers it vividly because she was told 'this is a member of the Royal Family',"" said Ms Bloom. ""That was a very big thing to her, she was shocked and she saw Virginia there with him and so I'm going to take her to the FBI."" Virginia Giuffre describes how she asked Jeffrey Epstein to take this picture of her with Andrew The photo of them together was first published in 2011 after the Mail on Sunday tracked down Ms Giuffre and paid her $160,000 for her story. This year palace sources started suggesting the photo was a fake - but Prince Andrew stopped just short of that inhis interview with BBC Newsnight. He said: ""You can't prove whether or not that photograph is faked because it's a photograph of a photograph of a photograph."" ""It's very difficult to be able to prove it but I don't remember that photograph being taken. That's me but whether that's my handâ¦ I have simply no recollection of the photograph ever being taken."" The prince also said he thought he had never been upstairs in his friend Ghislaine Maxwell's house, where the photo appears to have been taken. But Ms Giuffre told Panorama the photo is genuine and she gave the original to the FBI in 2011. ""I think the world is getting sick of these ridiculous excuses. It's a real photo,"" she said. ""I've given it to the FBI for their investigation and it's an authentic photo. There's a date on the back of it from when it was printed."" She said the date on the back of the photo is 13 March 2001 - two days after she left London on her trip with Epstein and Ms Maxwell. Panorama also spoke to the freelance photographer Michael Thomas who first copied the picture in 2011. He is convinced the picture is genuine because he found it in the middle of a bundle of photos that Ms Giuffre handed him from her travels with Epstein and Ms Maxwell. He said: ""It was nothing sophisticated. These were 5x7 photos that looked like they had come from Boots the chemist. They were typical teenage snaps."" The programme also found evidence that supports Ms Giuffre's claim that she gave the original to the FBI. A redacted court document shows she gave 20 photos to the FBI in 2011 and they were scanned front and back. But there are only 19 photos shown in the public version. Panorama has been told the Prince Andrew photo was removed from the public document to protect his privacy. The news that five women say that Prince Andrew witnessed Epstein and his guests receiving massages and have prepared subpoenas should he travel to the US is bad for the prince on several fronts. He says he had at no time seen, witnessed or suspected suspicious behaviour at Epstein residences. This flatly contradicts that. The existence of subpoenas - court-backed demands for sworn testimony - makes any visit to the US by the prince vanishingly unlikely.  It's pretty extraordinary:  the Queen's second son is now effectively unable to travel to the US, unless he fancies being forced to give a deposition. The subpoenas can be challenged, but it would be a huge risk getting embroiled in the US legal system. This news, and the rest of the programme, with a powerful interview by Virginia Giuffre, puts Prince Andrew, his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and his denials, back into the spotlight. The controversy refuses to go away; instead, it grows. Another Epstein victim, Sarah Ransome told Panorama Ghislaine Maxwell, one of Prince Andrew's oldest friends, worked hand in hand with Epstein. ""Ghislaine controlled the girls. She was like the Madam,"" she said. ""She was like the nuts and bolts of the sex trafficking operation and she would always visit Jeffrey on the island to make sure the girls were doing what they were supposed to be doing. ""She knew what Jeffrey liked. She worked and helped maintain Jeffrey's standard by intimidation, by intimidating the girls, so this was very much a joint effort."" Ms Maxwell could not be reached for comment but has previously denied any involvement in or knowledge of Epstein's abuse. Allegations of sex abuse against her were first made  public in court documents in 2009, but Prince Andrew has maintained the friendship. Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell attended Ascot in June 2000. Panorama uncovered an email from 2015 which suggests he even asked for Ms Maxwell's help in dealing with Virginia Giuffre's claims. She was known at the time by her maiden name Virginia Roberts. In the email the prince told Ms Maxwell: ""Let me know when we can talk. Got some specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts."" She replied: ""Have some info. Call me when you have a moment."" Prince Andrew declined to answer Panorama's detailed questions but he said in a statement that he deplores the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour. ""The Duke of York unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein's suicide left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims. The duke deeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure. ""It is his hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. The duke is willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.""

"Boy, 12, killed in 'deliberate' hit-and-run crash","This video can not be played Ch Supt Tracey Harman: ""We believe that the collision was deliberate, and have launched a murder investigation"". A 12-year-old boy has died and five others were injured in a ""deliberate"" hit-and-run crash near a school. The crash happened near Debden Park High School in Loughton, Essex, at about 15:20 GMT. Two 15-year-old boys, a 13-year-old boy, a 16-year-old girl and a 53-year-old woman were also hurt but their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. Police have launched a murder inquiry and want to speak to Terry Glover, 51. Ch Supt Tracey Harman, of Essex Police, said officers were looking to speak to Mr Glover, from Loughton, ""in connection with the investigation"". Ms Harman said officers were investigating whether the crash was linked to ""another incident nearby"" and made a ""direct plea"" to Mr Glover to contact police. Allow Twitter content?

The force has appealed for help locating a silver Ford KA, with registration number LS08 OKW, which was ""likely to have damage to [its] front"" and failed to stop at the scene. It is thought all the injured children were also pupils at the school on Willingale Road. A 15-year-old boy who was hurt told the BBC he believed the driver had deliberately targeted the group. Speaking from an east London hospital, he said he was walking on the pavement with a friend when he heard a car revving behind him. He described how the Ford KA sped up, mounted the pavement and hit the pair of them, throwing his friend over the bonnet. The GCSE student, who is awaiting treatment for injuries to his arm, back, leg and head, said all those hit by the car were walking near to him. Police said there was likely to be a ""serious and prolonged investigation"" Debden Park'shead teacher Helen Gascoyne said,externalshe was ""devastated"" to confirm the boy who died was a student at the school. She said: ""It is with great sadness that we must report that a 12-year-old student from our school has sadly died. ""Our thoughts are with the family and all those affected....The school will be open tomorrow with a number of counsellors on hand to support our community."" Det Ch Insp Rob Kirby, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, called the crash ""truly shocking"" and appealed for dash-cam footage. ""I would like to thank the many members of the public who have called us with information and spoken to our officers, as well as those who provided crucial medical assistance at the scene,"" he added. Police have called the crash ""truly shocking"" Insp Rob Brettell said: ""We are trying to locate and find a silver Ford KA which is likely to have damage to the front of the car."" He urged anyone who has seen the car or knows where it is to contact the force, and said it was likely to be a ""prolonged and serious investigation"". Willingale Road cannot be accessed from junctions on either side of the school and the area remains cordoned off.

UK drivers fight for VW 'dieselgate' compensation,"Volkswagen ""cheated"" European emissions rules designed ""to save lives"" by installing unlawful ""defeat devices"" in diesel cars, the High Court has heard. Tens of thousands of UK motorists who bought VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda diesel cars are taking legal action in the aftermath of the ""dieselgate"" scandal. The claimants' QC Tom de la Mare said: ""It is difficult to think of a more obvious cheat than the one VW used."" Volkswagen has said it will ""defend robustly its position"". In 2015, VW admitted 11 million cars worldwide - including 1.2 million in the UK - had software that reduced readings of emissions in tests. However, the UK hearing, expected to last two weeks, centres on whether that software constitutes a ""defeat device"" under EU regulations. In his opening remarks, Mr de la Mare told the court that VW engines were ""optimised to minimise the amount of pollutants"" in emissions tests, meaning the vehicles operated in a ""completely different way in the street to how it operated in the test"". He added: ""It is difficult to think of a more obvious cheat than the one VW used."" Mr de la Mare said European emissions standards were designed ""to save lives"", adding that ""the most up-to-date evidence"" showed that pollution was ""killing approximately 1,000 people a day in Europe"". He said internal VW documents showed that the company has ""long known that the software was unlawful and indefensible"", pointing to one document in which a VW employee said the vehicles would ""flunk"" emissions tests without the software. He submitted that the documents showed a ""clear acceptance that the software was the only basis on which they were meeting the emissions limits"". VW's barrister, Michael Fordham QC, argued in written submissions that the claimants had misunderstood the legal definition of a defeat device. In a statement before the hearing, a VW spokeswoman said: ""Volkswagen Group continues to defend robustly its position in the High Court in London. ""It remains Volkswagen Group's case that the claimants did not suffer any loss at all and that the affected vehicles did not contain a prohibited defeat device."" Volkswagen has faced a flurry of legal action worldwide, and has been forced to pay out more than â¬30bn (Â£26bn) in fines, recall costs and civil settlements. The carmaker's current and former senior employees are facing criminal charges in Germany. The English litigation was filed back in 2016, but has now reached what the claimants' lawyers have called ""a decisive court battle"". Gareth Pope, head of group litigation at Slater and Gordon, which represents more than 70,000 of almost 90,000 claimants, said before the start of the hearing: ""This trial will establish once and for all whether VW installed prohibited 'defeat devices' in affected vehicles and is a significant milestone in our clients' attempts to hold VW accountable in the UK. ""This is a decisive point for VW. For years, the carmaker has deceived its customers, marketing cars as complying with emissions standards while all the time knowing they were emitting many times more than the allowed level of toxic pollutants, perpetrating an environmental and health scandal. ""VW has had plenty of opportunity to come clean, make amends and move on from this highly damaging episode. ""But instead it's chosen to spend millions of pounds denying the claims our clients have been forced to bring against it rather than paying that to their own customers in compensation."" One of the claimants, Brian Levine - who bought two affected Volkswagens - told the Press Association: ""VW's tactics have been to delay and prevaricate - anything but face a day when it would have to explain what this software did. Well, that day has finally come. ""More than four years after the emissions scandal broke, the tens of thousands of customers will be able to hold VW to account in a British court of law and expose its efforts to cheat us."" Buying a car is one of the big financial decisions we make. We pay a hefty price for a brand we trust and expect the specifications to be as promised. But VW argues that the drivers claiming they were fooled by a defeat device will not qualify for compensation whatever the merits of their case, because they haven't suffered a loss. And VW denies having a defeat device, anyway, despite findings against the carmaker in other countries. Waiting for a result from this case will feel like being trapped in the mother of all traffic jams. Lawyers involved are expecting the whole process could take two to three years.

I saw things I can't unsee - London Bridge witness,"This video can not be played Bryonn Bain was giving a workshop at Fishmongers' Hall when the attack began An American academic has given a graphic account of the moment the London Bridge stabbing attack began, saying it ""felt like a warzone"". Bryonn Bain told the BBC that victim Jack Merritt had been the first person to confront Usman Khan when he launched his knife assault during a prisoner rehabilitation conference on Friday. ""I saw people die, I saw things that I will never be able to unsee,"" he said. Vigils have taken placefor Mr Merritt, 25, and second victim Saskia Jones, 23. Two women and a man were also injured in the attack before Khan was shot dead by armed officers on London Bridge - the two women are still in hospital in a stable condition. Prof Bain said former offenders attending the University of Cambridge-linked conference ""stepped up and intervened"" to tackle Khan, and people at Fishmongers' Hall owed their lives to the actions of those who had previously spent time in jail. London Bridge: What we know Families lead tributes to London attack victims London Bridge victims mourned at vigil He said two men from his performance poetry workshop immediately ran towards shouts from elsewhere in Fishmongers' Hall in the City of London as the attack began, and as shouts grew louder he also went to assist. ""That's when I ran down and saw the scene unfolding there,"" he said. ""I was able to see the attacker."" He added: ""It felt like a warzone... it felt like total chaos."" This video can not be played The chief executive of Fishmongers Hall, Commodore Toby Williamson describes how his staff fought back Prof Bain said course co-ordinator Mr Merritt was ""the first line of defence"". ""I want to honour him,"" Prof Bain said of Mr Merritt. ""I want to honour his father's wishes which have been explicit to not have his life be used for political purposes to ramp up draconian policies, because that's not what he was about."" Mr Merritt's father criticised newspaper coverage of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge to review the early release of convicted terrorists. Writing in the Guardian,external, David Merritt says his son ""would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against"". The article calls for a justice system that focuses on rehabilitation, rather than revenge, and criticises indeterminate sentences, saying his son worked for ""a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key"". Jack Merritt was a co-ordinator of the Learning Together programme and Saskia Jones a volunteer Prof Bain added: ""I want to make sure that as much as possible that we uphold the heroes of the day, were formerly incarcerated people, some of the folks who are often easiest to dehumanise. ""They stepped up and many of the folks in that space would not be here today if it weren't for these guys who did time in prison and literally saved lives."" In other developments on Monday: Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended his response to the attackafter Mr Merritt's father criticised newspaper coverage of Mr Johnson's pledge to review the early release of convicted terrorists Mr Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn attended a vigil at the Guildhall near London Bridge to honour those caught up in the attack London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the best way to defeat the hatred shown in the attack was to focus on the values of hope, unity and love BBC News learned the attacker, Usman Khan, 28, had been under investigation by the security service MI5 since his release from prison last year, but given one of the lowest priorities. He had been convicted of a terrorism offence in 2012 As part of his release conditions, Khan was obliged to take part in the government's desistance and disengagement programme - which aims to rehabilitate those involved in terrorism Vigils for the victims of the attack were also held in Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University, which Ms Jones had previously attended. Mr Merritt and Ms Jones both studied for masters degrees at the University of Cambridge's institute of criminology and had been taking part in an event for itsLearning Together programme- which focuses on education within the criminal justice system - when they were killed. The family of Jack Merritt take part in a vigil at the Guildhall in Cambridge Mr Merritt, from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, was a co-ordinator of the Learning Together programme and Ms Jones, from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, a volunteer The victims' familiespaid tribute to their loved onesat the weekend. Ms Jones's family said their daughterhad a ""great passion"" for supporting victims of criminal justice. In a statement, Mr Merritt's family described him as a""talented boy"" who ""died doing what he loved"". Toby Williamson, chief executive of Fishmongers' Hall, praised the bravery of his staff who intervened to stop the attacker, hailing their actions as ""extraordinary things done by ordinary people"". Mr Williamson told how Polish chef Lukasz suffered five wounds to his left-hand side as he fended off the knifeman with a narwhal tusk during ""about a minute of one-on-one straight combat"" - allowing others time to escape danger. 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker A group of hall staff, ex-offenders, prison and probation staff are believed to have drawn Khan out on to London Bridge where he was subsequently shot dead by armed police. The Metropolitan Police said in an update on Monday night that detectives were continuing extensive inquiries but had so far found nothing to suggest other people were involved in the attack. Khan, who admitted preparing terrorist acts in 2012, was released from prison in December 2018 after serving half of his sentence. The BBC understands Khan was formally under investigation by MI5 as he left jail but placed in the second-to-bottom category of investigations as his initial risk to the public was thought to be minimal. This was consistent with the grading given to most other people convicted of terrorism offences as they go back into the community under a release licence. Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison? What is Learning Together? London Bridge sentencing row - who did what? A low level of prioritisation is assigned to offenders such as Khan because their release comes with a strict set of licence conditions. These conditions theoretically provide suitable monitoring and oversight, such as alerts if they contact other suspects or travel outside an approved area. Khan, the BBC has learned, was on the highest-level of such community monitoring. The overall package, in theory, relieves pressure on MI5 so the security service can focus on more immediate threats. Friday was the first time that Khan, who wore a GPS tag, had been permitted to travel to London since he left prison. The BBC has been told that - earlier in the year - Khan was refused permission to travel to Stoke-on-Trent, which is where he grew up, in order to attend a social event. The prime minister said on Sunday that74 people jailed for terror offences and released early would have their licence conditions reviewed.. Police said two terror-related arrests following Friday's incident, in Staffordshire and north London, were not directly connected to the London Bridge attack. It came after theUK's terrorism threat level was downgraded on 4 November from ""severe"" to ""substantial"", meaning that attacks were thought to be ""likely"" rather than ""highly likely"".

Prince Andrew accuser calls for public support,"This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre: ""I knew I had to keep him happy"" A US woman who says she was brought to Britain aged 17 to have sex with Prince Andrew has implored the British public to ""stand beside her"" and ""not accept what has happened to her"". Virginia Giuffre, one of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, says she was trafficked to London by Epstein in 2001. She describes how Epstein's girlfriend told her what ""to do for Andrew"". The prince has ""categorically"" denied any sexual contact with Ms Giuffre. This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre: ""I implore the people in the UK... to not accept this as being OK"" Virginia Giuffre, formerly Virginia Roberts, has given her first interview for British television as part of aspecial hour-long Panorama. Her interview includes her account of how she was introduced to Prince Andrew. She said that she, the prince, Epstein and his then girlfriend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, took her to Tramp night club in London, where the Prince asked her to dance. ""He is the most hideous dancer I've ever seen in my life"", she says. ""His sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere"". When they had left the club, Ms Giuffre said Ghislaine Maxwell gave her instructions. ""In the car Ghislaine tells me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey and that just made me sick."" She said that later that evening, she had sex with Prince Andrew upstairs at Maxwell's house in Belgravia. This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre: ""I'm calling BS on this"" In aninterview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlislast month, the prince said he didn't recall meeting Virginia Roberts, and that he had a medical condition that meant he did not sweat. However, of the claim that he had sex with her, the Prince said he could ""absolutely and categorically"" say ""it never happened"". And in a court statement, Ghislaine Maxwell has said the allegations are lies. Asked about a photo that appears to show him with his arm around Virginia Giuffre's waist in Maxwell's house, the prince said he didn't recall the photograph ever being taken and questioned whether it was his hand in the picture. Letter casts doubt on when duke met Epstein Six things we learned from the duke's interview Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Virginia Giuffre describes how she asked Jeffrey Epstein to take this picture of her with Andrew. But in the Panorama interview, which was recorded before Prince Andrew's interview, Ms Giuffre said: ""The people on the inside are going to keep coming up with these ridiculous excuses like his arm was elongated or the photo was doctored. ""I'm calling BS on this,"" she said. ""He knows what happened, I know what happened. And there's only one of us telling the truth."" In response to tonight's Panorama, Buckingham Palace said the Duke ""unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein"" and ""deeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure."" They said ""it is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew says he has wracked his brains but cannot recall any incident involving Virginia Roberts. Prince Andrew - the Queen's third child - has been facing questions over his ties to Epstein, a US financierwho took his own lifein August awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The prince has faced a growing backlash since the Newsnight interview about his friendship with the US financier. He stepped back from royal dutieslast month because he said the Epstein scandal had become a ""major disruption"" to the Royal Family. Companies he had links with, such as BT and Barclays, also joined universities and charities in distancing themselves from him. After his BBC interview he said he deeply sympathised with sex offender Epstein's victims and everyone who ""wants some form of closure"".

Why has Wales under-performed in school tests?,"The latest international test results for teenagers - Pisa - have been published. There is a keen eye on how students in Wales have performed, but why? Here is our guide. Pisa's full title is Programme for International Student Assessment - the main tests are in maths, reading and science and are run every three years by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Tests take about two hours and all are done on computer. In 2018, they were taken by 600,000 15-year-old pupils in 79 countries and regions. In the last results, Singapore outperformed all other participating countries. Japan, Estonia, Hong Kong and Canada were also among the top performers. This time around, four Chinese provinces finished top in all areas. This was the fifth time Wales has taken part - results in 2010 saw Wales slip below average performance in all three subject areas and was described by the then-education minister as ""unacceptable"" and ""alarming"".But the 2018 tests have brought improvements, if Wales is still trailing England in particular, of the other UK nations. Wales has moved closer to the international average. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""We have caught up, we are continuing to improve in all areas and as a nation we must be determined to keep up this momentum."" In reading, latest tests showed a significant increase in the scores of higher achieving pupils in Wales since 2015 but the scores of lower achieving pupils have not changed significantly. In science, back in 2015, there were 28 countries with mean scores higher than Wales; that figure is now 19 countries. The study also said Wales had made ""encouraging progress"" in mathematics, and was close to the OECD average for the first time. There is no single reason, but one factor identified by the OECD was the need improve the quality of teaching. Former education minister Leighton Andrews said the Welsh Government may have taken its ""eye off the ball"" in the 2000s when it scrapped testing and league tables. The report into the 2015 tests found only 6% of the variation in student performance in Wales could be put down to their socio-economic background. The results also showed Wales' highest performers were achieving lower scores than the OECD average and top performers in other parts of the UK. Andreas Schleicher, head of education and skills at the OECD, saidthe nation had under-performed and the education system had ""lost its soul"" by not focusing on high-quality teaching. He said reforms in Wales were on the right lines but it will take a while for these to have an impact. They have become an increasingly influential indicator of global education performance since they were introduced in 2000. Some argue that major businesses look at Pisa scores before making investment decisions, but there are plenty of sceptics who say too much emphasis has been placed on Pisa by politicians. There are also questions about how useful it is to compare 15-year-olds in such varied education systems and cultures across the world. In Wales, ministers have made improving Pisa scores a top priority over the past decade and said they tested the skills young people will need in future. 500-score Pisa target dropped in Wales Wales still worst in UK in world education tests What can Wales learn from Poland? A video was shown to pupils promoting ""team Wales"" and how to make a mark in education before the tests were sat last year Education is going through a period of major reforms, many of which have been influenced by Pisa. Some were introduced after the 2010 results, including a renewed focus on literacy and numeracy. There have also been changes to teacher training. Reformed GCSEsare also more aligned with the skills Pisa tests assess. The last results highlighted concerns more able and talented pupils were not being stretched so the Welsh Government has invested Â£3m to boost their performance. The biggest reform of all is theongoing development of a new curriculumwhich will be introduced in classrooms from 2022. The OECD welcomed the changes, but said improvements in results would take time. In 2015, Singaporean children scored on average 535 for reading - in Wales it was 477 In Singapore,which had the best performance last time, education expert Dr Pak Tee Ng said it was about resources and investment. ""It's not just about investing money, it is investing in teachers, investing in professional development, investing so that the schools will be places, safe places and places for children to learn and to grow,"" he said. ""Not only that, I think we play a lot of attention to making sure that we have a much more positive narrative of education. That is to say we would like people to know that good things are happening in the schools and to us teachers are nation builders. ""The right spirit for education should be that for the sake of our children, for the sake of our country, we will improve regardless of where we stand in international comparative tests."" When asked about creating a more positive narrative in Wales, Dr Pak said: ""Let's not make any international comparative tests into some kind of world cup - children's education is not about competition like a world cup of some sorts. ""I would say it is right and proper for any country to improve the education system with or without international comparative tests."" Prof Alma Harris, head of Swansea University's school of education, said: ""Pisa does exactly what it says on the tin. ""It looks at the performance of 15-year olds in three different subjects every three years but an education system is way more dynamic than that and therefore looking at issues of mental health in young people, well-being, inclusion, equity - these are all things that Pisa can't measure but they're very important to any education system - it's what gives it excellence and equity. ""So I'd say that Pisa is one dimension, one indicator that we should take account of - of course - policy-makers will take account of it whatever we say - but to recognise that it is really one very small indicator amongst many others that would give a more contextualised picture of how a system is performing. ""Pisa of itself is not problematic, it's what people do with Pisa and how they interpret Pisa and I think where it's been most unhelpful is where it's changed the policy discourse in a country, away from the way the country may have been going."" Prof Harris said Pisa was problematic if it distracted a country from reform and Wales was ""on a very clear reform trajectory.""

Woman survives 12 days in outback on groundwater,"Tamra McBeath-Riley and her dog Raya had been on a drive to the outback A woman rescued after 12 days stranded in Australia's remote outback said she survived by eating biscuits and drinking from a watering hole. Tamra McBeath-Riley, 52, was with two other people who became stranded when their car got stuck in a riverbed. The group split up to get help. Ms McBeath-Riley was found near her car but her companions are still missing. Police said they would be ""severely dehydrated"" after being stranded in the outback for 13 days. Ms McBeath-Riley had set off with two others, her partner Claire Hockridge and friend Phu Tran, on an afternoon drive from Alice Springs in the Northern Territory on 19 November. They took Ms McBeath-Riley's dog Raya, a female Staffordshire bull terrier, with them. The group were travelling in remote territory just south of Alice Springs when they found themselves stuck in the bed of the Hugh River. Alice Springs is one of the larger towns in the remote Northern Territory Speaking to reporters outside a hospital in Alice Springs, Ms McBeath-Riley said the group had stayed by the car for around three days in an attempt to free it. ""We tried many times to try to get out, but just couldn't get out, the river was just too large,"" she said. ""During the day it's just really hot so we dug ourselves under the car. At night [we] could sleep in the car."" They used up all their supplies of water, as well as some iced vodkas, biscuits and beef noodles they had in the car. They eventually found a watering hole, and boiled the water before sieving it through a shirt. ""It was still quite dirty, not hygienic water but it kept them alive,"" NT Police Superintendent Pauline Vicary told the Australian Broadcasting Corps. They eventually decided to split up to get help. Mr Tran and Ms Hockridge planned to walk towards the highway. Man lost in Outback survives on ants Family found dead in outback Australia SOS spotted on camera saves Australian camper Ms McBeath-Riley stayed in the area, thinking her dog would not survive a long walk. Northern Territory Police despatched helicopters to search for the trio. They eventually spotted Ms McBeath-Riley about 1.5km (0.9 miles) away from the car area after a local person reported seeing tyre tracks. ""She's had a fairly traumatic period of time,"" Supt Vicary said. ""Sensibly she appears to have stayed where the water is and has been drinking that and that's probably what kept her going."" It is not clear if her dog was found along with her. Ms McBeath-Riley was taken to hospital and treated for dehydration and exposure. She said she had assumed her companions had already been found and that ""to find out that's not the case is worrying"". Police are stepping up their search for the pair. Supt Vicary said officers had yet to begin searching the area by foot. ""Because of the terrain that they have gone missing in, and because we don't have a particularly focused area, we are still doing the helicopters,"" she told ABC.

Climate summit told of nation's 'fight to death',"This video can not be played COP25: What you need to know about the climate conference The president of an island nation on the frontline of climate change says it is in a ""fight to the death"" after freak waves inundated the capital. Powerful swells averaging 5m (16ft) washed across the capital of the Marshall Islands, Majuro, last week. But President Hilda Heine said the Pacific nation had been fighting rising tides even before last week's disaster. Political leaders and climate diplomats are meeting in Madrid for two weeks of talks amid a growing sense of crisis. This conference of the parties, or COP25, was due to be held in Chile but was cancelled by the government due to weeks of civil disturbances. Spain then stepped in to host the event, which will see 29,000 attendees over the two weeks of talks. Greenhouse gas concentrations break records Massive Attack help create carbon-zero tours Critical year for climate change What is climate change? Climate change: Where we are in seven charts School protesters are among those who have taken to the streets The world's average surface temperature is rising rapidly because human activities release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). These gasestrap heat in the atmosphere, a bit like the glass roof of a greenhouse. At the meeting, Ms Heine commented: ""Water covers much of our land at one or other point of the year as we fight rising tides.  As we speak hundreds of people have evacuated their homes after large waves caused the ocean to inundate parts of our capital in Majuro last week."" She added: ""It's a fight to the death for anyone not prepared to flee. As a nation we refuse to flee.  But we also refuse to die."" Ms Heine is not alone in the view that small nations like the Marshall Islands face an imminent existential threat. At the Madrid summit, ambassador Lois Young, from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which represents low-lying coastal countries and small island nations, launched a rebuke to the world's big polluters. ""We are disappointed by inadequate action by developed countries and outraged by the dithering and retreat of one of the most culpable polluters from the Paris Agreement,"" she said. ""In the midst of a climate emergency, retreat and inaction are tantamount to sanctioning ecocide. They reflect profound failure to honour collective global commitment to protect the most vulnerable. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map ""With our very existence at stake, COP 25 must demonstrate unprecedented ambition to avert ecocide."" The COP25 meeting will aim to step up ambition so that all countries increase their national commitments to cut emissions. The meeting follows on the heels of three UN reports which stressed the increased urgency of limiting dangerous climate change. According to UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres, ""the point of no return is no longer over the horizon"". Speaking ahead of the meeting, he said political leaders had to respond to the imminent climate crisis. This video can not be played The man who took wind power to another level ""In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. ""We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions,"" Mr Guterres said. Almost every country in the world has now signed and ratified the Paris climate agreement and under the terms of the pact they will all have to put new climate pledges on the table before the end of 2020. The UN secretary general says no new coal-fired power stations should be built after 2020 This meeting in Madrid signals the start of a frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November next year. Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend the meeting in the Spanish capital - but US President Donald Trump will not be among them. The US became a signatory to the landmark Paris climate agreement in April 2016, under the Obama administration. But President Trump has said the accord - which has been signed by more than 190 countries - would lead to lost jobs and lower wages for American workers. Last month, hebegan the process of withdrawing from the Paris deal. However, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, will attend the conference with a congressional delegation. While her presence has been welcomed, US environmentalists want to see concrete steps on climate. ""While it's great Speaker Pelosi is coming to Madrid in place of Trump, symbolic gestures are no substitute for bold action,"" said Jean Su from the US Center for Biological Diversity. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA ""America remains the number one historic contributor to the climate emergency, and even Democratic politicians have never committed to taking responsibility for our fair share."" Underlining the real world impacts of climate change, a report from the charity Save the Children, says that what it calls ""climate shocks"" are threatening tens of millions of people in East and Southern Africa. The charity says 33 million people are at emergency levels of food insecurity due to cyclones and droughts. More than half of these are believed to be children. The situation has been made worse because the two strongest cyclones ever to hit the African continent, affected the same region just weeks apart. This video can not be played What is global warming? Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi last March, while six weeks later Cyclone Kenneth slammed Mozambique with millions affected by flooding. ""The climate crisis is happening here, and it's killing people, forcing them from their homes and ruining children's chance of a future,"" said Ian Vale from Save the Children.

I saw things I can't unsee - London Bridge witnessThe first eyewitness from inside Fishmongers' Hall recounts the attack that claimed two lives.UK,"This video can not be played Bryonn Bain was giving a workshop at Fishmongers' Hall when the attack began An American academic has given a graphic account of the moment the London Bridge stabbing attack began, saying it ""felt like a warzone"". Bryonn Bain told the BBC that victim Jack Merritt had been the first person to confront Usman Khan when he launched his knife assault during a prisoner rehabilitation conference on Friday. ""I saw people die, I saw things that I will never be able to unsee,"" he said. Vigils have taken placefor Mr Merritt, 25, and second victim Saskia Jones, 23. Two women and a man were also injured in the attack before Khan was shot dead by armed officers on London Bridge - the two women are still in hospital in a stable condition. Prof Bain said former offenders attending the University of Cambridge-linked conference ""stepped up and intervened"" to tackle Khan, and people at Fishmongers' Hall owed their lives to the actions of those who had previously spent time in jail. London Bridge: What we know Families lead tributes to London attack victims London Bridge victims mourned at vigil He said two men from his performance poetry workshop immediately ran towards shouts from elsewhere in Fishmongers' Hall in the City of London as the attack began, and as shouts grew louder he also went to assist. ""That's when I ran down and saw the scene unfolding there,"" he said. ""I was able to see the attacker."" He added: ""It felt like a warzone... it felt like total chaos."" This video can not be played The chief executive of Fishmongers Hall, Commodore Toby Williamson describes how his staff fought back Prof Bain said course co-ordinator Mr Merritt was ""the first line of defence"". ""I want to honour him,"" Prof Bain said of Mr Merritt. ""I want to honour his father's wishes which have been explicit to not have his life be used for political purposes to ramp up draconian policies, because that's not what he was about."" Mr Merritt's father criticised newspaper coverage of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge to review the early release of convicted terrorists. Writing in the Guardian,external, David Merritt says his son ""would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against"". The article calls for a justice system that focuses on rehabilitation, rather than revenge, and criticises indeterminate sentences, saying his son worked for ""a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key"". Jack Merritt was a co-ordinator of the Learning Together programme and Saskia Jones a volunteer Prof Bain added: ""I want to make sure that as much as possible that we uphold the heroes of the day, were formerly incarcerated people, some of the folks who are often easiest to dehumanise. ""They stepped up and many of the folks in that space would not be here today if it weren't for these guys who did time in prison and literally saved lives."" In other developments on Monday: Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended his response to the attackafter Mr Merritt's father criticised newspaper coverage of Mr Johnson's pledge to review the early release of convicted terrorists Mr Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn attended a vigil at the Guildhall near London Bridge to honour those caught up in the attack London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the best way to defeat the hatred shown in the attack was to focus on the values of hope, unity and love BBC News learned the attacker, Usman Khan, 28, had been under investigation by the security service MI5 since his release from prison last year, but given one of the lowest priorities. He had been convicted of a terrorism offence in 2012 As part of his release conditions, Khan was obliged to take part in the government's desistance and disengagement programme - which aims to rehabilitate those involved in terrorism Vigils for the victims of the attack were also held in Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University, which Ms Jones had previously attended. Mr Merritt and Ms Jones both studied for masters degrees at the University of Cambridge's institute of criminology and had been taking part in an event for itsLearning Together programme- which focuses on education within the criminal justice system - when they were killed. The family of Jack Merritt take part in a vigil at the Guildhall in Cambridge Mr Merritt, from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, was a co-ordinator of the Learning Together programme and Ms Jones, from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, a volunteer The victims' familiespaid tribute to their loved onesat the weekend. Ms Jones's family said their daughterhad a ""great passion"" for supporting victims of criminal justice. In a statement, Mr Merritt's family described him as a""talented boy"" who ""died doing what he loved"". Toby Williamson, chief executive of Fishmongers' Hall, praised the bravery of his staff who intervened to stop the attacker, hailing their actions as ""extraordinary things done by ordinary people"". Mr Williamson told how Polish chef Lukasz suffered five wounds to his left-hand side as he fended off the knifeman with a narwhal tusk during ""about a minute of one-on-one straight combat"" - allowing others time to escape danger. 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker A group of hall staff, ex-offenders, prison and probation staff are believed to have drawn Khan out on to London Bridge where he was subsequently shot dead by armed police. The Metropolitan Police said in an update on Monday night that detectives were continuing extensive inquiries but had so far found nothing to suggest other people were involved in the attack. Khan, who admitted preparing terrorist acts in 2012, was released from prison in December 2018 after serving half of his sentence. The BBC understands Khan was formally under investigation by MI5 as he left jail but placed in the second-to-bottom category of investigations as his initial risk to the public was thought to be minimal. This was consistent with the grading given to most other people convicted of terrorism offences as they go back into the community under a release licence. Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison? What is Learning Together? London Bridge sentencing row - who did what? A low level of prioritisation is assigned to offenders such as Khan because their release comes with a strict set of licence conditions. These conditions theoretically provide suitable monitoring and oversight, such as alerts if they contact other suspects or travel outside an approved area. Khan, the BBC has learned, was on the highest-level of such community monitoring. The overall package, in theory, relieves pressure on MI5 so the security service can focus on more immediate threats. Friday was the first time that Khan, who wore a GPS tag, had been permitted to travel to London since he left prison. The BBC has been told that - earlier in the year - Khan was refused permission to travel to Stoke-on-Trent, which is where he grew up, in order to attend a social event. The prime minister said on Sunday that74 people jailed for terror offences and released early would have their licence conditions reviewed.. Police said two terror-related arrests following Friday's incident, in Staffordshire and north London, were not directly connected to the London Bridge attack. It came after theUK's terrorism threat level was downgraded on 4 November from ""severe"" to ""substantial"", meaning that attacks were thought to be ""likely"" rather than ""highly likely"".

Rail disruption as 27-day strike begins,"This video can not be played Southampton rail commuters speak out on first day of strike Commuters are facing disruption as workers on South Western Railway (SWR) begin a 27-day strike. It comes after talks between the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and SWR over a long-running dispute over guards on trains broke down. The operator called the action ""unnecessary"" and said ""more than half"" of weekday trains would run, but warned of queues at stations. The union said the strike is ""in defence of passenger safety"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The RMT said SWR had ""point-blank refused"" to show any serious movement at talks held at the conciliation service Acas. The union has been demanding that guards should oversee the operation of doors and perform other safety functions in dispatching trains. It said the company's proposals would leave guards as ""glorified porters"" without any safety responsibilities. As the strike got under way earlier, disruption was compounded when aman seen carrying an air rifle led to a train being evacuated. Allow Twitter content?

Elsewhere, Sophia Griffiths, who travels from Earlsfield station into central London, said: ""Usually when they strike the station is not too bad but today was just nuts. ""I saw the queue outside and thought 'no way' - I've never seen it that long so I took the bus to Tooting and got the Tube from there."" She said she was supportive of the striking workers and said it was ""crazy they (SWR) would let it get to this"". The communications officer at Nuffield Council on Bioethics said she was considering cycling to work during the prolonged action and working from home more. The morning rush hour meant a crowded platform at Wokingham station Charlotte Burnell said it took almost an hour to travel from Claygate, Surrey, to Waterloo - a journey which usually takes 34 minutes. ""You can manage a couple of days of strike action but the thought of it going on for 27 days is pretty overwhelming,"" she said. ""It's physically uncomfortable. I was forced to stand awkwardly and my back was killing me."" Steve Nagioff described passengers ""rammed"" into a carriage on his commute from Whitton in south west London. ""A woman next to me said that she couldn't breathe. The train stopped at Richmond and I fell out - luckily other passengers got off the train so I got back on it again. ""It's just not right - I pay full ticket prices. If the service is going to be like this then it should be free,"" he added. This video can not be played BBC Transport Correspondent Paul Clifton explains the background to the strikes Becky Bartlett, from Wokingham in Berkshire, said she was an hour late for work in London after her regular train was cancelled. ""I have various theatre and gig plans for the month, plus Christmas parties and events, which I have either had to cancel, some at loss of the ticket price, or I'm going to have to pay for a Â£30+ taxi from Reading just to get home. ""This whole experience is going to be horrific. I'm one day in and I've already had enough."" Passengers faced packed carriages on the line from Guildford to Waterloo RMT assistant general secretary Steve Hedley said members were ""absolutely furious"" with SWR following the Acas talks. ""Of course our members don't want to lose a month's money running up to Christmas but they're prepared to do that to show that safety and accessibility for disabled people is non-negotiable."" Regional organiser Mick Tosh said the union would consider financial support for any members who suffered particular hardship because of the strike. Your Questions Answered: Could public transport be made cheaper? SWR said it had offered ""a guard on every train, and a safety critical role for that guard"". Managing director Andy Mellors said the action was ""unnecessary"" and the issue needed to be settled before a new fleet of modern suburban trains was introduced next year. ""Our assessment is that by having drivers opening and closing doors, that will actually optimise the performance of the network by getting more trains to Waterloo on time. ""We've been very clear that we're committed to keeping a guard on our trains and those guards will have safety critical competencies. Our proposals will make guards more customer facing and improve safety, security and accessibility."" By Paul Clifton, BBC South transport correspondent Commuters at Bracknell station are among those affected by the strike At Chandler's Ford station this morning, the ticket office door was locked. The platform was empty and all the signs were blank. It's going to stay that way for a month. The next train isn't due until 2 January 2020. It's the same story at Swaythling, Millbrook, Dean, Dunbridge and a few other small stations popular with children heading to school as well as daily commuters. The two sides are trading insults and blaming each other. They haven't budged in more than two years of strikes. I don't think many passengers have any goodwill left at all for either the RMT or South Western Railway - because this month-long strike is going to cause real hardship for hundreds of thousands of people each day. Union members took part in a picket at Waterloo Station SWR released arevised timetable,externaland said it would provide longer trains to increase capacity where possible. The operator runs services between London Waterloo and Portsmouth, Southampton, Bournemouth and Weymouth as well as Reading, Exeter and Bristol. It also operates suburban commuter lines in south-west London, Surrey, Berkshire, and north-east Hampshire. Strike days are as follows: From 00:01 GMT on Monday 2 December until 23:59 on Wednesday 11 December From 00:01 on Friday 13 December until 23:59 on Tuesday 24 December From 00:01 on Friday 27 December 2019 until 23:59 on 1 January Man with gun on train leads to 'pandemonium' Strike-hit rail company boss to be replaced December rail strikes to go ahead after talks fail Rail workers to hold 27 days of strikes Trains 'shambolic' as strike continues Chaos for passengers on strike day one South Western Railway strikes suspended What does a train guard do?

Gogglebox edits out comments about Alex Salmond,"Gogglebox is now in its 14th series Comments about former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who is facing a sexual assault trial, have been edited out of catch-up versions of Channel 4's Gogglebox. In Friday's episode, the Siddiqui family referred to Scotland's former first minister - who denies all charges - while watching Question Time. But the comments were cut after the programme became available on catch-up. A Channel 4 spokesperson said: ""This episode of the programme has been edited and is now available on All 4."" Contempt of court laws mean the media must not broadcast or publish anything that might influence jurors and prejudice a trial. The Scottish legal system has a stricter attitude to contempt of court than in England. Mr Salmond is to plead not guilty to charges including one attempted rape, one intent to rape, 10 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults. The trial date is set for 9 March next year. Speaking outside court after a brief hearing last month, Mr Salmond said he was innocent and would defend himself ""vigorously"" during the trial.

Tiger on 'longest walk ever' for mate and prey,"The tiger has walked across two states in India A tiger has undertaken the longest walk ever recorded in India, travelling some 1,300km (807 miles) in five months. Experts believe the two-and-a-half-year-old male is possibly in search of prey, territory or a mate. The tiger, which is fitted with a radio collar, left its home in a wildlife sanctuary in the western state of Maharashtra in June. It was then tracked travelling back and forth over farms, water and highways, and into a neighbouring state. So far, the tiger has come into conflict with humans only once, when it ""accidentally injured"" one person who was part of a group that entered a thicket under which it was resting. Can Calvin Klein scent catch a 'killer' tiger? Why India should not get complacent over its tiger population The tiger, called C1, was one of three male cubs born to T1, a female tiger in Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary, home to 10 tigers in Maharashtra state. He was fitted with a radio collar in February and continued to roam the forests until the onset of monsoon rains to ""find a suitable area to settle"". The animal left the sanctuary at the end of June, and since then has travelled through seven districts in Maharashtra and the neighbouring state, Telangana. At the weekend, he was located in another wildlife sanctuary in Maharashtra. Wildlife officials say the big cat has not travelled in a ""linear manner"". He is being tracked through GPS satellite information every hour and has been recorded in more than 5,000 locations in the past nine months. ""The tiger is possibly looking for territory, food and a mate. Most of the potential tiger areas [in India] are full and new tigers have to explore more,"" Dr Bilal Habib, a senior biologist with the Wildlife Institute of India, told the BBC. The tiger hid during the day and travelled in the night time, killing wild pigs and cattle for food. Dr Habib confirmed the one accidental injury to a man who entered the thicket where the tiger was resting, but said there had been no serious conflict with humans. ""People don't even know that this tiger is travelling in the backyard,"" he said. India is now estimated to be home to 70% of the world's tigers However, wildlife officials say the tiger may need to be captured and relocated to the nearest forest to ""avoid any untoward accidents"", forest officials said. They also fear they will lose communication with the animal in the near future as the battery of the radio collar has been drained by 80%. Tiger numbers have increased in India, but their habitat has shrunk and prey is not always plentiful, say experts. Every tiger requires a breeding prey population of 500 animals in its territory to ensure a ""food bank"", say experts.

Families lead tributes to victims,"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were stabbed to death in Friday's terror attack at London Bridge Tributes have been paid to two friends stabbed to death in Friday's terror attack at London Bridge. Jack Merritt, 25, andSaskia Jones, 23, had been at a conference celebrating the five-year anniversary of theLearning Together prison programmewhen knifeman, 28-year-oldUsman Khan, attacked them and three others. He was shot dead by police minutes after he fatally wounded the University of Cambridge graduates. ""Saskia was a funny, kind, positive influence at the centre of many people's lives,"" the family of Ms Jones said in a statement. ""She had a wonderful sense of mischievous fun and was generous to the point of always wanting to see the best in all people,"" they added. ""She was intent on living life to the full and had a wonderful thirst for knowledge, enabling her to be the best she could be. ""Saskia had a great passion for providing invaluable support to victims of criminal injustice, which led her to the point of recently applying for the police graduate recruitment programme, wishing to specialise in victim support."" London Bridge: What we know so far 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker Attack victim Saskia Jones 'was perfect soul' What is Learning Together? Ms Jones had completed a Masters degree in criminology in 2018. Prof Loraine Gelsthorpe, director of the University of Cambridge's institute of criminology, said Ms Jones had a ""determination to make an enduring and positive impact on society in everything she did"". ""Saskia's warm disposition and extraordinary intellectual creativity was combined with a strong belief that people who have committed criminal offences should have opportunities for rehabilitation,"" she added. Colleen Moore, a former tutor of Ms Jones at Anglia Ruskin University, paid tribute, telling the BBC: ""She was fearless, she was a warrior, she was going to change the world - maybe she will."" She added: ""She stood out above everyone else, partly because she wanted to. She was not afraid to say anything, there was no fooling herâ¦ she said things that she knew would be a bit risky but they were always right."" ""She was a lovely, lovely woman, she made me laugh. She called me out on things - a lot of people were scared of me, she wasn't."" Olivia Smith, a lecturer in criminology who marked Ms Jones' dissertation when she was at Anglia Ruskin, described her as ""one of a kind"" who ""would have been a force for good"". Dr Smith said: ""I'm so sorry that the world won't get to see what she could have achieved. ""Saskia's dissertation was so good that I cried with pride when I marked it."" A friend, Sebastian Lefeuvre, described the young woman's death as senseless. ""She was just the most perfect soul and she's gone,"" he said. Jack Merritt's family said he was a ""friend and colleague"" of Ms Jones. ""Our beautiful, talented boy, died doing what he loved, surrounded by people he loved and who loved him,"" a statement said. ""He lit up our lives and the lives of his many friends and colleagues, and we will miss him terribly. ""Jack lived his principles; he believed in redemption and rehabilitation, not revenge, and he always took the side of the underdog. ""Jack was an intelligent, thoughtful and empathetic person who was looking forward to building a future with his girlfriend, Leanne, and making a career helping people in the criminal justice system. ""We know Jack would not want this terrible, isolated incident to be used as a pretext by the government for introducing even more draconian sentences on prisoners, or for detaining people in prison for longer than necessary. ""Our thoughts go out to the relatives and friends of his friend and colleague who died with him in this incident, to the colleagues who were injured, and to his brilliant, supportive colleagues at the University of Cambridge Department of Criminology."" Mr Merritt had completed the same masters degree Ms Jones had, but a year earlier. He had previously gained a degree in law at the University of Manchester. One woman who called Mr Merritt her ""best mate"" described him in atribute posted on Twitter,externalas ""quite simply the best thing, completely golden"". ""I wanted so much for you. Your life had so much enjoyment in it, and you gave us all so much happiness,"" she wrote. The friend, who calls herself Holl on Twitter, said she went to the pub and ""kept expecting you to turn up, swanky coat, Dr Martens on"". ""I need you to be known for who you were, your beliefs and voice. I'm so angry Jack,"" she said. ""Your voice won't be lost, you will never be lost and I will never let you be forgotten."" She added Mr Merritt ""could have done anything"" but ""you chose to help others, you championed the underdog"". This video can not be played Listen to Jack Merritt speak on a BBC podcast about his work helping inmates at a prison to study law. Prof Gelsthorpe said: ""Jack's passion for social and criminal justice was infectious. He was deeply creative and courageously engaged with the world, advocating for a politics of love. He worked tirelessly in dark places to pull towards the light."" Legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg interviewed Mr Merritt for the BBC in February, when he was working with Learning Together at HMP Warren Hill in Suffolk. Mr Rozenbergdescribed him as,external""a fine young man, dedicated to improving people's lives"". Rapper Dave said Mr Merritt was ""the best guy"" and the news of his death was ""one of the most painful things"". Dave's Mercury Prize-winning album wasinspired by rehabilitation therapy his brother Christopher Omoregie has receivedwhile serving a life sentence for murder.

Families mourn London Bridge victims at vigil,"The family of Jack Merritt take part in a vigil at the Guildhall in Cambridge Vigils for the victims of the London Bridge attack have been held in London and Cambridge. Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were commemorated at the services, which included a minute's silence. They were stabbed to death by Usman Khan - convicted of terrorism in 2012 - at a prisoner rehabilitation event. The BBC has learned Khan, 28, was put under MI5 investigation when he left prison a year ago but was given one of the lowest priorities. Mr Merritt and Ms Jones were both graduates of the University of Cambridge's institute of criminology and had been taking part in an event for itsLearning Together programme- which focuses on education within the criminal justice system - when they were killed on Friday. 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker London Bridge: What we know so far Families lead tributes to London attack victims Mr Merritt's family and his girlfriend attended the service in Cambridge outside the Guildhall. This video can not be played London Bridge: Cambridge vigils held for attack victims Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among those at the vigil at the Guildhall in the City of London. They were joined London Mayor Sadiq Khan who said the best way to defeat the hatred shown in the attack was to focus on the values of hope, unity and love. Jack Merritt was a co-ordinator of the Learning Together programme and Saskia Jones a volunteer ""The best way to defeat this hatred is not by turning on one another, but it's by focussing on the values that bind us, to take hope from the heroism of ordinary Londoners and our emergency services who ran towards danger, risking their lives to help people they didn't even know,"" he said. The London service happened less than a mile from Fishmongers' Hall, where Usman Khan launched his attack. This video can not be played A moment of silence was held at the vigil for the victims in London Bishop of London Sarah Mullally said the vigils remembered ""academics celebrating rehabilitation and finding only danger"". She paid tribute to the workers at Fishmongers' Hall, who she said went to work to offer hospitality, but found themselves needing to give protection. A book of condolences is open at Guildhall Art Gallery and members of the public are invited to lay flowers outside nearby Mansion House. The vigil in Guildhall Yard in London was led by Bishop of London Sarah Mullally Members of the public also paid their tributes A vigil was also held at Anglia Ruskin University, where Saskia Jones attended before taking her masters at Cambridge The victims' familiespaid tribute to their loved onesover the weekend. Mr Merritt was a co-ordinator of the Learning Together programme and Ms Jones a volunteer Ms Jones's family said their daughter, from Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire,had a ""great passion"" for supporting victims of criminal injustice. In a statement, Mr Merritt's family described him as a""talented boy"" who ""died doing what he loved"". Mr Merritt's father went on to criticise the Daily Mail and Daily Express newspapers for their coverage of Prime Minister Boris Johnson'spromise to review licence conditionsplaced on convicted terrorists released from jail. On Twitter, David Merritt shared images of the Mail and Express front pages - which reported a ""blitz on freed jihadis"" -and wrote,external: ""Don't use my son's death, and his and his colleague's photos - to promote your vile propaganda. Jack stood against everything you stand for - hatred, division, ignorance."" Jack Merritt's family said he was 'looking forward to building a future with his girlfriend, Leanne' The family of Saskia Jones said her death ""will leave a huge void in our lives"" Cambridge University's vice-chancellor Prof Stephen J Toope said he was ""devastated to learn that among the victims were staff and alumni"". Toby Williamson, chief executive of Fishmongers' Hall, praised the bravery of his staff who intervened to stop the attacker, hailing their actions as ""extraordinary things done by ordinary people"". Mr Williamson told how Polish chef Lukasz suffered five wounds to his left-hand side as he fended off the knifeman with a narwhal tusk during ""about a minute of one-on-one straight combat"" - allowing others time to escape danger. This video can not be played The chief executive of Fishmongers Hall, Commodore Toby Williamson describes how his staff fought back Two others grabbed makeshift weapons including a fire extinguisher before the attacker fled down a staircase and then got trapped in reception. Dr Vin Diwakar, medical director for the NHS in London, said two people injured in the attack remained in a stable condition in hospital, while one had been able to return home. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Khan, who was released from prison in December 2018 after serving half of his sentence was shot dead by police on London Bridge. The BBC understands Khan was formally under investigation by MI5 as he left jail but placed in the second-to-bottom category of investigations as his initial risk to the public was thought to be minimal. This was consistent with the grading given to most other people convicted of terrorism offences as they go back into the community under a release licence. Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison? What is Learning Together? London Bridge sentencing row - who did what? A low level of prioritisation is assigned to offenders such as Khan because their release comes with a strict set of licence conditions. These conditions theoretically provide suitable monitoring and oversight, such as alerts if they contact other suspects or travel outside an approved area. Khan, the BBC has learned, was on the highest-level of such community monitoring. The overall package, in theory, relives pressure on MI5 so the security service can focus on more immediate threats. The prime minister said on Sunday that74 people jailed for terror offences and released early will have their licence conditions reviewed. Later that day, Staffordshire Police said a 34-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts - but added there was no information to suggest the man was involved in the London Bridge attack. The man has been named as Nazam Hussain, who was jailed in 2012 alongside Usman Khan and received the same sentence - 16 years with half of that served in prison - after pleading guilty to preparing acts of terrorism. Following his arrest, Hussain was recalled to prison due to a suspected breach of his licence conditions. Inquiries by detectives into the potential terrorism offences are continuing, police said. Another man, Yayha Rashid, 23, of north London, has been charged following his arrest on Sunday on suspicion of breaching notification requirements. The Metropolitan Police said Rashid's arrest was not connected with the London Bridge attack. Friday's incident comes after theUK's terrorism threat level was downgraded on 4 November from ""severe"" to ""substantial"", meaning that attacks were thought to be ""likely"" rather than ""highly likely"". The terror threat level is reviewed every six months by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which makes recommendations independent of government. Friday's attack took place close to where eight people died and 48 were injured by three men who drove into pedestrians on London Bridge, before stabbing people in Borough Market in June 2017.

Disabled workers suffer pay penalty,"Disabled employees are paid 12.2% less than their non-disabled peers, according to official data. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that in 2018 the median pay for non-disabled workers was Â£12.11 an hour, against Â£10.63 for disabled. London had the widest disability pay gap at 15.3%, with the narrowest in Scotland, at 8.3%. The gap was the widest for those in their 30s and 40s,the ONS said in its report,external. The data underlines the struggle facing many disabled workers, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) said. ""Too many disabled people continue to face prejudice and struggle to get into employment or to remain in work, and are less likely to progress to senior management roles or to work in professional occupations,"" said the CIPD's Dr Jill Miller. ""Businesses that aren't inclusive - and don't manage health and disability effectively - risk missing out on hard-working and talented individuals, and damaging their reputation among staff and customers."" Angela Matthews, head of policy and research at Business Disability Forum, added: ""Disabled workers are not 'one group'. Some people with disabilities do not experience many barriers in work, and others experience many, multiple barriers. ""But we know that unjustified attitudes about what various groups of disabled people can and can't do are still widespread, and affect many employment related issues, including equal pay, bonus pay, and pay increases,"" Ms Matthews said. The ONS report is the first analysis of disability pay gaps in the UK using newly reweighted earnings data from theAnnual Population Survey.,external To define disability, the ONS uses theGovernment Statistical Service (GSS) definition,external. This identifies ""disabled"" as a person who has a physical or mental health condition, or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more, that reduces their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. What's pledged for disability and mental health? 'Little sign of change' for women in top roles The ONS said disabled females were in general paid 10.1% less than non-disabled females in 2018 - narrower than the pay gap between disabled and non-disabled male employees who had a gap of 11.6%. However, employment rates for disabled men and women were similar at 51.7% and 50.4%. The ONS also found that those disabled employees with mental impairments had the biggest pay gap at 18.6%, while the gap was 9.7% for the physically impaired. Much of the difference in pay can be put down to factors such as what employees do and how qualified they are, the agency said. Using the GSS definition of disability, the ONS said 18.9% of people in the UK aged 16 to 64 years were disabled in 2018. Women were more likely to be disabled than men, at 21.1% and 16.6%, respectively. What's pledged for disability and mental health?

Prince Andrew accuser calls for public supportVirginia Giuffre tells BBC Panorama she urges the British public to 'stand beside her'UK,"This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre: ""I knew I had to keep him happy"" A US woman who says she was brought to Britain aged 17 to have sex with Prince Andrew has implored the British public to ""stand beside her"" and ""not accept what has happened to her"". Virginia Giuffre, one of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, says she was trafficked to London by Epstein in 2001. She describes how Epstein's girlfriend told her what ""to do for Andrew"". The prince has ""categorically"" denied any sexual contact with Ms Giuffre. This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre: ""I implore the people in the UK... to not accept this as being OK"" Virginia Giuffre, formerly Virginia Roberts, has given her first interview for British television as part of aspecial hour-long Panorama. Her interview includes her account of how she was introduced to Prince Andrew. She said that she, the prince, Epstein and his then girlfriend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, took her to Tramp night club in London, where the Prince asked her to dance. ""He is the most hideous dancer I've ever seen in my life"", she says. ""His sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere"". When they had left the club, Ms Giuffre said Ghislaine Maxwell gave her instructions. ""In the car Ghislaine tells me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey and that just made me sick."" She said that later that evening, she had sex with Prince Andrew upstairs at Maxwell's house in Belgravia. This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre: ""I'm calling BS on this"" In aninterview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlislast month, the prince said he didn't recall meeting Virginia Roberts, and that he had a medical condition that meant he did not sweat. However, of the claim that he had sex with her, the Prince said he could ""absolutely and categorically"" say ""it never happened"". And in a court statement, Ghislaine Maxwell has said the allegations are lies. Asked about a photo that appears to show him with his arm around Virginia Giuffre's waist in Maxwell's house, the prince said he didn't recall the photograph ever being taken and questioned whether it was his hand in the picture. Letter casts doubt on when duke met Epstein Six things we learned from the duke's interview Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Virginia Giuffre describes how she asked Jeffrey Epstein to take this picture of her with Andrew. But in the Panorama interview, which was recorded before Prince Andrew's interview, Ms Giuffre said: ""The people on the inside are going to keep coming up with these ridiculous excuses like his arm was elongated or the photo was doctored. ""I'm calling BS on this,"" she said. ""He knows what happened, I know what happened. And there's only one of us telling the truth."" In response to tonight's Panorama, Buckingham Palace said the Duke ""unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein"" and ""deeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure."" They said ""it is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew says he has wracked his brains but cannot recall any incident involving Virginia Roberts. Prince Andrew - the Queen's third child - has been facing questions over his ties to Epstein, a US financierwho took his own lifein August awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The prince has faced a growing backlash since the Newsnight interview about his friendship with the US financier. He stepped back from royal dutieslast month because he said the Epstein scandal had become a ""major disruption"" to the Royal Family. Companies he had links with, such as BT and Barclays, also joined universities and charities in distancing themselves from him. After his BBC interview he said he deeply sympathised with sex offender Epstein's victims and everyone who ""wants some form of closure"".

"Trump refuses to attend impeachment hearingThe White House cites a lack of ""fairness"" to say the president will not attend Wednesday's session.US & Canada","Mr Trump and his counsel would have had the opportunity to ask questions at the hearing The White House has said US President Donald Trump and his lawyers will not attend an impeachment hearing on Wednesday, citing a lack of ""fairness"". The hearing by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee marks the next stage of the probe, with legal experts giving testimony that could lead to a vote of impeachment. It is alleged the president pressured Ukraine to conduct two investigations for his own political gain. Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing. After weeks of closed-door witness interviews and public hearings, the process will now focus on possible charges of misconduct, which could lead to an impeachment vote in the House and trial in the Republican-led Senate. The Democratic-led inquiry centres on a phone call in July between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr Trump has dismissed the process as a ""witch hunt"". Trump impeachment inquiry: A simple guide The impeachment story explained Who's who in the Trump-Ukraine story? Last Wednesday, Jerrold Nadler,the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, invited Mr Trump to attend this week's hearing, ""directly or through a counsel"", saying it would be an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis for impeachment. But in a letter to the committee, White House counsel Pat Cipollone accused the committee of a ""complete lack of due process and fundamental fairness"", saying the invitation would fail to give the White House adequate time to prepare and did not give information about the witnesses. Reports suggested witnesses were ""apparently all academics"" and would include ""no fact witnesses"", Mr Cipollone said. A fact witness testifies their personal knowledge of events while an expert witness assists the judge by offering an opinion. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Mr Cipollone also said the committee had called three witnesses but allowed Republicans to call just one, and lambasted Mr Nadler's claim that the process was ""consistent"" with historical impeachment inquiries, arguing that President Bill Clinton had a fairer hearing in 1998. In order for Mr Trump to be represented in further hearings, the president's counsel said, Mr Nadler would need to ensure ""that due process rights are protected"" and that the process was ""fair and just"".

The letter also accused Democrats of scheduling the hearing ""no doubt purposefully"" to conflict with Mr Trump's visit this week to London for a Nato summit. He is due to return to Washington after the judiciary committee hearing. Mr Cipollone's letter did not say whether Mr Trump would attend a second hearing, which does not yet have a date, but added that a response would be given by Friday. Democrats say Mr Trump dangled two bargaining chips - $400m (Â£309m) of military aid to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting with Ukraine's new leader. They think this political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounts to an abuse of power. The first investigation Mr Trump wanted from Ukraine was into one of his main Democratic challengers, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. Hunter joined the board of a Ukrainian company when Joe Biden was US vice-president. The second Trump demand was that Ukraine try to corroborate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the last US presidential election. This theory has been widely debunked, and the US intelligence agencies are unanimous in saying Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016. A SIMPLE GUIDE:If you want a basic take, this one is for you GO DEEPER:Here is a 100, 300 and 800-word summary of the story WHAT IS IMPEACHMENT?A political process to remove a president VIEW FROM TRUMP COUNTRY:Reaction from a West Virginia town CONTEXT:Why Ukraine matters to the US FACT-CHECK:Is the whistleblower linked to the Democrats? First the White House said it would not co-operate with the impeachment probe because it was not formally authorised by the House of Representatives. Then, Donald Trump complained that the congressionally approved process in the Intelligence Committee violated his legal due-process rights. Now the White House says it won't send lawyers to the first Judiciary Committee hearing this week, even though they are permitted to participate. The president still has the opportunity to change course, and Wednesday's hearing could turn out to be a stuffy academic discussion about the impeachment process with little lasting impact, but it's a sign that the White House feels things may be breaking Mr Trump's way. Opinion polls indicate the public's view of impeachment is solidifying on party lines. Those who like the president want the process to end; those who hate him want him gone, whether through impeachment or next November's election. That's a recipe for partisan stalemate. And as long as Republicans continue to stick together, the president has an impenetrable defence against removal from office. While the White House may not be winning the impeachment fight, it's not losing either - and for now that's reason enough to keep the process at arm's length. At the heart of the inquiry is the rough transcript of a phone call on 25 July between Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky, in which Mr Trump asks for ""a favour"" and wants Ukraine to ""look into"" corruption claims involving the Bidens. These claims remain unsubstantiated. The call prompted a whistleblower complaint from an unidentified CIA officer who said Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"". That complaint sparked an impeachment inquiry which has featured diplomats and White House aides giving testimony to Congress. Several testified that there was a ""shadow"" foreign policy to push Ukraine into opening these investigations, and to announce them publicly. The witnesses linked the president to the promise of a White House meeting but none had direct knowledge he had personally held back the military aid. However, Democrats say the evidence is overwhelming that Mr Trump orchestrated the pressure campaign, and point to an admission of a ""quid pro quo"" by White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney at a press conference. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said the committees leading the probe - Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs - are now working on their report, which will be issued on 3 December. On Wednesday, legal experts yet to be named are expected to be heard by the Judiciary Committee, which is responsible for crafting articles of impeachment, or the charges of wrongdoing against the president. It is expected that those charges will be drafted this month. After a vote in the Democratic-controlled House, a trial would be held in the Senate. The White House and some Republicans want the trial to be limited to two weeks. If Mr Trump was convicted by a two-thirds majority - an outcome deemed highly unlikely - he would become the first US president to be removed from office through impeachment.

Exeter Crown Court heard Alexander Lewis-Ranwell battered his victims - all in their 80s - with a shovel and a hammer in a ""whirlwind of destruction"". He has paranoid schizophrenia and was having delusions about saving girls from a paedophile ring, jurors heard. The 28-year-old was found not guilty by reason of insanity after jurors decided he ""did not know it was illegal"". Twins Richard and Roger Carter, 84, and Anthony Payne, 80, werebludgeoned on 10 February. The court heard Lewis-Ranwell was arrested and released by police twice in the lead-up to the killings. The man who killed three times after police bailed him He began the first fatal attack just three hours after he had been released from police custody, where he had been held for wounding a farmer with a saw. It was his second arrest in the space of 24 hours and came just seven hours after he was arrested over an attempted burglary at another farm. Anthony Payne was killed at his home near Exeter St David's station Three psychiatrists agreed Lewis-Ranwell was insane when he battered his victims. But the prosecution had argued the defendant bore some responsibility for what happened. The court heard evidence of Lewis-Ranwell's interaction with various health professionals during his three spells in custody between 8 and 11 February. After his first arrest, on 8 February, his mother phoned police expressing ""grave concerns should he be released"" but he was charged and bailed. Following his second arrest, at about 16:00 on 9 February, a police inspector reviewing his detention found he ""potentially presents as a serious risk to the public if released"". Two-and-a-half hours later, a forensic medical examiner - a doctor employed by G4S Health Services - deemed Lewis-Ranwell was not ""acutely unwell"" and a full mental health assessment was not carried out.

Less than three hours later he scaled the wall of the Carter brothers' home in Cowick Lane, took a spade from the garden and beat them both to death with it. After his final arrest the defendant told a psychiatrist at Broadmoor secure hospital: ""I cannot believe no-one helped me - they let me out twice when I was unwell."" In sentencing, Mrs Justice May described the case as ""disturbing... on so many levels - three dead, two injured at the hands of someone floridly psychotic at the time and therefore not criminally responsible"". She said she would be making a hospital order with restrictions to ensure Lewis-Ranwell ""won't be allowed into the community until agencies are absolutely content it is OK for him to be released"". The judge informed the court that, prior to returning their verdicts, the jury had passed her a note raising concerns about the ""state of psychiatric services in Devon and the failings in care in Alexander Lewis-Ranwell's case"". Lewis-Ranwell caught on CCTV on the day of the killings In a statement, the head of custody for G4S Health Services, Jon Allen, said the company ""stood by their decision"" that ""Lewis-Ranwell was not suicidal and did not meet the requirements of a full Mental Health Act assessment in the out-of-hours period"".

Climate summit told of nation's 'fight to death'The president of the Marshall Islands tells a summit that rising tides threaten its existence.Science & EnvironmentComments,"This video can not be played COP25: What you need to know about the climate conference The president of an island nation on the frontline of climate change says it is in a ""fight to the death"" after freak waves inundated the capital. Powerful swells averaging 5m (16ft) washed across the capital of the Marshall Islands, Majuro, last week. But President Hilda Heine said the Pacific nation had been fighting rising tides even before last week's disaster. Political leaders and climate diplomats are meeting in Madrid for two weeks of talks amid a growing sense of crisis. This conference of the parties, or COP25, was due to be held in Chile but was cancelled by the government due to weeks of civil disturbances. Spain then stepped in to host the event, which will see 29,000 attendees over the two weeks of talks. Greenhouse gas concentrations break records Massive Attack help create carbon-zero tours Critical year for climate change What is climate change? Climate change: Where we are in seven charts School protesters are among those who have taken to the streets The world's average surface temperature is rising rapidly because human activities release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). These gasestrap heat in the atmosphere, a bit like the glass roof of a greenhouse. At the meeting, Ms Heine commented: ""Water covers much of our land at one or other point of the year as we fight rising tides.  As we speak hundreds of people have evacuated their homes after large waves caused the ocean to inundate parts of our capital in Majuro last week."" She added: ""It's a fight to the death for anyone not prepared to flee. As a nation we refuse to flee.  But we also refuse to die."" Ms Heine is not alone in the view that small nations like the Marshall Islands face an imminent existential threat. At the Madrid summit, ambassador Lois Young, from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which represents low-lying coastal countries and small island nations, launched a rebuke to the world's big polluters. ""We are disappointed by inadequate action by developed countries and outraged by the dithering and retreat of one of the most culpable polluters from the Paris Agreement,"" she said. ""In the midst of a climate emergency, retreat and inaction are tantamount to sanctioning ecocide. They reflect profound failure to honour collective global commitment to protect the most vulnerable. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map ""With our very existence at stake, COP 25 must demonstrate unprecedented ambition to avert ecocide."" The COP25 meeting will aim to step up ambition so that all countries increase their national commitments to cut emissions. The meeting follows on the heels of three UN reports which stressed the increased urgency of limiting dangerous climate change. According to UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres, ""the point of no return is no longer over the horizon"". Speaking ahead of the meeting, he said political leaders had to respond to the imminent climate crisis. This video can not be played The man who took wind power to another level ""In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. ""We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions,"" Mr Guterres said. Almost every country in the world has now signed and ratified the Paris climate agreement and under the terms of the pact they will all have to put new climate pledges on the table before the end of 2020. The UN secretary general says no new coal-fired power stations should be built after 2020 This meeting in Madrid signals the start of a frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November next year. Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend the meeting in the Spanish capital - but US President Donald Trump will not be among them. The US became a signatory to the landmark Paris climate agreement in April 2016, under the Obama administration. But President Trump has said the accord - which has been signed by more than 190 countries - would lead to lost jobs and lower wages for American workers. Last month, hebegan the process of withdrawing from the Paris deal. However, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, will attend the conference with a congressional delegation. While her presence has been welcomed, US environmentalists want to see concrete steps on climate. ""While it's great Speaker Pelosi is coming to Madrid in place of Trump, symbolic gestures are no substitute for bold action,"" said Jean Su from the US Center for Biological Diversity. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA ""America remains the number one historic contributor to the climate emergency, and even Democratic politicians have never committed to taking responsibility for our fair share."" Underlining the real world impacts of climate change, a report from the charity Save the Children, says that what it calls ""climate shocks"" are threatening tens of millions of people in East and Southern Africa. The charity says 33 million people are at emergency levels of food insecurity due to cyclones and droughts. More than half of these are believed to be children. The situation has been made worse because the two strongest cyclones ever to hit the African continent, affected the same region just weeks apart. This video can not be played What is global warming? Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi last March, while six weeks later Cyclone Kenneth slammed Mozambique with millions affected by flooding.

"Child life expectancy projections cut by yearsChildren born this year expected to live shorter lives than previously thought, say official stats.Health","Years have been knocked off official projections of children's life expectancies in the UK, an Office for National Statistics (ONS) report shows. A baby girl born in 2019 is now expected to celebrate three fewer birthdays on average, than under previous calculations. Official 2014 data thought that girl would make it to 93.6. Now the figure is 90.4. The report also slashed the likelihood of children reaching 100. Although life expectancies have been and are still improving, experts say previous estimates were too high. The improvement is much smaller than previously thought, as part of a widely acknowledged slowdown in life expectancy since 2011. In 2018, life expectancy growth stalledfor the first time in more than 30 years. This has led statisticians to re-evaluate their assumptions about future improvements in life expectancy, resulting in the figures released today. The ONS report calculates,externalthe impact of this less-rosy picture on children's prospects of a long life. So a boy born in 2019 is now expected to live for 87.8 years. But the 2016 data thought he would reach 89.7 and the 2014 data said 91.1. And looking to the future, to children born in 2043, there is a dramatic drop in the chances of reaching 100. The latest report says: 20.8% of newborn boys are expected to reach 100 26.1% of newborn girls are expected to reach 100 But the projections two years ago thought: 34.1% of newborn boys would reach 100 40.2% of newborn girls would reach 100 The ONS said: ""There has been considerable public debate about the causes of the slowdown in life expectancy improvements. ""Researchers have suggested a range of possible explanations for the slowdown... several factors are at play, none of which can be singled out as being the most important with any certainty."" Many reports,including by Public Health England,externalandthe Health Foundation,externalthink tank, have attempted to get to the bottom of the issue. Why aren't we living longer? A lack of a recent blockbuster moment in medicine could be an issue. Life expectancy in the 20th Century improved with the creation of the NHS, falls in smoking, childhood immunisation (the last case of polio in the UKwas in 1984,external) and medical advances particularly for the big killers - heart disease, stroke and cancer. But now dementia is listed as the leading cause of death and it is incurable. Dementia: The greatest health challenge of our time Public Health England says a more elderly population - with dementia and other long-term health problems - may also be more vulnerable to diseases like flu. But there are issues affecting life expectancy well before old age. Deaths from drug misuse, with Scotland having the highestdrug death rate in the EU, are also quoted. One of the most politically charged questions has been around austerity - the programme of government cuts that coincides with the slowdown in life expectancy. The evidence either way is hotly contested. But Public Health England's report says the poorest people have felt the impact on life expectancy the hardest and that ""could indicate a role for government spending"". Follow Jameson Twitter,external. Stalling life expectancy in the UK has attracted plenty of attention from academics, but they offer no definitive answers on the causes. When you are talking about shifts in predictions of lifespans, it needs more than a few years of data. But there is concern about why it's a different story to that in most other developed economies. An analysis by the ONS last year concluded that the slowdown in life expectancy growth in the UK since 2011 was one of the largest of the countries analysed. That's led to speculation on UK specific factors. Cuts in government spending in the policy period dubbed by some as ""austerity"" might, according to some commentators, have been a factor. It's worth noting, though, that cuts in social care in England were not replicated to the same extent in other parts of the UK. The decline in living standards and the reduced ability of some households to pay for heating and food in the decade since the financial crisis in 2008 have also been mentioned. The gap between life expectancy in the richest and poorest neighbourhoods in England has increased according to research last year.

The Sun leads on the PM's warning that his main rival in the election, Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, is a ""security risk"" The Daily Telegraph says Labour must ""come clean"" about how it got hold of documents it says ""proves"" the NHS is for sale At the summit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to call for Nato unity, amid growing tensions within the military bloc. The summit will mark the founding of the 29-member defence alliance 70 years ago. The two-day gathering is overshadowed by a bitter row between France and Turkey over the Syrian conflict. Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron described Nato as ""brain dead"", saying alliance members were no longer co-operating on a range of key issues. Read the full story here. As the election campaign enters its final days, Donald Trump has arrived in the UK for a meeting of the defence alliance Nato. The US president's plane, Air Force One, landed at Stansted airport ahead of the three-day visit. Mr Trump is set to attend a reception for world leaders hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. The summit marking the 70th anniversary of Nato starts in Watford on Wednesday.

The full document,which can be viewed here,external, focuses on Sinn Fein's approach to Brexit, as well as Irish unity, the restoration of Stormont and other issues. The party has a long-standing policy of abstentionism, meaning its MPs do not take their seats at Westminster, and it argues that by not doing so it is fulfilling the mandate given to it by it voters. The party's manifesto says Sinn Fein has been more effective arguing outside of Westminster - including in Dublin, Brussels and Washington - than it would have been if it had taken its seats. This video can not be played As we told you a few moments ago, the Labour leader has written to President Trump to ""clarify"" whether or not the NHS is on the table as part of post-Brexit trade talks. Mr Corbyn says there would be ""no deal"" with the US, under a Labour government, if it insisted the NHS was included in post-Brexit trade talks Jeremy Corbyn has said he would walk away from trade negotiations if the US insisted on including the NHS as part of a trade deal. President Trump and the first lady left the White House earlier for the Nato summit in London earlier Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to US President Donald Trump to ask him to âurgently clarify that our NHS is
genuinely off the table in UK-US trade talks and that it will not be exposed
to higher costs from US drug companies"". Speaking ahead of
President Trumpâs visit to London for a Nato summit, Mr Corbyn says Labour would ânegotiate a trade arrangement with the EU that means we will protect our manufacturing industries' primary market, and weâll have to trade with rest of the world of course. But weâre not putting our public services on any negotiating table in any circumstances"". Mr Corbyn hasclaimed government papers he released last week are ""proof"" that the NHS was at riskunder a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the claims are ""nonsense"" and the NHS would not be part of trade talks. Mr Corbyn says there would be âno dealâ with the US, under a Labour government, if it insisted the NHS or other public services were included in trade talks. In his letter to Mr Trump, Mr Corbyn added: âI am sure you understand that our coming general election on 12 December means the British public need urgent clarity that our NHS is genuinely off the table in UK-US trade talks and will not be exposed to higher costs from US drugs companies.â Mr Corbyn says he would
be âvery happy to talk to Mr Trumpâ. His message to the president, he says, is âfirstly, welcome"" - but, ""secondly, our public services
will not be included in in any trade deal with the United States. Our NHS is
not for sale and weâre not going to allow the extension of medicine patents
that will push up drug prices in this country"". Read our full story here. Mr Corbyn says this 451-page dossier showing initial talks between the UK and the US proves the NHS is ""for sale"" It's that time of the evening again - we've been sent the first of Tuesday's front pages. The Financial Times splashes with a picture of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, at Guildhall Yard, London, to honour the victims off the London Bridge terror attack. The faces of Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn are all over the i's front page, too, in a busy collage of headlines and articles. ""The media won't decide this election,"" the paper says. The Christian Peoples Alliance is anti-abortion The Christian Peoples Alliance is fielding 29 candidates
across the UK. The centrepiece of its manifesto is a pledge to give all
newly-weds a Â£12,000 grant when they marry and a further Â£6,000 on the birth or
adoption of their first child. Opposite sex couples only would be eligible for the
financial support. The move would be funded by a new Â£3bn annual sales tax on
high-tech companies. On Brexit, the party supports another referendum but not
until five years after the UK has left the EU. It says the UKâs decision to
leave must be honoured but there should be a âmechanismâ to go back if the UK
does not make a success of leaving. Other pledges include:  The party's leader Sid Cordle has also vowed to maintain the partyâs
âuncompromisingâ anti-abortion stance â by repealing the 1967 law legalising
abortion and giving full legal protection to the unborn child. You can readthe Christian Peoples Alliance manifesto here,external- and ourfull policy guide comparing various parties' pledges here. Swaledale, Yorkshire The partyâs manifesto, entitled Yorkshire Deserves Better,
calls for a radical shake-up in the relationship between Westminster and
Yorkshireâs 5.4 million residents. Its main goal is a new devolved assembly for the region,
which it says would empower business and end the current situation where
Yorkshire is left fighting for âscraps from the tableâ. Transport is a key focus, with a pledge to build a new
ânorthern powerhouseâ railway line linking Hull, York, Leeds, Bradford and
Sheffield with Newcastle, Liverpool and Manchester. Other pledges include:  The party, which is fielding 28 candidates this time, did
not campaign either way in the Brexit referendum. While it says the Leave vote must be honoured, it wants to
maintain a close economic relationship with the EU and as few barriers to trade
as possible. Party leader Chris Whitwood says the possibility of the UK
joining the European Free Trade Association in the future should not be ruled
out, while the UKâs exit provides an opportunity for powers repatriated from
Brussels to be handed to the region. You can readthe Yorkshire Party's manifesto here,external- and ourfull policy guide comparing various parties' pledges here. Formed by a breakaway group of Labour and Conservative MPs
in February, the party is fielding only three candidates after other key
figures either joined the Lib Dems or decided to retire. The trio â former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, former
Tory minister Anna Soubry and ex-Labour MP Mike Gapes â say they are flying the
flag for âcentre ground valuesâ and a politics rooted in âfairness,
responsibility, truthfulness, opportunity and long-termismâ. Their nine-page policy statement, entitled 2020 Vision For
Change, has at its heart a commitment to hold another Brexit referendum and to
campaign to remain in the EU. Rather than publishing an âexhaustiveâ manifesto, the party
says the abbreviated document contains only policies that are âcompelling,
appropriate and deliverableâ and reflect its values. Its pledges include:  If it succeeds in returning MPs to Westminster, TIG says it
will push for cross-party working âto become the normâ in Parliament and
challenge the âcartelâ of the big parties over election rules. You can readTIG's manifesto here,external- and ourfull policy guide comparing various parties' pledges here. Now that Mr Corbyn's Labour rally and Mr Johnson's Conservative event are over, let's take a look at some of the smaller parties you might not have heard so much about in the election campaign so far. Over the next few minutes we'll profile the Yorkshire Party, the Christian Peoples Alliance and the Independent Group for Change. There's a big cheer from the Conservative-supporting crowd when Johnson says his âget Brexit doneâ line for the first time in this speech. He then moves on to compare the various plans his party has for the country if it wins a majority on 12 December. He says the Tories' understanding of the UK economy is why ""this party is more trusted on health now, and on education, than the Labour Party"". He continues to lay into Labour's record on the economy. ""It would be comical if it weren't so tragic,"" he adds, attacking the spending pledges made in the opposition's main campaign. On education, Mr Johnson says the choice is ""stark"". ""You can come with us - a party that supports fantastic education for every pupil. Or go with Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party who actually want to abolish Ofsted."" You can view the main policies of the Conservative and Labour parties - as well as the other main parties in this election - in our policy guide here. The PM's speech is littered with metaphors as usual - this ""dog in the manger"" Parliament is like a bus ""slap bang in the middle of the yellow box junction, stopping the traffic in every direction"". He says the people of this country are like the ""AA"" - they will fix the broken-down country. ""And we can do it... in just 10 days' time, we can get out of the rut we've been in for the last three and a half years [since the EU referendum],"" he adds. He's applauded as he says that once Brexit is delivered, a Tory government will bring in legislation to stop the automatic early release of serious and violent offenders - ""not to speak of terrorists"" he adds. This line comes after the PM faced criticism for what some have called ""politicising"" Friday's London Bridge attack, where a convicted terrorist stabbed two people to death. Mr Corbyn says he wants to ""lead a government that is serious about
dealing with injustices"". He says he has been asked whether the country can afford Labour's manifesto promises. ""Are you sure the country cannot afford it?"" he says he replied. ""Unless we invest for the future where will the jobs of
tomorrow be?"" He goes on to talk about the NHS, calling it ""Labourâs greatest achievement"". He says he has ""studied"" the papers that detail meetings the UK government has been having with the US Department of Trade in the last two years. ""Itâs frightening,"" he says. ""They are discussing extending the patents on medicines for
export to the British market. ""Discussing access to our health service by American pharmaceuticals and others."" He adds: ""My simple message to Donald Trump and Boris Johnson is - our NHS is not for sale."" Here's our Reality Check on what those documents tell us about the talks. Mr Corbyn criticises the ""abuse thrown at people"" campaigning for Labour and the ""media investigations into them"". ""When they go low and attack us with personal abuse and the rest of us,"" he says. ""When they go low we go high. ""We are better than them."" You may recognise these words - they were first utteredin the 2016 US presidential campaign by former first lady Michelle Obama,externalwho said this when talking about Hillary Clinton's detractors. In a schedule clash that's keeping us busy, the prime minister is on stage in Colchester at the same time as Mr Corbyn is in Hastings. Mr Johnson is speaking at a rally in the Tory-held seat in northern Essex. He starts by thanking his supporters for all the campaigning they've helped with. ""We had no choice"" but to have an election, he says, blaming the poll on the ""Brexit-blocking Parliament"". His speech follows words from his close allies, party chairman James
Cleverly and Home Secretary Priti Patel. The
Conservatives held the Colchester seat in 2017 with 5,677 more votes than
second-placed Labour. You can see a list of all of the candidates in the constituency here. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn begins his speech in the marginal seat Hastings & Rye, in Sussex. He says he has been asked what his priorities are. ""My absolute priority is dealing with the situation facing rough sleepers and the homeless,"" he says. ""There is something morally wrong about a wealthy country that tolerates people sleeping rough."" Labour lost out to the Tories by a mere 346 votes in Hastings & Rye in the 2017 election. You can see a list of all of the candidates in the constituency here. Our political correspondent's thoughts from the Tory campaign bus... Ben WrightBBC political correspondent Itâs an old story but Iâll tell it anyway. During the 1964
general election campaign Harold Wilson was trumpeting his support for the navy at a
vast public meeting in the dockyard town of Chatham. âAnd why am I saying all
this?"" he asked rhetorically. ""Because you're in Chatham!â shouted a
voice from the crowd. A famously fine heckle from an era where prime ministers
had to contend with the electorate face to face. They still do from behind
their TV studio podiums of course but the public meeting and town centre
walkabout has mostly gone. Weâre 10 days from polling day and from my perch in
the Tory campaign Iâve yet to hear a heckle. Not one. Today Boris Johnson
turned up at a deserted cruise liner terminal at Southampton docks to plug his
partyâs policies for border control after Brexit. He chugged around the quiet
port in a boat and did a quick television interview on his response to Fridayâs
terror attack before heading off to a rally for Tory activists
this evening. The PM was in and out before the cityâs voters
twigged he was there. Itâs the same wherever Mr Johnson goes. The Conservative
campaign feels efficient, focused and sterile. Clips for broadcasters are
provided, Tory social media content is recorded and pictures of the prime minister in different bits of Britain are taken that will appear online and in
tomorrowâs newspapers. But spontaneous encounters between the PM and the general public hardly ever happen. Itâs now impossible to imagine Boris Johnson copying John Majorâs 1992
campaign and plunging into the crowd to argue his case. During the 2016
referendum, Mr Johnson seemed to relish the chaotic cut and thrust of town to
town campaigning but thereâs none of that now. The Tory battle bus still
ploughs up and down the countryâs motorways carrying the media from one event
to the next but it feels the real electioneering is happening somewhere else. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

The group, which includes survivors of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing and attacks in London, also says all venues must set up anti-terror security plans. Its demands follow Friday's London Bridge attack, in which two people were stabbed to death. Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, arebeing honoured in a remembrance serviceat Guildhall Yard in the City of London on Monday. London Bridge attack: What we know so far 'Heroes' praised for confronting attacker Johnson says 74 terror prisoners released early Boris Johnson launched an urgent review after it emerged that convicted terrorist Usman Khan - who was shot dead by police following Friday's attack - had been released having served half his sentence. The prime minister blamed legislation introduced when Labour was in power and said there were currently 74 people convicted of terrorist offences who had been released early. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the Conservatives of trying to keep people safe ""on the cheap"" and called for more funding for public services, including probation and mental health. The survivors' group, which has written to the Daily Telegraph outlining its demands, includes Brendan Cox, whose wife the Labour MPJo Cox was killed in 2016and Gina Van Dort, whose husband Chris Dyer died in theTunisia attack in 2015,in which 30 Britons were murdered. Its letter says: ""We are sick of the promises [made by politicians] that never materialise. The promises to look after victims who then face months of delay for mental health support or years of waiting for compensation. ""We ask all of the parties to agree to consult on and implement a new 'Survivors' Charter' that would guarantee basic rights and services for survivors."" Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones were killed during a conference to rehabilitate offenders near London Bridge The group wants MPs to back ""Martyn's Law"", compelling all owners of events spaces to have in place a ""basic security plan"". This is named after Martyn Hett, killed in the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017, in which 22 people were killed. The group says it is ""sick of promises that never materialise"" but praises the ""heroes"" who confronted Khan on London Bridge, preventing him from continuing his attack. It also asks the public not to ""give the terrorists what they want by sharing videos or views from attackers or by blaming whole groups or giving in to hate"". And it wants the media to ""allow survivors the space to recover after terrorist incidents and to focus coverage on the heroes rather than the attackers"". Three people were injured in Friday's attack, which Khan began at a prisoner rehabilitation conference, organised by Cambridge University, at Fishmongers' Hall, next to London Bridge. Two of the injured remain in hospital and are described as being in a stable condition.

Trump refuses to attend impeachment hearing,"Mr Trump and his counsel would have had the opportunity to ask questions at the hearing The White House has said US President Donald Trump and his lawyers will not attend an impeachment hearing on Wednesday, citing a lack of ""fairness"". The hearing by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee marks the next stage of the probe, with legal experts giving testimony that could lead to a vote of impeachment. It is alleged the president pressured Ukraine to conduct two investigations for his own political gain. Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing. After weeks of closed-door witness interviews and public hearings, the process will now focus on possible charges of misconduct, which could lead to an impeachment vote in the House and trial in the Republican-led Senate. The Democratic-led inquiry centres on a phone call in July between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr Trump has dismissed the process as a ""witch hunt"". Trump impeachment inquiry: A simple guide The impeachment story explained Who's who in the Trump-Ukraine story? Last Wednesday, Jerrold Nadler,the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, invited Mr Trump to attend this week's hearing, ""directly or through a counsel"", saying it would be an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis for impeachment. But in a letter to the committee, White House counsel Pat Cipollone accused the committee of a ""complete lack of due process and fundamental fairness"", saying the invitation would fail to give the White House adequate time to prepare and did not give information about the witnesses. Reports suggested witnesses were ""apparently all academics"" and would include ""no fact witnesses"", Mr Cipollone said. A fact witness testifies their personal knowledge of events while an expert witness assists the judge by offering an opinion. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Mr Cipollone also said the committee had called three witnesses but allowed Republicans to call just one, and lambasted Mr Nadler's claim that the process was ""consistent"" with historical impeachment inquiries, arguing that President Bill Clinton had a fairer hearing in 1998. In order for Mr Trump to be represented in further hearings, the president's counsel said, Mr Nadler would need to ensure ""that due process rights are protected"" and that the process was ""fair and just"".

The letter also accused Democrats of scheduling the hearing ""no doubt purposefully"" to conflict with Mr Trump's visit this week to London for a Nato summit. He is due to return to Washington after the judiciary committee hearing. Mr Cipollone's letter did not say whether Mr Trump would attend a second hearing, which does not yet have a date, but added that a response would be given by Friday. Democrats say Mr Trump dangled two bargaining chips - $400m (Â£309m) of military aid to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting with Ukraine's new leader. They think this political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounts to an abuse of power. The first investigation Mr Trump wanted from Ukraine was into one of his main Democratic challengers, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. Hunter joined the board of a Ukrainian company when Joe Biden was US vice-president. The second Trump demand was that Ukraine try to corroborate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the last US presidential election. This theory has been widely debunked, and the US intelligence agencies are unanimous in saying Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016. A SIMPLE GUIDE:If you want a basic take, this one is for you GO DEEPER:Here is a 100, 300 and 800-word summary of the story WHAT IS IMPEACHMENT?A political process to remove a president VIEW FROM TRUMP COUNTRY:Reaction from a West Virginia town CONTEXT:Why Ukraine matters to the US FACT-CHECK:Is the whistleblower linked to the Democrats? First the White House said it would not co-operate with the impeachment probe because it was not formally authorised by the House of Representatives. Then, Donald Trump complained that the congressionally approved process in the Intelligence Committee violated his legal due-process rights. Now the White House says it won't send lawyers to the first Judiciary Committee hearing this week, even though they are permitted to participate. The president still has the opportunity to change course, and Wednesday's hearing could turn out to be a stuffy academic discussion about the impeachment process with little lasting impact, but it's a sign that the White House feels things may be breaking Mr Trump's way. Opinion polls indicate the public's view of impeachment is solidifying on party lines. Those who like the president want the process to end; those who hate him want him gone, whether through impeachment or next November's election. That's a recipe for partisan stalemate. And as long as Republicans continue to stick together, the president has an impenetrable defence against removal from office. While the White House may not be winning the impeachment fight, it's not losing either - and for now that's reason enough to keep the process at arm's length. At the heart of the inquiry is the rough transcript of a phone call on 25 July between Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky, in which Mr Trump asks for ""a favour"" and wants Ukraine to ""look into"" corruption claims involving the Bidens. These claims remain unsubstantiated. The call prompted a whistleblower complaint from an unidentified CIA officer who said Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"". That complaint sparked an impeachment inquiry which has featured diplomats and White House aides giving testimony to Congress. Several testified that there was a ""shadow"" foreign policy to push Ukraine into opening these investigations, and to announce them publicly. The witnesses linked the president to the promise of a White House meeting but none had direct knowledge he had personally held back the military aid. However, Democrats say the evidence is overwhelming that Mr Trump orchestrated the pressure campaign, and point to an admission of a ""quid pro quo"" by White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney at a press conference. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said the committees leading the probe - Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs - are now working on their report, which will be issued on 3 December. On Wednesday, legal experts yet to be named are expected to be heard by the Judiciary Committee, which is responsible for crafting articles of impeachment, or the charges of wrongdoing against the president. It is expected that those charges will be drafted this month. After a vote in the Democratic-controlled House, a trial would be held in the Senate. The White House and some Republicans want the trial to be limited to two weeks. If Mr Trump was convicted by a two-thirds majority - an outcome deemed highly unlikely - he would become the first US president to be removed from office through impeachment.

Disabled workers face a 12.2% pay gap,"Disabled employees are paid 12.2% less than their non-disabled peers, according to official data. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that in 2018 the median pay for non-disabled workers was Â£12.11 an hour, against Â£10.63 for disabled. London had the widest disability pay gap at 15.3%, with the narrowest in Scotland, at 8.3%. The gap was the widest for those in their 30s and 40s,the ONS said in its report,external. The data underlines the struggle facing many disabled workers, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) said. ""Too many disabled people continue to face prejudice and struggle to get into employment or to remain in work, and are less likely to progress to senior management roles or to work in professional occupations,"" said the CIPD's Dr Jill Miller. ""Businesses that aren't inclusive - and don't manage health and disability effectively - risk missing out on hard-working and talented individuals, and damaging their reputation among staff and customers."" Angela Matthews, head of policy and research at Business Disability Forum, added: ""Disabled workers are not 'one group'. Some people with disabilities do not experience many barriers in work, and others experience many, multiple barriers. ""But we know that unjustified attitudes about what various groups of disabled people can and can't do are still widespread, and affect many employment related issues, including equal pay, bonus pay, and pay increases,"" Ms Matthews said. The ONS report is the first analysis of disability pay gaps in the UK using newly reweighted earnings data from theAnnual Population Survey.,external To define disability, the ONS uses theGovernment Statistical Service (GSS) definition,external. This identifies ""disabled"" as a person who has a physical or mental health condition, or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more, that reduces their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. What's pledged for disability and mental health? 'Little sign of change' for women in top roles The ONS said disabled females were in general paid 10.1% less than non-disabled females in 2018 - narrower than the pay gap between disabled and non-disabled male employees who had a gap of 11.6%. However, employment rates for disabled men and women were similar at 51.7% and 50.4%. The ONS also found that those disabled employees with mental impairments had the biggest pay gap at 18.6%, while the gap was 9.7% for the physically impaired. Much of the difference in pay can be put down to factors such as what employees do and how qualified they are, the agency said. Using the GSS definition of disability, the ONS said 18.9% of people in the UK aged 16 to 64 years were disabled in 2018. Women were more likely to be disabled than men, at 21.1% and 16.6%, respectively. What's pledged for disability and mental health?

UK motorists start VW 'dieselgate' legal action,"Volkswagen ""cheated"" European emissions rules designed ""to save lives"" by installing unlawful ""defeat devices"" in diesel cars, the High Court has heard. Tens of thousands of UK motorists who bought VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda diesel cars are taking legal action in the aftermath of the ""dieselgate"" scandal. The claimants' QC Tom de la Mare said: ""It is difficult to think of a more obvious cheat than the one VW used."" Volkswagen has said it will ""defend robustly its position"". In 2015, VW admitted 11 million cars worldwide - including 1.2 million in the UK - had software that reduced readings of emissions in tests. However, the UK hearing, expected to last two weeks, centres on whether that software constitutes a ""defeat device"" under EU regulations. In his opening remarks, Mr de la Mare told the court that VW engines were ""optimised to minimise the amount of pollutants"" in emissions tests, meaning the vehicles operated in a ""completely different way in the street to how it operated in the test"". He added: ""It is difficult to think of a more obvious cheat than the one VW used."" Mr de la Mare said European emissions standards were designed ""to save lives"", adding that ""the most up-to-date evidence"" showed that pollution was ""killing approximately 1,000 people a day in Europe"". He said internal VW documents showed that the company has ""long known that the software was unlawful and indefensible"", pointing to one document in which a VW employee said the vehicles would ""flunk"" emissions tests without the software. He submitted that the documents showed a ""clear acceptance that the software was the only basis on which they were meeting the emissions limits"". VW's barrister, Michael Fordham QC, argued in written submissions that the claimants had misunderstood the legal definition of a defeat device. In a statement before the hearing, a VW spokeswoman said: ""Volkswagen Group continues to defend robustly its position in the High Court in London. ""It remains Volkswagen Group's case that the claimants did not suffer any loss at all and that the affected vehicles did not contain a prohibited defeat device."" Volkswagen has faced a flurry of legal action worldwide, and has been forced to pay out more than â¬30bn (Â£26bn) in fines, recall costs and civil settlements. The carmaker's current and former senior employees are facing criminal charges in Germany. The English litigation was filed back in 2016, but has now reached what the claimants' lawyers have called ""a decisive court battle"". Gareth Pope, head of group litigation at Slater and Gordon, which represents more than 70,000 of almost 90,000 claimants, said before the start of the hearing: ""This trial will establish once and for all whether VW installed prohibited 'defeat devices' in affected vehicles and is a significant milestone in our clients' attempts to hold VW accountable in the UK. ""This is a decisive point for VW. For years, the carmaker has deceived its customers, marketing cars as complying with emissions standards while all the time knowing they were emitting many times more than the allowed level of toxic pollutants, perpetrating an environmental and health scandal. ""VW has had plenty of opportunity to come clean, make amends and move on from this highly damaging episode. ""But instead it's chosen to spend millions of pounds denying the claims our clients have been forced to bring against it rather than paying that to their own customers in compensation."" One of the claimants, Brian Levine - who bought two affected Volkswagens - told the Press Association: ""VW's tactics have been to delay and prevaricate - anything but face a day when it would have to explain what this software did. Well, that day has finally come. ""More than four years after the emissions scandal broke, the tens of thousands of customers will be able to hold VW to account in a British court of law and expose its efforts to cheat us."" Buying a car is one of the big financial decisions we make. We pay a hefty price for a brand we trust and expect the specifications to be as promised. But VW argues that the drivers claiming they were fooled by a defeat device will not qualify for compensation whatever the merits of their case, because they haven't suffered a loss. And VW denies having a defeat device, anyway, despite findings against the carmaker in other countries. Waiting for a result from this case will feel like being trapped in the mother of all traffic jams. Lawyers involved are expecting the whole process could take two to three years.

Amazon pulls Auschwitz-themed Christmas ornaments,"Auschwitz was the largest of the Nazi concentration camps Amazon has withdrawn a range of ""Christmas ornaments"" displaying images of a former concentration camp that sellers had posted on its website. The move followed a tweet from Poland's Auschwitz Memorial calling on the retailer to remove the ""disturbing and disrespectful"" merchandise. It included Christmas tree decorations, a bottle opener and a mouse-pad. All displayed scenes from the Nazi death camp where mass killing was conducted in World War Two. The Christmas merchandise featured images from Auschwitz including the railway line leading to its infamous gates, the barbed wire fences and the buildings where it housed victims - mainly Jews. The memorial and museum later posted an update to say the items had been removed and thanked social media users for their ""activity and response"" after the post attracted thousands of retweets.

Ted Baker probes Â£25m stock inventory blunder,"Fashion retailer Ted Baker has said it may have overstated the value of its stock by between Â£20m and Â£25m. Law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer is to carry out a review, and independent accountants will also be appointed to investigate. Shares in Ted Baker fell to a 10-year low as analysts described the news as ""less than ideal"" and a ""blunder"". This year, former boss Ray Kelvin stepped down over misconduct claims, while sales and profits have tumbled. In the latest setback, Ted Baker said it may have accounted for up to Â£25m of stock, mainly clothing, on its balance sheet that did not exist. The company said in a statement,external: ""Ted Baker is committed to ensuring the independent review is completed in an efficient and transparent manner and will update the market as appropriate. Whilst the review is ongoing, the company will not comment further."" Ted Baker added, however, that it did not expect any cash impact from the overstatement of inventory. The problems are the latest setback in a difficult year for the firm. In March, Mr Kelvin - who had been chief executive since the company's launch in 1988 -resigned over claims he presided over a culture of ""forced hugging"". He has denied all allegations of misconduct. The company has also seen its sales, profits and share price tumble. In October, the retailer reported a Â£23m loss for the six months to 10 August, down from a Â£24.5m profit last year. For years Ted Baker bucked the trend with growing sales and profits, a business which knew its customers and pitched its products at the right price. But it's had a turbulent 2019. Ray Kelvin turned the business from a single store in Glasgow into a global brand. He was one of the UK's most successful retailers. In many ways Ray Kelvin was Ted Baker. His departure was bound to have some impact on the brand, especially when it came to innovation and quirkiness. But some wonder whether its troubles point to far deeper issues within the business. For instance, has Ted Baker become too expensive in a very competitive market where rivals are discounting like mad. This blunder is the last thing it needs. News of the inventory problems come just weeks after the company appointed Rachel Osborne as its new finance head. The issue was also mentioned in Ted Baker's last annual report based on information from its auditors, KPMG. The accounting giant said it had uncovered mis-statements but concluded they were too small to affect the fashion label's accounts. Retail analysts at Liberum said: ""Today's latest news from Ted Baker, regarding the overstatement of last year's inventory value, is less than ideal."" AJ Bell's investment director Russ Mould said it appeared that ""Ted Baker has found another banana to slip up on"". ""Discovering that the value of inventory on its balance sheet has been overstated is a huge blunder on its behalf,"" he said. ""It suggests that the business hasn't got a grip on its numbers which is a bit worrying considering that new chief executive Lindsay Page used to be the finance director. ""Appointing a law firm and the intention to bring in independent accountants will raise questions about whether more serious problems are bubbling under the surface at the business.""

Whale dies with 100kg 'litter ball' in its stomach,"A sperm whale which died after stranding on the Isle of Harris had a 100kg ""litter ball"" in its stomach. Fishing nets, rope, packing straps, bags and plastic cups were among the items discovered in a compacted mass. Whale experts said it was not immediately clear whether the debris had contributed to the whale's death. But locals who found the carcass on Seilebost beach on Thursday said it highlighted the wider problem of marine pollution. Netting and bundles of rope were among the items found inside the whale Dan Parry, who lives in nearby Luskentyre, said: ""It was desperately sad, especially when you saw the fishing nets and debris that came out of its stomach. ""We walk on these beaches nearly every day and I always take a bag to pick up litter, most of which is fishing-related. ""This stuff could have easily been netting or the like lost in a storm, we just don't know, but it does show the scale of the problem we have with marine pollution."" Members of the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (Smass), an organisation that investigates the deaths of whales and dolphins, dissected the whale to try and determine its cause of death. A post on the group's Facebook page stated: ""The animal wasn't in particularly poor condition, and whilst it is certainly plausible that this amount of debris was a factor in its live stranding, we actually couldn't find evidence that this had impacted or obstructed the intestines. ""This amount of plastic in the stomach is nonetheless horrific, must have compromised digestion, and serves to demonstrate yet again the hazards that marine litter and lost or discarded fishing gear can cause to marine life."" The debris is believed to have originated from both the land and the fishing industry. The Coastguard and workers from Western Isles Council helped with the examination of the whale on Saturday, as well as digging a giant hole on the beach to bury the sub-adult male. According to Smass figuresreports of whale and dolphin strandings in Scotland are on the increase. There were 204 reports in 2009, rising to more than 930 in 2018.

Climate talks open as 'point of no return' loomsPoliticians and diplomats meet in Spain as scientists and charities say urgent steps are needed.Science & EnvironmentComments,"This video can not be played COP25: What you need to know about the climate conference The president of an island nation on the frontline of climate change says it is in a ""fight to the death"" after freak waves inundated the capital. Powerful swells averaging 5m (16ft) washed across the capital of the Marshall Islands, Majuro, last week. But President Hilda Heine said the Pacific nation had been fighting rising tides even before last week's disaster. Political leaders and climate diplomats are meeting in Madrid for two weeks of talks amid a growing sense of crisis. This conference of the parties, or COP25, was due to be held in Chile but was cancelled by the government due to weeks of civil disturbances. Spain then stepped in to host the event, which will see 29,000 attendees over the two weeks of talks. Greenhouse gas concentrations break records Massive Attack help create carbon-zero tours Critical year for climate change What is climate change? Climate change: Where we are in seven charts School protesters are among those who have taken to the streets The world's average surface temperature is rising rapidly because human activities release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). These gasestrap heat in the atmosphere, a bit like the glass roof of a greenhouse. At the meeting, Ms Heine commented: ""Water covers much of our land at one or other point of the year as we fight rising tides.  As we speak hundreds of people have evacuated their homes after large waves caused the ocean to inundate parts of our capital in Majuro last week."" She added: ""It's a fight to the death for anyone not prepared to flee. As a nation we refuse to flee.  But we also refuse to die."" Ms Heine is not alone in the view that small nations like the Marshall Islands face an imminent existential threat. At the Madrid summit, ambassador Lois Young, from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which represents low-lying coastal countries and small island nations, launched a rebuke to the world's big polluters. ""We are disappointed by inadequate action by developed countries and outraged by the dithering and retreat of one of the most culpable polluters from the Paris Agreement,"" she said. ""In the midst of a climate emergency, retreat and inaction are tantamount to sanctioning ecocide. They reflect profound failure to honour collective global commitment to protect the most vulnerable. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map ""With our very existence at stake, COP 25 must demonstrate unprecedented ambition to avert ecocide."" The COP25 meeting will aim to step up ambition so that all countries increase their national commitments to cut emissions. The meeting follows on the heels of three UN reports which stressed the increased urgency of limiting dangerous climate change. According to UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres, ""the point of no return is no longer over the horizon"". Speaking ahead of the meeting, he said political leaders had to respond to the imminent climate crisis. This video can not be played The man who took wind power to another level ""In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. ""We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions,"" Mr Guterres said. Almost every country in the world has now signed and ratified the Paris climate agreement and under the terms of the pact they will all have to put new climate pledges on the table before the end of 2020. The UN secretary general says no new coal-fired power stations should be built after 2020 This meeting in Madrid signals the start of a frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November next year. Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend the meeting in the Spanish capital - but US President Donald Trump will not be among them. The US became a signatory to the landmark Paris climate agreement in April 2016, under the Obama administration. But President Trump has said the accord - which has been signed by more than 190 countries - would lead to lost jobs and lower wages for American workers. Last month, hebegan the process of withdrawing from the Paris deal. However, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, will attend the conference with a congressional delegation. While her presence has been welcomed, US environmentalists want to see concrete steps on climate. ""While it's great Speaker Pelosi is coming to Madrid in place of Trump, symbolic gestures are no substitute for bold action,"" said Jean Su from the US Center for Biological Diversity. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA ""America remains the number one historic contributor to the climate emergency, and even Democratic politicians have never committed to taking responsibility for our fair share."" Underlining the real world impacts of climate change, a report from the charity Save the Children, says that what it calls ""climate shocks"" are threatening tens of millions of people in East and Southern Africa. The charity says 33 million people are at emergency levels of food insecurity due to cyclones and droughts. More than half of these are believed to be children. The situation has been made worse because the two strongest cyclones ever to hit the African continent, affected the same region just weeks apart. This video can not be played What is global warming?

Morning-after pill 'should be sold off the shelf',"Women and girls should be able to get hold of emergency contraception more easily without the need for a consultation with a pharmacist, say women's health experts. A report by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends the morning-after pill ""should be sold straight off the shelf"", like condoms. There are too many barriers to health services for women in the UK, it says. And their needs should be a priority. The report,Better for Women,external, is also calling for women to be allowed to take the first abortion pill at home,as well as the second, if they know they are less than 10 weeks pregnant. It said women should be able to have a consultation for an early medical abortion over the phone or via Skype. The report also recommends a network of one-stop health clinics for women, offering smear tests, contraceptives and advice all in one place. At the moment, women and girls have to have a consultation with a pharmacist before they can be given anemergency contraceptive, or morning-after pill,external- taken within five days of unprotected sex. This can leave them feeling ""uncomfortable, embarrassed or judged"", the report says. It recommends that the morning-after pill should be available ""in front of the counter"" and off the shelf, alongside pregnancy tests and condoms. Jane, 25, from the West Midlands, was turned away by the first pharmacy she visited to get the morning-after pill because they had no appointments that day. After protesting, she eventually saw a pharmacist and was given the emergency contraceptive - but only after lots of questioning. She said she felt as if she'd done something wrong. ""I felt really judged and patronised. I'm pretty sure he said something like, 'That was silly',"" Jane says. ""After that I just felt angry that women are made to go through this when there is a really simple solution."" Emergency contraception is available free of charge without prescription from all pharmacies in Scotland and Wales. In England, contraception services are commissioned locally and are on offer in sexual health clinics, some GP surgeries and most pharmacies - but are not always free of charge. Contraception: Which is most effective? Are women turning their back on the pill? Women 'struggling to access contraception' The College says cuts to public health budgets have made it more difficult for women to access the services they need -figures obtained by the BBC last yearsuggest nearly half of councils in England had plans to reduce contraception services. This may have led to rising conception rates and abortions among older women, because of unplanned pregnancies, the report says. In 2018, more than 205,000 abortions were performed in England and Wales. The report also calls for theprogestogen-only contraceptive pill,external, taken once a day, to be available over the counter in pharmacies instead of with a prescription from a GP. It says girls and women should be able to order the pills online like any other pharmacy product. Prof Lesley Regan, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the progestogen-only contraceptive pill (Pop) was very safe, and a consultation with a GP before starting to take it was ""unnecessary"". The report also recommends: long-term contraception should be discussed straight after a woman gives birth improved access to abortions for all women one-stop women's health clinics should be set up and open at weekends and evenings three full cycles of IVF should be offered to all eligible women in the UK GP appointment times should be extended to 15 minutes The report said: ""Too many women are spending years in pain and discomfort because [GP] appointment times are too short and demands on the time of doctors and other healthcare professionals are too great. ""This makes women less likely to talk about their issues."" The report points out that longer appointments would save the NHS money in the long term. Dr Asha Kasliwal, president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said women and girls, including under-18s, must have free and timely access to all methods of emergency contraception. ""While emergency contraception is free in some places in England, many will choose to access it in pharmacies where cost and opening times vary considerably. ""Consultations with pharmacists are highly recommended and best practice, as this is a valuable opportunity for individuals to discuss their contraceptive needs with a healthcare professional. ""However, a consultation should not be a barrier to receiving emergency contraception."" Prof Regan said the key was ensuring services were more joined up and responsive to the need of girls and women. ""It is important we provide a comprehensive health service for girls and women throughout their lives. ""We want to empower 51% of the population to be as healthy as possible and ensure no-one is left behind,"" she said.

Thousands could be without gas for five days,"This video can not be played Colette Dunn said she has been using boiled kettles to make bath-time for her daughter possible Hundreds of engineers are visiting homes in the Falkirk area as part of a major operation to tackle a gas network failure. Thousands of people spent the night without heat in freezing temperatures after the outage on Sunday morning. Heaters and portable cookers have been distributed to vulnerable residents and 14 schools and nurseries are closed. Gas infrastructure company SGN said it had now begun reconnecting supplies to homes across the area. The company said previously that it had hoped to visit all 8,000 affected properties by Monday afternoon. By 21:30 on Monday, SGN confirmed it had reconnected gas to 3,000 properties. Latest updates from SGN,external Thousands facing 'several days' without gas More than 250 engineers are going door-to-door to turn off gas supplies at the meter for safety reasons. Falkirk Council said themajority of schools in the area,external, as well as Kinnaird Waters early learning and childcare centre, would reopen on Tuesday. Bainsford primary school and nursery class, Larbert early learning and childcare centre, and Kinnaird primary school and Thistle Wing will remain closed. SGN has warned some homes could be without gas supplies until the weekend in the ""worst-case scenario"". Angelene Perry's children donned blankets and woolly hats as the family struggled to stay warm Mother-of-four Angelene Perry, who has a nine-month-old baby, said she had borrowed four radiators from a friend and has been given a stove and two fan heaters by SGN to heat one room. She said: ""We're using the kettle just now to boil all our water. ""I'm just thinking at the moment how I'm going to go through the week, and just really thinking about night time. ""During the day we're OK, we can huddle into one room, but just trying to plan ahead for the week."" International Rescue Corps has helped distribute supplies to homes in the area SGN spokesman Denis Kerby said they were working to restore supplies as quickly as possible. ""That might be a couple of days but in terms of getting everyone back on, we're looking at five days,"" he told theBBC's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme. ""It could be up to Friday, it could even creep into the weekend - that is really the worst-case scenario."" Affected residents have received hot plates and fan heaters He said engineers needed to visit every home even if residents have managed the turn off their own supplies. Mr Kerby said that SGN apologised for the fault as it was ""our piece of equipment that's failed."" He said: ""However, what we are doing is making sure people are getting their gas back as quickly as possible. ""So this is making sure that no one who has a vulnerability is going to be missed."" Residents have been told they could be waiting for up to five days for their supplies to be restored. To ensure the gas supply is managed in a safe way: Customers are initially told by the gas emergency service to turn off the gas themselves at a switch beside their meters Engineers have to check every home to ensure the gas has been turned off before it can restore supplies If the gas is not fully off, when the supply is restored it could quickly fill the home Some homes that receive gas from other parts of the network will still have supplies Once the gas is back in the network, engineers make return visits to homes to reconnect supplies Engineers need to relight some boilers and check that appliances are working safely If gas meters are inside homes, engineers must be given access, however, if they are outside (in a white or brown meter box) access is not needed. Affected householders will be compensated for their time without gas. Find outmore here,external. A problem with a ""governor"" station which regulates gas pressure in the local network developed at about 04:30 Sunday. Thousands of people woke up to discover they had no heating or hot water as their boilers shut down. SGN said homes in Bainsford, Carron, Carronshore, Larbert, Langlees, New Carron Village, Skinflats and Stenhousemuir  were affected. Meanwhile, residents have also been warned to be ""mindful"" of their electricity use, following a number of power outages in the area overnight. On Twitter,police said,external: ""Scottish Power is asking people in the Falkirk area is to be mindful of their electricity use over the coming days as there's increased demand on the electricity network with people using heaters while they're without gas. Fire service staff are helping with the distribution of heaters and hotplates With overnight temperatures dipping below zero, people living in the area are being urged to check on vulnerable neighbours. Falkirk Council made the Camelon Community Centre available to SGN, which was handing out portable heating and cooking equipment to elderly, sick or disabled customers and those with young children. A mobile catering unit was also distributing hot food. Mr Kerby added: ""Our priority is vulnerable customers. We are liaising with the local authority and our partners in the community to make sure we can visit all the people who may need that extra bit of help. ""We would also appeal to people to be really good neighbours - and please check on any elderly neighbours or anyone in the vicinity who may need some extra help."" Engineers hope to visit all affected homes by Monday afternoon One local resident, David McCallan, told BBC Scotland that his home was like an ""ice box"" when he woke up on Monday morning, until he switched on a heater supplied by SGN. ""It's not a great heat but it's sufficient to keep myself and my wife warm enough."" Customers can request heating or cooking appliances by calling into Camelon Community Centre.

Vigil for London Bridge attack victims under way,"The family of Jack Merritt take part in a vigil at the Guildhall in Cambridge Vigils for the victims of the London Bridge attack have been held in London and Cambridge. Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were commemorated at the services, which included a minute's silence. They were stabbed to death by Usman Khan - convicted of terrorism in 2012 - at a prisoner rehabilitation event. The BBC has learned Khan, 28, was put under MI5 investigation when he left prison a year ago but was given one of the lowest priorities. Mr Merritt and Ms Jones were both graduates of the University of Cambridge's institute of criminology and had been taking part in an event for itsLearning Together programme- which focuses on education within the criminal justice system - when they were killed on Friday. 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker London Bridge: What we know so far Families lead tributes to London attack victims Mr Merritt's family and his girlfriend attended the service in Cambridge outside the Guildhall. This video can not be played London Bridge: Cambridge vigils held for attack victims Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among those at the vigil at the Guildhall in the City of London. They were joined London Mayor Sadiq Khan who said the best way to defeat the hatred shown in the attack was to focus on the values of hope, unity and love. Jack Merritt was a co-ordinator of the Learning Together programme and Saskia Jones a volunteer ""The best way to defeat this hatred is not by turning on one another, but it's by focussing on the values that bind us, to take hope from the heroism of ordinary Londoners and our emergency services who ran towards danger, risking their lives to help people they didn't even know,"" he said. The London service happened less than a mile from Fishmongers' Hall, where Usman Khan launched his attack. This video can not be played A moment of silence was held at the vigil for the victims in London Bishop of London Sarah Mullally said the vigils remembered ""academics celebrating rehabilitation and finding only danger"". She paid tribute to the workers at Fishmongers' Hall, who she said went to work to offer hospitality, but found themselves needing to give protection. A book of condolences is open at Guildhall Art Gallery and members of the public are invited to lay flowers outside nearby Mansion House. The vigil in Guildhall Yard in London was led by Bishop of London Sarah Mullally Members of the public also paid their tributes A vigil was also held at Anglia Ruskin University, where Saskia Jones attended before taking her masters at Cambridge The victims' familiespaid tribute to their loved onesover the weekend. Mr Merritt was a co-ordinator of the Learning Together programme and Ms Jones a volunteer Ms Jones's family said their daughter, from Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire,had a ""great passion"" for supporting victims of criminal injustice. In a statement, Mr Merritt's family described him as a""talented boy"" who ""died doing what he loved"". Mr Merritt's father went on to criticise the Daily Mail and Daily Express newspapers for their coverage of Prime Minister Boris Johnson'spromise to review licence conditionsplaced on convicted terrorists released from jail. On Twitter, David Merritt shared images of the Mail and Express front pages - which reported a ""blitz on freed jihadis"" -and wrote,external: ""Don't use my son's death, and his and his colleague's photos - to promote your vile propaganda. Jack stood against everything you stand for - hatred, division, ignorance."" Jack Merritt's family said he was 'looking forward to building a future with his girlfriend, Leanne' The family of Saskia Jones said her death ""will leave a huge void in our lives"" Cambridge University's vice-chancellor Prof Stephen J Toope said he was ""devastated to learn that among the victims were staff and alumni"". Toby Williamson, chief executive of Fishmongers' Hall, praised the bravery of his staff who intervened to stop the attacker, hailing their actions as ""extraordinary things done by ordinary people"". Mr Williamson told how Polish chef Lukasz suffered five wounds to his left-hand side as he fended off the knifeman with a narwhal tusk during ""about a minute of one-on-one straight combat"" - allowing others time to escape danger. This video can not be played The chief executive of Fishmongers Hall, Commodore Toby Williamson describes how his staff fought back Two others grabbed makeshift weapons including a fire extinguisher before the attacker fled down a staircase and then got trapped in reception. Dr Vin Diwakar, medical director for the NHS in London, said two people injured in the attack remained in a stable condition in hospital, while one had been able to return home. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Khan, who was released from prison in December 2018 after serving half of his sentence was shot dead by police on London Bridge. The BBC understands Khan was formally under investigation by MI5 as he left jail but placed in the second-to-bottom category of investigations as his initial risk to the public was thought to be minimal. This was consistent with the grading given to most other people convicted of terrorism offences as they go back into the community under a release licence. Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison? What is Learning Together? London Bridge sentencing row - who did what? A low level of prioritisation is assigned to offenders such as Khan because their release comes with a strict set of licence conditions. These conditions theoretically provide suitable monitoring and oversight, such as alerts if they contact other suspects or travel outside an approved area. Khan, the BBC has learned, was on the highest-level of such community monitoring. The overall package, in theory, relives pressure on MI5 so the security service can focus on more immediate threats. The prime minister said on Sunday that74 people jailed for terror offences and released early will have their licence conditions reviewed. Later that day, Staffordshire Police said a 34-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts - but added there was no information to suggest the man was involved in the London Bridge attack. The man has been named as Nazam Hussain, who was jailed in 2012 alongside Usman Khan and received the same sentence - 16 years with half of that served in prison - after pleading guilty to preparing acts of terrorism. Following his arrest, Hussain was recalled to prison due to a suspected breach of his licence conditions. Inquiries by detectives into the potential terrorism offences are continuing, police said. Another man, Yayha Rashid, 23, of north London, has been charged following his arrest on Sunday on suspicion of breaching notification requirements. The Metropolitan Police said Rashid's arrest was not connected with the London Bridge attack. Friday's incident comes after theUK's terrorism threat level was downgraded on 4 November from ""severe"" to ""substantial"", meaning that attacks were thought to be ""likely"" rather than ""highly likely"". The terror threat level is reviewed every six months by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which makes recommendations independent of government. Friday's attack took place close to where eight people died and 48 were injured by three men who drove into pedestrians on London Bridge, before stabbing people in Borough Market in June 2017.

Critical year for climate change,"An image showing carbon dioxide emissions over the Earth A critical 12 months in the battle against rising temperatures begins in Madrid this week, as UN delegates gather for key talks. The 25th Conference of the Parties, or COP, will see negotiators from almost 200 countries in attendance. Ahead of the meeting the UN secretary general has warned that the world is at the point of no return. AntÃ³nio Guterres said the global response to date has been ""utterly inadequate"". Massive Attack help create carbon-zero tours Is the climate passing some key 'tipping points'? Climate signal links global floods and fires The conference takes place amid a welter of bad news on climate change in recent days. The World Meteorological Organisation announced thatgreenhouse gas concentrations reached their highest recorded levelin 2018. The UN Environment Programme showed thatthere's a huge gap between the plans that governments currently have on the table to cut emissions and what's neededto keep under 1.5C. Keeping to that guardrail will need a five-fold increase in the carbon cutting ambitions of countries. The UN Secretary General warned delegates ahead of the meeting ""the point of no return was no longer over the horizon"". ""We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions,"" Mr Guterres said. As well as demanding that the negotiators increase their level of carbon cutting ambition at this meeting, Mr Guterres announced that the Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney will take on the role of UN Special Envoy on climate action and climate finance. Yes, this annual event, the Conference of the Parties or COP was due to take place in the Chilean capital Santiago this year.It was cancelled by President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era due to ongoing civil unrest in the country. After a brief flurry of diplomatic activity,Spain said they would step into the void and host the conference,external, with Chile still leading the diplomatic negotiations. The Spanish argue that it is critical to support a UN process that depends on global co-operation in the face of rising nationalism around the world. ""COP25 will reaffirm that multilateralism is the best tool to solve global challenges such as climate change,"" said Spain's minister for the ecological transition Teresa Ribera. ""Neither the UN nor the international community have let the climate agenda fall, despite the challenges to organise this event, because this is a vital moment to drive implementation and action. Spain immediately offered to organise the summit in record time. There is no turning back."" The hope is that this meeting will concentrate the minds of international diplomats on the huge scale of the challenge. Governments have promised to update their climate pledges by 2020, whenthe COP will be held in Glasgow. But so far, despite the urgings of scientists, major improvements in pledges have been slow to materialise. Many nations have aspirations to carbon neutrality in the long term, but they have been slow to put specific short-term commitments on the table. ""Some 70 countries have pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050, this must be carried on at Madrid COP,"" said Sonam Wangdi, the Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group in UN climate change negotiations. ""There must be an agreement among us all to do our fair share. If it doesn't happen in Madrid it could be too late for 2020 pledges."" The hope for Madrid is that the meeting can avoid major bust ups and keep edging forward. It also has to overcome two possible banana skins - loss and damage, and carbon markets. This issue has dogged the negotiations for several years now, but the likelihood is that it will come to a head in Madrid. Loss and damage are the impacts that can't be prevented or adapted to by countries. Extreme weather events like Cyclone Kenneth in Mozambique are said to be examples of loss and damage, say campaigners Some experts consider ""loss"" to apply to the complete destruction of something such as human lives, habitats and species. ""Damage"" refers to something that can be repaired, such as roads or buildings. So the examples that are given are rising sea levels which can't be prevented, or storms that are connected to rising temperatures. Back in 2013, under pressure from developing countries, the climate talks set up a special forum to discuss loss and damage. In Madrid the delegates must decide how to progress. Poorer nations want the loss and damage to have teeth within the UN setup, and more importantly, funding. ""Everybody has to recognise that there is a need and then there must be a funding window,"" said Sonam Wangdi from the LDCs. ""Once you have that, where the funding comes from is secondary, right now there is no fund."" Rich countries fear that the whole question is a way of tying them into paying out for sea level rise and storms for centuries ahead, because the bulk of the carbon in the atmosphere comes from fossil fuels used by the developed world. As the conference starts, 150 environmental groups including climate activists Naomi Klein and Lidy Nacpil have written to ministers calling for adequate funding for loss and damage. They say the combination of climate disasters and debt can prove toxic for developing nations. ""The climate crisis has been causing death, despair and displacement in the global south,"" said Harjeet Singh from Action Aid. ""This bullying of the countries hardest hit by climate change, by those that got rich from extracting and consuming fossil fuels, must end now."" Hot air is in fact one of the big concerns with the question of carbon markets. In the past richer countries have often paid for carbon reduction projects in poorer nations. The wealthy have then been able to count the carbon saved from these projects against their own emissions. These schemes were discredited amid accusations of fraud and ""double counting"" where both the poor and the rich countries counted the same emissions reduction as part of their plans. A wind farm in China built with funding from richer countries. The carbon credits created by projects like this are controversial Article six of the Paris agreement set out to reform these carbon markets, recognising that if they were transparent and effective they could really help to raise ambitions. Discussions on how the new arrangements would work were due to be completed in Katowice at the COP last year butthey ran into real problems. Brazil resisted all attempts to curtail double counting. Other countries wanted to carry forward carbon credits from older schemes. Some also want to be able to sell or carry forward credits if they overachieve on their existing carbon cutting plans, which observers feel would encourage countries to set a low bar in terms of commitments. Experts often call these types of credits ""hot air"" as they are more an accounting exercise than a real reduction in carbon dioxide. The amount of ""hot air"" is huge, running into billions of tonnes of carbon. Experts fear that these could undermine the integrity of the Paris pact if they are allowed to continue. ""We believe that these markets will have an impact but they must result in real reductions on the ground,"" said Sonam Wangdi from the LDCs. ""The option is needed and the carbon market is one of the tools - but there needs to be environmental integrity and they need to be transparent and there needs to be real reductions there."" Trying to get unanimous agreement between almost 200 countries on how to tackle climate change is a really big ask. The agreement that was struck in Paris in 2015 only came about after six long years of snail pace negotiations. It was the deal that diplomats had hoped to strike in the failed Copenhagen COP in 2009. So if the goal is that countries have new promises in place by the end of 2020, Madrid is an important snapshot of what can realistically be achieved. Countries often tend to hold back on their pledges until they see what others are likely to do. Madrid will give a sense of whether there is a willingness from some of the larger countries, like India, China and the EU, to show leadership. ""After 30 years of advocacy and optimism, we see COP 25 as the last opportunity to take decisive action,"" said Ambassador Janine Felson from Belize, the deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States. ""Anything short of a vastly greater commitment to emission reduction through new national plans that are consistent with our fight for a 1.5 degree world, greater momentum towards honouring outstanding 2020 climate finance commitments, a new climate finance goal suitable for achieving a 1.5 degree world and tangible support for disaster risk reduction and reconstruction in small island and developing states will signal a willingness to accept catastrophe."" This could be the last year in which a US team will play a part in the negotiations. On 4 November President Trump sent a formal letter to the UN, which has triggered the 12-month countdown to the US pullout. President Trump has kept a campaign promise to his supporters to pull out of the Paris pact The Americans are due to leave on 4 November 2020, one day after the next US presidential election and five days ahead of the critical COP26 in Glasgow. The US has been playing a more truculent role in recent negotiations, joining with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia to prevent the conference welcoming a key IPCC report on how the world can keep temperatures under 1.5C this century. Over the past couple of years the US has also supported side events promoting coal and will likely continue to do so in the future. Even if they do withdraw completely next year, that will only be from the Paris agreement part of the negotiations. The US will still be party to the UN climate convention. It is unlikely they will stop sending teams to the conferences. Just a year ago, Greta Thunberg attended the Katowice COP as a relatively unknown Swedish student who was taking direct action in striking from school for the climate. A year later and she has become a global icon who can get a standing ovation from diplomats by calling out their hypocrisy on rising temperatures. Greta's dedication to the cause has been enhanced by her decision to cross the Atlantic in a yacht to attend the Santiago meeting. Now she is on another boat on her way back to Madrid. She is due to arrive a few days after the start. Her participation and her speech will likely make headlines around the world. Conferences like the COP are rooted in a traditional UN diplomatic that requires a unanimous agreement on steps forward. While environmental campaigners and others can observe, there is limited input from young people, school strikers and other voices. Nordic countries are attempting to do something different this year with ministers from Sweden, Finland and Iceland inviting five young people from different countries to take part in discussions with politicians and report back from COP25.

Arctic coal for India threatens wildlife,"An icebreaker (red) escorts Russian cargo ships on the Northern Sea Route Natural riches come in two conflicting types in Russia's Arctic north: valuable minerals and spectacular wildlife. But sadly for many threatened species, the decline in Arctic sea ice has created a new economic opportunity for Russia in their remote habitat. In a decree last year President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian firms to boost cargo traffic on the Northern Sea Route to an annual 80m tonnes by 2024. Ambitious energy co-operation deals were signed with India in Vladivostok, in Russia's far east, in October. One centres on a big open-cast coal mining project in the Taymyr Peninsula, in the far north of central Siberia. The area is rich in high-quality coking coal (anthracite), used to make steel and aluminium. Dharmendra Pradhan, India's Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, said: ""We are the second largest coal importer in the world, and we intend to achieve production of 3m tonnes of steel per year by 2030, so we need to increase coal supplies."" The Taymyr coal mining is open-cast, like at this mine in Yakutia, eastern Russia But Taymyr is a haven for wildlife. It has Russia's largest nature reserve - Bolshoi Arkticheskiy - covering 4.2m hectares (16,200 sq miles). On TV President Putin presents himself as a caring conservationist,famously relaxing in Siberia's unspoilt wilderness.,external But he is also championing the expansion of fossil fuel projects in that wilderness. Russia is boosting trade with China, India and other growing Asian markets hungry for raw materials. Coal is to contribute to meeting that 80m-tonne target for Arctic deliveries, which will go via Russia's far east. But such shipments pose considerable risks. Despite global warming, icebreakers still play a key role, as winter temperatures plunge below minus 20C. Remote settlements lack equipment to deal with any pollution emergency. And long voyages to India will mean more greenhouse gas emissions from shipping. Russia floating nuclear power station sets sail The Arctic is estimated to have 72% of Russia's total gas reserves. Oil and gas mega-projects are far advanced further west, notably on the Yamal Peninsula. The snowy owl (L) and red-breasted goose: many bird species flock to Taymyr In Taymyr the coastal tundra - marshland with permanently frozen subsoil - is a nesting ground for migratory birds, which fly there for the brief Arctic summer. Polar bears sometimes come ashore on Taymyr while, inland, vast reindeer herds roam and snowy owls hunt lemmings. Along with the pollution threat, reindeer are now seriously threatened by poaching, says Alexey Knizhnikov, a conservationist at WWF Russia. ""Developing new projects in such an ecologically sensitive area is madness, in our view,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played Human-polar bear confrontations are becoming ever more common due to the effects of climate change There is already pollution with heavy metals and sulphur dioxide (SO2) around the city of Norilsk, from the Norilsk Nickel ore smelter. Russia firm admits 'red river' spillage A Greenpeace study published in August said:,external""In terms of individual hotspots, the Norilsk smelter complex continues to be the largest SO2 emission hotspot in the world."" It also found India to be the world's top SO2 emitter. Now a bay just south of Dikson - a tiny weather-beaten port and one of the world's remotest settlements - is a new, ecological danger zone. An anthracite coalfield lies at Medusa Bay, part of the Bolshoi Arkticheskiy nature reserve. The bay attracts big flocks of birds, including six rare or endangered species: the small swan, peregrine falcon, gyrfalcon, white-headed loon, white-tailed eagle and red-breasted goose. Bolshoi Arkticheskiy nature reserve in Taymyr: a wilderness now at risk from mining The open-cast coal company, Vostokugol,external, is embroiled in a legal battle with the state environmental monitoring agency, Rosprirodnadzor, over mining violations. Vostokugol is appealing against a ruling that it abused the licensing system: a Moscow court found it had mined and exported coal from Medusa Bay, yet only had permits for prospecting. It was fined 601m roubles (Â£7.3m; $9.4m). The company has a joint production deal with Coal India Limited, an industrial giant. Meanwhile, Greenpeace urged Russia's chief prosecutor in August to intervene, after the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources more than halved the size of a buffer zone protecting Medusa Bay nature reserve. The zone - where mining and related construction are banned - was reduced to 1,150 hectares (2,842 acres), from 3,020 ha. That government move in July came despite a 2016 plea from the ministry itself and the Taymyr nature reserve authority to site a planned new coal terminal well away from the reserve. In line with Mr Putin's Arctic ambitions, Vostokugol is developing - albeit slowly - the Medusa Bay coalfield and two coal terminals for loading on to ships. Greenpeace says the Chaika terminal is just 1km (0.6 miles) from the nature reserve. ""At that distance, when coal is loaded at the terminal, coal dust will pour down on the nature reserve,"" says the Greenpeace legal complaint against the natural resources ministry. Vostokugol plans to export 20m tonnes of coal from there by 2024. Another firm, Severnaya Zvezda, also has licences to mine coal in Taymyr. Vostokugol's shiny new office block in Dikson contrasts with old buildings nearby Vostokugol started mining and building infrastructure at Medusa Bay in 2016, but later suspended operations. The company did not respond to the BBC's questions. Just 2km from the open-cast coal mine standsan international bird monitoring centre - the Willem Barents Biological Station.,externalIt was set up with Dutch government funding in 1994. Dr Sergey Kharitonov, a biologist, was there last year. Coal dust from the mine had already reached as far as Dikson, he told the BBC. ""The bird populations are in danger, I'm worried about their future,"" he said. ""The place has lots of coal, and it's apparently easy and profitable to mine it."" WWF's Alexey Knizhnikov said ""there is little transparency in this project - there is a lack of regulation and they didn't do any public consultations"". More than 500,000 reindeer migrate across Taymyr Strategic priorities however are driving this mining and energy extraction in the polar wilderness.

Cemetery search in 1986 missing sailor caseSimon Parkes is thought to have been murdered while he was on shore leave in Gibraltar.Hampshire & Isle of Wight,"Simon Parkes disappeared after spending the evening in bars in Gibraltar Police have begun to search a cemetery for the remains of a Royal Navy sailor who was thought to have been murdered in Gibraltar in 1986. Naval rating Simon Parkes, 18, from Kingswood near Bristol, disappeared after going ashore with crewmates from HMS Illustrious. Police said a member of the ship's crew had provided ""credible"" information. The case was reopened in 2001 after a shipmate, petty officer Allan Grimson, was convicted of two murders. Grimson has denied involvement in Mr Parkes' death. Police said they had received ""credible""new information relating to Trafalgar Cemetery HMS Illustrious docked in Gibraltar on 12 December 1986 during its return to Portsmouth from a deployment to Asia and Australasia. Mr Parkes spent the evening in bars before telling friends he was leaving to buy food, police said. The Royal Navy conducted a search when the radio operator failed to rejoin the ship, but found no trace of him. Mr Parkes' parents said they hoped his remains would be found and brought home In 2003, a number of Gibraltar cemeteries were searched after a police review concluded Mr Parkes was likely to have been murdered. Det Insp Roger Wood said the new information made Trafalgar Cemetery ""more interesting and more significant than it was in the early 2000s"". He said: ""This year Hampshire Constabulary has received new information from a witness which has been assessed as credible. ""Based on that information, today we are beginning a search operation and conducting further inquiries over in Gibraltar with the hope of finally locating Simon's remains."" Det Insp Roger Wood said the cemetery search would take about a week Mr Parkes' parents said they hoped his remains would be found and brought home. His mother Margaret said: ""We're getting older, time's getting on, we desperately need to know."" Hampshire Constabulary has issued a new appeal to trace more of Mr Parkes' crewmates, including those who were with him on the evening he vanished.

Ted Baker investigates stock inventory blunder,"Fashion retailer Ted Baker has said it may have overstated the value of its stock by between Â£20m and Â£25m. Law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer is to carry out a review, and independent accountants will also be appointed to investigate. Shares in Ted Baker fell to a 10-year low as analysts described the news as ""less than ideal"" and a ""blunder"". This year, former boss Ray Kelvin stepped down over misconduct claims, while sales and profits have tumbled. In the latest setback, Ted Baker said it may have accounted for up to Â£25m of stock, mainly clothing, on its balance sheet that did not exist. The company said in a statement,external: ""Ted Baker is committed to ensuring the independent review is completed in an efficient and transparent manner and will update the market as appropriate. Whilst the review is ongoing, the company will not comment further."" Ted Baker added, however, that it did not expect any cash impact from the overstatement of inventory. The problems are the latest setback in a difficult year for the firm. In March, Mr Kelvin - who had been chief executive since the company's launch in 1988 -resigned over claims he presided over a culture of ""forced hugging"". He has denied all allegations of misconduct. The company has also seen its sales, profits and share price tumble. In October, the retailer reported a Â£23m loss for the six months to 10 August, down from a Â£24.5m profit last year. For years Ted Baker bucked the trend with growing sales and profits, a business which knew its customers and pitched its products at the right price. But it's had a turbulent 2019. Ray Kelvin turned the business from a single store in Glasgow into a global brand. He was one of the UK's most successful retailers. In many ways Ray Kelvin was Ted Baker. His departure was bound to have some impact on the brand, especially when it came to innovation and quirkiness. But some wonder whether its troubles point to far deeper issues within the business. For instance, has Ted Baker become too expensive in a very competitive market where rivals are discounting like mad. This blunder is the last thing it needs. News of the inventory problems come just weeks after the company appointed Rachel Osborne as its new finance head. The issue was also mentioned in Ted Baker's last annual report based on information from its auditors, KPMG. The accounting giant said it had uncovered mis-statements but concluded they were too small to affect the fashion label's accounts. Retail analysts at Liberum said: ""Today's latest news from Ted Baker, regarding the overstatement of last year's inventory value, is less than ideal."" AJ Bell's investment director Russ Mould said it appeared that ""Ted Baker has found another banana to slip up on"". ""Discovering that the value of inventory on its balance sheet has been overstated is a huge blunder on its behalf,"" he said. ""It suggests that the business hasn't got a grip on its numbers which is a bit worrying considering that new chief executive Lindsay Page used to be the finance director. ""Appointing a law firm and the intention to bring in independent accountants will raise questions about whether more serious problems are bubbling under the surface at the business.""

Parties clash over Brexit in TV debate,"This video can not be played ITV debate: Parties tackle question of no-deal Brexit Leading figures from the UK's political parties have clashed on Brexit, the NHS and terror legislation in the latest televised general election debate. Labour's Richard Burgon declined to say during the ITV programme which way he would vote in the EU referendum his party is promising, if it wins power. Tory Rishi Sunak was pushed to rule out a no-deal Brexit if the Conservatives won, but did not give a direct answer. The UK goes to the polls on 12 December. Labour's shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon defended Jeremy Corbyn's decision to remain neutral in the event of a second referendum, saying the Labour leader was ""determined to bring the country together and heal divisions, not try to exploit them for votes"". Pressed by presenter Julie Etchingham on whether he would vote to stay in the EU or leave in another referendum, he said: ""I want to speak to my local Labour Party members after a Labour government comes back with that deal and then we'll decide how we approach that."" This video can not be played Labour's Richard Burgon on Brexit: 'It would be for the people to decide' Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said being neutral showed Mr Corbyn was a ""bystander not a leader"", but Mr Burgon said her party's policy of cancelling Brexit was ""not very liberal, not very democratic"".

Parties clash over Brexit in TV debateSenior figures from seven political parties also exchanged views on the NHS and terror legislation.Election 2019,"This video can not be played ITV debate: Parties tackle question of no-deal Brexit Leading figures from the UK's political parties have clashed on Brexit, the NHS and terror legislation in the latest televised general election debate. Labour's Richard Burgon declined to say during the ITV programme which way he would vote in the EU referendum his party is promising, if it wins power. Tory Rishi Sunak was pushed to rule out a no-deal Brexit if the Conservatives won, but did not give a direct answer. The UK goes to the polls on 12 December. Labour's shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon defended Jeremy Corbyn's decision to remain neutral in the event of a second referendum, saying the Labour leader was ""determined to bring the country together and heal divisions, not try to exploit them for votes"". Pressed by presenter Julie Etchingham on whether he would vote to stay in the EU or leave in another referendum, he said: ""I want to speak to my local Labour Party members after a Labour government comes back with that deal and then we'll decide how we approach that."" This video can not be played Labour's Richard Burgon on Brexit: 'It would be for the people to decide' Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said being neutral showed Mr Corbyn was a ""bystander not a leader"", but Mr Burgon said her party's policy of cancelling Brexit was ""not very liberal, not very democratic"".

Morning-after pill 'should be sold off the shelf'A report says accessing contraceptives in the UK should be easier for girls and women.Health,"Women and girls should be able to get hold of emergency contraception more easily without the need for a consultation with a pharmacist, say women's health experts. A report by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends the morning-after pill ""should be sold straight off the shelf"", like condoms. There are too many barriers to health services for women in the UK, it says. And their needs should be a priority. The report,Better for Women,external, is also calling for women to be allowed to take the first abortion pill at home,as well as the second, if they know they are less than 10 weeks pregnant. It said women should be able to have a consultation for an early medical abortion over the phone or via Skype. The report also recommends a network of one-stop health clinics for women, offering smear tests, contraceptives and advice all in one place. At the moment, women and girls have to have a consultation with a pharmacist before they can be given anemergency contraceptive, or morning-after pill,external- taken within five days of unprotected sex. This can leave them feeling ""uncomfortable, embarrassed or judged"", the report says. It recommends that the morning-after pill should be available ""in front of the counter"" and off the shelf, alongside pregnancy tests and condoms. Jane, 25, from the West Midlands, was turned away by the first pharmacy she visited to get the morning-after pill because they had no appointments that day. After protesting, she eventually saw a pharmacist and was given the emergency contraceptive - but only after lots of questioning. She said she felt as if she'd done something wrong. ""I felt really judged and patronised. I'm pretty sure he said something like, 'That was silly',"" Jane says. ""After that I just felt angry that women are made to go through this when there is a really simple solution."" Emergency contraception is available free of charge without prescription from all pharmacies in Scotland and Wales. In England, contraception services are commissioned locally and are on offer in sexual health clinics, some GP surgeries and most pharmacies - but are not always free of charge. Contraception: Which is most effective? Are women turning their back on the pill? Women 'struggling to access contraception' The College says cuts to public health budgets have made it more difficult for women to access the services they need -figures obtained by the BBC last yearsuggest nearly half of councils in England had plans to reduce contraception services. This may have led to rising conception rates and abortions among older women, because of unplanned pregnancies, the report says. In 2018, more than 205,000 abortions were performed in England and Wales. The report also calls for theprogestogen-only contraceptive pill,external, taken once a day, to be available over the counter in pharmacies instead of with a prescription from a GP. It says girls and women should be able to order the pills online like any other pharmacy product. Prof Lesley Regan, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the progestogen-only contraceptive pill (Pop) was very safe, and a consultation with a GP before starting to take it was ""unnecessary"". The report also recommends: long-term contraception should be discussed straight after a woman gives birth improved access to abortions for all women one-stop women's health clinics should be set up and open at weekends and evenings three full cycles of IVF should be offered to all eligible women in the UK GP appointment times should be extended to 15 minutes The report said: ""Too many women are spending years in pain and discomfort because [GP] appointment times are too short and demands on the time of doctors and other healthcare professionals are too great. ""This makes women less likely to talk about their issues."" The report points out that longer appointments would save the NHS money in the long term. Dr Asha Kasliwal, president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said women and girls, including under-18s, must have free and timely access to all methods of emergency contraception. ""While emergency contraception is free in some places in England, many will choose to access it in pharmacies where cost and opening times vary considerably. ""Consultations with pharmacists are highly recommended and best practice, as this is a valuable opportunity for individuals to discuss their contraceptive needs with a healthcare professional. ""However, a consultation should not be a barrier to receiving emergency contraception."" Prof Regan said the key was ensuring services were more joined up and responsive to the need of girls and women. ""It is important we provide a comprehensive health service for girls and women throughout their lives. ""We want to empower 51% of the population to be as healthy as possible and ensure no-one is left behind,"" she said.

Patients to be hit by week of cancellations,"This video can not be played Industrial action 'may delay cancer diagnoses' says Belfast Trust Patients in Northern Ireland are facing a week of disruption, with more than 10,000 outpatient appointments and surgeries cancelled in Belfast. Some people referred by their GPs on suspicion of cancer could have their diagnosis delayed, the head of the Belfast Health Trust has said. The trust apologised, blaming industrial action on pay and staffing. But the trade union Unison said it had been asked to exempt cancer services from its action and had agreed to that. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith told BBC News NI he was ""extremely concerned"" about the challenges facing the health service. He said: ""The government is clear this is one of a number of the urgent problems that we need a restored executive to tackle and that is why we are so focused on getting Stormont back."" Full details of the cancellations and advice for patients can be found on theHealth and Social Care Board website,external. Belfast Health Trust chief executive Martin Dillon said outpatient cancellations meant people due to have cancer diagnostic tests this week had had their appointments postponed. Martin Dillon said some people suspected of having cancer may have to wait for tests Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show, Mr Dillon said: ""There are some patients whose GPs may well have a suspicion of cancer - not yet confirmed. ""Some of those people will have been due to have tests this week that would have confirmed that one way or the other. ""Regrettably we've had to stand those appointments down. ""This could potentially lead to a delay in diagnosis and could potentially lead to a delay in treatment."" Mr Dillon confirmed that all patients who are having cancer treatment would have their treatment as planned this week. Unison union members are carrying out waves of four-hour strikes on Monday. Patricia McKeown, Unison's regional secretary, said that in talks with the Belfast Health Trust last week union officials were asked to exempt cancer services from their industrial action. ""Unison agreed to this along with a range of other exemptions,"" she said. ""The trust did not indicate any intention to cancel cancer diagnostic treatment - if it had done so it would have been exempted. ""We ask the Belfast Trust to urgently engage with Unison's local representatives to explain why they have taken this action and to put it right."" Ms McKeown also argued that three of the trusts had announced they would cancel all elective surgery some weeks ago, before her union confirmed its members were taking industrial action. Patricia McKeown said the situation was not of Unison's making She said the industrial action would be ""cumulative"" and it would be ""an escalation"". ""Right across the whole system, Unison members are working to rule. ""They are coming in to do their contracted jobs, they are stopping giving the tens of thousands of free hours they give to the health service every week in order to cover for missing colleagues."" The Royal College of Nursing's Northern Ireland director Pat Cullen said her union's members were ""absolutely devastated"" by such widespread cancellations. ""We as yet have no idea why such significant appointments will be cancelled because our nurses will be there to care for their patients,"" she said. Nurses planned to take industrial action on Tuesday but would continue to do all direct patient care, she added. They will not do the tasks usually performed by porters or administrators. Some outpatient appointments will still take place at the places listed above ""We have been describing what has been a perfect storm in terms of the levels of vacancies within the nursing workforce and that has fallen on deaf ears,"" she said. ""Nurses cannot continue to work in the environment they are working in."" The trust is asking patients not to phone to reschedule due to the large numbers of people affected. The South Eastern Health Trust is also cancelling some services but on a smaller scale. Last week the Royal College of Surgeons warnedNorthern Ireland's healthcare system was ""at the point of collapse""after waiting times reached an all-time high. In Belfast, the following hospitals will have all outpatient appointments, day case procedures and planned surgeries cancelled on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday: Royal Victoria Hospital (including the children's hospital, maternity hospital and school of dentistry) Belfast City Hospital Mater Hospital Musgrave Park Hospital However, some outpatient appointments will go ahead at these places: Health and wellbeing centres Community facilities Chemotherapy or radiotherapy at either the Bridgewater suite or cancer centre at Belfast City Hospital Macular clinic at Fairview Paediatric oncology at the children's hospital On Wednesday, all outpatient services will run as normal. Planned surgeries and day case procedures will still be postponed. Emergency services and day centres are not affected by the industrial action. In the South Eastern Health Trust area, all routine outpatient appointments at the Ulster Hospital have been cancelled on Wednesday, with the exception of maternity and children's services. On Friday, outpatient departments at Ulster Hospital, Lagan Valley Hospital, Downe Hospital, Ards Hospital and Bangor Hospital will be closed in the afternoon. Members of Unison - NI's largest health workers' union - started their industrial action last week Health workers across Northern Ireland are staging industrial action in protest at pay and staffing levels which they claim are ""unsafe"". On Monday night, the Unite trade union said its members had voted to strike on 18 December. It said it has 4,000 members who work in the health service and they would join members of the Royal College of Nursing, Unison and NIPSA in strike action. The Department of Health said the serious disruption to services was ""extremely distressing"". It said its offer of an independent conciliation process on the dispute stands. ""As we have been saying for some time, we simply don't have the money or authority to resolve this impasse and we strongly believe that patients should not be the ones to suffer because of that,"" the department said. ""Like our trust colleagues we would still wish to apologise to everyone affected."" The Northern Health Trust told the BBC that at present none of its services are affected. However, the trust said it was working with Unison, with industrial action due to take place on Friday. Updates can be found on itswebsite,external.

Rail delays as 27-day strike begins,"This video can not be played Southampton rail commuters speak out on first day of strike Commuters are facing disruption as workers on South Western Railway (SWR) begin a 27-day strike. It comes after talks between the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and SWR over a long-running dispute over guards on trains broke down. The operator called the action ""unnecessary"" and said ""more than half"" of weekday trains would run, but warned of queues at stations. The union said the strike is ""in defence of passenger safety"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The RMT said SWR had ""point-blank refused"" to show any serious movement at talks held at the conciliation service Acas. The union has been demanding that guards should oversee the operation of doors and perform other safety functions in dispatching trains. It said the company's proposals would leave guards as ""glorified porters"" without any safety responsibilities. As the strike got under way earlier, disruption was compounded when aman seen carrying an air rifle led to a train being evacuated. Allow Twitter content?

Elsewhere, Sophia Griffiths, who travels from Earlsfield station into central London, said: ""Usually when they strike the station is not too bad but today was just nuts. ""I saw the queue outside and thought 'no way' - I've never seen it that long so I took the bus to Tooting and got the Tube from there."" She said she was supportive of the striking workers and said it was ""crazy they (SWR) would let it get to this"". The communications officer at Nuffield Council on Bioethics said she was considering cycling to work during the prolonged action and working from home more. The morning rush hour meant a crowded platform at Wokingham station Charlotte Burnell said it took almost an hour to travel from Claygate, Surrey, to Waterloo - a journey which usually takes 34 minutes. ""You can manage a couple of days of strike action but the thought of it going on for 27 days is pretty overwhelming,"" she said. ""It's physically uncomfortable. I was forced to stand awkwardly and my back was killing me."" Steve Nagioff described passengers ""rammed"" into a carriage on his commute from Whitton in south west London. ""A woman next to me said that she couldn't breathe. The train stopped at Richmond and I fell out - luckily other passengers got off the train so I got back on it again. ""It's just not right - I pay full ticket prices. If the service is going to be like this then it should be free,"" he added. This video can not be played BBC Transport Correspondent Paul Clifton explains the background to the strikes Becky Bartlett, from Wokingham in Berkshire, said she was an hour late for work in London after her regular train was cancelled. ""I have various theatre and gig plans for the month, plus Christmas parties and events, which I have either had to cancel, some at loss of the ticket price, or I'm going to have to pay for a Â£30+ taxi from Reading just to get home. ""This whole experience is going to be horrific. I'm one day in and I've already had enough."" Passengers faced packed carriages on the line from Guildford to Waterloo RMT assistant general secretary Steve Hedley said members were ""absolutely furious"" with SWR following the Acas talks. ""Of course our members don't want to lose a month's money running up to Christmas but they're prepared to do that to show that safety and accessibility for disabled people is non-negotiable."" Regional organiser Mick Tosh said the union would consider financial support for any members who suffered particular hardship because of the strike. Your Questions Answered: Could public transport be made cheaper? SWR said it had offered ""a guard on every train, and a safety critical role for that guard"". Managing director Andy Mellors said the action was ""unnecessary"" and the issue needed to be settled before a new fleet of modern suburban trains was introduced next year. ""Our assessment is that by having drivers opening and closing doors, that will actually optimise the performance of the network by getting more trains to Waterloo on time. ""We've been very clear that we're committed to keeping a guard on our trains and those guards will have safety critical competencies. Our proposals will make guards more customer facing and improve safety, security and accessibility."" By Paul Clifton, BBC South transport correspondent Commuters at Bracknell station are among those affected by the strike At Chandler's Ford station this morning, the ticket office door was locked. The platform was empty and all the signs were blank. It's going to stay that way for a month. The next train isn't due until 2 January 2020. It's the same story at Swaythling, Millbrook, Dean, Dunbridge and a few other small stations popular with children heading to school as well as daily commuters. The two sides are trading insults and blaming each other. They haven't budged in more than two years of strikes. I don't think many passengers have any goodwill left at all for either the RMT or South Western Railway - because this month-long strike is going to cause real hardship for hundreds of thousands of people each day. Union members took part in a picket at Waterloo Station SWR released arevised timetable,externaland said it would provide longer trains to increase capacity where possible. The operator runs services between London Waterloo and Portsmouth, Southampton, Bournemouth and Weymouth as well as Reading, Exeter and Bristol.

Whale dies with 100kg 'litter ball' in its stomachFishing nets and rope were among the debris found inside the whale which stranded on the Isle of Harris.,"A sperm whale which died after stranding on the Isle of Harris had a 100kg ""litter ball"" in its stomach. Fishing nets, rope, packing straps, bags and plastic cups were among the items discovered in a compacted mass. Whale experts said it was not immediately clear whether the debris had contributed to the whale's death. But locals who found the carcass on Seilebost beach on Thursday said it highlighted the wider problem of marine pollution. Netting and bundles of rope were among the items found inside the whale Dan Parry, who lives in nearby Luskentyre, said: ""It was desperately sad, especially when you saw the fishing nets and debris that came out of its stomach. ""We walk on these beaches nearly every day and I always take a bag to pick up litter, most of which is fishing-related. ""This stuff could have easily been netting or the like lost in a storm, we just don't know, but it does show the scale of the problem we have with marine pollution."" Members of the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (Smass), an organisation that investigates the deaths of whales and dolphins, dissected the whale to try and determine its cause of death. A post on the group's Facebook page stated: ""The animal wasn't in particularly poor condition, and whilst it is certainly plausible that this amount of debris was a factor in its live stranding, we actually couldn't find evidence that this had impacted or obstructed the intestines. ""This amount of plastic in the stomach is nonetheless horrific, must have compromised digestion, and serves to demonstrate yet again the hazards that marine litter and lost or discarded fishing gear can cause to marine life."" The debris is believed to have originated from both the land and the fishing industry. The Coastguard and workers from Western Isles Council helped with the examination of the whale on Saturday, as well as digging a giant hole on the beach to bury the sub-adult male. According to Smass figuresreports of whale and dolphin strandings in Scotland are on the increase. There were 204 reports in 2009, rising to more than 930 in 2018.

"Rail delays as 27-day strike beginsIt follows a row over guards on South Western Railway services, which run from London Waterloo.England","This video can not be played Southampton rail commuters speak out on first day of strike Commuters are facing disruption as workers on South Western Railway (SWR) begin a 27-day strike. It comes after talks between the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and SWR over a long-running dispute over guards on trains broke down. The operator called the action ""unnecessary"" and said ""more than half"" of weekday trains would run, but warned of queues at stations. The union said the strike is ""in defence of passenger safety"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The RMT said SWR had ""point-blank refused"" to show any serious movement at talks held at the conciliation service Acas. The union has been demanding that guards should oversee the operation of doors and perform other safety functions in dispatching trains. It said the company's proposals would leave guards as ""glorified porters"" without any safety responsibilities. As the strike got under way earlier, disruption was compounded when aman seen carrying an air rifle led to a train being evacuated. Allow Twitter content?

Elsewhere, Sophia Griffiths, who travels from Earlsfield station into central London, said: ""Usually when they strike the station is not too bad but today was just nuts. ""I saw the queue outside and thought 'no way' - I've never seen it that long so I took the bus to Tooting and got the Tube from there."" She said she was supportive of the striking workers and said it was ""crazy they (SWR) would let it get to this"". The communications officer at Nuffield Council on Bioethics said she was considering cycling to work during the prolonged action and working from home more. The morning rush hour meant a crowded platform at Wokingham station Charlotte Burnell said it took almost an hour to travel from Claygate, Surrey, to Waterloo - a journey which usually takes 34 minutes. ""You can manage a couple of days of strike action but the thought of it going on for 27 days is pretty overwhelming,"" she said. ""It's physically uncomfortable. I was forced to stand awkwardly and my back was killing me."" Steve Nagioff described passengers ""rammed"" into a carriage on his commute from Whitton in south west London. ""A woman next to me said that she couldn't breathe. The train stopped at Richmond and I fell out - luckily other passengers got off the train so I got back on it again. ""It's just not right - I pay full ticket prices. If the service is going to be like this then it should be free,"" he added. This video can not be played BBC Transport Correspondent Paul Clifton explains the background to the strikes Becky Bartlett, from Wokingham in Berkshire, said she was an hour late for work in London after her regular train was cancelled. ""I have various theatre and gig plans for the month, plus Christmas parties and events, which I have either had to cancel, some at loss of the ticket price, or I'm going to have to pay for a Â£30+ taxi from Reading just to get home. ""This whole experience is going to be horrific. I'm one day in and I've already had enough."" Passengers faced packed carriages on the line from Guildford to Waterloo RMT assistant general secretary Steve Hedley said members were ""absolutely furious"" with SWR following the Acas talks. ""Of course our members don't want to lose a month's money running up to Christmas but they're prepared to do that to show that safety and accessibility for disabled people is non-negotiable."" Regional organiser Mick Tosh said the union would consider financial support for any members who suffered particular hardship because of the strike. Your Questions Answered: Could public transport be made cheaper? SWR said it had offered ""a guard on every train, and a safety critical role for that guard"". Managing director Andy Mellors said the action was ""unnecessary"" and the issue needed to be settled before a new fleet of modern suburban trains was introduced next year. ""Our assessment is that by having drivers opening and closing doors, that will actually optimise the performance of the network by getting more trains to Waterloo on time. ""We've been very clear that we're committed to keeping a guard on our trains and those guards will have safety critical competencies. Our proposals will make guards more customer facing and improve safety, security and accessibility."" By Paul Clifton, BBC South transport correspondent Commuters at Bracknell station are among those affected by the strike At Chandler's Ford station this morning, the ticket office door was locked. The platform was empty and all the signs were blank. It's going to stay that way for a month. The next train isn't due until 2 January 2020. It's the same story at Swaythling, Millbrook, Dean, Dunbridge and a few other small stations popular with children heading to school as well as daily commuters. The two sides are trading insults and blaming each other. They haven't budged in more than two years of strikes. I don't think many passengers have any goodwill left at all for either the RMT or South Western Railway - because this month-long strike is going to cause real hardship for hundreds of thousands of people each day. Union members took part in a picket at Waterloo Station SWR released arevised timetable,externaland said it would provide longer trains to increase capacity where possible. The operator runs services between London Waterloo and Portsmouth, Southampton, Bournemouth and Weymouth as well as Reading, Exeter and Bristol.

Huawei's Meng details life on bail in CanadaMeng Wanzhou is fighting extradition to the US on charges of violating sanctions against Iran.,"Meng Wanzhou on her way to court in Vancouver in September, as part of her fight against extradition to the US A Chinese Huawei executive who was arrested in Canada a year ago has published an open letter detailing her life on bail and thanking supporters. Meng Wanzhou - the chief financial officer and daughter of Huawei's founder - is fighting extradition to the US on charges of violating sanctions against Iran. In her widely read letter, she said she had time to ""read a book"" and ""complete an oil painting"" while on bail. Her arrest sparked a diplomatic row. China has always said the charges against Ms Meng are politically motivated. Shortly after her arrest, two Canadians were detained in China, but Beijing says the cases are not related to Ms Meng. Michael Spavor, aconsultant with links to North Korea, and Michael Kovrig, a former diplomatwho works for an NGO,external, are accused of spying - although Canada has called their detention ""arbitrary"". They are being held in a detention centre and are allowed only infrequent visits from consular staff. On Monday, Mr Kovrig's employer tweeted that he hadyet to see a lawyer or his family,external. In April, it was reported that both men were being interrogated for between six to eight hours a day, and weresometimes subject to 24-hour artificial lighting,external. In July, guards reportedly confiscated Mr Kovrig's reading glasses. Ms Weng's letter waspublished on the Huawei website,externaland on social media, on the anniversary of her detention. In it, she thanked her supporters in Canada, saying the applause in the public gallery after the court granted her bail, 11 days into her detention, had ""made her burst into tears"". As part of the bail conditions, Ms Meng was given an electronic tag, and a 23:00-06:00 curfew, but was allowed to travel aroundmuch of Vancouver. ""When I was in Shenzhen [in China], time used to pass by very quickly,"" Ms Meng wrote on Sunday night. ""I always felt like I was being stretched thin and that there was never enough time to get everything done."" Now, she wrote, time passes so slowly ""I have enough time to read a book from cover to cover. I can take the time to discuss minutiae with my colleagues or to carefully complete an oil painting"". The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Huawei: The story of a controversial company Huawei executive launches extradition fight She also praised ""the kindness of people here in Canada"", and ""the kindness of the correctional officers and inmates at the Alouette Correctional Center for Women"" where she was detained. Ms Meng is fighting extradition to the US, where she is wanted for a host of charges, includingevading sanctions on Iran- something she and Huawei deny. Her case is due to be heard in January. She made no comment on the allegations in the letter. BBC Monitoring said the version of the letter posted on Huawei's social media channel had had more than 60 million views by Monday morning. News of Meng Wanzhou's arrest in 2018 broke just after China's president Xi Jinping and Donald Trump sat down to dinner in Buenos Aires, Argentina at the G20 summit, to thrash out trade war issues. The two leaders came to an understanding and a truce was signed - but thousands of miles away in Canada, a new battle was just beginning. Ms Meng's arrest was seen as a turning point in the US-China trade war; an illustration of how serious the Trump administration was about going after Huawei - particularly on issues like technology theft and violations of American law. For China, Ms Meng's arrest was seen as an attack like no other. If Huawei is the crown jewel of Chinese tech, then Ms Meng is its princess. Although Beijing denies it, the detention of the two Canadians Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor was widely seen as punishment for taking sides - and a warning to other countries who might consider copying Canada's decision. Michael Spavor (L) and Michael Kovrig have been held since December The two Canadians were detained in December, shortly after Ms Weng was detained. Their detention led to a diplomatic and trade row, with China blocking tens millions of dollars' worth of Canadian pork and vegetable oil exports. They wereformally arrested in May, and can be held for up to 13-and-a-half-months before charges are filed, the Canadian government says. In September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused China of ""using arbitrary detention as a tool to achieve political goals"".

Police cemetery search in 1986 missing sailor case,"Simon Parkes disappeared after spending the evening in bars in Gibraltar Police have begun to search a cemetery for the remains of a Royal Navy sailor who was thought to have been murdered in Gibraltar in 1986. Naval rating Simon Parkes, 18, from Kingswood near Bristol, disappeared after going ashore with crewmates from HMS Illustrious. Police said a member of the ship's crew had provided ""credible"" information. The case was reopened in 2001 after a shipmate, petty officer Allan Grimson, was convicted of two murders. Grimson has denied involvement in Mr Parkes' death. Police said they had received ""credible""new information relating to Trafalgar Cemetery HMS Illustrious docked in Gibraltar on 12 December 1986 during its return to Portsmouth from a deployment to Asia and Australasia. Mr Parkes spent the evening in bars before telling friends he was leaving to buy food, police said. The Royal Navy conducted a search when the radio operator failed to rejoin the ship, but found no trace of him. Mr Parkes' parents said they hoped his remains would be found and brought home In 2003, a number of Gibraltar cemeteries were searched after a police review concluded Mr Parkes was likely to have been murdered. Det Insp Roger Wood said the new information made Trafalgar Cemetery ""more interesting and more significant than it was in the early 2000s"". He said: ""This year Hampshire Constabulary has received new information from a witness which has been assessed as credible. ""Based on that information, today we are beginning a search operation and conducting further inquiries over in Gibraltar with the hope of finally locating Simon's remains."" Det Insp Roger Wood said the cemetery search would take about a week Mr Parkes' parents said they hoped his remains would be found and brought home. His mother Margaret said: ""We're getting older, time's getting on, we desperately need to know."" Hampshire Constabulary has issued a new appeal to trace more of Mr Parkes' crewmates, including those who were with him on the evening he vanished.

The party's manifesto says Sinn Fein has been more effective arguing outside of Westminster - including in Dublin, Brussels and Washington - than it would have been if it had taken its seats. This video can not be played As we told you a few moments ago, the Labour leader has written to President Trump to ""clarify"" whether or not the NHS is on the table as part of post-Brexit trade talks. Mr Corbyn says there would be ""no deal"" with the US, under a Labour government, if it insisted the NHS was included in post-Brexit trade talks Jeremy Corbyn has said he would walk away from trade negotiations if the US insisted on including the NHS as part of a trade deal. President Trump and the first lady left the White House earlier for the Nato summit in London earlier Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to US President Donald Trump to ask him to âurgently clarify that our NHS is
genuinely off the table in UK-US trade talks and that it will not be exposed
to higher costs from US drug companies"". Speaking ahead of
President Trumpâs visit to London for a Nato summit, Mr Corbyn says Labour would ânegotiate a trade arrangement with the EU that means we will protect our manufacturing industries' primary market, and weâll have to trade with rest of the world of course. But weâre not putting our public services on any negotiating table in any circumstances"". Mr Corbyn hasclaimed government papers he released last week are ""proof"" that the NHS was at riskunder a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the claims are ""nonsense"" and the NHS would not be part of trade talks. Mr Corbyn says there would be âno dealâ with the US, under a Labour government, if it insisted the NHS or other public services were included in trade talks. In his letter to Mr Trump, Mr Corbyn added: âI am sure you understand that our coming general election on 12 December means the British public need urgent clarity that our NHS is genuinely off the table in UK-US trade talks and will not be exposed to higher costs from US drugs companies.â Mr Corbyn says he would
be âvery happy to talk to Mr Trumpâ. His message to the president, he says, is âfirstly, welcome"" - but, ""secondly, our public services
will not be included in in any trade deal with the United States. Our NHS is
not for sale and weâre not going to allow the extension of medicine patents
that will push up drug prices in this country"". Read our full story here. Mr Corbyn says this 451-page dossier showing initial talks between the UK and the US proves the NHS is ""for sale"" It's that time of the evening again - we've been sent the first of Tuesday's front pages. The Financial Times splashes with a picture of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, at Guildhall Yard, London, to honour the victims off the London Bridge terror attack. The faces of Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn are all over the i's front page, too, in a busy collage of headlines and articles. ""The media won't decide this election,"" the paper says. The Christian Peoples Alliance is anti-abortion The Christian Peoples Alliance is fielding 29 candidates
across the UK. The centrepiece of its manifesto is a pledge to give all
newly-weds a Â£12,000 grant when they marry and a further Â£6,000 on the birth or
adoption of their first child. Opposite sex couples only would be eligible for the
financial support. The move would be funded by a new Â£3bn annual sales tax on
high-tech companies. On Brexit, the party supports another referendum but not
until five years after the UK has left the EU. It says the UKâs decision to
leave must be honoured but there should be a âmechanismâ to go back if the UK
does not make a success of leaving. Other pledges include:  The party's leader Sid Cordle has also vowed to maintain the partyâs
âuncompromisingâ anti-abortion stance â by repealing the 1967 law legalising
abortion and giving full legal protection to the unborn child. You can readthe Christian Peoples Alliance manifesto here,external- and ourfull policy guide comparing various parties' pledges here. Swaledale, Yorkshire The partyâs manifesto, entitled Yorkshire Deserves Better,
calls for a radical shake-up in the relationship between Westminster and
Yorkshireâs 5.4 million residents. Its main goal is a new devolved assembly for the region,
which it says would empower business and end the current situation where
Yorkshire is left fighting for âscraps from the tableâ. Transport is a key focus, with a pledge to build a new
ânorthern powerhouseâ railway line linking Hull, York, Leeds, Bradford and
Sheffield with Newcastle, Liverpool and Manchester. Other pledges include:  The party, which is fielding 28 candidates this time, did
not campaign either way in the Brexit referendum. While it says the Leave vote must be honoured, it wants to
maintain a close economic relationship with the EU and as few barriers to trade
as possible. Party leader Chris Whitwood says the possibility of the UK
joining the European Free Trade Association in the future should not be ruled
out, while the UKâs exit provides an opportunity for powers repatriated from
Brussels to be handed to the region. You can readthe Yorkshire Party's manifesto here,external- and ourfull policy guide comparing various parties' pledges here. Formed by a breakaway group of Labour and Conservative MPs
in February, the party is fielding only three candidates after other key
figures either joined the Lib Dems or decided to retire. The trio â former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, former
Tory minister Anna Soubry and ex-Labour MP Mike Gapes â say they are flying the
flag for âcentre ground valuesâ and a politics rooted in âfairness,
responsibility, truthfulness, opportunity and long-termismâ. Their nine-page policy statement, entitled 2020 Vision For
Change, has at its heart a commitment to hold another Brexit referendum and to
campaign to remain in the EU. Rather than publishing an âexhaustiveâ manifesto, the party
says the abbreviated document contains only policies that are âcompelling,
appropriate and deliverableâ and reflect its values. Its pledges include:  If it succeeds in returning MPs to Westminster, TIG says it
will push for cross-party working âto become the normâ in Parliament and
challenge the âcartelâ of the big parties over election rules. You can readTIG's manifesto here,external- and ourfull policy guide comparing various parties' pledges here. Now that Mr Corbyn's Labour rally and Mr Johnson's Conservative event are over, let's take a look at some of the smaller parties you might not have heard so much about in the election campaign so far. Over the next few minutes we'll profile the Yorkshire Party, the Christian Peoples Alliance and the Independent Group for Change. There's a big cheer from the Conservative-supporting crowd when Johnson says his âget Brexit doneâ line for the first time in this speech. He then moves on to compare the various plans his party has for the country if it wins a majority on 12 December. He says the Tories' understanding of the UK economy is why ""this party is more trusted on health now, and on education, than the Labour Party"". He continues to lay into Labour's record on the economy. ""It would be comical if it weren't so tragic,"" he adds, attacking the spending pledges made in the opposition's main campaign. On education, Mr Johnson says the choice is ""stark"". ""You can come with us - a party that supports fantastic education for every pupil. Or go with Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party who actually want to abolish Ofsted."" You can view the main policies of the Conservative and Labour parties - as well as the other main parties in this election - in our policy guide here. The PM's speech is littered with metaphors as usual - this ""dog in the manger"" Parliament is like a bus ""slap bang in the middle of the yellow box junction, stopping the traffic in every direction"". He says the people of this country are like the ""AA"" - they will fix the broken-down country. ""And we can do it... in just 10 days' time, we can get out of the rut we've been in for the last three and a half years [since the EU referendum],"" he adds. He's applauded as he says that once Brexit is delivered, a Tory government will bring in legislation to stop the automatic early release of serious and violent offenders - ""not to speak of terrorists"" he adds. This line comes after the PM faced criticism for what some have called ""politicising"" Friday's London Bridge attack, where a convicted terrorist stabbed two people to death. Mr Corbyn says he wants to ""lead a government that is serious about
dealing with injustices"". He says he has been asked whether the country can afford Labour's manifesto promises. ""Are you sure the country cannot afford it?"" he says he replied. ""Unless we invest for the future where will the jobs of
tomorrow be?"" He goes on to talk about the NHS, calling it ""Labourâs greatest achievement"". He says he has ""studied"" the papers that detail meetings the UK government has been having with the US Department of Trade in the last two years. ""Itâs frightening,"" he says. ""They are discussing extending the patents on medicines for
export to the British market. ""Discussing access to our health service by American pharmaceuticals and others."" He adds: ""My simple message to Donald Trump and Boris Johnson is - our NHS is not for sale."" Here's our Reality Check on what those documents tell us about the talks. Mr Corbyn criticises the ""abuse thrown at people"" campaigning for Labour and the ""media investigations into them"". ""When they go low and attack us with personal abuse and the rest of us,"" he says. ""When they go low we go high. ""We are better than them."" You may recognise these words - they were first utteredin the 2016 US presidential campaign by former first lady Michelle Obama,externalwho said this when talking about Hillary Clinton's detractors. In a schedule clash that's keeping us busy, the prime minister is on stage in Colchester at the same time as Mr Corbyn is in Hastings. Mr Johnson is speaking at a rally in the Tory-held seat in northern Essex. He starts by thanking his supporters for all the campaigning they've helped with. ""We had no choice"" but to have an election, he says, blaming the poll on the ""Brexit-blocking Parliament"". His speech follows words from his close allies, party chairman James
Cleverly and Home Secretary Priti Patel. The
Conservatives held the Colchester seat in 2017 with 5,677 more votes than
second-placed Labour. You can see a list of all of the candidates in the constituency here. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn begins his speech in the marginal seat Hastings & Rye, in Sussex. He says he has been asked what his priorities are. ""My absolute priority is dealing with the situation facing rough sleepers and the homeless,"" he says. ""There is something morally wrong about a wealthy country that tolerates people sleeping rough."" Labour lost out to the Tories by a mere 346 votes in Hastings & Rye in the 2017 election. You can see a list of all of the candidates in the constituency here. Our political correspondent's thoughts from the Tory campaign bus... Ben WrightBBC political correspondent Itâs an old story but Iâll tell it anyway. During the 1964
general election campaign Harold Wilson was trumpeting his support for the navy at a
vast public meeting in the dockyard town of Chatham. âAnd why am I saying all
this?"" he asked rhetorically. ""Because you're in Chatham!â shouted a
voice from the crowd. A famously fine heckle from an era where prime ministers
had to contend with the electorate face to face. They still do from behind
their TV studio podiums of course but the public meeting and town centre
walkabout has mostly gone. Weâre 10 days from polling day and from my perch in
the Tory campaign Iâve yet to hear a heckle. Not one. Today Boris Johnson
turned up at a deserted cruise liner terminal at Southampton docks to plug his
partyâs policies for border control after Brexit. He chugged around the quiet
port in a boat and did a quick television interview on his response to Fridayâs
terror attack before heading off to a rally for Tory activists
this evening. The PM was in and out before the cityâs voters
twigged he was there. Itâs the same wherever Mr Johnson goes. The Conservative
campaign feels efficient, focused and sterile. Clips for broadcasters are
provided, Tory social media content is recorded and pictures of the prime minister in different bits of Britain are taken that will appear online and in
tomorrowâs newspapers. But spontaneous encounters between the PM and the general public hardly ever happen. Itâs now impossible to imagine Boris Johnson copying John Majorâs 1992
campaign and plunging into the crowd to argue his case. During the 2016
referendum, Mr Johnson seemed to relish the chaotic cut and thrust of town to
town campaigning but thereâs none of that now. The Tory battle bus still
ploughs up and down the countryâs motorways carrying the media from one event
to the next but it feels the real electioneering is happening somewhere else. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Commuters braced as 27-day rail strike begins,"This video can not be played Southampton rail commuters speak out on first day of strike Commuters are facing disruption as workers on South Western Railway (SWR) begin a 27-day strike. It comes after talks between the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and SWR over a long-running dispute over guards on trains broke down. The operator called the action ""unnecessary"" and said ""more than half"" of weekday trains would run, but warned of queues at stations. The union said the strike is ""in defence of passenger safety"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The RMT said SWR had ""point-blank refused"" to show any serious movement at talks held at the conciliation service Acas. The union has been demanding that guards should oversee the operation of doors and perform other safety functions in dispatching trains. It said the company's proposals would leave guards as ""glorified porters"" without any safety responsibilities. As the strike got under way earlier, disruption was compounded when aman seen carrying an air rifle led to a train being evacuated. Allow Twitter content?

Elsewhere, Sophia Griffiths, who travels from Earlsfield station into central London, said: ""Usually when they strike the station is not too bad but today was just nuts. ""I saw the queue outside and thought 'no way' - I've never seen it that long so I took the bus to Tooting and got the Tube from there."" She said she was supportive of the striking workers and said it was ""crazy they (SWR) would let it get to this"". The communications officer at Nuffield Council on Bioethics said she was considering cycling to work during the prolonged action and working from home more. The morning rush hour meant a crowded platform at Wokingham station Charlotte Burnell said it took almost an hour to travel from Claygate, Surrey, to Waterloo - a journey which usually takes 34 minutes. ""You can manage a couple of days of strike action but the thought of it going on for 27 days is pretty overwhelming,"" she said. ""It's physically uncomfortable. I was forced to stand awkwardly and my back was killing me."" Steve Nagioff described passengers ""rammed"" into a carriage on his commute from Whitton in south west London. ""A woman next to me said that she couldn't breathe. The train stopped at Richmond and I fell out - luckily other passengers got off the train so I got back on it again. ""It's just not right - I pay full ticket prices. If the service is going to be like this then it should be free,"" he added. This video can not be played BBC Transport Correspondent Paul Clifton explains the background to the strikes Becky Bartlett, from Wokingham in Berkshire, said she was an hour late for work in London after her regular train was cancelled. ""I have various theatre and gig plans for the month, plus Christmas parties and events, which I have either had to cancel, some at loss of the ticket price, or I'm going to have to pay for a Â£30+ taxi from Reading just to get home. ""This whole experience is going to be horrific. I'm one day in and I've already had enough."" Passengers faced packed carriages on the line from Guildford to Waterloo RMT assistant general secretary Steve Hedley said members were ""absolutely furious"" with SWR following the Acas talks. ""Of course our members don't want to lose a month's money running up to Christmas but they're prepared to do that to show that safety and accessibility for disabled people is non-negotiable."" Regional organiser Mick Tosh said the union would consider financial support for any members who suffered particular hardship because of the strike. Your Questions Answered: Could public transport be made cheaper? SWR said it had offered ""a guard on every train, and a safety critical role for that guard"". Managing director Andy Mellors said the action was ""unnecessary"" and the issue needed to be settled before a new fleet of modern suburban trains was introduced next year. ""Our assessment is that by having drivers opening and closing doors, that will actually optimise the performance of the network by getting more trains to Waterloo on time. ""We've been very clear that we're committed to keeping a guard on our trains and those guards will have safety critical competencies. Our proposals will make guards more customer facing and improve safety, security and accessibility."" By Paul Clifton, BBC South transport correspondent Commuters at Bracknell station are among those affected by the strike At Chandler's Ford station this morning, the ticket office door was locked. The platform was empty and all the signs were blank. It's going to stay that way for a month. The next train isn't due until 2 January 2020. It's the same story at Swaythling, Millbrook, Dean, Dunbridge and a few other small stations popular with children heading to school as well as daily commuters. The two sides are trading insults and blaming each other. They haven't budged in more than two years of strikes. I don't think many passengers have any goodwill left at all for either the RMT or South Western Railway - because this month-long strike is going to cause real hardship for hundreds of thousands of people each day. Union members took part in a picket at Waterloo Station SWR released arevised timetable,externaland said it would provide longer trains to increase capacity where possible. The operator runs services between London Waterloo and Portsmouth, Southampton, Bournemouth and Weymouth as well as Reading, Exeter and Bristol. It also operates suburban commuter lines in south-west London, Surrey, Berkshire, and north-east Hampshire. Strike days are as follows: From 00:01 GMT on Monday 2 December until 23:59 on Wednesday 11 December From 00:01 on Friday 13 December until 23:59 on Tuesday 24 December From 00:01 on Friday 27 December 2019 until 23:59 on 1 January Man with gun on train leads to 'pandemonium' Strike-hit rail company boss to be replaced December rail strikes to go ahead after talks fail Rail workers to hold 27 days of strikes Trains 'shambolic' as strike continues Chaos for passengers on strike day one South Western Railway strikes suspended What does a train guard do?

Heaters distributed as gas supply fault continues,"This video can not be played Colette Dunn said she has been using boiled kettles to make bath-time for her daughter possible Hundreds of engineers are visiting homes in the Falkirk area as part of a major operation to tackle a gas network failure. Thousands of people spent the night without heat in freezing temperatures after the outage on Sunday morning. Heaters and portable cookers have been distributed to vulnerable residents and 14 schools and nurseries are closed. Gas infrastructure company SGN said it had now begun reconnecting supplies to homes across the area. The company said previously that it had hoped to visit all 8,000 affected properties by Monday afternoon. By 21:30 on Monday, SGN confirmed it had reconnected gas to 3,000 properties. Latest updates from SGN,external Thousands facing 'several days' without gas More than 250 engineers are going door-to-door to turn off gas supplies at the meter for safety reasons. Falkirk Council said themajority of schools in the area,external, as well as Kinnaird Waters early learning and childcare centre, would reopen on Tuesday. Bainsford primary school and nursery class, Larbert early learning and childcare centre, and Kinnaird primary school and Thistle Wing will remain closed. SGN has warned some homes could be without gas supplies until the weekend in the ""worst-case scenario"". Angelene Perry's children donned blankets and woolly hats as the family struggled to stay warm Mother-of-four Angelene Perry, who has a nine-month-old baby, said she had borrowed four radiators from a friend and has been given a stove and two fan heaters by SGN to heat one room. She said: ""We're using the kettle just now to boil all our water. ""I'm just thinking at the moment how I'm going to go through the week, and just really thinking about night time. ""During the day we're OK, we can huddle into one room, but just trying to plan ahead for the week."" International Rescue Corps has helped distribute supplies to homes in the area SGN spokesman Denis Kerby said they were working to restore supplies as quickly as possible. ""That might be a couple of days but in terms of getting everyone back on, we're looking at five days,"" he told theBBC's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme. ""It could be up to Friday, it could even creep into the weekend - that is really the worst-case scenario."" Affected residents have received hot plates and fan heaters He said engineers needed to visit every home even if residents have managed the turn off their own supplies. Mr Kerby said that SGN apologised for the fault as it was ""our piece of equipment that's failed."" He said: ""However, what we are doing is making sure people are getting their gas back as quickly as possible. ""So this is making sure that no one who has a vulnerability is going to be missed."" Residents have been told they could be waiting for up to five days for their supplies to be restored. To ensure the gas supply is managed in a safe way: Customers are initially told by the gas emergency service to turn off the gas themselves at a switch beside their meters Engineers have to check every home to ensure the gas has been turned off before it can restore supplies If the gas is not fully off, when the supply is restored it could quickly fill the home Some homes that receive gas from other parts of the network will still have supplies Once the gas is back in the network, engineers make return visits to homes to reconnect supplies Engineers need to relight some boilers and check that appliances are working safely If gas meters are inside homes, engineers must be given access, however, if they are outside (in a white or brown meter box) access is not needed. Affected householders will be compensated for their time without gas. Find outmore here,external. A problem with a ""governor"" station which regulates gas pressure in the local network developed at about 04:30 Sunday. Thousands of people woke up to discover they had no heating or hot water as their boilers shut down. SGN said homes in Bainsford, Carron, Carronshore, Larbert, Langlees, New Carron Village, Skinflats and Stenhousemuir  were affected. Meanwhile, residents have also been warned to be ""mindful"" of their electricity use, following a number of power outages in the area overnight. On Twitter,police said,external: ""Scottish Power is asking people in the Falkirk area is to be mindful of their electricity use over the coming days as there's increased demand on the electricity network with people using heaters while they're without gas. Fire service staff are helping with the distribution of heaters and hotplates With overnight temperatures dipping below zero, people living in the area are being urged to check on vulnerable neighbours. Falkirk Council made the Camelon Community Centre available to SGN, which was handing out portable heating and cooking equipment to elderly, sick or disabled customers and those with young children. A mobile catering unit was also distributing hot food. Mr Kerby added: ""Our priority is vulnerable customers. We are liaising with the local authority and our partners in the community to make sure we can visit all the people who may need that extra bit of help. ""We would also appeal to people to be really good neighbours - and please check on any elderly neighbours or anyone in the vicinity who may need some extra help."" Engineers hope to visit all affected homes by Monday afternoon One local resident, David McCallan, told BBC Scotland that his home was like an ""ice box"" when he woke up on Monday morning, until he switched on a heater supplied by SGN.

"Trump declines to attend impeachment hearingThe president won't be able to ""participate fairly"" at Wednesday's hearing, the White House says.","Mr Trump and his counsel would have had the opportunity to ask questions at the hearing The White House has said US President Donald Trump and his lawyers will not attend an impeachment hearing on Wednesday, citing a lack of ""fairness"". The hearing by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee marks the next stage of the probe, with legal experts giving testimony that could lead to a vote of impeachment. It is alleged the president pressured Ukraine to conduct two investigations for his own political gain. Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing. After weeks of closed-door witness interviews and public hearings, the process will now focus on possible charges of misconduct, which could lead to an impeachment vote in the House and trial in the Republican-led Senate. The Democratic-led inquiry centres on a phone call in July between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr Trump has dismissed the process as a ""witch hunt"". Trump impeachment inquiry: A simple guide The impeachment story explained Who's who in the Trump-Ukraine story? Last Wednesday, Jerrold Nadler,the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, invited Mr Trump to attend this week's hearing, ""directly or through a counsel"", saying it would be an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis for impeachment. But in a letter to the committee, White House counsel Pat Cipollone accused the committee of a ""complete lack of due process and fundamental fairness"", saying the invitation would fail to give the White House adequate time to prepare and did not give information about the witnesses. Reports suggested witnesses were ""apparently all academics"" and would include ""no fact witnesses"", Mr Cipollone said. A fact witness testifies their personal knowledge of events while an expert witness assists the judge by offering an opinion. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Mr Cipollone also said the committee had called three witnesses but allowed Republicans to call just one, and lambasted Mr Nadler's claim that the process was ""consistent"" with historical impeachment inquiries, arguing that President Bill Clinton had a fairer hearing in 1998. In order for Mr Trump to be represented in further hearings, the president's counsel said, Mr Nadler would need to ensure ""that due process rights are protected"" and that the process was ""fair and just"".

The letter also accused Democrats of scheduling the hearing ""no doubt purposefully"" to conflict with Mr Trump's visit this week to London for a Nato summit. He is due to return to Washington after the judiciary committee hearing. Mr Cipollone's letter did not say whether Mr Trump would attend a second hearing, which does not yet have a date, but added that a response would be given by Friday. Democrats say Mr Trump dangled two bargaining chips - $400m (Â£309m) of military aid to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting with Ukraine's new leader. They think this political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounts to an abuse of power. The first investigation Mr Trump wanted from Ukraine was into one of his main Democratic challengers, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. Hunter joined the board of a Ukrainian company when Joe Biden was US vice-president. The second Trump demand was that Ukraine try to corroborate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the last US presidential election. This theory has been widely debunked, and the US intelligence agencies are unanimous in saying Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016. A SIMPLE GUIDE:If you want a basic take, this one is for you GO DEEPER:Here is a 100, 300 and 800-word summary of the story WHAT IS IMPEACHMENT?A political process to remove a president VIEW FROM TRUMP COUNTRY:Reaction from a West Virginia town CONTEXT:Why Ukraine matters to the US FACT-CHECK:Is the whistleblower linked to the Democrats? First the White House said it would not co-operate with the impeachment probe because it was not formally authorised by the House of Representatives. Then, Donald Trump complained that the congressionally approved process in the Intelligence Committee violated his legal due-process rights. Now the White House says it won't send lawyers to the first Judiciary Committee hearing this week, even though they are permitted to participate. The president still has the opportunity to change course, and Wednesday's hearing could turn out to be a stuffy academic discussion about the impeachment process with little lasting impact, but it's a sign that the White House feels things may be breaking Mr Trump's way. Opinion polls indicate the public's view of impeachment is solidifying on party lines. Those who like the president want the process to end; those who hate him want him gone, whether through impeachment or next November's election. That's a recipe for partisan stalemate. And as long as Republicans continue to stick together, the president has an impenetrable defence against removal from office. While the White House may not be winning the impeachment fight, it's not losing either - and for now that's reason enough to keep the process at arm's length. At the heart of the inquiry is the rough transcript of a phone call on 25 July between Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky, in which Mr Trump asks for ""a favour"" and wants Ukraine to ""look into"" corruption claims involving the Bidens. These claims remain unsubstantiated. The call prompted a whistleblower complaint from an unidentified CIA officer who said Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"". That complaint sparked an impeachment inquiry which has featured diplomats and White House aides giving testimony to Congress. Several testified that there was a ""shadow"" foreign policy to push Ukraine into opening these investigations, and to announce them publicly. The witnesses linked the president to the promise of a White House meeting but none had direct knowledge he had personally held back the military aid. However, Democrats say the evidence is overwhelming that Mr Trump orchestrated the pressure campaign, and point to an admission of a ""quid pro quo"" by White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney at a press conference. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said the committees leading the probe - Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs - are now working on their report, which will be issued on 3 December. On Wednesday, legal experts yet to be named are expected to be heard by the Judiciary Committee, which is responsible for crafting articles of impeachment, or the charges of wrongdoing against the president. It is expected that those charges will be drafted this month. After a vote in the Democratic-controlled House, a trial would be held in the Senate. The White House and some Republicans want the trial to be limited to two weeks. If Mr Trump was convicted by a two-thirds majority - an outcome deemed highly unlikely - he would become the first US president to be removed from office through impeachment.

Trump declines to attend impeachment hearing,"Mr Trump and his counsel would have had the opportunity to ask questions at the hearing The White House has said US President Donald Trump and his lawyers will not attend an impeachment hearing on Wednesday, citing a lack of ""fairness"". The hearing by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee marks the next stage of the probe, with legal experts giving testimony that could lead to a vote of impeachment. It is alleged the president pressured Ukraine to conduct two investigations for his own political gain. Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing. After weeks of closed-door witness interviews and public hearings, the process will now focus on possible charges of misconduct, which could lead to an impeachment vote in the House and trial in the Republican-led Senate. The Democratic-led inquiry centres on a phone call in July between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr Trump has dismissed the process as a ""witch hunt"". Trump impeachment inquiry: A simple guide The impeachment story explained Who's who in the Trump-Ukraine story? Last Wednesday, Jerrold Nadler,the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, invited Mr Trump to attend this week's hearing, ""directly or through a counsel"", saying it would be an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis for impeachment. But in a letter to the committee, White House counsel Pat Cipollone accused the committee of a ""complete lack of due process and fundamental fairness"", saying the invitation would fail to give the White House adequate time to prepare and did not give information about the witnesses. Reports suggested witnesses were ""apparently all academics"" and would include ""no fact witnesses"", Mr Cipollone said. A fact witness testifies their personal knowledge of events while an expert witness assists the judge by offering an opinion. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Mr Cipollone also said the committee had called three witnesses but allowed Republicans to call just one, and lambasted Mr Nadler's claim that the process was ""consistent"" with historical impeachment inquiries, arguing that President Bill Clinton had a fairer hearing in 1998. In order for Mr Trump to be represented in further hearings, the president's counsel said, Mr Nadler would need to ensure ""that due process rights are protected"" and that the process was ""fair and just"".

The letter also accused Democrats of scheduling the hearing ""no doubt purposefully"" to conflict with Mr Trump's visit this week to London for a Nato summit. He is due to return to Washington after the judiciary committee hearing. Mr Cipollone's letter did not say whether Mr Trump would attend a second hearing, which does not yet have a date, but added that a response would be given by Friday. Democrats say Mr Trump dangled two bargaining chips - $400m (Â£309m) of military aid to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting with Ukraine's new leader. They think this political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounts to an abuse of power. The first investigation Mr Trump wanted from Ukraine was into one of his main Democratic challengers, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. Hunter joined the board of a Ukrainian company when Joe Biden was US vice-president. The second Trump demand was that Ukraine try to corroborate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the last US presidential election. This theory has been widely debunked, and the US intelligence agencies are unanimous in saying Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016. A SIMPLE GUIDE:If you want a basic take, this one is for you GO DEEPER:Here is a 100, 300 and 800-word summary of the story WHAT IS IMPEACHMENT?A political process to remove a president VIEW FROM TRUMP COUNTRY:Reaction from a West Virginia town CONTEXT:Why Ukraine matters to the US FACT-CHECK:Is the whistleblower linked to the Democrats? First the White House said it would not co-operate with the impeachment probe because it was not formally authorised by the House of Representatives. Then, Donald Trump complained that the congressionally approved process in the Intelligence Committee violated his legal due-process rights. Now the White House says it won't send lawyers to the first Judiciary Committee hearing this week, even though they are permitted to participate. The president still has the opportunity to change course, and Wednesday's hearing could turn out to be a stuffy academic discussion about the impeachment process with little lasting impact, but it's a sign that the White House feels things may be breaking Mr Trump's way. Opinion polls indicate the public's view of impeachment is solidifying on party lines. Those who like the president want the process to end; those who hate him want him gone, whether through impeachment or next November's election. That's a recipe for partisan stalemate.

Couple's two year fight over contaminated home,"Pat and Donna Workman say they may now have to live in a caravan A family who left their home two years ago after it was contaminated by fuel and sewage are demanding action from those they hold responsible. Pat and Donna Workman believe work carried out by the local authority is to blame for their situation. They said it cost them their life savings, with an estimated Â£250,000 clean-up bill for their Cardigan home. Ceredigion council said it was continuing to work to resolve the situation and was offering advice. Mr and Mrs Workman said they began to notice problems with damp at their home after asphalt was laid on an adjacent lane in 2013. The work was part of a refurbishment programme on Ceredigion council buildings. An extra toilet was also installed in the council building, leading to sewage overflows leaking into the ground around their home, the couple said. They said surveys of their property pinpointed the road-surfacing as the cause of damp. Land under the house has become contaminated by fuel and sewage In 2017, they began smelling petrol fumes in the house. Investigations revealed a fuel line at a neighbouring petrol station had been damaged. The garage owner, Peter Williams, has accused the council of being responsible for damaging pipes during the refurbishment project - but said that has been rejected by the authority. ""The council said we had to move out because it's unsafe,"" said Mr Workman. ""We've been out for two years. We've been paying Â£600 rent and also paying the mortgage in this house which we can't live in. ""All the land underneath the house and around the house has been contaminated."" The Cardigan couple were forced to leave their home two years ago The Workmans said the council offered to pay half the cost of rental accommodation for the first six months. ""After that, they expected us to take a mortgage break, so to stop paying the mortgage,"" said Mr Workman. Family's possessions 'destroyed' by floodwater Residents fight to save 'loved' Tudor building Ex-soldier's hand-built cabin demolished Now, with all their savings gone, the couple said they are considering living in a caravan next to the house. ""All we want is for them to to pay for our accommodation somewhere else, because we don't know how long this is going to last. ""It could last six years - it could take 60 years,"" added the couple. ""Great sympathy"" for the family, says garage owner Peter Williams Mr Williams said he remained in a legal dispute with the council over the pipe issue, and was convinced their work was responsible for causing the damage. ""They're saying it's my fault, and I'm saying it's not,"" he said. ""We're at stalemate. It's dragging on and we don't seem to be getting anywhere. I think the council should be responsible for it."" He said he had great sympathy for the Workman family: ""I've seen the family grow up. They've been good neighbours to me."" Ceredigion council says it is still trying to resolve the situation In a statement, Ceredigion council said it was ""sympathetic"" to the Workman's situation and remained committed to offering advice and assistance. ""The council is also working towards resolution of the contamination issue, but the matter remains extremely complex with a number of technical obstacles present, as well as a number of different parties involved."" The authority said it had commissioned detailed investigations of the site and is considering all available options to enable the family to return to their home.

Nuclear power and Wales - what will parties do?,"Pick up any of the main parties' election manifestos and it is hard to escape pledges on the environment and climate change. The Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru all make promises ranging from a ""green industrial revolution"" to ""decarbonisation"". The UK gets about a fifth of its electricity from nuclear generation, but it is from ageing plants and reactors approaching retirement. Wales' two nuclear plants have already finished generating electricity - Trawsfynydd in Gwynedd back in 1991 followed by Wylfa on Anglesey in 2015, the last - and longest running - Magnox fuel nuclear plant. After almost four years,the very last of those used radioactive Magnox fuel cells were removedfrom the site in September. In January this year, a Â£16bn plan to build a second nuclear power plant at Wylfa was mothballed. After years of planning, land purchases and design hurdles, the Japanese energy giant Hitachi pulled the plug on the project, leaving the company it owned - Horizon Nuclear Power - to sack its 1,000-strong workforce, costing HorizonÂ£1.7bn in pre-tax losses. But the plans are not entirely dead - rather in a state of suspended animation - and the planning process to approve the technology for the new Anglesey plant continues. The UK government - whoever is elected after the general election - is legally committed to giving a decision on theDevelopment Consent Order,externalnext year. On Anglesey, nuclear has always been a hot potato of a topic - especially at election time. Wylfa remained a significant employer since electricity generation ended while fuel cells were removed from the site. A lingering hope remains that a new plant will be built - and with it, more jobs - always a vote winner. Climate change: Is nuclear power the answer? Wylfa and the energy gap But there is also a vocal anti-nuclear lobby - they would rather see cash invested in wind, wave and solar technology, which is also a significant employer in a constituency that dubs itself 'energy island,external'. Politics on the island It is a constituency that has been a three-way marginal seat more often than not held by Labour, Conservatives and Plaid Cymru in the 15 general elections since work to build the original Wylfa plant began in 1963. Since then, the voters of Ynys Mon have traditionally returned the sitting MP then switched party allegiance the three times those sitting MPs stepped aside from politics - from Labour to Tory in 1979, Tory to Plaid in 1987 and Plaid back to Labour in 2001. In this election, Labour's Albert Owen has retired after 18 years as the island's MP. Is there a new future on the horizon for Trawsfynydd? While Trawsfynydd near Dolgellau in Gwynedd saw its nuclear plant close nearly 30 years ago, the atomic energy story there may not have finished. About 200 people still work on decommissioning the old site, but that is expected to steadily fall over the next decade. But there is a new buzz about the place - and it is all about Small Modular Reactors - or SMRs. The UK government's research and innovation arm is pumping Â£18m into a consortium led by Rolls-Royce to develop low-cost, factory assembled small nuclear plants. Those involved hope they can use these sites to deliver ""nuclear power at the price of wind"". A consortium led by Rolls-Royce wants to deliver small reactors within a decade Rolls-Royce's chief technology officer Paul Stein has made no secret of the fact Trawsfynydd is in its sights as a potential host for one of these new generation of small nuclear plants. He has gone on the record to state he believes there was a ""pretty high probability"" that Wales would be an early beneficiary of its first forays into building these reactors. Roll-Royce and its partners would like to see the first SMRs up, running and generating electricity within eight to 10 years. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external IN-DEPTH:More general election explainers and features Where do the parties stand on nuclear? The Conservatives have been emphatically in favour of nuclear power -their manifesto states,external: ""We will support gas for hydrogen production and nuclear energy, including fusion, as important parts of the energy system, alongside increasing our commitment to renewables."" Asked specifically about Wales - and Wylfa, the party said: ""The Welsh Conservatives support Wyfla B and we believe that nuclear power will continue to play a vital role in meeting the energy needs of Wales and the UK in the coming decades. ""We do not believe that Wales will need more nuclear power stations in addition to Wyfla."" Labour's manifesto,externalis equally clear in Wales - it is also backing nuclear power - insisting new nuclear is ""needed for energy security"". On Wylfa Newydd - the party said: ""The Tories have let down the people of Ynys MÃ´n by failing to deliver the Wylfa project. Labour will work with people on the island to maximise its potential for new nuclear energy, alongside investment in renewables."" Plaid Cymru also addresses the issue - which is politically tricky for a party with an eye on recapturing Anglesey from Labour. Its manifesto states,externalit will ""oppose the development of new sites for nuclear power stations"". On Wylfa, the party said: ""The question is hypothetical as the plans are currently suspended and no-one is proposing to underwrite the project. ""Plaid Cymru opposes new nuclear projects and our priority is on the green jobs revolution - investing in renewables, creating tens of thousands of green collar jobs (including on Anglesey) and tackling the climate emergency."" The Liberal Democrats say they want to ""decarbonise the power sector completely"". The party'sUK manifesto,externaldoes not deal with the issue of nuclear energy directly - rather focusing on ""supporting renewables"". But the Welsh party  said there was currently ""no economic or environmental case"" to build any new nuclear plants in the UK. They went even further on Wylfa and new Welsh plants: ""We therefore would not support a new nuclear site on Wylfa Newydd or new nuclear stations elsewhere in Wales."" However,because of the electoral pact with Plaid Cymru- the Welsh Liberal Democrats and the Green Party are not fielding candidates in Ynys MÃ´n. The Green Party said nuclear energy was ""a distraction from developing renewable energy"". It says it would ""prohibit the construction of nuclear power stations""in its manifesto, 'If Not Now, When',external. UKIP's manifesto,externalstates: ""UK needs a mix of energy sources comprising nuclear, conventional and renewable"", while nuclear power does not feature in theBrexit Party's election contract,external.

Australian blogger being 'shackled in China',"Yang Hengjun, a popular blogger and former Chinese diplomat, was detained in January Australia says the treatment endured by one of its citizens in criminal detention in China is ""unacceptable"". Chinese-Australian writer Dr Yang Hengjun has been held in Beijing since January. He has been accused of espionage - charges denied by him and the Australian government. He now faces daily interrogations while being shackled, and has been increasingly isolated, Canberra said. Australia has consistently lobbied Chinese authorities for his release. But China's foreign ministry has told Australia to not interfere in the case, and to respect the nation's ""judicial sovereignty"". On Monday, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said she was ""very concerned"" about his condition, which was reported in a recent consulate visit. Mr Yang, a former Chinese diplomat, has been allowed one visit from Australian officials per month. But he has been barred from contact with his lawyers and his family for close to 11 months and has not been given any of their letters. Supporters say his health has deteriorated in recent months. China formally charged him in August. The Australian 'democracy peddler' detained in China 'I'm in Australia but I feel censored by Chinese students' Australia asks China to allow Uighur pair's travel Mr Yang, a scholar and novelist based in New York, was detained when he travelled to China in January with his wife Yuan Ruijuan and her child. Prior to the arrest he had maintained an active presence on Chinese social media. Nicknamed ""the democracy peddler"", he maintained a blog on the country's current affairs and international relations. However, he had not been directly critical of Chinese authorities in recent years. Beijing has held him for alleged ""involvement in criminal activities endangering China's national security"". Australia has called for clarification of the charges. Australia has also repeatedly requested that he receive ""basic standards of justice, procedural fairness and humane treatment"" during his detention. His lawyers say his treatment has got worse as Chinese authorities attempt to extract a confession from him. His case must be brought before a court by March. Canberra's rebuke comes as tensions remain heightened with Beijing. Australia's political classwas rocked last week by allegations of Chinese espionageand interference in domestic issues. China has strongly dismissed the claims as ""imaginary fears"".

Huawei executive enjoys art and books in detention,"Meng Wanzhou on her way to court in Vancouver in September, as part of her fight against extradition to the US A Chinese Huawei executive who was arrested in Canada a year ago has published an open letter detailing her life on bail and thanking supporters. Meng Wanzhou - the chief financial officer and daughter of Huawei's founder - is fighting extradition to the US on charges of violating sanctions against Iran. In her widely read letter, she said she had time to ""read a book"" and ""complete an oil painting"" while on bail. Her arrest sparked a diplomatic row. China has always said the charges against Ms Meng are politically motivated. Shortly after her arrest, two Canadians were detained in China, but Beijing says the cases are not related to Ms Meng. Michael Spavor, aconsultant with links to North Korea, and Michael Kovrig, a former diplomatwho works for an NGO,external, are accused of spying - although Canada has called their detention ""arbitrary"". They are being held in a detention centre and are allowed only infrequent visits from consular staff. On Monday, Mr Kovrig's employer tweeted that he hadyet to see a lawyer or his family,external. In April, it was reported that both men were being interrogated for between six to eight hours a day, and weresometimes subject to 24-hour artificial lighting,external. In July, guards reportedly confiscated Mr Kovrig's reading glasses. Ms Weng's letter waspublished on the Huawei website,externaland on social media, on the anniversary of her detention. In it, she thanked her supporters in Canada, saying the applause in the public gallery after the court granted her bail, 11 days into her detention, had ""made her burst into tears"". As part of the bail conditions, Ms Meng was given an electronic tag, and a 23:00-06:00 curfew, but was allowed to travel aroundmuch of Vancouver. ""When I was in Shenzhen [in China], time used to pass by very quickly,"" Ms Meng wrote on Sunday night. ""I always felt like I was being stretched thin and that there was never enough time to get everything done."" Now, she wrote, time passes so slowly ""I have enough time to read a book from cover to cover. I can take the time to discuss minutiae with my colleagues or to carefully complete an oil painting"". The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Huawei: The story of a controversial company Huawei executive launches extradition fight She also praised ""the kindness of people here in Canada"", and ""the kindness of the correctional officers and inmates at the Alouette Correctional Center for Women"" where she was detained. Ms Meng is fighting extradition to the US, where she is wanted for a host of charges, includingevading sanctions on Iran- something she and Huawei deny. Her case is due to be heard in January. She made no comment on the allegations in the letter. BBC Monitoring said the version of the letter posted on Huawei's social media channel had had more than 60 million views by Monday morning. News of Meng Wanzhou's arrest in 2018 broke just after China's president Xi Jinping and Donald Trump sat down to dinner in Buenos Aires, Argentina at the G20 summit, to thrash out trade war issues. The two leaders came to an understanding and a truce was signed - but thousands of miles away in Canada, a new battle was just beginning. Ms Meng's arrest was seen as a turning point in the US-China trade war; an illustration of how serious the Trump administration was about going after Huawei - particularly on issues like technology theft and violations of American law. For China, Ms Meng's arrest was seen as an attack like no other. If Huawei is the crown jewel of Chinese tech, then Ms Meng is its princess. Although Beijing denies it, the detention of the two Canadians Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor was widely seen as punishment for taking sides - and a warning to other countries who might consider copying Canada's decision. Michael Spavor (L) and Michael Kovrig have been held since December The two Canadians were detained in December, shortly after Ms Weng was detained. Their detention led to a diplomatic and trade row, with China blocking tens millions of dollars' worth of Canadian pork and vegetable oil exports. They wereformally arrested in May, and can be held for up to 13-and-a-half-months before charges are filed, the Canadian government says. In September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused China of ""using arbitrary detention as a tool to achieve political goals"".

Maltese prime minister to resign in new yearJoseph Muscat makes the announcement amid anger over the inquiry into a journalist's murder.,"Joseph Muscat has been in office six years Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has announced on national TV that he will step down in the new year, amid a crisis over a murdered journalist. He said he would ask the ruling Labour Party to begin the process to choose his successor on 12 January. Demonstrators have demanded his immediate resignation over the inquiry into Daphne Caruana Galizia's death. She was killed by a car bomb in 2017 as she investigated corruption among Malta's business and political elite. A businessman with alleged links to government officials was charged with complicity in the murder on Saturday. Why Maltaâs prime minister had to go The key figures in Malta's crisis Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Muscat said of the way the murder inquiry had been handled: ""Some decisions were good while others could have been better made."" ""All the responsibility I had to shoulder surely does not compare to the pain that the victim's family is enduring,"" he added. He said he would resign as leader of the Labour Party on 12 January and as prime minister ""in the days after"". Mr Muscat has been in power for six years, winning two elections by a landslide and presiding over a period of prosperity and social reform in the EU's smallest member state. ""Malta needs to start a new chapter and only I can give that signal,"" Mr Muscat said. He took the decision after a four-hour meeting with Labour's parliamentary group, at which MPs gave ""unanimous support to all decisions which the Prime Minister will be taking"". A large crowd of protesters earlier rallied in the capital Valletta to demand Mr Muscat's immediate resignation. Copies of a photo showing Mr Muscat's former chief of staff, Keith Schembri, alongside Melvin Theuma, an alleged middleman in Caruana Galizia's murder, were pinned to the gates of the building. Demonstrators filled Valletta's streets Fury over Mr Muscat's handling of the crisis grew this weekend when businessman Yorgen Fenech was charged with complicity in the murder, an allegation he denies. Mr Fenech was identified last year as being the owner of a mysterious Dubai-registered company, 17 Black, listed in the Panama Papers - a massive leak of documents from an offshore law firm in 2016. There were allegations that 17 Black planned to make secret payments to companies set up by Mr Schembri and Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi. This video can not be played Galizia's son, Paul, in 2018 called for a public inquiry over his mother's death Both men resigned this week but deny any wrongdoing, and Mr Mizzi has denied any business links to Mr Fenech. Three other men are in custody charged with Caruana Galizia's actual murder, which involved a car bomb. What happened after the Panama Papers? Malta country profile The murdered journalist's family said the prime minister had been left deeply compromised and should resign because he had failed, for the past two years, to take action to clean up politics in Malta. They argued that as long as he remained in place, a full investigation into Caruana Galizia's death was not possible. In another development, Mr Muscat's Economy Minister, Chris Cardona, was reinstated on Sunday after suspending himself on Tuesday after he was questioned by police. He denies any wrongdoing. Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December 2017 and pleaded not guilty in pre-trial proceedings. Caruana Galizia (pictured in 1989) was survived by her husband and children Vincent Muscat later told police the bomb had been placed in Caruana Galizia's car while it was parked outside the walled compound where she lived. The killings earned the trio 150,000 euros (Â£132,000),Reuters news agency reports,external.

Climate talks to open as 'point of no return' looms,"This video can not be played COP25: What you need to know about the climate conference The president of an island nation on the frontline of climate change says it is in a ""fight to the death"" after freak waves inundated the capital. Powerful swells averaging 5m (16ft) washed across the capital of the Marshall Islands, Majuro, last week. But President Hilda Heine said the Pacific nation had been fighting rising tides even before last week's disaster. Political leaders and climate diplomats are meeting in Madrid for two weeks of talks amid a growing sense of crisis. This conference of the parties, or COP25, was due to be held in Chile but was cancelled by the government due to weeks of civil disturbances. Spain then stepped in to host the event, which will see 29,000 attendees over the two weeks of talks. Greenhouse gas concentrations break records Massive Attack help create carbon-zero tours Critical year for climate change What is climate change? Climate change: Where we are in seven charts School protesters are among those who have taken to the streets The world's average surface temperature is rising rapidly because human activities release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). These gasestrap heat in the atmosphere, a bit like the glass roof of a greenhouse. At the meeting, Ms Heine commented: ""Water covers much of our land at one or other point of the year as we fight rising tides.  As we speak hundreds of people have evacuated their homes after large waves caused the ocean to inundate parts of our capital in Majuro last week."" She added: ""It's a fight to the death for anyone not prepared to flee. As a nation we refuse to flee.  But we also refuse to die."" Ms Heine is not alone in the view that small nations like the Marshall Islands face an imminent existential threat. At the Madrid summit, ambassador Lois Young, from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which represents low-lying coastal countries and small island nations, launched a rebuke to the world's big polluters. ""We are disappointed by inadequate action by developed countries and outraged by the dithering and retreat of one of the most culpable polluters from the Paris Agreement,"" she said. ""In the midst of a climate emergency, retreat and inaction are tantamount to sanctioning ecocide. They reflect profound failure to honour collective global commitment to protect the most vulnerable. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map ""With our very existence at stake, COP 25 must demonstrate unprecedented ambition to avert ecocide."" The COP25 meeting will aim to step up ambition so that all countries increase their national commitments to cut emissions. The meeting follows on the heels of three UN reports which stressed the increased urgency of limiting dangerous climate change. According to UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres, ""the point of no return is no longer over the horizon"". Speaking ahead of the meeting, he said political leaders had to respond to the imminent climate crisis. This video can not be played The man who took wind power to another level ""In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. ""We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions,"" Mr Guterres said. Almost every country in the world has now signed and ratified the Paris climate agreement and under the terms of the pact they will all have to put new climate pledges on the table before the end of 2020. The UN secretary general says no new coal-fired power stations should be built after 2020 This meeting in Madrid signals the start of a frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November next year. Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend the meeting in the Spanish capital - but US President Donald Trump will not be among them. The US became a signatory to the landmark Paris climate agreement in April 2016, under the Obama administration. But President Trump has said the accord - which has been signed by more than 190 countries - would lead to lost jobs and lower wages for American workers. Last month, hebegan the process of withdrawing from the Paris deal. However, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, will attend the conference with a congressional delegation. While her presence has been welcomed, US environmentalists want to see concrete steps on climate. ""While it's great Speaker Pelosi is coming to Madrid in place of Trump, symbolic gestures are no substitute for bold action,"" said Jean Su from the US Center for Biological Diversity. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA ""America remains the number one historic contributor to the climate emergency, and even Democratic politicians have never committed to taking responsibility for our fair share."" Underlining the real world impacts of climate change, a report from the charity Save the Children, says that what it calls ""climate shocks"" are threatening tens of millions of people in East and Southern Africa. The charity says 33 million people are at emergency levels of food insecurity due to cyclones and droughts. More than half of these are believed to be children. The situation has been made worse because the two strongest cyclones ever to hit the African continent, affected the same region just weeks apart. This video can not be played What is global warming? Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi last March, while six weeks later Cyclone Kenneth slammed Mozambique with millions affected by flooding.

Arctic coal passage to India threatens wildlife,"An icebreaker (red) escorts Russian cargo ships on the Northern Sea Route Natural riches come in two conflicting types in Russia's Arctic north: valuable minerals and spectacular wildlife. But sadly for many threatened species, the decline in Arctic sea ice has created a new economic opportunity for Russia in their remote habitat. In a decree last year President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian firms to boost cargo traffic on the Northern Sea Route to an annual 80m tonnes by 2024. Ambitious energy co-operation deals were signed with India in Vladivostok, in Russia's far east, in October. One centres on a big open-cast coal mining project in the Taymyr Peninsula, in the far north of central Siberia. The area is rich in high-quality coking coal (anthracite), used to make steel and aluminium. Dharmendra Pradhan, India's Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, said: ""We are the second largest coal importer in the world, and we intend to achieve production of 3m tonnes of steel per year by 2030, so we need to increase coal supplies."" The Taymyr coal mining is open-cast, like at this mine in Yakutia, eastern Russia But Taymyr is a haven for wildlife. It has Russia's largest nature reserve - Bolshoi Arkticheskiy - covering 4.2m hectares (16,200 sq miles). On TV President Putin presents himself as a caring conservationist,famously relaxing in Siberia's unspoilt wilderness.,external But he is also championing the expansion of fossil fuel projects in that wilderness. Russia is boosting trade with China, India and other growing Asian markets hungry for raw materials. Coal is to contribute to meeting that 80m-tonne target for Arctic deliveries, which will go via Russia's far east. But such shipments pose considerable risks. Despite global warming, icebreakers still play a key role, as winter temperatures plunge below minus 20C. Remote settlements lack equipment to deal with any pollution emergency. And long voyages to India will mean more greenhouse gas emissions from shipping. Russia floating nuclear power station sets sail The Arctic is estimated to have 72% of Russia's total gas reserves. Oil and gas mega-projects are far advanced further west, notably on the Yamal Peninsula. The snowy owl (L) and red-breasted goose: many bird species flock to Taymyr In Taymyr the coastal tundra - marshland with permanently frozen subsoil - is a nesting ground for migratory birds, which fly there for the brief Arctic summer. Polar bears sometimes come ashore on Taymyr while, inland, vast reindeer herds roam and snowy owls hunt lemmings. Along with the pollution threat, reindeer are now seriously threatened by poaching, says Alexey Knizhnikov, a conservationist at WWF Russia. ""Developing new projects in such an ecologically sensitive area is madness, in our view,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played Human-polar bear confrontations are becoming ever more common due to the effects of climate change There is already pollution with heavy metals and sulphur dioxide (SO2) around the city of Norilsk, from the Norilsk Nickel ore smelter. Russia firm admits 'red river' spillage A Greenpeace study published in August said:,external""In terms of individual hotspots, the Norilsk smelter complex continues to be the largest SO2 emission hotspot in the world."" It also found India to be the world's top SO2 emitter. Now a bay just south of Dikson - a tiny weather-beaten port and one of the world's remotest settlements - is a new, ecological danger zone. An anthracite coalfield lies at Medusa Bay, part of the Bolshoi Arkticheskiy nature reserve. The bay attracts big flocks of birds, including six rare or endangered species: the small swan, peregrine falcon, gyrfalcon, white-headed loon, white-tailed eagle and red-breasted goose. Bolshoi Arkticheskiy nature reserve in Taymyr: a wilderness now at risk from mining The open-cast coal company, Vostokugol,external, is embroiled in a legal battle with the state environmental monitoring agency, Rosprirodnadzor, over mining violations. Vostokugol is appealing against a ruling that it abused the licensing system: a Moscow court found it had mined and exported coal from Medusa Bay, yet only had permits for prospecting. It was fined 601m roubles (Â£7.3m; $9.4m). The company has a joint production deal with Coal India Limited, an industrial giant. Meanwhile, Greenpeace urged Russia's chief prosecutor in August to intervene, after the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources more than halved the size of a buffer zone protecting Medusa Bay nature reserve. The zone - where mining and related construction are banned - was reduced to 1,150 hectares (2,842 acres), from 3,020 ha. That government move in July came despite a 2016 plea from the ministry itself and the Taymyr nature reserve authority to site a planned new coal terminal well away from the reserve. In line with Mr Putin's Arctic ambitions, Vostokugol is developing - albeit slowly - the Medusa Bay coalfield and two coal terminals for loading on to ships. Greenpeace says the Chaika terminal is just 1km (0.6 miles) from the nature reserve. ""At that distance, when coal is loaded at the terminal, coal dust will pour down on the nature reserve,"" says the Greenpeace legal complaint against the natural resources ministry. Vostokugol plans to export 20m tonnes of coal from there by 2024. Another firm, Severnaya Zvezda, also has licences to mine coal in Taymyr. Vostokugol's shiny new office block in Dikson contrasts with old buildings nearby Vostokugol started mining and building infrastructure at Medusa Bay in 2016, but later suspended operations. The company did not respond to the BBC's questions. Just 2km from the open-cast coal mine standsan international bird monitoring centre - the Willem Barents Biological Station.,externalIt was set up with Dutch government funding in 1994. Dr Sergey Kharitonov, a biologist, was there last year. Coal dust from the mine had already reached as far as Dikson, he told the BBC. ""The bird populations are in danger, I'm worried about their future,"" he said. ""The place has lots of coal, and it's apparently easy and profitable to mine it."" WWF's Alexey Knizhnikov said ""there is little transparency in this project - there is a lack of regulation and they didn't do any public consultations"". More than 500,000 reindeer migrate across Taymyr Strategic priorities however are driving this mining and energy extraction in the polar wilderness. Russia is the world's third-largest coal exporter (210m tonnes in 2018), after Indonesia (439mt) and Australia (382mt),the World Coal Association reports.,external Payakha oilfield in Taymyr is another new industrial project Read related stories on similar topics: 'Bleak' outlook as carbon emissions gap grows Quit 'coal addiction', UN boss warns Asia Will global warming open up Arctic trade?

India and Russia signed an energy co-operation agreement in Vladivostok in September Russia aims to boost its coal exports to India six-fold by 2025, to 28m tonnes annually.

Vigil to be held for London Bridge victims,"The family of Jack Merritt take part in a vigil at the Guildhall in Cambridge Vigils for the victims of the London Bridge attack have been held in London and Cambridge. Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were commemorated at the services, which included a minute's silence. They were stabbed to death by Usman Khan - convicted of terrorism in 2012 - at a prisoner rehabilitation event. The BBC has learned Khan, 28, was put under MI5 investigation when he left prison a year ago but was given one of the lowest priorities. Mr Merritt and Ms Jones were both graduates of the University of Cambridge's institute of criminology and had been taking part in an event for itsLearning Together programme- which focuses on education within the criminal justice system - when they were killed on Friday. 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker London Bridge: What we know so far Families lead tributes to London attack victims Mr Merritt's family and his girlfriend attended the service in Cambridge outside the Guildhall. This video can not be played London Bridge: Cambridge vigils held for attack victims Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among those at the vigil at the Guildhall in the City of London. They were joined London Mayor Sadiq Khan who said the best way to defeat the hatred shown in the attack was to focus on the values of hope, unity and love. Jack Merritt was a co-ordinator of the Learning Together programme and Saskia Jones a volunteer ""The best way to defeat this hatred is not by turning on one another, but it's by focussing on the values that bind us, to take hope from the heroism of ordinary Londoners and our emergency services who ran towards danger, risking their lives to help people they didn't even know,"" he said. The London service happened less than a mile from Fishmongers' Hall, where Usman Khan launched his attack. This video can not be played A moment of silence was held at the vigil for the victims in London Bishop of London Sarah Mullally said the vigils remembered ""academics celebrating rehabilitation and finding only danger"". She paid tribute to the workers at Fishmongers' Hall, who she said went to work to offer hospitality, but found themselves needing to give protection. A book of condolences is open at Guildhall Art Gallery and members of the public are invited to lay flowers outside nearby Mansion House. The vigil in Guildhall Yard in London was led by Bishop of London Sarah Mullally Members of the public also paid their tributes A vigil was also held at Anglia Ruskin University, where Saskia Jones attended before taking her masters at Cambridge The victims' familiespaid tribute to their loved onesover the weekend. Mr Merritt was a co-ordinator of the Learning Together programme and Ms Jones a volunteer Ms Jones's family said their daughter, from Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire,had a ""great passion"" for supporting victims of criminal injustice. In a statement, Mr Merritt's family described him as a""talented boy"" who ""died doing what he loved"". Mr Merritt's father went on to criticise the Daily Mail and Daily Express newspapers for their coverage of Prime Minister Boris Johnson'spromise to review licence conditionsplaced on convicted terrorists released from jail. On Twitter, David Merritt shared images of the Mail and Express front pages - which reported a ""blitz on freed jihadis"" -and wrote,external: ""Don't use my son's death, and his and his colleague's photos - to promote your vile propaganda. Jack stood against everything you stand for - hatred, division, ignorance."" Jack Merritt's family said he was 'looking forward to building a future with his girlfriend, Leanne' The family of Saskia Jones said her death ""will leave a huge void in our lives"" Cambridge University's vice-chancellor Prof Stephen J Toope said he was ""devastated to learn that among the victims were staff and alumni"". Toby Williamson, chief executive of Fishmongers' Hall, praised the bravery of his staff who intervened to stop the attacker, hailing their actions as ""extraordinary things done by ordinary people"". Mr Williamson told how Polish chef Lukasz suffered five wounds to his left-hand side as he fended off the knifeman with a narwhal tusk during ""about a minute of one-on-one straight combat"" - allowing others time to escape danger. This video can not be played The chief executive of Fishmongers Hall, Commodore Toby Williamson describes how his staff fought back Two others grabbed makeshift weapons including a fire extinguisher before the attacker fled down a staircase and then got trapped in reception. Dr Vin Diwakar, medical director for the NHS in London, said two people injured in the attack remained in a stable condition in hospital, while one had been able to return home. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Khan, who was released from prison in December 2018 after serving half of his sentence was shot dead by police on London Bridge. The BBC understands Khan was formally under investigation by MI5 as he left jail but placed in the second-to-bottom category of investigations as his initial risk to the public was thought to be minimal. This was consistent with the grading given to most other people convicted of terrorism offences as they go back into the community under a release licence. Why was the London Bridge attacker out of prison? What is Learning Together? London Bridge sentencing row - who did what? A low level of prioritisation is assigned to offenders such as Khan because their release comes with a strict set of licence conditions. These conditions theoretically provide suitable monitoring and oversight, such as alerts if they contact other suspects or travel outside an approved area. Khan, the BBC has learned, was on the highest-level of such community monitoring. The overall package, in theory, relives pressure on MI5 so the security service can focus on more immediate threats. The prime minister said on Sunday that74 people jailed for terror offences and released early will have their licence conditions reviewed. Later that day, Staffordshire Police said a 34-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts - but added there was no information to suggest the man was involved in the London Bridge attack. The man has been named as Nazam Hussain, who was jailed in 2012 alongside Usman Khan and received the same sentence - 16 years with half of that served in prison - after pleading guilty to preparing acts of terrorism. Following his arrest, Hussain was recalled to prison due to a suspected breach of his licence conditions. Inquiries by detectives into the potential terrorism offences are continuing, police said. Another man, Yayha Rashid, 23, of north London, has been charged following his arrest on Sunday on suspicion of breaching notification requirements. The Metropolitan Police said Rashid's arrest was not connected with the London Bridge attack. Friday's incident comes after theUK's terrorism threat level was downgraded on 4 November from ""severe"" to ""substantial"", meaning that attacks were thought to be ""likely"" rather than ""highly likely"". The terror threat level is reviewed every six months by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which makes recommendations independent of government.

Critical year for climate change begins in Madrid,"An image showing carbon dioxide emissions over the Earth A critical 12 months in the battle against rising temperatures begins in Madrid this week, as UN delegates gather for key talks. The 25th Conference of the Parties, or COP, will see negotiators from almost 200 countries in attendance. Ahead of the meeting the UN secretary general has warned that the world is at the point of no return. AntÃ³nio Guterres said the global response to date has been ""utterly inadequate"". Massive Attack help create carbon-zero tours Is the climate passing some key 'tipping points'? Climate signal links global floods and fires The conference takes place amid a welter of bad news on climate change in recent days. The World Meteorological Organisation announced thatgreenhouse gas concentrations reached their highest recorded levelin 2018. The UN Environment Programme showed thatthere's a huge gap between the plans that governments currently have on the table to cut emissions and what's neededto keep under 1.5C. Keeping to that guardrail will need a five-fold increase in the carbon cutting ambitions of countries. The UN Secretary General warned delegates ahead of the meeting ""the point of no return was no longer over the horizon"". ""We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions,"" Mr Guterres said. As well as demanding that the negotiators increase their level of carbon cutting ambition at this meeting, Mr Guterres announced that the Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney will take on the role of UN Special Envoy on climate action and climate finance. Yes, this annual event, the Conference of the Parties or COP was due to take place in the Chilean capital Santiago this year.It was cancelled by President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era due to ongoing civil unrest in the country. After a brief flurry of diplomatic activity,Spain said they would step into the void and host the conference,external, with Chile still leading the diplomatic negotiations. The Spanish argue that it is critical to support a UN process that depends on global co-operation in the face of rising nationalism around the world. ""COP25 will reaffirm that multilateralism is the best tool to solve global challenges such as climate change,"" said Spain's minister for the ecological transition Teresa Ribera. ""Neither the UN nor the international community have let the climate agenda fall, despite the challenges to organise this event, because this is a vital moment to drive implementation and action. Spain immediately offered to organise the summit in record time. There is no turning back."" The hope is that this meeting will concentrate the minds of international diplomats on the huge scale of the challenge. Governments have promised to update their climate pledges by 2020, whenthe COP will be held in Glasgow. But so far, despite the urgings of scientists, major improvements in pledges have been slow to materialise. Many nations have aspirations to carbon neutrality in the long term, but they have been slow to put specific short-term commitments on the table. ""Some 70 countries have pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050, this must be carried on at Madrid COP,"" said Sonam Wangdi, the Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group in UN climate change negotiations. ""There must be an agreement among us all to do our fair share. If it doesn't happen in Madrid it could be too late for 2020 pledges."" The hope for Madrid is that the meeting can avoid major bust ups and keep edging forward. It also has to overcome two possible banana skins - loss and damage, and carbon markets. This issue has dogged the negotiations for several years now, but the likelihood is that it will come to a head in Madrid. Loss and damage are the impacts that can't be prevented or adapted to by countries. Extreme weather events like Cyclone Kenneth in Mozambique are said to be examples of loss and damage, say campaigners Some experts consider ""loss"" to apply to the complete destruction of something such as human lives, habitats and species. ""Damage"" refers to something that can be repaired, such as roads or buildings. So the examples that are given are rising sea levels which can't be prevented, or storms that are connected to rising temperatures. Back in 2013, under pressure from developing countries, the climate talks set up a special forum to discuss loss and damage. In Madrid the delegates must decide how to progress. Poorer nations want the loss and damage to have teeth within the UN setup, and more importantly, funding. ""Everybody has to recognise that there is a need and then there must be a funding window,"" said Sonam Wangdi from the LDCs. ""Once you have that, where the funding comes from is secondary, right now there is no fund."" Rich countries fear that the whole question is a way of tying them into paying out for sea level rise and storms for centuries ahead, because the bulk of the carbon in the atmosphere comes from fossil fuels used by the developed world. As the conference starts, 150 environmental groups including climate activists Naomi Klein and Lidy Nacpil have written to ministers calling for adequate funding for loss and damage. They say the combination of climate disasters and debt can prove toxic for developing nations. ""The climate crisis has been causing death, despair and displacement in the global south,"" said Harjeet Singh from Action Aid. ""This bullying of the countries hardest hit by climate change, by those that got rich from extracting and consuming fossil fuels, must end now."" Hot air is in fact one of the big concerns with the question of carbon markets. In the past richer countries have often paid for carbon reduction projects in poorer nations. The wealthy have then been able to count the carbon saved from these projects against their own emissions. These schemes were discredited amid accusations of fraud and ""double counting"" where both the poor and the rich countries counted the same emissions reduction as part of their plans. A wind farm in China built with funding from richer countries. The carbon credits created by projects like this are controversial Article six of the Paris agreement set out to reform these carbon markets, recognising that if they were transparent and effective they could really help to raise ambitions. Discussions on how the new arrangements would work were due to be completed in Katowice at the COP last year butthey ran into real problems. Brazil resisted all attempts to curtail double counting. Other countries wanted to carry forward carbon credits from older schemes. Some also want to be able to sell or carry forward credits if they overachieve on their existing carbon cutting plans, which observers feel would encourage countries to set a low bar in terms of commitments. Experts often call these types of credits ""hot air"" as they are more an accounting exercise than a real reduction in carbon dioxide. The amount of ""hot air"" is huge, running into billions of tonnes of carbon. Experts fear that these could undermine the integrity of the Paris pact if they are allowed to continue. ""We believe that these markets will have an impact but they must result in real reductions on the ground,"" said Sonam Wangdi from the LDCs. ""The option is needed and the carbon market is one of the tools - but there needs to be environmental integrity and they need to be transparent and there needs to be real reductions there."" Trying to get unanimous agreement between almost 200 countries on how to tackle climate change is a really big ask. The agreement that was struck in Paris in 2015 only came about after six long years of snail pace negotiations. It was the deal that diplomats had hoped to strike in the failed Copenhagen COP in 2009. So if the goal is that countries have new promises in place by the end of 2020, Madrid is an important snapshot of what can realistically be achieved. Countries often tend to hold back on their pledges until they see what others are likely to do. Madrid will give a sense of whether there is a willingness from some of the larger countries, like India, China and the EU, to show leadership. ""After 30 years of advocacy and optimism, we see COP 25 as the last opportunity to take decisive action,"" said Ambassador Janine Felson from Belize, the deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States. ""Anything short of a vastly greater commitment to emission reduction through new national plans that are consistent with our fight for a 1.5 degree world, greater momentum towards honouring outstanding 2020 climate finance commitments, a new climate finance goal suitable for achieving a 1.5 degree world and tangible support for disaster risk reduction and reconstruction in small island and developing states will signal a willingness to accept catastrophe."" This could be the last year in which a US team will play a part in the negotiations. On 4 November President Trump sent a formal letter to the UN, which has triggered the 12-month countdown to the US pullout. President Trump has kept a campaign promise to his supporters to pull out of the Paris pact The Americans are due to leave on 4 November 2020, one day after the next US presidential election and five days ahead of the critical COP26 in Glasgow. The US has been playing a more truculent role in recent negotiations, joining with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia to prevent the conference welcoming a key IPCC report on how the world can keep temperatures under 1.5C this century. Over the past couple of years the US has also supported side events promoting coal and will likely continue to do so in the future. Even if they do withdraw completely next year, that will only be from the Paris agreement part of the negotiations. The US will still be party to the UN climate convention. It is unlikely they will stop sending teams to the conferences. Just a year ago, Greta Thunberg attended the Katowice COP as a relatively unknown Swedish student who was taking direct action in striking from school for the climate. A year later and she has become a global icon who can get a standing ovation from diplomats by calling out their hypocrisy on rising temperatures. Greta's dedication to the cause has been enhanced by her decision to cross the Atlantic in a yacht to attend the Santiago meeting. Now she is on another boat on her way back to Madrid. She is due to arrive a few days after the start. Her participation and her speech will likely make headlines around the world. Conferences like the COP are rooted in a traditional UN diplomatic that requires a unanimous agreement on steps forward. While environmental campaigners and others can observe, there is limited input from young people, school strikers and other voices. Nordic countries are attempting to do something different this year with ministers from Sweden, Finland and Iceland inviting five young people from different countries to take part in discussions with politicians and report back from COP25.

"Australian blogger being 'shackled in China'Australian citizen Yang Hengjun, a former diplomat, has been detained in China since January.Australia","Yang Hengjun, a popular blogger and former Chinese diplomat, was detained in January Australia says the treatment endured by one of its citizens in criminal detention in China is ""unacceptable"". Chinese-Australian writer Dr Yang Hengjun has been held in Beijing since January. He has been accused of espionage - charges denied by him and the Australian government. He now faces daily interrogations while being shackled, and has been increasingly isolated, Canberra said. Australia has consistently lobbied Chinese authorities for his release. But China's foreign ministry has told Australia to not interfere in the case, and to respect the nation's ""judicial sovereignty"". On Monday, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said she was ""very concerned"" about his condition, which was reported in a recent consulate visit. Mr Yang, a former Chinese diplomat, has been allowed one visit from Australian officials per month. But he has been barred from contact with his lawyers and his family for close to 11 months and has not been given any of their letters. Supporters say his health has deteriorated in recent months. China formally charged him in August. The Australian 'democracy peddler' detained in China 'I'm in Australia but I feel censored by Chinese students' Australia asks China to allow Uighur pair's travel Mr Yang, a scholar and novelist based in New York, was detained when he travelled to China in January with his wife Yuan Ruijuan and her child. Prior to the arrest he had maintained an active presence on Chinese social media. Nicknamed ""the democracy peddler"", he maintained a blog on the country's current affairs and international relations. However, he had not been directly critical of Chinese authorities in recent years. Beijing has held him for alleged ""involvement in criminal activities endangering China's national security"". Australia has called for clarification of the charges. Australia has also repeatedly requested that he receive ""basic standards of justice, procedural fairness and humane treatment"" during his detention. His lawyers say his treatment has got worse as Chinese authorities attempt to extract a confession from him. His case must be brought before a court by March. Canberra's rebuke comes as tensions remain heightened with Beijing. Australia's political classwas rocked last week by allegations of Chinese espionageand interference in domestic issues.

Tories vow to improve border security after Brexit,"The Conservatives are publishing plans to improve the UK's border security after Brexit. If the party wins the general election, it says it will introduce automated exit and entrance checks. It would also make it harder for people with serious criminal convictions to enter the UK from EU countries. Labour says the UK would no longer have access to EU databases or the European Arrest Warrant, undermining the fight against terror and organised crime. The Liberal Democrats say the Conservative plans would lead to ""bureaucracy, more red tape and - because the EU will implement a mirrored system for the British public - fees for anyone travelling to the EU for their holiday"". Why don't we know how many people come to the UK? How could a UK points-based immigration system work? Announcing the proposals, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""When people voted to leave in 2016, they were voting to take back control of our borders. ""After Brexit we will introduce anAustralian-style points based immigration systemand take steps to strengthen our border and improve the security of the UK."" The party says introducing automated entry and exit checks and a requirement for biometric passports will enable the government to ""know who and how many people are in the country, and to identify individuals who have breached the terms of their visa and restrict illegal immigration"". Successive UK governments have attempted to introduce a more reliable system for counting people in and out of the country,with limited success. The Conservatives say they would also introduce an American-style visa waiver scheme, called Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA), which travellers would have to obtain before reaching the UK border. It would provide an enhanced ability to screen arrivals against watchlists and block those deemed to be a threat from entering the UK, the party claims. As the technology becomes available, a future Conservative government would hope to record biometric data - which might include things like fingerprints or retina scans - on all ETAs to provide a further security layer, although the party does not go into details. Inlast year's White Paper setting out its post-Brexit immigration plans, the government said: ""It is our intention to require EU citizens to obtain an ETA, but we intend to discuss this further with the EU in the next phase of negotiations."" Ms Patel is also proposing broader powers to deny entry to EU foreign nationals who have serious criminal convictions. Minor criminality will not be a bar to entry in itself, just as is the case with people from non-EU countries at the moment, but would be assessed on a ""case by case"" basis. The Conservatives say they would also end the use of European ID cards as proof of identity for travel at the UK border. The plans also include more checks on goods entering the UK from the EU using ""pre-arrival data"", which the Tories say would cut revenue ""leakage"" caused by smuggling by Â£5bn. The details of how this would work will be hammered out in trade talks with the EU and the rest of the world, the party says. The BBC's Reality Check team said the Â£5bn figure was composed of a number of different sources, including Â£1.5bn of VAT fraud and error in online marketplaces. There is also a tension between gathering data and keeping trade flowing smoothly without burdening business with red tape. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""Tory claims to be strengthening the border through their sell-out Brexit deal are groundless."" ""By quitting the entire system of EU security and justice, we will no longer have real-time access to a host of critical databases or access to the European Arrest Warrant,"" she said. ""This will undermine the ability of our police and border agencies to apprehend terrorists and organised criminals, and could even make us a safe haven for fugitives fleeing the justice systems in the EU.""
