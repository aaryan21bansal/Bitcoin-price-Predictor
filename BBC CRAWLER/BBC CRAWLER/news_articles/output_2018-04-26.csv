What to expect from summit,"A thaw in South and North Korean relations first began in the lead-up to the Winter Olympics South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will meet on Friday in an act of diplomacy not seen for more than a decade. This rare dialogue comes after months of improving relations between the two countries and will pave the way to proposed talks between the United States and North Korea. Denuclearisation and peace on the peninsula will top the agenda. While analysts are sceptical Pyongyang will agree to give up its nuclear weapons, the summit carries promise for both Koreas. Each side has other problems - like sanctions and separated families - they're likely to bring to the negotiating table. It's a big deal. As well as being the first time Korean leaders have met since 2007, it marks the first summit of its kind for Mr Kim. Unlikehis meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping- cloaked in secrecy and confirmed after the event - part of the Korean talks will be televised live. ""It's his coming-out party,"" said James Kim, director of the Asan Institute of Policy Studies. ""Kim Jong-un has never had this kind of meeting before."" He is following in the footsteps of his father. Kim Jong-il met the presidents of South Korea at two summits: first Kim Dae-jung in 2000 and then Roh Moo-hyun in 2007. North Korea crisis in 300 words Flagpole rivalry: The 'petty' side of Korean relations Talks with Kim: The political gamble of the 21st Century The meetings were designed to address the nuclear threat and foster economic co-operation between the Koreas, and for his work on engagementKim Dae-Jung was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize,external. Some gains were made - theKaesong industrial complex was establishedand families torn apart by war reunited. But disarmament remained elusive and repeated nuclear provocations - coupled with conservative governments in Seoul taking a harder line on Pyongyang - derailed peace efforts. Attempts to draw North Korea out of isolation and build more reliance on the South have since been criticised. Asan Institute's Dr Kim says some in South Korea would argue much of the aid and financial assistance sent to North Korea - designed to convince it to rein in its nuclear ambitions - was not used as had been intended. ""Some people argue it made it worse if anything. They believe it fed into North Korea becoming a nuclear power."" A decade or so later, against a backdrop of mounting hostilities and threats, Seoul has steered Pyongyang back to the table. President Moon, whose involvement in inter-Korea talks stretches back to his time as a top aide to former President Roh, took office last year pushing for more engagement with the North. Who is Moon Jae-in? South Korea youths: 'We're too busy for reunification' ""There's no question he wants reconciliation to be part of legacy,"" says Ji-Young Lee, assistant professor at the American University School of International Service. Mr Moon's hopes for the summit in Panmunjom are clear.,externalThe leader has said a peace treaty between the two Koreas - which are technically still at war - ""must be pursued"" to conclude the longstanding conflict on the peninsula. Mr Moon played a role in previous attempts to engage with North Korea The Ministry of Unification, which oversees the relationship with North Korea, lists denuclearisation and reduced military tensions as the chief goal, followed by forging closer economic and social ties with North Korea. That may include reopening the Kaesong complex. The site at Kaesong, an unusual example of economic co-operation by the Koreas, was shut down in 2016 after Seoul said the North was taking workers' wages and diverting the funds to support its nuclear ambitions. President Moon says he will reopen the complex, which at its peak employed around 55,000 North Korean workers at South Korean-owned factories, if progress is made toward denuclearisation. Reunions for the 60,000 family members separated by the Korean War will also be up for discussion. Those meetings last took place in 2015, before relations soured once again, in part over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. The release of foreigners held in detention by North Korea is also expected to be on the table. The human drama of Korean family reunions North Korea's missile and nuclear programme explained North Korea's goals aren't as obvious. Many analysts say punishing sanctions are the reason Mr Kim is now ready to talk. Sanctions enforced by the US and the United Nations, designed to cripple the North Korean economy, wereramped up last year after an escalation of military threats. Asan's Dr Kim says North Korea sees engagement with the South as ""the only way to get Washington to come down and talk with them"" about issues like sanctions. North Korean state media insists it is ""self-confidence"" rather than sanctions that drove it to seek talks. Other moves signal a desire for sanctions relief. A week before the historic summit, North Koreasaid it was putting a stop to all nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles ahead of the historic summit. These have been major provocations in the past. The moves were welcomed by Mr Moon and crucially, in the North Korean leader's eyes, by US President Donald Trump. Why has Kim Jong-un halted North Korean tests now? Economic pain pushes Pyongyang to talks North Korea-Trump talks in 400 words Dr Euan Graham, director of international security at the Lowy Institute, says for Mr Kim, all roads lead to the US and talking to Mr Moon ""is the price he has to pay"" to get there. And securing a stage with Mr Trump could give the isolated leader a win at home. American University's Prof Lee says Mr Kim wants to be ""treated like an equal to US leaders"". ""We tend to think dictators can do anything but he's constantly under pressure. He has to worry about his own standing in North Korea."" In March, Mr Kim told a South Korean delegation he was ""committed to denuclearisation"" Optimism that talks are happening - the Unification Ministry says more than three-quarters of South Koreans are ""positive"" about the summit - is tempered by hopes for what they can realistically achieve. Mostly they are seen as a starting point, towards both potentially unifying the Koreas and toward ridding Pyongyang of nuclear weapons. ""These talks could be some kind of helpful launching pad,"" says Prof Lee, who expects plenty of agreements and follow-up exchanges to follow the summit. Eyes will be on the connection between the two leaders. Asan's Dr Kim says success is dependent on President Moon and Mr Kim's ""chemistry"" and whether the pair get along. ""I think this will be a very good meeting for both leaders. But in terms of whether it will lead to denuclearisation, I'm not so sure.""

Rudd casts doubt on customs union policy,"The prime minister has ruled out remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit Home Secretary Amber Rudd has appeared to cast doubt on the government's policy of not being in a customs union with the EU after Brexit. She told journalists she would not be ""drawn"" on the issue and said there were discussions to be had about it in cabinet to agree a ""final position"". Later she tweeted that she ""should have been clearer"" but had not wanted to get into ""ongoing cabinet discussions"". The PM Theresa May has ruled out being in an EU customs union after Brexit. Kuenssberg: Rudd breaks with May's Home Office approach :As it happened: MPs debate customs union plan Reality Check: What is a customs union? Home Office 'to scrap immigration removals targets' The comments came on the day Ms Rudd faced fresh calls to resign over her handling of the Windrush scandal, which has seen relatives of people from Caribbean countries who settled in the UK decades ago being declared illegal immigrants, if they could not prove they had lived continuously in the UK. She was forced to admit in the House of Commons that immigration removal targets had existed, a day after telling a committee of MPs that there weren't any. But the issue of whether or not the UK would be in a customs union after Brexit came up as she addressed a lunch for parliamentary journalists She replied: ""I'm not going to be drawn on that. We still have a few discussions to be had in a really positive, consensual and easy way among some of my cabinet colleagues in order to arrive at a final position."" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Amber Rudd appears to have let slip that discussions around the cabinet table about negotiating a customs union with the EU have not in fact concluded. ""If that is so, then the prime minister should rethink her approach and listen to the growing chorus of voices in Parliament and in the businesses community that believe she has got it wrong on a customs union.""

The prime minister is under pressure from both sides of the EU debate on the issue of the customs union, which allows for goods to be transported tariff-free between EU member states. TheFinancial Times reports,externalthat Mrs May is expected to try to secure agreement on an alternative to the customs union, in a Brexit cabinet committee meeting next week. Ministers were defeated on the issue in the House of Lords last week and the government faces key votes in the Commons next month. On Thursday, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""The government is clear we are leaving the customs union and not joining a customs union."" Brexiteers have criticised a suggested ""customs partnership"" to replace the current arrangements, while pro-EU campaigners say a customs union is the only way to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. MPs debated a non-binding motion on Thursday calling on the government to include in its negotiating objectives with the EU ""the establishment of an effective customs union between the two territories"". With few pro-Brexit MPs attending the debate, the motion was approved without a vote, prompting Labour's Chris Leslie to suggest it ""was now the default consensus view of this House"" and said the government should respond. Crunch votes are expected next month when Remain-supporting MPs will push for a change of course. This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? A customs union is when countries agree to apply the same taxes on imports to goods from outside the union. This means when goods have cleared customs in one country, they can be shipped to others in the union without further tariffs being imposed. If the UK remains part of the customs union, it would be unable to strike trade deals with countries around the world, but supporters say it would help keep an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. During the debate, Labour's Yvette Cooper said the UK exported more than Â£230bn of goods and services to the EU every year and warned that to ""rip up"" existing trade arrangements would be ""deeply damaging"". She argued that existing trade deals should be ""cherished"" as it was becoming harder to negotiate new ones ""as communities across different individual countries become more worried about both the losers and the winners of big changes to trade arrangements"". UK will leave customs union, insists No 10 Reality Check: Why is the customs union so important? Pro-European Conservative Ken Clarke told MPs: ""You will damage the economy of this country... if you suddenly decide to erect new barriers at the border between the UK and our major trading partners."" And former Conservative cabinet minister Nicky Morgan warned: ""If we undermine and ignore the evidence for peace in Northern Ireland, and we undermine the business and financial security of the people in this country, we will not be forgiven for a generation."" Labour MP Kate Hoey, one of the few Brexiteers at the debate, said she felt ""alone"" in the chamber: ""There are a lot of people here today who are using the issue of the customs union to start the process again of wanting to stay in the European Union."" She argued that if the UK stayed in the customs union, it would be a ""transition"" to remaining, and would not allow Britain to ""take back control"" of its trade. Please upgrade your browser Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed a customs union, but only if the UK had a say in future EU trade deals. Mrs May has ruled out joining a customs union but has come up with two options to avoid a hard border in Ireland. One of them is a ""customs partnership"" that would involve the UK collecting the EU's tariffs on goods coming from other countries on the EU's behalf. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. This option has been heavily criticised by some Brexiteers, with influential backbench Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg branding it ""completely cretinous"". The other option being proposed by the government would be to minimise checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and putting in place a trusted trader scheme.

Bill Cosby guilty of sexual assault,"This video can not be played Lawyer on Cosby verdict: 'Finally, women are believed in court' US comedian Bill Cosby has been found guilty of three counts of sexual assault, each of which carries a potential 10 years in prison. The actor, 80, has been on trial for drugging and assaulting ex-basketball player Andrea Constand in 2004. Cosby, the first major black actor on primetime TV, will remain out of jail until he is sentenced, the judge ruled. He lost his temper after the verdict, as prosecutors argued he should be denied bail. The prosecutor argued that he should be held because he is ""somebody who has unlimited wealth"" and could flee on a private plane. ""He doesn't have a plane,"" Cosby then erupted, adding a vulgarity which he directed at the prosecutor. Bill Cosby: The fall of 'America's Dad' Seven questions answered about Cosby case ""I feel like my faith in humanity is restored,"" Cosby accuser Lili Bernard said outside the courthouse. ""We are so happy that finally we can say, women are believed, and not only on #MeToo, but in a court of law,"" lawyer Gloria Allred said. Ms Constand (centre) has yet to speak about the trial's conclusion It was the second time the actor had stood trial for the allegations, after an earlier jury failed to reach a verdict in June 2017. At the start of the retrial in Pennsylvania it was revealed that Cosby had paid Ms Constand almost $3.4m (Â£2.4m) in a civil settlement in 2006. Cosby is best known for starring in the 1980s TV series The Cosby Show. Around 60 women over five decades have publicly accused the Emmy award-winning actor of being a sexual predator. But statute of limitation laws mean that only one charge has been brought to trial. Some of his accusers were present in court, and cried as the guilty verdict was returned. Cosby's lawyer Tom Mesereau insisted ""the fight is not over"", adding that he believes Cosby is innocent and that he plans to file an appeal. Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele, who brought the charges against Cosby, held a press conference after the verdict. Cosby has been stripped of numerous awards and accolades in the previous decade ""Money and power or who you are will not stop us from a criminal investigation and prosecuting a case,"" Mr Steele said, as Ms Constand stood beside him. When the attack took place, Ms Constand was working as director of operations for the women's basketball team at Temple University, Philadelphia. She told the court she had gone to the home of her then friend Cosby, to discuss her resignation. She said he had given her three blue pills to ""help take the edge off,"" which she believed to be a natural remedy. Minutes later, she was suffering double vision and quickly lost consciousness. She awoke to find Cosby groping her breasts and penetrating her, she said, adding that the drugs made her physically unable to fight back. Ms Constand reported the attack, but the district attorney refused to press charges. The case was reopened in 2015. Andrea Constand was once a friend of Cosby's Nada Tawfik, BBC News, Norristown, Pennsylvania This verdict is being celebrated as a major win for the #MeToo movement. It shows that the shift in our society and culture from doubting to believing victims is also affecting the justice system. Bill Cosby's lawyers anticipated this and took direct aim at the movement during the trial, telling the jury ""mob rule is not due process."" But ultimately, the jury sided with Andrea Constand and set aside the 80-year-old comedian's wholesome image as American's favourite dad. At one time, there was no star bigger than Bill Cosby. He was the most watched man on television, a role model for minorities trying to break into Hollywood. And despite years of allegations, he seemed untouchable. That has now all changed, and there is no doubt that this verdict will have far-reaching consequences. Judge Steven O'Neill allowed five of Cosby's other accusers to serve as ""prior bad acts"" witnesses during the trial, as the prosecution sought to establish a pattern of misconduct. Heidi Thomas told the court that the comedian served her spiked winethat made her drowsy for four days in 1984. Former US model Janice Dickinson was among those who testified, alleging that Cosby drugged and raped her at a hotel in 1982, when she was 27 years old. ""I wanted to hit him, wanted to punch him in the face,"" Ms Dickinson, 63, told the courtroom in Norristown, Pennsylvania. ""I felt anger, was humiliated, disgusted, ashamed."" Former model Janice Dickinson has accused Cosby of raping her in 1982 The former reality television star testified Mr Cosby offered her a blue pill that he said would help with discomfort from menstrual cramps. ""He smelled like cigars and espresso and his body odour,"" she said. ""I couldn't move, I felt like I was rendered motionless. ""Here was America's dad on top of me, happily married man with five children and how very, very wrong it was,"" she said. The case against Cosby was one of the first celebrity assault trials conducted in the light of the #MeToo movement, which has raised awareness of alleged sexual misconduct by a number of powerful media figures.

Thousands protest over Spanish rape ruling,"The protesters see the justice system as being distant from society Thousands of people have been protesting across Spain, after a court acquitted five men of rape charges for an attack on a young woman during a bull-running festival. Angry demonstrators packed central Madrid and other cities shouting ""Shame! Shame!"" and ""No means no"". The five were jailed for nine years for sexual assault, but many saw the sentence as too lenient. Both the woman and the defendants say they will appeal against the verdict. The five - who belonged to a WhatsApp group calledLa manada(wolf pack) - filmed the attack, which took place during the San Fermin festival in Pamplona in July 2016. The 18-year-old victim's ordeal caused a national outcry. Under Spanish law, the charge of sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. 'Wolf pack' gang rape trial angers Spain Women and men came out into the streets in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Pamplona itself, and in more than a dozen other cities across Spain. In Madrid, police tried to block demonstrators who marched on the Congress of Deputies, shouting slogans such as ""patriarchal justice"" and ""sister, here is your pack"". The protests began outside the courthouse in Pamplona, where supporters of the victim had gathered to hear the verdict, and women's rights groups organised protests elsewhere. Many of the victim's supporters outside the court donned red gloves in protest Altamira Gonzalo, vice-president of Themis, a Spanish organisation of women jurists, told Efe news agency: ""It should have been a courageous sentence. The courts can't be so distant from society."" Socialist party leader Pedro Sanchez tweeted his outrage (in Spanish),external: ""If what the 'wolfpack' did wasn't group violence against a defenceless woman, then what do we understand by rape?"" The five, in their late 20s and originally from Seville, and the victim, from Madrid, were not present when the judgement was read out after a five-month trial, which was held behind closed doors to protect the woman's identity. The men, who have been in custody since 2016, were also ordered to pay the woman â¬50,000 ($61,000; Â£43,500) in compensation. This video can not be played The ""wolf pack"" verdict was met with anger outside court Prosecutors had asked for sentences of more than 20 years. However, one judge had argued that the men should have been acquitted of all charges except stealing the victim's phone. Videos of the late-night encounter between the men and the young woman showed how the five men had wandered the streets among other drunken revellers before two of them led her into a basement by the hand. According to a police report, the men surrounded the woman in a small alcove, removed her clothes and had unprotected sex. A picture of the accused is seen on screen in the courtroom Some of them filmed the sexual act on their phones - there were seven videos, totalling 96 seconds. One of the men posted messages in a WhatsApp group celebrating what they had done and promising to share the recording. According to the police report, the victim maintained a ""passive or neutral"" attitude throughout the scene, keeping her eyes closed at all times. Her phone was then stolen. She was found in a reportedly distraught state by a couple in the street outside the scene of the attack. She told the trial she was still having psychological treatment to deal with trauma. Some of the men were found to be in a video in which they apparently abused another woman, who seemed to be unconscious. By James Badcock, Madrid The ""wolf pack"" case has been Spain's #MeToo over the past two years, with thousands of supporters of the victim uniting under the sloganYo te creo(I believe you). The shocking nature of the group abuse, the youth of the victim and the obnoxious celebratory messages about their ""conquest"" on their WhatsApp chat combined to make the case fertile fodder for black-and-white public opinion. That the two majority verdict judges have chosen to see shades of grey by not interpreting the criminals' acts as violent or intimidatory will fuel indignant criticism from feminist groups. Several leading left-wing politicians have already questioned the verdict. The apparent certainty of an appeal hearing means the debate over whether the law protects women will continue. JosÃ© Ãngel Prenda, 28: considered the leader of the five, wrote a message in the WhatsApp group about the video showing them having sex with the woman. He had been sentenced to two years in prison in 2011 for theft with force Antonio Manuel Guerrero: a Civil Guard police officer, born in 1989, is thought to have recorded six videos. He also admitted to stealing the victim's phone Ãngel Boza, 26: his criminal records include theft with force and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs Alfonso JesÃºs Cabezuelo, 29: a military officer, is thought to have recorded one video JesÃºs Escudero, 27: a hairdresser 'Wolf pack' gang rape trial angers Spain Spain country profile Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Ruth Davidson announces she is pregnant,"This video can not be played Ruth Davidson: 'I'm delighted to say we're starting a family' Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has announced that she is three months pregnant. Ms Davidson said she and her partner Jen Wilson were ""excited"" to be expecting their first child in October after undergoing IVF. She said she would be taking some time off for maternity leave like ""thousands of working women do every year"". But she said she expects to return to the Scottish Parliament in the spring of next year. The party's deputy leader, Jackson Carlaw, will stand in for Ms Davidson during her maternity leave. Politicians who had children in office Ms Davidson admitted there had been some ""ups and downs"" while attempting to conceive, but said she and Ms Wilson were now ""looking forward to starting our family"" after finding out in March that an IVF procedure had been successful. And she said it will be ""business as usual"" until she goes on maternity leave. Ms Davidson got engaged to Jen Wilson in 2016 - but they delayed their wedding to pay vet's bills after their dog was hit by a car The 39-year-old Edinburgh Central MSP said she had struggled with morning sickness since becoming pregnant -  at one point having to leave the Holyrood chamber just before a session of first minister's questions. She told BBC Scotland: ""I've had a bit of the fatigue, the nausea and the dizzy spells and all the rest of it, and I think trying to do everything I was doing before and keep up the pace so people couldn't tell, just until we knew everything was OK, was a bit of a struggle, so I don't think everyone's noticed. ""There was once I was on my way up to first minister's questions and you can probably see if on one of the tapes that I go in and sit down, I'm there for a good 30 seconds before I get back up and walk right out again, just in case. ""But I was OK and I don't think anyone noticed."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Davidson, who was recently named in aTime Magazine list of the world's most influential people, said having a baby should not impact on her political career. She said: ""I think that you've seen right across the world lots of women in politics who have made different choices. ""I don't think that we should limit a woman's choices by whether she had children or not. Her ability to do her job shouldn't be impacted. ""It does require organisation to do both, you can't have all of the time in all of the world, but you can have a family and combine that with a career, and I don't think we should ever send a message to women that they can't have both."" Ms Davidson also said she hoped her announcement could help to underline that it is normal for same-sex couples to have children. She added: ""I think it's important that people realise that this happens and it's normal. Hopefully this takes some of the taboo or mystery away from it."" The couple had planned to get married, but ended up using the money saved for the wedding to pay for medical treatment after their dog - Wilson - was hit by a car. Ms Davidson said she and Ms Wilson still plan to get married, but said she was hoping to ""lose some baby weight"" first.

Pompeo confirmed as secretary of state,"Mr Pompeo secretly met the North Korea leader in Pyongyang earlier this month The US Senate has confirmed former CIA director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state, ending a tough confirmation battle. Mr Pompeo had been accused by Democrats of being a war hawk and harbouring anti-Muslim and homophobic views. The Senate voted 57-42 to approve him as America's top diplomat, the second of the Trump presidency. His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, was sacked last month by the president via Twitter amid a personality clash. Mike Pompeo - Trump's loyalist new diplomat Republican senators, who control the upper chamber, voted unanimously on Thursday to confirm Mr Pompeo. Six Democrats joined them. Allow Twitter content?

Some of those Democrats - including North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia's Joe Manchin - come from states that President Donald Trump won in 2016. The approval comes in time for Mr Pompeo - a former hardline conservative congressman from Kansas - to lead a US delegation to Nato foreign minister talks in Brussels this weekend. This video can not be played Pompeo: War should always be the last resort In a statement, Mr Trump applauded his new secretary of state as someone who ""will always put the interests of America first"". ""Having a patriot of Mike's immense talent, energy, and intellect leading the Department of State will be an incredible asset for our country at this critical time in history,"" he added. Mr Pompeo has been arranging a summit between Mr Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. The meeting could happen in the coming months. AnalysisbyBarbara Plett,State Department Correspondent, BBCNews,Washington Mike Pompeo is a man of action and all indications are he plans to be out front as Secretary of State. As a Trump loyalist and foreign policy hawk he's the exact opposite of his predecessor Rex Tillerson. But he aims to use the former to gain clout amongst the key Cabinet and White House players determining America's relations with the world. And on the latter he's tried to convince senators that he'll pursue ""relentless diplomacy."" He's been at it already with his secret trip to North Korea, and can be expected to continue to take the lead in preparing for the summit between Trump and Kim Jong-un. But he believes the administration's hardline approach of sanctions backed by the credible threat of force is what forced the North Korean leader to the table and has pledged to maintain the pressure until the talks yield concrete results. He doesn't like the Iran nuclear deal but says he'd prefer to fix it rather than scrap it. Democrats are sceptical, but he'll have a lot of work to do if Trump does abandon the accord, since there's no set formula for what that would mean. Pompeo has also pledged to restore the State department's ""swagger"" in the wake of Tillerson's disastrous management of the building, and is already focused on filling the many vacancies. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders tweeted a photo of Mr Pompeo watching on TV as the Senate held their vote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Kim set to cross border for historic talks,"This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea Kim Jong-un has pledged a ""new history"" in relations with his neighbour as he became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953. In a moment rich with symbolism and pomp, South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim shook hands at the border. Mr Kim said it was the ""starting point"" for peace, after crossing the military line that divides the peninsula. It comes just months after warlike rhetoric from North Korea. Much of what the summit will focus on has been agreed in advance, but many analysts remain sceptical about the North's apparent enthusiasm for engagement. LIVE: Latest updates from the historic summit The leaders were met on Friday by an honour guard in traditional costume on the South Korean side. The pair walked to the Peace House in Panmunjom, a military compound in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two countries. Mr Kim then invited the South Korean president to step briefly across the demarcation line into North Korea, before the pair stepped back into South Korea - all the while holding hands. It was an apparently unscripted moment during a highly choreographed sequence of events. The meeting is aimed at ending the decades-long conflict on the peninsula When the first session ended, the pair separated for lunch and Mr Kim returned to the North in a heavily guarded black limousine. Diplomacy on the menu: How food can shape politics When he returned in the afternoon, the leaders took part in a ceremony consisting of the planting of a pine tree using soil and water from both countries. The pair shovelled soil on the roots of the tree and unveiled a stone marker featuring their names, official titles and a message that read: ""Planting peace and prosperity."" Mr Kim returns to the North in a car surrounded by bodyguards The summit will conclude with the leaders signing an agreement and delivering a joint statement before dinner. The banquet will be held on the South's side and the menu is as symbolic as the other rituals. Mr Kim will be served the Swiss potato dish rÃ¶sti- a nod to his time studying in Switzerland - along with the North's signature dish of cold noodles, and a North Korean liquor. Mr Kim is accompanied by nine officials, including his powerful and influential sister Kim Yo-jong. Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon The confidantes Kim is bringing to the summit The meeting - the first between Korean leaders in more than a decade - is seen as a step toward possible peace on the peninsula and marks the first summit of its kind for Mr Kim. It is the first time Korean leaders have met in more than a decade It carries promise for both Koreas with topics being discussed ranging from nuclear technology and sanctions to separated families, and is seen as an opportunity to foster economic co-operation. ""I feel that [we] have fired a flare at the starting point... the moment of writing a new history vis-Ã -vis peace, prosperity and North-South relations,"" Mr Kim said ahead of talks with Mr Moon at the Peace House in the border village of Panmunjom. ""A new history begins now,"" he also wrote in a guestbook. What to expect from talks North Korea crisis in 300 words The White House has expressed hope that the talks will achieve progress towards peace ahead a proposed meeting between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump in the coming weeks - an unprecedented move. Talks are likely to focus on reaching an agreement on North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, which has advanced significantly since the last summit more than a decade ago. Seoul has warned that a deal to rid Pyongyang of its nuclear weapons will be ""difficult"" to achieve. The leaders appeared at ease in their first face-to-face meeting Mr Kim announced last week that he was suspending nuclear tests. The move was welcomed by the US and South Korea, althoughChinese researchers have indicated that North Korea's nuclear test site may be unusableafter a rock collapse following its last nuclear test. Why has Kim halted nuclear tests now? The son of refugees who became president Profile: Kim Jong-un As well as addressing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the leaders are expected to discuss a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, as well as economic and social issues. Few had predicted a development like this, as North Korea continued its nuclear and missile tests and stepped up its rhetoric through 2016 and 2017. The rapprochement began in January whenMr Kim suggested he was ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea. The following month the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. Did the Winter Olympics repair relations? North and South set up hotline ahead of summit Many South Koreans were overcome with emotion as they watched the historic moment live on television Mr Kim's new appetite for diplomacy led to the key turning point, which was a meeting with senior South Korean officials in March, and after that came the announcement that Mr Kim would also meet Mr Trump.

Seven questions answered,"Mr Cosby has maintained that his sexual encounters were consensual Bill Cosby has been convicted of sexual assault by a Pennsylvania jury. After years of allegations from dozens of women, how did we get to this point? Mr Cosby was convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault against Andrea Constand in a retrial at a courthouse in Pennsylvania. Bill Cosby is an American comedian and actor best known for his role as the father in the television hit The Cosby Show which ran from 1984-92 and was a huge hit in the US and around the globe. At one point he was the highest-paid actor in the US. He was born on a council estate in Philadelphia and started his career as a stand-up comedian in 1962, debuting on NBC's The Tonight Show in 1963. In 1965, he became the first black actor to star in a drama series in the US, in the espionage show I Spy. He earned three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role, at a time of high race tensions in the US. The Cosby Show was described by TV critics as ""transformational piece of American culture"". He portrayed a doctor called Cliff Huxtable raising five children with his wife. By 1989, he was earning $4m (Â£2.5m) a month in syndication rights alone. In 2013 he did a national stand-up tour and received rave reviews. After that, several women began to come forward with allegations of sexual assault, some going back nearly 30 years. Bill Cosby: America's Dad under fire He was on trial for a charge of three counts of felony indecent assault, alleged by a former colleague, Andrea Constand. Cosby has been found guilty on all three counts. It is the only criminal case Cosby has faced thus far related to sexual assault accusations dating back years. Ms Constand, a former employee of Temple University who now lives in Canada, has said that she came to think of Cosby as a ""mentor and a friend"" before she said he made unwanted sexual advances. She went to visit him at his home in 2004 to discuss her career and her future where she said he drugged and sexually assaulted her. A criminal complaint unsealed last year details the encounter. She and Cosby settled a lawsuit in 2006 and she was paid an undisclosed sum. Prosecutors re-opened her case last summer when they realised the statute of limitations had not run out and after other women had come forward. Cosby victim 'paralysed' by drugs In other states, he faces defamation lawsuits for branding his accusers liars. Over the years, nearly 60 women have come forward accusing Mr Cosby of sexual assault. Thirty-five of those womentold their stories to New York Magazine,externalin 2015. They alleged he assaulted them in their own homes and even in public. In another case, an accuser named Judy Huth said Cosby molested her when she was 15 years old, forcing her to perform a sexual act on him at the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles. Criminal charges were not filed against Cosby because of the statute of limitations. His lawyers called Ms Huth's claims discredited or decades old. In another prominent case, a 25-year-old model named Chloe Goins sued Cosby for a sexual assault at the Playboy Mansion she says happened in 2008. She sought criminal charges but prosecutors decline to pursue them. He maintains the sexual encounters were consensual. In Ms Constand's case, he said she never said no, though she never said yes either. A deposition for her case showed that he admitted pursuing sex with younger women and giving them Quaaludes, a sedative. He said he was confident his behaviour was not rape. The New York Times described the deposition as presenting Cosby as ""as an unapologetic, cavalier playboy, someone who used a combination of fame, apparent concern and powerful sedatives in a calculated pursuit of young women"". The first trial failed to reach a verdict in the spring of 2017. In the second trial, the judge allowed more evidence to be admitted, for the defence and the prosecution. So the court heard testimony from four more accusers, evidence not allowed in the first trial, when only Ms Constand's account was heard. That meant the prosecution could establish a pattern of behaviour on the part of the disgraced comedian. There was also new evidence that worked in Cosby's favour. A new defence witness who once worked with Ms Constand had talked about fabricating evidence against a celebrity for financial gain. And a $3.38m payment that Cosby paid to her in a 2006 settlement - which the defence said showed she was a gold-digger - had not been previously disclosed. Since the first trial failed to reach a verdict in early 2017, there has been a slew of cases brought by women alleging sexual assault by high-profile men. The men and women of the jury were asked during selection how much they knew about #MeToo and directed to make their decision based only on the evidence of this case. But it would have been hard to ignore the new climate in which women have felt empowered to make accusations and a prevailing view that complaints no longer be ignored. One of Cosby's accusers, Lili Bernard, said after the verdict: ""The MeToo movement has shown that women are worthy of being believed."" Since the allegations against Cosby first arose several years ago, Cosby's work - including TV shows, films, and stand-up performances - has been pulled from many US networks, including TV Land, Centric, and Bounce TV. Netflix and NBC both ended planned projects with Cosby after the assault charges as well. In 2015, he was dropped by his talent agency, CAA. Streaming television giant Hulu also eventually dropped The Cosby Show, though at the time they claimed it was unrelated to the rape allegations. As writer and producer Larry Wilmore told the LA Times last year: ""His legacy is forever going to be tarnished."" In addition to Cosby's erasure on television, he also lost several honorary titles and degrees following the accusations. In 2014, the Navy revoked his honorary title of Chief Petty Officer. Several US universities revoked Cosby's honorary degrees in the years leading up to the trial, including Brown University, the University of Connecticut, Tufts University, Oberlin College, Marquette University, and Fordham University. Shortly after Thursday's guilty verdict, Wesleyan University announced they would do the same.

'Wolf pack' jailed for sex attack in Spain,"This video can not be played The ""wolf pack"" verdict was met with anger outside court A Spanish court has jailed five men for sexually abusing a young woman during the famous San Fermin bull-running festival but acquitted them of rape. All five were sentenced to nine years in prison for their part in the attack, which they filmed, during the festival in Pamplona in July 2016. The 18-year-old victim's ordeal caused a national outcry, and protests continued outside the court. Both the woman and the defendants say they will appeal against the verdict. ""It's rape, not abuse,"" demonstrators said outside the court. Rallies have been called in Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Alicante and more than a dozen other cities across Spain against the verdict and in support of the victim. The five, in their late 20s and originally from Seville, and the victim, from Madrid, were not present when the judgement was read out after a five-month trial, which was held behind closed doors to protect the woman's identity. 'Wolf pack' gang rape trial angers Spain Under Spanish law, the charge of sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. But senior politicians and human rights groups questioned whether a prolonged sexual assault involving intercourse by five men could be anything but intimidation or rape. The men, who have been in custody since 2016, have also been ordered to pay the woman â¬50,000 ($61,000; Â£43,500) in compensation. Prosecutors had asked for sentences of more than 20 years. However, one judge had argued that the men should have been acquitted of all charges except stealing the victim's phone. Videos of the late-night encounter between the men and the young woman showed how the five men had wandered the streets among other drunken revellers before two of them led her into a basement by the hand. According to a police report, the men - who belonged to a WhatsApp group calledLa manada(wolf pack) - surrounded the woman in a small alcove, removed her clothes and had unprotected sex. A picture of the accused is seen on screen in the courtroom Some of them filmed the sexual act on their phones - there were seven videos, totalling 96 seconds. One of the men posted messages in a WhatsApp group celebrating what they had done and promising to share the recording. According to the police report, the victim maintained a ""passive or neutral"" attitude throughout the scene, keeping her eyes closed at all times. Her phone was then stolen. She was found in a reportedly distraught state by a couple in the street outside the scene of the attack. She told the trial she was still having psychological treatment to deal with trauma. Some of the men were found to be in a video in which they apparently abused another woman, who seemed to be unconscious. By James Badcock, Madrid The ""wolf pack"" case has been Spain's #MeToo over the past two years, with thousands of supporters of the victim uniting under the sloganYo te creo(I believe you). The shocking nature of the group abuse, the youth of the victim and the obnoxious celebratory messages about their ""conquest"" on their WhatsApp chat combined to make the case fertile fodder for black-and-white public opinion. That the two majority verdict judges have chosen to see shades of grey by not interpreting the criminals' acts as violent or intimidatory will fuel indignant criticism from feminist groups. Several leading left-wing politicians have already questioned the verdict. The apparent certainty of an appeal hearing means the debate over whether the law protects women will continue. JosÃ© Ãngel Prenda, 28: considered the leader of the five, wrote a message in the WhatsApp group about the video showing them having sex with the woman. He had been sentenced to two years in prison in 2011 for theft with force Antonio Manuel Guerrero: a Civil Guard police officer, born in 1989, is thought to have recorded six videos. He also admitted to stealing the victim's phone Ãngel Boza, 26: his criminal records include theft with force and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs Alfonso JesÃºs Cabezuelo, 29: a military officer, is thought to have recorded one video JesÃºs Escudero, 27: a hairdresser Supporters of the victim gathered outside the courthouse for the verdict, and were furious when it was read out. Some donned red gloves in protest. Women's rights groups and many politicians reacted angrily, with Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya SÃ¡enz de SantamarÃ­a calling on officials to analyse the verdict so that similar cases could be avoided. UN Women programme director MarÃ­a Noel Vaeza said this was a ""lost opportunity"", El PaÃ­s newspaper reports (in Spanish),,externalurging an end to the ""social impunity [in cases of] rape"". Dozens of people gathered outside the court ahead of the verdict, some wearing red gloves in protest Altamira Gonzalo, vice-president of Themis, a Spanish organisation of women jurists, told Efe news agency: ""It should have been a courageous sentence. The courts can't be so distant from society"". Socialist party leader Pedro Sanchez tweeted his outrage (in Spanish),external: ""If what the 'wolfpack' did wasn't group violence against a defenceless woman, then what do we understand by rape?"" The victim's lawyer said he was ""disappointed"" while lawyers for the five men said they would appeal, calling the verdict ""unfair"".

Wembley deal 'could take eight weeks',"This video can not be played Fulham owner Khan confident of Wembley purchase Fulham's billionaire owner Shahid Khan says he hopes a deal to buy Wembley Stadium from the Football Association will be completed in eight to 12 weeks. Khan, who also owns NFL side Jacksonville Jaguars,has made an offerthought to be worth Â£900m. It is understood he would pay Â£600m for the stadium and the FA will continue to run the Â£300m-valued Club Wembley hospitality business. ""This offer makes a lot of sense for us,"" he told BBC Sport. ""When I say us, I'm talking about the Jaguars, NFL, Wembley, and I think it also makes a lot of sense for the FA and the English football team. ""I'm pretty confident - that's why we're putting our name, our reputation on the line to get it done."" Would England still play at Wembley - and what could the FA do with the money? Khan, who has owned Championship side Fulham since 2013, said England games would remain at Wembley and he would retain the stadium's name. BBC Sport understands selling Wembley would allow the FA to make a major investment into football at grassroots level. Pakistan-born Khan has a current net worth of $7.2bn (Â£5.2bn) and is the 217th richest person in the world, according to the 2018 Forbes rich list. He said he understands fans' concerns over his offer for the 90,000-seat stadium, which is the largest in the United Kingdom. ""I think they have to understand the value and the attraction for myself,"" Khan added. ""We'll leave the tradition and the stadium itself. Even though this is a new stadium, it does need upgrades. ""It means a lot to me because the first English stadium I went to was Wembley, and obviously it's iconic and historic and it means a lot to me. ""Under this arrangement the FA retains the right, the revenue, and that is really the most positive part of Wembley for the FA. So they will be retaining it and obviously we want it to be there."" The 67-year-old added that the deal would lead to ""more meaningful discussions"" over a permanent NFL franchise in London. Wembley has been hosting NFL games each autumn since 2007. Additionally, Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur have a deal with the NFL to stage a minimum of two games a season over 10 years once they have moved into theirnew stadiumlater this year. ""Until now, NFL doesn't have a stadium solution or have a home,"" Khan said. ""And it can't work with a Premier League club, because of the schedule. It does work very well with Wembley, so I think it makes it closer."" According to the FA's latest financial results, it still owes Â£113m to public bodies such as Sport England, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, plus the London Development Agency, which helped pay to build the stadium, which cost Â£757m and opened in 2007. In January,the FA said,externalit would finish paying for the ground by the end of 2024. In a statement, Sport England said it had invested Â£120m of National Lottery money into the development of Wembley and it looked forward to ""hearing more detail about how such a deal would work and whether it would benefit grassroots sport"". Born in Lahore, Khan moved to America in 1968 to study engineering and subsidised his degree by washing dishes for $1.20 an hour. He became involved in car manufacturing - specifically car bumpers - and set up his own company in 1978 to make a bumper that was lighter and made cars more fuel-efficient. It was estimated in 2012 that two-thirds of all the cars in the US had parts made by Khan's company. Khan's bid to buy NFL team St Louis Rams in 2010 was blocked by Stan Kroenke - the majority owner of Arsenal - who promptly bought the club outright. He became the first ethnic minority owner of an NFL team when he bought Jacksonville Jaguars in 2012 for $760m, before buying Fulham from Mohamed Al-Fayed a year later. Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman:""This process is at an early stage and it's ultimately a decision for the FA. But Wembley is the historic home of English football and holds a very special place in the hearts of fans up and down the country and I'm sure the FA will want to strongly consider the views of these supporters before deciding what to do next."" Labour Shadow Sports Minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan:""The FA should not rush into any deal to sell and any deal must guarantee that England continue to play at Wembley as well as around the country; that major tournaments, cup finals and play-offs for multiple sports are still held at Wembley; and that ticket prices for England games are frozen for 10 years. The FA needs to guarantee that profits of the sale will be put into grassroots football to ensure that future generations will benefit."" This video can not be played Hodgson would be 'disappointed' if England stopped playing at Wembley Crystal Palace boss and former England manager and Roy Hodgson:""I am a massive supporter of Wembley as the national stadium and England playing there but I also have great faith in the FA that they won't be making decisions lightly. If they think that is a good deal, a deal that will bring in money that they can spend in a better way, then I would be behind that."" Former England captain and BBC Sport presenter Gary Lineker on Twitter:""I don't really see much of a downside to the FA selling Wembley. The old Wembley was never owned by the FA and we won the World Cup there. Bags of money going into grassroots is way more important than owning a load of concrete. Two steps back, 39 steps forward."" Swansea manager Carlos Carvalhal, who guided Sheffield Wednesday to the 2016 Championship play-off final:""I think they are monuments and we can't sell them in my opinion. If you sell Wembley you can sell Big Ben and Buckingham Palace? We can't sell monuments, it is culture, and you can't sell culture."" Chairman of Matchroom Sports and former Leyton Orient owner Barry Hearn:""Unless there's a very good reason why it shouldn't be sold, frankly the laws of commerce take over. It's he who has most will win. I would be saddened but I would be realistic enough to say it's life in the current system."" Everton manager and former England boss Sam Allardyce:""The FA went through a hugely difficult period to build that stadium, so to lose it and not play there would be a no from me. There'd have to be a certain contract that makes sure Wembley is still Wembley and cup finals are still played there, and [some] international games there.""

Sinclair computer designer dies,"Rick Dickinson, the designer of Sinclair computers, has died in the US while receiving treatment for cancer. The British designer, thought to be in his 60s, worked in-house for Sinclair Research and oversaw the creation of its home computers in the 1980s. He was responsible for the boxy look of the ZX80 and ZX81 and the Bauhaus-inspired appearance of the Spectrum. Mr Dickinson also helped to develop the technologies for the UK company's touch-sensitive and rubber keyboards. He was recently linked to a crowd-funded project by Retro Computers to turn the Spectrum into a handheld computer. Some of the early reference designs for the machine were drawn up by him. In an interview with the BBCin 2012, Mr Dickinson said the development of the keyboards had been driven by a desire to cut costs. The touch-sensitive mats used in the Sinclair machines were much cheaper and simpler than traditional keyboards made of hundreds of components. In the interview, he said he had had doubts that the first machines would be successful but the company had been ""overwhelmed"" by interest and demand once they had launched. The boxy look of the ZX81 helped to cut the cost of producing the machine He said the machines had ""spawned a generation"" of coders that had helped to establish the UK's reputation as a creative, game-making powerhouse. He added: ""Sinclair products were born out of staggering innovation and clever shortcuts to get things into ever smaller packages at lower costs."" The drawing board on which Mr Dickinson designed the Spectrum is now in the Science Museum. A graduate in industrial design from Newcastle Polytechnic, he joined Sinclair in 1979. After leaving the company, Mr Dickinson set up an industrial design consultancy Dickinson Associates. Through the Cambridgeshire-based firm, he was involved with the design of the first Amstrad portable computers, early mobile phones and game consoles. The first news of Mr Dickinson's death came via an email sent by his wife, Elizabeth, to family and friends, asking that it be sent on to all those might want to know of his passing. A spokesman at Dickinson Associates confirmed he had died earlier this week. The email said Mr Dickinson had been diagnosed with cancer in 2015, for which he had received successful treatment. However, it said, the cancer had returned last year. Mr Dickinson had then travelled to the US for specialist care but had died suddenly between bouts of treatment.

Amazon sales surge doubles profitsThe online retailer beat expectations with a 43% rise in revenues during the first quarter.1ma few seconds agoBusiness,"Amazon has reported a 43% surge in revenues for the first quarter, fuelled by online shopping in the US. The internet retail giant said sales rose to $51bn (Â£36.6bn) in the three months to March, surpassing analysts' forecasts. Amazon also said that its profit more than doubled, sending its share price to a new high in after-hours trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It added that it expects profit and revenue to grow in the second quarter. Over the three months to March, Amazon's net profit rose to $1.6bn from $724m in the same period last year. Amazon was founded and is led by Jeff Bezos who, according to Forbes magazine, is now the richest man in the world and owns The Washington Post newspaper. The company has recently been targeted byUS President Donald Trump, who claims Amazon does not pay enough tax. He has also claimed it is ripping off the US Postal Service which, he alleges, loses an average $1.50 for each package it delivers for Amazon. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world, according to Forbes Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told Reuters that success is ""the best revenge that Bezos can get against the administration for its veiled threats about sales taxes and not paying its fair share"". Amazon reported that sales from its North American business rose to $30.7bn compared to $20.9bn in the first quarter last year. Its profit also leapt to $1.1bn from $596m previously. Its also said that Amazon Web Services, which hosts a cloud computing platform that is used by a number of major companies, also performed well in the quarter.

"Retail woes hit Poundworld and CarpetrightThe discount retailer explores restructuring, as Carpetright's creditors approve a store closure plan.","Discount retailer Poundworld is looking at closing about 100 of its 355 stores, putting up to 1,500 jobs at risk. Poundworld is considering the move under an insolvency process called a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). Like many retailers Poundworld has been hit by falling consumer confidence, rising overheads and the weaker pound. Meanwhile, Carpetright's creditors and landlords have approved the company's CVA plan for about 80 closures, putting hundreds of job at risk. CVA's have become a popular among retailers because they allow firms to offload underperforming stores and reduce rents while avoiding administration. A number of retailers have chosen to go through a CVA, including New Look and Carpetright while last weekHouse of Fraser said it was considering this measure as part of a number of options. Earlier this year, both Toys R Us UK and electronics chain Maplin went into administration. Poundworld is owned by private equity firm TPG Capital, which also controls the restaurant chain Prezzo whose landlords agreed to a CVA last month. Prezzo is also closing 94 branches. Poundworld is expected to announce the terms of the CVA next month. As well as closing stores it would try to get agreement from landlords to reduce rents. The chain imports a lot of its stock and is having to pay more for it because of the fall in the value of the pound. Job loss fears over Fenwick restructuring Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Five things to do with empty retail space Poundworld employs about 5,500 staff and has its headquarters in West Yorkshire. The company was formed in 2004, but it says it can trace its origins ""back to 1974 and a market stall in Wakefield, West Yorkshire"". Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said news of Poundworld's troubles ""signals just how much distress bricks and mortar retailers are under"". ""The toxic mix of rising costs, softer consumer demand and the acceleration of seismic structural shifts are pushing many business models to breaking point. ""Stuck with too many stores, inflexible leases and spiraling operating costs, the business is in desperate need of restructuring."" The developments at Poundworld's emerged as Carpetright's creditors voted on the retailer's restructuring plan. Carpetright has earmarked 81 stores for closure under its CVA, which allow the firm to shut loss-making outlets and secure rent reductions. At the meeting, Carpetright won the backing of more than 75% of creditors to push ahead with the plan, which puts about 300 jobs at risk. Meanwhile, upmarket department store chainFenwicks, which has nine branches in England and employs about 2,000 staff, is looking at ways to restructure. A company spokeswoman said the process would involve shaking up the marketing, human resources, finance and IT functions within the stores.

Kim set to cross border for Korea talks,"This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea Kim Jong-un has pledged a ""new history"" in relations with his neighbour as he became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953. In a moment rich with symbolism and pomp, South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim shook hands at the border. Mr Kim said it was the ""starting point"" for peace, after crossing the military line that divides the peninsula. It comes just months after warlike rhetoric from North Korea. Much of what the summit will focus on has been agreed in advance, but many analysts remain sceptical about the North's apparent enthusiasm for engagement. LIVE: Latest updates from the historic summit The leaders were met on Friday by an honour guard in traditional costume on the South Korean side. The pair walked to the Peace House in Panmunjom, a military compound in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two countries. Mr Kim then invited the South Korean president to step briefly across the demarcation line into North Korea, before the pair stepped back into South Korea - all the while holding hands. It was an apparently unscripted moment during a highly choreographed sequence of events. The meeting is aimed at ending the decades-long conflict on the peninsula When the first session ended, the pair separated for lunch and Mr Kim returned to the North in a heavily guarded black limousine. Diplomacy on the menu: How food can shape politics When he returned in the afternoon, the leaders took part in a ceremony consisting of the planting of a pine tree using soil and water from both countries. The pair shovelled soil on the roots of the tree and unveiled a stone marker featuring their names, official titles and a message that read: ""Planting peace and prosperity."" Mr Kim returns to the North in a car surrounded by bodyguards The summit will conclude with the leaders signing an agreement and delivering a joint statement before dinner. The banquet will be held on the South's side and the menu is as symbolic as the other rituals. Mr Kim will be served the Swiss potato dish rÃ¶sti- a nod to his time studying in Switzerland - along with the North's signature dish of cold noodles, and a North Korean liquor. Mr Kim is accompanied by nine officials, including his powerful and influential sister Kim Yo-jong. Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon The confidantes Kim is bringing to the summit The meeting - the first between Korean leaders in more than a decade - is seen as a step toward possible peace on the peninsula and marks the first summit of its kind for Mr Kim. It is the first time Korean leaders have met in more than a decade It carries promise for both Koreas with topics being discussed ranging from nuclear technology and sanctions to separated families, and is seen as an opportunity to foster economic co-operation. ""I feel that [we] have fired a flare at the starting point... the moment of writing a new history vis-Ã -vis peace, prosperity and North-South relations,"" Mr Kim said ahead of talks with Mr Moon at the Peace House in the border village of Panmunjom. ""A new history begins now,"" he also wrote in a guestbook. What to expect from talks North Korea crisis in 300 words The White House has expressed hope that the talks will achieve progress towards peace ahead a proposed meeting between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump in the coming weeks - an unprecedented move. Talks are likely to focus on reaching an agreement on North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, which has advanced significantly since the last summit more than a decade ago. Seoul has warned that a deal to rid Pyongyang of its nuclear weapons will be ""difficult"" to achieve. The leaders appeared at ease in their first face-to-face meeting Mr Kim announced last week that he was suspending nuclear tests. The move was welcomed by the US and South Korea, althoughChinese researchers have indicated that North Korea's nuclear test site may be unusableafter a rock collapse following its last nuclear test. Why has Kim halted nuclear tests now? The son of refugees who became president Profile: Kim Jong-un As well as addressing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the leaders are expected to discuss a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, as well as economic and social issues. Few had predicted a development like this, as North Korea continued its nuclear and missile tests and stepped up its rhetoric through 2016 and 2017. The rapprochement began in January whenMr Kim suggested he was ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea. The following month the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. Did the Winter Olympics repair relations? North and South set up hotline ahead of summit Many South Koreans were overcome with emotion as they watched the historic moment live on television Mr Kim's new appetite for diplomacy led to the key turning point, which was a meeting with senior South Korean officials in March, and after that came the announcement that Mr Kim would also meet Mr Trump.

Kim to cross border for Korea talks,"Mr Kim, right, is set to take a historic step when he attends his first summit Kim Jong-un is set to become the first North Korean leader to cross into South Korean territory since the end of the Korean War in 1953, as final details are put in place for the summit. South Korea said President Moon Jae-in would personally meet Mr Kim at the border at 09:30 (00:30 GMT) on Friday. The historic summit will focus on the North's recent indications it could be willing to give up its nuclear weapons. Talks are also proposed between Mr Kim and US President Trump by early June. Mr Kim is set to cross the military demarcation line - a clearly defined marker of the official land border between the territories. He will, however, remain within the Demilitarised Zone. Seoul has warned reaching an agreement aimed at ridding Pyongyang of its nuclear weapons will be ""difficult"", because North Korea's nuclear and missile technology has advanced so much since the sides' leaders last met more than a decade ago. ""The difficult part is at what level the two leaders will be able to reach an agreement regarding willingness to denuclearise,"" South Korean presidential spokesperson Im Jong-seok said. What to expect from Kim-Moon talks North Korea crisis in 300 words Talks with Kim: The political gamble of the 21st Century The meeting - the third of its kind following summits in 2000 and 2007 - is the result of months of improving relations between the two Koreas, and paves the way for a planned meeting between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump. President Trump cast some doubt on that meeting on Thursday, saying in an interview with Fox News, ""maybe the meeting doesn't even take place"". He also said he was considering three or four dates as well as five possible locations, if it does go ahead. This video can not be played How to talk to North Korea - advice from three North Korean experts Mr Kim announced last week that he would suspend nuclear tests for the time being. The move was welcomed by the US and South Korea as a positive step, althoughChinese researchers have indicated that North Korea's nuclear test site may be unusableafter a rock collapse following its last test in September. As well as addressing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the leaders are expected to discuss a path to peace on the peninsula to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, and a series of economic and social issues. South Korea and the US say they are suspending annual military drills for a day while the summit takes place. Every detail of the summit has been precisely planned - from the timetable to the dinner menu. Mr Moon will meet Mr Kim and his delegation of nine officials at the concrete blocks which mark the demarcation line on the border, Mr Im told reporters on Thursday. South Korean honour guards will then escort the leaders to a welcome ceremony at a plaza in Panmunjom,a military compound in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two countries. The heavily guarded Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) divides the two Koreas - the concrete border line stretches between the buildings Official talks between Mr Moon and Mr Kim will begin at 10:30 local time (01:30 GMT) at the Peace House in Panmunjom. The pair will break after the first session and will have lunch separately - with the delegation from the North crossing back to their side of the border. At an afternoon ceremony, Mr Moon and Mr Kim will plant a pine tree using soil and water from both countries, to symbolise ""peace and prosperity"". South Korean youths: ""We're too busy for reunification"" A ""petty"" history of Korean relations Following the tree planting, they will walk together before starting the next round of talks. The summit will conclude with the leaders signing an agreement and delivering a joint statement before dinner. The banquet will be held on the South side - and a carefully planned menu has already been announced. Kim Jong-un will be served the Swiss potato dish rÃ¶sti- a nod to his time studying in Switzerland - along with the North's signature dish of cold noodles, and a North Korean liquor. One detail, however, may have been overlooked - or may have been a deliberate move. Japan objected to the choice of dessertbecause of the inclusion on the mango mousse being served of disputed islands on a map of the Korean peninsula. Japan, North Korea and South Korea all claim the islands. After dinner, the delegations will watch a video called ""Spring of One"", before Mr Kim returns home. An object of diplomatic dispute - the mango mousse Mr Kim will be accompanied by nine officials, including his sister,Kim Yo-jong, who led the North's delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea earlier this year. Kim Yong-nam, North Korea's nominal head of state, will also attend. Kim Yo-jong's visit to Pyeongchang mesmerised the crowds In a rare move - one not seen at previous inter-Korean summits - the delegation will also feature top military officials and diplomats. South Korean presidential spokesperson Mr Im said he was encouraged by this shift. The people Kim is bringing to the summit The son of refugees who became president Profile: Kim Jong-un ""I feel North Korea is sending their key military officials to the summit as they too, believe denuclearisation and peace are important,"" he said. ""North Korea appears to take into account not only the inter-Korean summit but also the subsequent North-US summit and efforts for international co-operation."" South Korea will send seven officials along with President Moon, including the ministers for defence, foreign affairs and unification. The chairman of South Korea's joint chiefs of staff was a late addition to his entourage. The summit is the high point after months of improving relations between the two countries, which few would have predicted following years of rising tension. The rapprochement began in January whenMr Kim suggested he was ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea.The following month the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations?? North Korea and South Korea set up hotline ahead of summit Mr Kim's new appetite for diplomacy led to a meeting with senior South Korean officials in March - the first time officials from Seoul had met the young leader since he came to power in 2011 - to map out details for a meeting with Mr Moon. Ahead of the summit, North Korean media praised Mr Kim for his work in the talks. ""It is a historic event for national history made possible by our brisk efforts for dialogue and peace,"" The Rodong Sinmun, official newspaper of the ruling Workers' Party, said in an editorial. ""Improving North-South relations is a necessary requirement for the achievement of homeland unification,"" it said.

Kim to cross border for Korea talksFinal details are announced for Friday's historic meeting between the two Korean leaders.6h6 hours agoAsia,"Mr Kim, right, is set to take a historic step when he attends his first summit Kim Jong-un is set to become the first North Korean leader to cross into South Korean territory since the end of the Korean War in 1953, as final details are put in place for the summit. South Korea said President Moon Jae-in would personally meet Mr Kim at the border at 09:30 (00:30 GMT) on Friday. The historic summit will focus on the North's recent indications it could be willing to give up its nuclear weapons. Talks are also proposed between Mr Kim and US President Trump by early June. Mr Kim is set to cross the military demarcation line - a clearly defined marker of the official land border between the territories. He will, however, remain within the Demilitarised Zone. Seoul has warned reaching an agreement aimed at ridding Pyongyang of its nuclear weapons will be ""difficult"", because North Korea's nuclear and missile technology has advanced so much since the sides' leaders last met more than a decade ago. ""The difficult part is at what level the two leaders will be able to reach an agreement regarding willingness to denuclearise,"" South Korean presidential spokesperson Im Jong-seok said. What to expect from Kim-Moon talks North Korea crisis in 300 words Talks with Kim: The political gamble of the 21st Century The meeting - the third of its kind following summits in 2000 and 2007 - is the result of months of improving relations between the two Koreas, and paves the way for a planned meeting between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump. President Trump cast some doubt on that meeting on Thursday, saying in an interview with Fox News, ""maybe the meeting doesn't even take place"". He also said he was considering three or four dates as well as five possible locations, if it does go ahead. This video can not be played How to talk to North Korea - advice from three North Korean experts Mr Kim announced last week that he would suspend nuclear tests for the time being. The move was welcomed by the US and South Korea as a positive step, althoughChinese researchers have indicated that North Korea's nuclear test site may be unusableafter a rock collapse following its last test in September. As well as addressing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the leaders are expected to discuss a path to peace on the peninsula to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, and a series of economic and social issues. South Korea and the US say they are suspending annual military drills for a day while the summit takes place. Every detail of the summit has been precisely planned - from the timetable to the dinner menu. Mr Moon will meet Mr Kim and his delegation of nine officials at the concrete blocks which mark the demarcation line on the border, Mr Im told reporters on Thursday. South Korean honour guards will then escort the leaders to a welcome ceremony at a plaza in Panmunjom,a military compound in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two countries. The heavily guarded Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) divides the two Koreas - the concrete border line stretches between the buildings Official talks between Mr Moon and Mr Kim will begin at 10:30 local time (01:30 GMT) at the Peace House in Panmunjom. The pair will break after the first session and will have lunch separately - with the delegation from the North crossing back to their side of the border. At an afternoon ceremony, Mr Moon and Mr Kim will plant a pine tree using soil and water from both countries, to symbolise ""peace and prosperity"". South Korean youths: ""We're too busy for reunification"" A ""petty"" history of Korean relations Following the tree planting, they will walk together before starting the next round of talks. The summit will conclude with the leaders signing an agreement and delivering a joint statement before dinner. The banquet will be held on the South side - and a carefully planned menu has already been announced. Kim Jong-un will be served the Swiss potato dish rÃ¶sti- a nod to his time studying in Switzerland - along with the North's signature dish of cold noodles, and a North Korean liquor. One detail, however, may have been overlooked - or may have been a deliberate move. Japan objected to the choice of dessertbecause of the inclusion on the mango mousse being served of disputed islands on a map of the Korean peninsula. Japan, North Korea and South Korea all claim the islands. After dinner, the delegations will watch a video called ""Spring of One"", before Mr Kim returns home. An object of diplomatic dispute - the mango mousse Mr Kim will be accompanied by nine officials, including his sister,Kim Yo-jong, who led the North's delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea earlier this year. Kim Yong-nam, North Korea's nominal head of state, will also attend. Kim Yo-jong's visit to Pyeongchang mesmerised the crowds In a rare move - one not seen at previous inter-Korean summits - the delegation will also feature top military officials and diplomats. South Korean presidential spokesperson Mr Im said he was encouraged by this shift. The people Kim is bringing to the summit The son of refugees who became president Profile: Kim Jong-un ""I feel North Korea is sending their key military officials to the summit as they too, believe denuclearisation and peace are important,"" he said. ""North Korea appears to take into account not only the inter-Korean summit but also the subsequent North-US summit and efforts for international co-operation."" South Korea will send seven officials along with President Moon, including the ministers for defence, foreign affairs and unification. The chairman of South Korea's joint chiefs of staff was a late addition to his entourage. The summit is the high point after months of improving relations between the two countries, which few would have predicted following years of rising tension. The rapprochement began in January whenMr Kim suggested he was ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea.The following month the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations?? North Korea and South Korea set up hotline ahead of summit Mr Kim's new appetite for diplomacy led to a meeting with senior South Korean officials in March - the first time officials from Seoul had met the young leader since he came to power in 2011 - to map out details for a meeting with Mr Moon. Ahead of the summit, North Korean media praised Mr Kim for his work in the talks. ""It is a historic event for national history made possible by our brisk efforts for dialogue and peace,"" The Rodong Sinmun, official newspaper of the ruling Workers' Party, said in an editorial. ""Improving North-South relations is a necessary requirement for the achievement of homeland unification,"" it said.

Immigration removal targets 'to be axed'The move comes after Home Secretary Amber Rudd told MPs she had not known they existed.,"This video can not be played Amber Rudd rejects calls to quit over Windrush scandal The Home Office is to axe immigration removal targets - a day after Home Secretary Amber Rudd said they did not exist, the BBC understands. Ms Rudd told MPs investigating the Windrush scandal on Wednesday targets were not set for immigration officials. But after fresh evidence emerged overnight she was forced on Thursday to admit to MPs that ""local"" targets for ""internal"" use had been set. The Home Office is now scrapping them, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg understands. The instruction to axe the targets is likely to be sent out from Immigration and Enforcement, a division of the Home Office, in the coming days. However, the government's overall target of reducing net migration to under 100,000 a year will stay in place, the BBC's political editor said. The home secretary faced fresh calls to quit following her admission that the targets did exist and, according to union officials, are prominently displayed on posters at regional immigration centres. Who are the Windrush generation? Home Office 'knew about Windrush issues' What is the 'hostile environment' policy? In a separate development on Thursday,she appeared to cast doubt on the government's policy of not being in a customs union with the EU after Brexit- although she later said she ""should have been clearer"" that ""we will be leaving the customs union"". Ms Rudd said she had not been aware of the immigration removal targets but Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said she was ""trying to blame officials"" and the ""direction will have come from the centre"". Ms Abbott said she did not see how Ms Rudd could survive in her job ""unless she is only there as a human shield for Theresa May"". Asked how the targets had impacted on Windrush migrants, Ms Abbott said: ""Immigration officials may have been looking for soft targets in the shape of West Indian pensioners who don't have hot shot lawyers."" Her Labour frontbench colleague, Dawn Butler, told the BBC's Daily Politics Mrs May was ""presiding over a government that has policies that are institutionally racist"". By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor What is remarkable is how the Home Office suddenly ditched the targets. They were introduced under Labour and tightened up under the Tories to try to cut the numbers of people living in the UK without the legal right to do so. Ministers believed then, and still now, that the public demand for tighter rules must be heeded. It is remarkable then that, in less than 24 hours, the home secretary seemed to suddenly ditch that whole approach. In the commotion, she has made a significant break with Theresa May's approach. Read more from Laura The SNP's home affairs spokeswoman Alison Thewlis also called for Ms Rudd's resignation, saying she was presiding over a department ""out of control"" and it was ""no surprise"" targets existed as there was ""a litany of callous incompetence"" at the Home Office. Conservative backbenchers, including Sir Nicholas Soames and Philip Davies, rallied behind Ms Rudd, with Mr Davies saying most members of the public backed tougher action against illegal immigration and accused Labour and the SNP of being ""out of touch with working class communities"". This video can not be played Appearing before a select committee, Home Secretary Amber Rudd denies there are targets Answering an urgent question in the Commons earlier on Thursday, Ms Rudd said: ""I have never agreed that there should be specific removal targets and I would never support a policy that puts targets ahead of people. ""The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. ""These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change. ""I have asked officials to provide me with a full picture of performance measurement tools which are used at all levels, and will update the House and the Home Affairs select committee as soon as possible."" Aninspection report from December 2015,external, seen by the BBC, showed targets for the voluntary departures of people regarded as having no right to stay in the UK existed at that time. A 2015 report from the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration details an annual target of 12,000 voluntary departures for 2015/16 The Windrush row erupted after it emerged relatives of migrants from Commonwealth Caribbean countries who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s had been declared illegal immigrants if they could not provide a range of documentation that proved they had lived in the UK continuously. Some of the Windrush generation have been threatened with deportation, lost their jobs or been refused access to medical treatment. Cancer patient Albert Thompson, the man who has been the focus of much of the Windrush row, has now beengiven a date to start his treatment on the NHSand granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. It comes after he was told last year he would have to pay Â£54,000 unless he could produce the right documentation. This video can not be played Albert Thompson: ""I was denied NHS cancer treatment"" Addressing the Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday, Ms Rudd said she had asked for more removals of illegal immigrants to take place, but added: ""We don't have targets for removals."" Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Service Union, had told the MPs a national target, broken down regionally, had been set to remove people in the UK illegally, and staff were under ""increasing pressure"" to meet it. There are three types of enforceable departures: deportations, administrative removals, and voluntary departures.

The Green Party has echoed calls for Ms Rudd to quit, saying that her confirmation of the existence of targets had ""confirmed our worst fears about the Home Office"". ""You can't set targets for people you want to kick out without deciding that some people won't get a fair hearing, because there's a quota to meet by the end of the year,"" said co-leader Jonathan Bartley. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable has raised concerns about the Home Office's ability to process applications from millions of EU nationals who want to stay in the UK after Brexit if it cannot deal properly with the Windrush generation. The government has set up a task force to help those affected by the Windrush cases formalise their status. So far 3,800 calls have been made to the helpline, of which 1,364 were potentially Windrush cases, MPs were told on Wednesday.

Retail woes hit Poundworld and Carpetright,"Discount retailer Poundworld is looking at closing about 100 of its 355 stores, putting up to 1,500 jobs at risk. Poundworld is considering the move under an insolvency process called a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). Like many retailers Poundworld has been hit by falling consumer confidence, rising overheads and the weaker pound. Meanwhile, Carpetright's creditors and landlords have approved the company's CVA plan for about 80 closures, putting hundreds of job at risk. CVA's have become a popular among retailers because they allow firms to offload underperforming stores and reduce rents while avoiding administration. A number of retailers have chosen to go through a CVA, including New Look and Carpetright while last weekHouse of Fraser said it was considering this measure as part of a number of options. Earlier this year, both Toys R Us UK and electronics chain Maplin went into administration. Poundworld is owned by private equity firm TPG Capital, which also controls the restaurant chain Prezzo whose landlords agreed to a CVA last month. Prezzo is also closing 94 branches. Poundworld is expected to announce the terms of the CVA next month. As well as closing stores it would try to get agreement from landlords to reduce rents. The chain imports a lot of its stock and is having to pay more for it because of the fall in the value of the pound. Job loss fears over Fenwick restructuring Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Five things to do with empty retail space Poundworld employs about 5,500 staff and has its headquarters in West Yorkshire. The company was formed in 2004, but it says it can trace its origins ""back to 1974 and a market stall in Wakefield, West Yorkshire"". Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said news of Poundworld's troubles ""signals just how much distress bricks and mortar retailers are under"". ""The toxic mix of rising costs, softer consumer demand and the acceleration of seismic structural shifts are pushing many business models to breaking point. ""Stuck with too many stores, inflexible leases and spiraling operating costs, the business is in desperate need of restructuring."" The developments at Poundworld's emerged as Carpetright's creditors voted on the retailer's restructuring plan. Carpetright has earmarked 81 stores for closure under its CVA, which allow the firm to shut loss-making outlets and secure rent reductions. At the meeting, Carpetright won the backing of more than 75% of creditors to push ahead with the plan, which puts about 300 jobs at risk. Meanwhile, upmarket department store chainFenwicks, which has nine branches in England and employs about 2,000 staff, is looking at ways to restructure. A company spokeswoman said the process would involve shaking up the marketing, human resources, finance and IT functions within the stores.

Knife and gun crime rises revealed,"This video can not be played 'Young people don't want to talk to police' Knife crime rose by 22% in England and Wales in 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The figures, which cover crimes recorded by the police, also showed an 11% increase in firearms offences. A separate survey on the public's experience of crimes in the two countries said there had been no change in overall violent offences. The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) said most types of crime stayed at similar levels to 2016. It added that eight-in-10 adults had not experienced any crimes asked about in the survey throughout 2017. 'I realised I don't need to carry a knife' Knife-related hospital admissions rise How can we solve violence at a local level? While some of the increases in recorded crimes are explained by changes in the way police report them, the ONS warned that some of the statistics showed a genuine rise in the offence - such as the 9% increase in burglaries and the 33% increase in robbery. Recorded homicides were also up by 9% in 2017, to 653 from 599 the previous year. However, when the victims of terror attacks in London and Manchester are included in the 2017 figures, and those who died in Hillsborough in 1989 - which were ruled as manslaughter by a coroner in 2016 and included in that year's figures - the number of recorded homicides fell slightly between 2016 and 2017 from 695 to 688. This video can not be played Knife crime: What's it like to be stabbed? Alexa Bradley, who focuses on crime statistics and analysis for the ONS, said the two sets of figures showed the ""picture of crime"" had been ""fairly stable"", with levels much lower than the peak seen in the mid-1990s. But she said the ""high harm"" offences, such as homicide, knife crime and gun crime, were on the up, which was ""a trend that has been emerging over the previous two years"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the rise in these violent incidents was ""unacceptably high"", and they were ""a national problem that required national solutions from the government"". 39,598 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument - up from 32,448 in 2016 6,604 offences involving firearms - up from 5,864 in 2016 688 homicides, including terror attacks in London and Manchester - but when the terror attacks and Hillsborough are excluded, there was a rise of 9% from 599 homicides to 653 74,130 recorded robbery offences - up from 55,824 in 2016 SOURCE: ONS The CSEW showed a significant fall in computer misuse cases - which were only introduced as part of the figures last year. The 28% drop in incidents, apparently down to a reduction in computer viruses, led to an overall fall in the number of crimes estimated by the survey. But both the CSEW and police recorded figures showed a rise in vehicle crime, with the former estimating a 17% rise in vehicle-related theft and the latter recording a 16% increase in vehicle offences. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Last week, the Home Office set out a strategy to combat serious violence because of a surge in stabbings and shootings that is reflected in the latest figures. But what is likely to worry ministers as much, if not more, is evidence that, after 20 years of decline, burglaries and car crime are on the increase. Thefts of and from cars is rising, according to both the police (by 16%) and the survey (17%), while the ONS says the 9%, apparently genuine, rise in burglaries logged by police is likely to show up in the survey in the near future. Whereas serious violence is concentrated in big cities, property offences affect a broader sweep of people and areas - though the rates of offending are nowhere near the levels they were in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard has released its own figures, showing a significant rise in homicides in London. Comparing April with March 2016-17 with April to March 2017-18, the number rose from 109 to 157 - a 44% increase. Eight of these were as a result of the terror attacks on Westminster Bridge, London Bridge and Finsbury Park. The Metropolitan Police said the number was lower than in 2003-04, when there were 205 incidents, but added: ""Nevertheless, any murder is one murder too many and detectives are working 24/7 to catch those responsible, using all resources available to them."" The new statistics come after a spate of violent crime in the first three months of 2018. In the first 100 days of 2018,52 people were killed in the capital- many of which were stabbings - raising serious concerns about how to tackle violent crime on the city's streets.

"'Wolf pack' jailed for sex attack in SpainFive men are convicted of abusing, but not raping, a woman in a case seen as Spain's MeToo moment.2h2 hours agoEurope","This video can not be played The ""wolf pack"" verdict was met with anger outside court A Spanish court has jailed five men for sexually abusing a young woman during the famous San Fermin bull-running festival but acquitted them of rape. All five were sentenced to nine years in prison for their part in the attack, which they filmed, during the festival in Pamplona in July 2016. The 18-year-old victim's ordeal caused a national outcry, and protests continued outside the court. Both the woman and the defendants say they will appeal against the verdict. ""It's rape, not abuse,"" demonstrators said outside the court. Rallies have been called in Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Alicante and more than a dozen other cities across Spain against the verdict and in support of the victim. The five, in their late 20s and originally from Seville, and the victim, from Madrid, were not present when the judgement was read out after a five-month trial, which was held behind closed doors to protect the woman's identity. 'Wolf pack' gang rape trial angers Spain Under Spanish law, the charge of sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. But senior politicians and human rights groups questioned whether a prolonged sexual assault involving intercourse by five men could be anything but intimidation or rape. The men, who have been in custody since 2016, have also been ordered to pay the woman â¬50,000 ($61,000; Â£43,500) in compensation. Prosecutors had asked for sentences of more than 20 years. However, one judge had argued that the men should have been acquitted of all charges except stealing the victim's phone. Videos of the late-night encounter between the men and the young woman showed how the five men had wandered the streets among other drunken revellers before two of them led her into a basement by the hand. According to a police report, the men - who belonged to a WhatsApp group calledLa manada(wolf pack) - surrounded the woman in a small alcove, removed her clothes and had unprotected sex. A picture of the accused is seen on screen in the courtroom Some of them filmed the sexual act on their phones - there were seven videos, totalling 96 seconds. One of the men posted messages in a WhatsApp group celebrating what they had done and promising to share the recording. According to the police report, the victim maintained a ""passive or neutral"" attitude throughout the scene, keeping her eyes closed at all times. Her phone was then stolen. She was found in a reportedly distraught state by a couple in the street outside the scene of the attack. She told the trial she was still having psychological treatment to deal with trauma. Some of the men were found to be in a video in which they apparently abused another woman, who seemed to be unconscious. By James Badcock, Madrid The ""wolf pack"" case has been Spain's #MeToo over the past two years, with thousands of supporters of the victim uniting under the sloganYo te creo(I believe you). The shocking nature of the group abuse, the youth of the victim and the obnoxious celebratory messages about their ""conquest"" on their WhatsApp chat combined to make the case fertile fodder for black-and-white public opinion. That the two majority verdict judges have chosen to see shades of grey by not interpreting the criminals' acts as violent or intimidatory will fuel indignant criticism from feminist groups. Several leading left-wing politicians have already questioned the verdict. The apparent certainty of an appeal hearing means the debate over whether the law protects women will continue. JosÃ© Ãngel Prenda, 28: considered the leader of the five, wrote a message in the WhatsApp group about the video showing them having sex with the woman. He had been sentenced to two years in prison in 2011 for theft with force Antonio Manuel Guerrero: a Civil Guard police officer, born in 1989, is thought to have recorded six videos. He also admitted to stealing the victim's phone Ãngel Boza, 26: his criminal records include theft with force and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs Alfonso JesÃºs Cabezuelo, 29: a military officer, is thought to have recorded one video JesÃºs Escudero, 27: a hairdresser Supporters of the victim gathered outside the courthouse for the verdict, and were furious when it was read out. Some donned red gloves in protest. Women's rights groups and many politicians reacted angrily, with Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya SÃ¡enz de SantamarÃ­a calling on officials to analyse the verdict so that similar cases could be avoided. UN Women programme director MarÃ­a Noel Vaeza said this was a ""lost opportunity"", El PaÃ­s newspaper reports (in Spanish),,externalurging an end to the ""social impunity [in cases of] rape"". Dozens of people gathered outside the court ahead of the verdict, some wearing red gloves in protest Altamira Gonzalo, vice-president of Themis, a Spanish organisation of women jurists, told Efe news agency: ""It should have been a courageous sentence. The courts can't be so distant from society"". Socialist party leader Pedro Sanchez tweeted his outrage (in Spanish),external: ""If what the 'wolfpack' did wasn't group violence against a defenceless woman, then what do we understand by rape?"" The victim's lawyer said he was ""disappointed"" while lawyers for the five men said they would appeal, calling the verdict ""unfair"".

"FA receives Â£900m offer to sell WembleyThe Football Association receives an offer to sell Wembley Stadium, in a deal understood to be worth Â£900m.2h2 hours agoBBC SportComments","Wembley Stadium cost Â£757m and opened in 2007 Fulham owner Shahid Khan has made an offer, thought to be worth Â£900m, to buy Wembley Stadium from the Football Association. It is understood Khan would pay Â£600m for the stadium and the FA will continue to run the Club Wembley hospitality business, valued at Â£300m. The FA board discussed the approach at a meeting on Thursday. ""We would strive to be the best possible steward for a venue that is iconic,"" said Khan. The owner of NFL side Jacksonville Jaguars added: ""Wembley would return to private ownership and the Football Association would be able to focus on its core mission of developing players. ""I trust many if not most of you are also supporters of the England national teams, so I hope you welcome the potential of this becoming a reality."" Fulham coach Slavisa Jokanovic said at a news conference on Thursday that Khan told him ""about his plan a year and a half ago - he's very ambitious"". BBC Sport understands selling Wembley would allow the FA to make a major investment into football at grassroots level. But, according to theFA's latest financial results,external, it still owes Â£113m to public bodies such as Sport England, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, plus the London Development Agency, which helped pay to build the stadium, which cost Â£757m and opened in 2007. The FAsaid in January,externalit would finish paying for the ground by the end of 2024. The 90,000-seat stadium, which is the largest in the United Kingdom, has been the home for Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur this season while work on their new stadium takes place. Spurs also have a deal with the NFL to stage a minimum of two games a season over 10 years once their new stadium is complete. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the link-up with the NFL was a ""compelling and exciting partnership"". NFL executive vice-president Mark Waller said having stadium options in London has been ""critical to the NFL"". His statement added: ""The potential purchase of Wembley Stadium is a further powerful sign of their commitment to the UK and their vision to help us grow the sport. ""This new relationship would allow for even greater flexibility in scheduling future NFL games in London."" This video can not be played Hodgson would be 'disappointed' if England stopped playing at Wembley It's an offer that doesn't come along all too often. The FA board has a huge decision to make now. The money, I'm told, would be ploughed by the FA into the grassroots game, with a potentially revolutionary effect on provision of coaches, coach educators, 4G pitches and money to revamp facilities. As for the England teams? Well, they will still be able to call Wembley their home. What now for FA Cup semi-finals and final? Or the other major trophy games and play-off finals? Could they stay at Wembley or will other big grounds such as Old Trafford or Emirates Stadium benefit as a result? In short, are we about to witness Wembley's status as the national stadium erode? Greater commercialisation of the stadium is perhaps almost inevitable if it is to become home, in time, to the Jacksonville Jaguars. But for a ground officially known right now as ""Wembley Stadium connected by EE"" that's maybe not such a leap. Shahid Khan bought Fulham in 2013 BBC Radio London's Andy Rowley Khan came to prominence in England when buying Fulham in 2013 from Mohamed Al-Fayed. The 67-year-old was born in Lahore, Pakistan but moved to the United States at the age of 16 to study engineering and went on to become a billionaire as an automobile parts manufacturer. Khan's current net worth is $7.2bn (Â£5.2bn), making him the 217th richest person in the world according to the 2018 Forbes rich list, and the 73rd richest in the United States. Khan bought NFL franchise Jacksonville Jaguars in 2011 and they have had a deal to play ""home"" games at Wembley since 2013. The contract for that is in place until 2020 as the Jaguars have tried to put themselves at the forefront of the NFL links with London. Fulham are pushing for a return to the Premier League, having been relegated to the Championship in 2014 soon after Khan's arrival, while Jacksonville had their best season for a decade, reaching the AFC Championship game before being beaten by New England Patriots. Khan has stated that any prospective deal for Wembley will have no impact on his commitment to Fulham and the proposed redevelopment of the Riverside stand. Khan's son, Tony, has been vice chairman and director of football operations at Fulham since February 2017, having previously advised on football operations.

'America's Dad' under fire,"Cosby became a global star in the 1980s Bill Cosby was once known to millions as ""America's Dad"", but the comedian had his reputation shattered when he was sentenced to three to 10 years in jail after being convicted of sexual assault. That judgement has now been overturned, and the 83-year-old has walked free from prison after serving two years of the sentence. His role as the benevolent, jumper-wearing Dr Cliff Huxtable in 1980s hit sitcom The Cosby Show made him a national treasure in the US. But more than a dozen women accused Mr Cosby of misconduct, and one case made it to court. Although a jury failed to reach a verdict in June 2017,a retrial originally led to a conviction less than a year later.But in June 2021,Pennsylvania's highest court ruled he had been denied a fair trial, quashing the guilty verdict. How did this man, a household name for so long in America, rise and fall so far? Born in 1937 in a social housing complex in Philadelphia, the young William Henry Cosby Jr shone shoes and worked at a local supermarket to help his family make ends meet. His early life was touched by tragedy when one of his four brothers died and he, the oldest, became a father figure. Accounts of his school years portray a joker and a storyteller who loved to entertain classmates. After school he joined the US Navy, then went to university and worked part-time as a bartender. Filling in for a club comedian, he laid the path for his future fame. His debut on NBC's Tonight Show in 1963 led to a recording contract with Warner Brothers, and the release of a series of award-winning comedy albums. On one of those, 1968's To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With, he established the themes that would define his work - the father as a loving disciplinarian; siblings who could plot together one minute, then scream blue murder the next; and a confidence in the bonds of family. Cosby, shown here in 1973, began his career in the nightclubs of Greenwich Village The album sleeve noted: ""During his time on stage, Cosby never once told a joke. He didn't sing or dance or do tricks. All he did was talk"" - but the performer had the 10,000-strong audience in the palm of his hand throughout. By the time the album was released, Mr Cosby was already a TV star. In 1965, he had become the first black actor to star in a drama series, when he was cast in the espionage show I Spy. He played Alexander Scott, an undercover agent posing as a tennis instructor, alongside Robert Culp, who played fellow agent Kelly Robinson. Premiering during a time of great upheaval for race relations in the US, it was banned by some stations in the southern states. But Cosby went on to earn three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role - a record that still stands. Although black actors had appeared in TV comedies before, Cosby's role in the primetime drama I Spy was groundbreaking Despite his prominence on TV, Mr Cosby made a conscious decision not to directly address race relations in his act - preferring a more subtle challenge to the status quo. ""A white person listens to my act, and he laughs, and he thinks: 'Yeah, that's the way I see it, too,'"" he once said. ""OK. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? ""So I figure this way, I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy."" The Cosby Show, which was launched by NBC in 1984 and aired for eight seasons, was his biggest success and established him as a household name. Based on his stand-up routines, Mr Cosby's portrayal of an educated, affluent doctor - Heathcliff ""Cliff"" Huxtable - and the trials of raising five young children drew parallels with his own life. His TV wife, Claire, was loosely based on his own wife Camille, whom he married in 1964. Bill Cosby's wife Camille has stood by him The sitcom was watched by about30 million viewers,externaleach week. By 1989, its star was earning $4m (Â£2.5m) a month in syndication rights alone. When the show was cancelled in 1992, Mr Cosby embarked on a number of projects including film roles, but was never able to emulate the success of his star vehicle. In 2013, he receivedrave reviews,externalfor his first TV stand-up show in 30 years, which led to a national tour. But his comeback fell apart as several women came forward with allegations of sexual assault going back almost 30 years. The accusations first surfaced in 2005, when Andrea Constand, a staff member at Cosby's former university, said she had been drugged and molested by the star at his home a year earlier. Prosecutors declined to press charges, citing lack of evidence, but Ms Constand filed a civil case against the comedian. Due to statute of limitations law, Andrea Constand was the only alleged sex assault victim who could bring charges against Cosby Thirteen women, 12 of whom remained anonymous, agreed to be witnesses, each with a similar account of sexual assault. Mr Cosby denied the accusations, which his lawyer called ""preposterous"", and the case was settled out of court in 2006 for an undisclosed sum. In subsequent years, some of Ms Constand's fellow witnesses told their stories to the media. But the accusations were not comprehensively reported until Mr Cosby's planned TV comeback thrust him back into the limelight. More than 50 women accused the star of sexual assault or rape, but due to time limits on cases, only one - Andrea Constand - took the case to criminal court. Why is there a time limit on sexual assault cases in the US? Mr Cosby's lawyers consistently denied the charges, asking why the women had not made legal complaints at the time when they said they were assaulted. In 2014 Mr Cosby said he had not addressed the allegations in public because ""a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos"". But shortly afterwards, previously unseencourt papers from 2005came to light and showed he had admitted obtaining sedatives to give to young women he wanted to have sex with. The sedatives, called Quaaludes, render people unable to move. The rise and fall of Quaaludes Timeline of Cosby accusations The accusations disrupted his hopes of a return to show business. Cable station TV Land pulled repeats of The Cosby Show, some of his stand-up shows were called off and protesters showed up to the ones that he still put on. His statue was removed from the MGM Hollywood Studios park in Florida, and several colleges removed honorary degrees they had given him. Cosby addressing Temple University students at a commencement ceremony in 2003 His portraits were taken down from the walls in his alma mater, Temple University in Philadelphia, and he resigned from the board of trustees. At first, it appeared unlikely that any criminal action would be taken against Mr Cosby, partly because most US states have of statutes of limitation in cases of rape and sexual assault. However, one case came to criminal trial - that of Andrea Constand. The case was seen as one of the biggest US celebrity court case since the murder trial of former American football player OJ Simpson in 1995. In June 2017, Ms Constandtold her story in court for the first time, having previously been barred from doing so due to the 2006 settlement. She said Mr Cosby had given her pills that he claimed were herbal and said would ""take the edge off"", but which left her virtually paralysed. ""In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen"", she said. About 20 minutes later, she said, he put his hand on her genitals. ""I wasn't able to fight it in any way,"" she told the court. ""I wanted it to stop."" Mr Cosby continued to deny the allegations. He did not give evidence in court buthad one witness. In the end, with Mr Cosby possibly facing the rest of his life in prison if found guilty, the jury was deadlocked, and a mistrial was declared in June 2017. The retrial, which began on 9 April 2018, took place in a changed atmosphere. A flood of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men in the entertainment industry such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey had triggered the #MeToo movement. The trial in Pennsylvania became one of the first celebrity cases of the #MeToo era. The decision by the judge to allow five more women to testify against him was seen as a key development. On this occasion, the jury took two days to find the comedian guilty on all three counts of sexual assault. Months later, he was sentenced to a total of three to 10 years in prison. After serving two years of the jail sentence, in June Pennsylvania's highest court overturned his conviction for sexual assault. Hours later, Mr Cosby was driven away from the prison. The court found that Mr Cosby had been denied due process and should not have been put on trial because he had reached an agreement with the previous prosecutor in 2005 that he would not be charged. ""He must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be barred"", it wrote ina 79-page ruling,external. But despite the outcome, some legal analysts said Mr Cosby would not be able to go back to the life he knew before. His reputation would be ""forever tarnished"", said defence lawyer Rikki Klieman of CBS News. ""He does not go back to being America's Dad, everything that he lost in terms of the trappings of his life - his reputation, his TV jobs, his night club jobs, his being a spokesperson - all of that is gone.""

Five questions answered about Cosby case,"Mr Cosby has maintained that his sexual encounters were consensual Bill Cosby has been convicted of sexual assault by a Pennsylvania jury. After years of allegations from dozens of women, how did we get to this point? Mr Cosby was convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault against Andrea Constand in a retrial at a courthouse in Pennsylvania. Bill Cosby is an American comedian and actor best known for his role as the father in the television hit The Cosby Show which ran from 1984-92 and was a huge hit in the US and around the globe. At one point he was the highest-paid actor in the US. He was born on a council estate in Philadelphia and started his career as a stand-up comedian in 1962, debuting on NBC's The Tonight Show in 1963. In 1965, he became the first black actor to star in a drama series in the US, in the espionage show I Spy. He earned three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role, at a time of high race tensions in the US. The Cosby Show was described by TV critics as ""transformational piece of American culture"". He portrayed a doctor called Cliff Huxtable raising five children with his wife. By 1989, he was earning $4m (Â£2.5m) a month in syndication rights alone. In 2013 he did a national stand-up tour and received rave reviews. After that, several women began to come forward with allegations of sexual assault, some going back nearly 30 years. Bill Cosby: America's Dad under fire He was on trial for a charge of three counts of felony indecent assault, alleged by a former colleague, Andrea Constand. Cosby has been found guilty on all three counts. It is the only criminal case Cosby has faced thus far related to sexual assault accusations dating back years. Ms Constand, a former employee of Temple University who now lives in Canada, has said that she came to think of Cosby as a ""mentor and a friend"" before she said he made unwanted sexual advances. She went to visit him at his home in 2004 to discuss her career and her future where she said he drugged and sexually assaulted her. A criminal complaint unsealed last year details the encounter. She and Cosby settled a lawsuit in 2006 and she was paid an undisclosed sum. Prosecutors re-opened her case last summer when they realised the statute of limitations had not run out and after other women had come forward. Cosby victim 'paralysed' by drugs In other states, he faces defamation lawsuits for branding his accusers liars. Over the years, nearly 60 women have come forward accusing Mr Cosby of sexual assault. Thirty-five of those womentold their stories to New York Magazine,externalin 2015. They alleged he assaulted them in their own homes and even in public. In another case, an accuser named Judy Huth said Cosby molested her when she was 15 years old, forcing her to perform a sexual act on him at the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles. Criminal charges were not filed against Cosby because of the statute of limitations. His lawyers called Ms Huth's claims discredited or decades old. In another prominent case, a 25-year-old model named Chloe Goins sued Cosby for a sexual assault at the Playboy Mansion she says happened in 2008. She sought criminal charges but prosecutors decline to pursue them. He maintains the sexual encounters were consensual. In Ms Constand's case, he said she never said no, though she never said yes either. A deposition for her case showed that he admitted pursuing sex with younger women and giving them Quaaludes, a sedative. He said he was confident his behaviour was not rape. The New York Times described the deposition as presenting Cosby as ""as an unapologetic, cavalier playboy, someone who used a combination of fame, apparent concern and powerful sedatives in a calculated pursuit of young women"". The first trial failed to reach a verdict in the spring of 2017. In the second trial, the judge allowed more evidence to be admitted, for the defence and the prosecution. So the court heard testimony from four more accusers, evidence not allowed in the first trial, when only Ms Constand's account was heard. That meant the prosecution could establish a pattern of behaviour on the part of the disgraced comedian. There was also new evidence that worked in Cosby's favour. A new defence witness who once worked with Ms Constand had talked about fabricating evidence against a celebrity for financial gain. And a $3.38m payment that Cosby paid to her in a 2006 settlement - which the defence said showed she was a gold-digger - had not been previously disclosed. Since the first trial failed to reach a verdict in early 2017, there has been a slew of cases brought by women alleging sexual assault by high-profile men. The men and women of the jury were asked during selection how much they knew about #MeToo and directed to make their decision based only on the evidence of this case. But it would have been hard to ignore the new climate in which women have felt empowered to make accusations and a prevailing view that complaints no longer be ignored. One of Cosby's accusers, Lili Bernard, said after the verdict: ""The MeToo movement has shown that women are worthy of being believed."" Since the allegations against Cosby first arose several years ago, Cosby's work - including TV shows, films, and stand-up performances - has been pulled from many US networks, including TV Land, Centric, and Bounce TV. Netflix and NBC both ended planned projects with Cosby after the assault charges as well. In 2015, he was dropped by his talent agency, CAA.

Five questions answered about case,"Mr Cosby has maintained that his sexual encounters were consensual Bill Cosby has been convicted of sexual assault by a Pennsylvania jury. After years of allegations from dozens of women, how did we get to this point? Mr Cosby was convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault against Andrea Constand in a retrial at a courthouse in Pennsylvania. Bill Cosby is an American comedian and actor best known for his role as the father in the television hit The Cosby Show which ran from 1984-92 and was a huge hit in the US and around the globe. At one point he was the highest-paid actor in the US. He was born on a council estate in Philadelphia and started his career as a stand-up comedian in 1962, debuting on NBC's The Tonight Show in 1963. In 1965, he became the first black actor to star in a drama series in the US, in the espionage show I Spy. He earned three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role, at a time of high race tensions in the US. The Cosby Show was described by TV critics as ""transformational piece of American culture"". He portrayed a doctor called Cliff Huxtable raising five children with his wife. By 1989, he was earning $4m (Â£2.5m) a month in syndication rights alone. In 2013 he did a national stand-up tour and received rave reviews. After that, several women began to come forward with allegations of sexual assault, some going back nearly 30 years. Bill Cosby: America's Dad under fire He was on trial for a charge of three counts of felony indecent assault, alleged by a former colleague, Andrea Constand. Cosby has been found guilty on all three counts. It is the only criminal case Cosby has faced thus far related to sexual assault accusations dating back years. Ms Constand, a former employee of Temple University who now lives in Canada, has said that she came to think of Cosby as a ""mentor and a friend"" before she said he made unwanted sexual advances. She went to visit him at his home in 2004 to discuss her career and her future where she said he drugged and sexually assaulted her. A criminal complaint unsealed last year details the encounter. She and Cosby settled a lawsuit in 2006 and she was paid an undisclosed sum. Prosecutors re-opened her case last summer when they realised the statute of limitations had not run out and after other women had come forward. Cosby victim 'paralysed' by drugs In other states, he faces defamation lawsuits for branding his accusers liars. Over the years, nearly 60 women have come forward accusing Mr Cosby of sexual assault. Thirty-five of those womentold their stories to New York Magazine,externalin 2015. They alleged he assaulted them in their own homes and even in public. In another case, an accuser named Judy Huth said Cosby molested her when she was 15 years old, forcing her to perform a sexual act on him at the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles. Criminal charges were not filed against Cosby because of the statute of limitations. His lawyers called Ms Huth's claims discredited or decades old. In another prominent case, a 25-year-old model named Chloe Goins sued Cosby for a sexual assault at the Playboy Mansion she says happened in 2008. She sought criminal charges but prosecutors decline to pursue them. He maintains the sexual encounters were consensual. In Ms Constand's case, he said she never said no, though she never said yes either. A deposition for her case showed that he admitted pursuing sex with younger women and giving them Quaaludes, a sedative. He said he was confident his behaviour was not rape. The New York Times described the deposition as presenting Cosby as ""as an unapologetic, cavalier playboy, someone who used a combination of fame, apparent concern and powerful sedatives in a calculated pursuit of young women"". The first trial failed to reach a verdict in the spring of 2017. In the second trial, the judge allowed more evidence to be admitted, for the defence and the prosecution. So the court heard testimony from four more accusers, evidence not allowed in the first trial, when only Ms Constand's account was heard. That meant the prosecution could establish a pattern of behaviour on the part of the disgraced comedian. There was also new evidence that worked in Cosby's favour. A new defence witness who once worked with Ms Constand had talked about fabricating evidence against a celebrity for financial gain. And a $3.38m payment that Cosby paid to her in a 2006 settlement - which the defence said showed she was a gold-digger - had not been previously disclosed.

Bill Cosby: 'America's Dad' under fire,"Cosby became a global star in the 1980s Bill Cosby was once known to millions as ""America's Dad"", but the comedian had his reputation shattered when he was sentenced to three to 10 years in jail after being convicted of sexual assault. That judgement has now been overturned, and the 83-year-old has walked free from prison after serving two years of the sentence. His role as the benevolent, jumper-wearing Dr Cliff Huxtable in 1980s hit sitcom The Cosby Show made him a national treasure in the US. But more than a dozen women accused Mr Cosby of misconduct, and one case made it to court. Although a jury failed to reach a verdict in June 2017,a retrial originally led to a conviction less than a year later.But in June 2021,Pennsylvania's highest court ruled he had been denied a fair trial, quashing the guilty verdict. How did this man, a household name for so long in America, rise and fall so far? Born in 1937 in a social housing complex in Philadelphia, the young William Henry Cosby Jr shone shoes and worked at a local supermarket to help his family make ends meet. His early life was touched by tragedy when one of his four brothers died and he, the oldest, became a father figure. Accounts of his school years portray a joker and a storyteller who loved to entertain classmates. After school he joined the US Navy, then went to university and worked part-time as a bartender. Filling in for a club comedian, he laid the path for his future fame. His debut on NBC's Tonight Show in 1963 led to a recording contract with Warner Brothers, and the release of a series of award-winning comedy albums. On one of those, 1968's To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With, he established the themes that would define his work - the father as a loving disciplinarian; siblings who could plot together one minute, then scream blue murder the next; and a confidence in the bonds of family. Cosby, shown here in 1973, began his career in the nightclubs of Greenwich Village The album sleeve noted: ""During his time on stage, Cosby never once told a joke. He didn't sing or dance or do tricks. All he did was talk"" - but the performer had the 10,000-strong audience in the palm of his hand throughout. By the time the album was released, Mr Cosby was already a TV star. In 1965, he had become the first black actor to star in a drama series, when he was cast in the espionage show I Spy. He played Alexander Scott, an undercover agent posing as a tennis instructor, alongside Robert Culp, who played fellow agent Kelly Robinson. Premiering during a time of great upheaval for race relations in the US, it was banned by some stations in the southern states. But Cosby went on to earn three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role - a record that still stands. Although black actors had appeared in TV comedies before, Cosby's role in the primetime drama I Spy was groundbreaking Despite his prominence on TV, Mr Cosby made a conscious decision not to directly address race relations in his act - preferring a more subtle challenge to the status quo. ""A white person listens to my act, and he laughs, and he thinks: 'Yeah, that's the way I see it, too,'"" he once said. ""OK. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? ""So I figure this way, I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy."" The Cosby Show, which was launched by NBC in 1984 and aired for eight seasons, was his biggest success and established him as a household name. Based on his stand-up routines, Mr Cosby's portrayal of an educated, affluent doctor - Heathcliff ""Cliff"" Huxtable - and the trials of raising five young children drew parallels with his own life. His TV wife, Claire, was loosely based on his own wife Camille, whom he married in 1964. Bill Cosby's wife Camille has stood by him The sitcom was watched by about30 million viewers,externaleach week. By 1989, its star was earning $4m (Â£2.5m) a month in syndication rights alone. When the show was cancelled in 1992, Mr Cosby embarked on a number of projects including film roles, but was never able to emulate the success of his star vehicle. In 2013, he receivedrave reviews,externalfor his first TV stand-up show in 30 years, which led to a national tour. But his comeback fell apart as several women came forward with allegations of sexual assault going back almost 30 years. The accusations first surfaced in 2005, when Andrea Constand, a staff member at Cosby's former university, said she had been drugged and molested by the star at his home a year earlier. Prosecutors declined to press charges, citing lack of evidence, but Ms Constand filed a civil case against the comedian. Due to statute of limitations law, Andrea Constand was the only alleged sex assault victim who could bring charges against Cosby Thirteen women, 12 of whom remained anonymous, agreed to be witnesses, each with a similar account of sexual assault. Mr Cosby denied the accusations, which his lawyer called ""preposterous"", and the case was settled out of court in 2006 for an undisclosed sum. In subsequent years, some of Ms Constand's fellow witnesses told their stories to the media. But the accusations were not comprehensively reported until Mr Cosby's planned TV comeback thrust him back into the limelight. More than 50 women accused the star of sexual assault or rape, but due to time limits on cases, only one - Andrea Constand - took the case to criminal court. Why is there a time limit on sexual assault cases in the US? Mr Cosby's lawyers consistently denied the charges, asking why the women had not made legal complaints at the time when they said they were assaulted. In 2014 Mr Cosby said he had not addressed the allegations in public because ""a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos"". But shortly afterwards, previously unseencourt papers from 2005came to light and showed he had admitted obtaining sedatives to give to young women he wanted to have sex with. The sedatives, called Quaaludes, render people unable to move. The rise and fall of Quaaludes Timeline of Cosby accusations The accusations disrupted his hopes of a return to show business. Cable station TV Land pulled repeats of The Cosby Show, some of his stand-up shows were called off and protesters showed up to the ones that he still put on. His statue was removed from the MGM Hollywood Studios park in Florida, and several colleges removed honorary degrees they had given him. Cosby addressing Temple University students at a commencement ceremony in 2003 His portraits were taken down from the walls in his alma mater, Temple University in Philadelphia, and he resigned from the board of trustees. At first, it appeared unlikely that any criminal action would be taken against Mr Cosby, partly because most US states have of statutes of limitation in cases of rape and sexual assault. However, one case came to criminal trial - that of Andrea Constand. The case was seen as one of the biggest US celebrity court case since the murder trial of former American football player OJ Simpson in 1995. In June 2017, Ms Constandtold her story in court for the first time, having previously been barred from doing so due to the 2006 settlement. She said Mr Cosby had given her pills that he claimed were herbal and said would ""take the edge off"", but which left her virtually paralysed. ""In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen"", she said. About 20 minutes later, she said, he put his hand on her genitals. ""I wasn't able to fight it in any way,"" she told the court. ""I wanted it to stop."" Mr Cosby continued to deny the allegations. He did not give evidence in court buthad one witness. In the end, with Mr Cosby possibly facing the rest of his life in prison if found guilty, the jury was deadlocked, and a mistrial was declared in June 2017. The retrial, which began on 9 April 2018, took place in a changed atmosphere. A flood of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men in the entertainment industry such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey had triggered the #MeToo movement. The trial in Pennsylvania became one of the first celebrity cases of the #MeToo era. The decision by the judge to allow five more women to testify against him was seen as a key development. On this occasion, the jury took two days to find the comedian guilty on all three counts of sexual assault. Months later, he was sentenced to a total of three to 10 years in prison. After serving two years of the jail sentence, in June Pennsylvania's highest court overturned his conviction for sexual assault. Hours later, Mr Cosby was driven away from the prison. The court found that Mr Cosby had been denied due process and should not have been put on trial because he had reached an agreement with the previous prosecutor in 2005 that he would not be charged. ""He must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be barred"", it wrote ina 79-page ruling,external. But despite the outcome, some legal analysts said Mr Cosby would not be able to go back to the life he knew before. His reputation would be ""forever tarnished"", said defence lawyer Rikki Klieman of CBS News. ""He does not go back to being America's Dad, everything that he lost in terms of the trappings of his life - his reputation, his TV jobs, his night club jobs, his being a spokesperson - all of that is gone.""

President Trump to visit UK in July,"Theresa May and Donald Trump met in Davos earlier this year US President Donald Trump is to visit the UK on Friday 13 July, after previously cancelling a trip amid claims he would face mass protests. It will not be the full-blown state visit Mr Trump was promised when Prime Minister Theresa May visited the White House in January last year. But an invitation to a state visit still stands, the BBC understands. BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said he understood the president was likely to meet the Queen during the visit. Mr Trump will hold talks with Mrs May, Downing Street said, with further details to be ""set out in due course"". The prime minister said she was ""looking forward to welcoming President Trump to the United Kingdom for a working visit on July 13"". The July date follows the Nato summit in Brussels which the president is expected to attend. Donald Trump scraps UK February visit Trump 'should visit Scotland, not London' Downing Street and the White House hoped to co-ordinate releasing details of the trip, but Mr Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders apparently let slip the information first. UK ambassador Sir Kim Darroch confirmed the date on Twitter, saying he was ""delighted"" that Mr Trump would visit the UK. Will the president fit in a day at his golf course in Scotland? By Jon Sopel, BBC North American editor The White House announcement confirming the date of the president's visit came sooner than Downing Street had anticipated, which means there is still a lot of detail to work out. The centrepiece will be his talks with Theresa May, but most attention is likely to focus on any audience he has with the Queen. I understand they will meet, either at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. She has, after all, met every serving US president during her reign except of Lyndon B Johnson. What will also be fascinating is to see if Mr Trump meets Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. It's also conceivable that he will bolt on an extra day to his trip to visit Turnberry, the championship golf course he owns on the west coast of Scotland. And then there is the likely logistical issue of policing, and how to keep demonstrators at bay. One minister has been quoted as saying Donald Trump won't go anywhere where he can be publicly shouted at. Mr Trump cancelled a planned trip to London to open the new US embassy in Vauxhall earlier this year, complaining the move to an ""off location"" south of the Thames had been a ""bad deal"". But critics said his decision may have been driven by a fear of protests. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted that it was ""fantastic"" news that Mr Trump would ""at last"" be visiting Britain.

Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK's director, said: ""When Donald Trump arrives on these shores, we and thousands of our supporters will very definitely be making our voices heard."" And Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson said the ""scaled-down trip must not be met by scaled-down protests"". Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said on BBC One's Question Time that she would not join protests, but defended the rights of others to do so - saying Mr Trump's ""actions and his attitudes have made him so frightening to so many people in this country"". This video can not be played Donald Trump and Theresa May held hands briefly in Washington Culture Secretary Matt Hancock told the same programme that the US-UK relationship was ""much deeper than any one person"" and ""we have to make sure that we influence the strongest economy on earth"". ""The United States kicked out more Russian diplomats than any other country in response to the Salisbury attack,"" he said. ""They have been strong supporters when we have needed them recently in the face of Russian aggression."" More than 33,000 people on Facebook have already said they will attend a protest organised by left-wing journalist Owen Jones. Six Conservative groups - including the think tanks the Bow Group and the Bruges Group - have written to Mr Trump urging him to focus his visit on his ""ancestral home"" of Scotland, where his mother was born. Ben Harris-Quinney, chairman of the Bow Group, said: ""A visit to London by the president is likely to draw major protests, crime and disorder, and we do not wish to see Britain or President Trump embarrassed by this. ""It is important that the people of the United States and its government know there are many in Britain who strongly support the president and the special relationship, and wish for President Trump to be afforded the warmest of welcomes. ""Sadly that will not be the case in London."" Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit Mr Trump in the White House following his inauguration in January 2017. She conveyed an invitation from the Queen for Mr Trump to come for a state visit - a formal occasion with much pomp and ceremony. Mr Trump accepted the invitation but a date has yet to be set, amid speculation it has been postponed indefinitely. Plans for a working visit to the UK in 2018 were announced when Mr Trump met Mrs May at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said Mrs May would have lots of business to discuss with Mr Trump, from the framework of a future trade deal to his plans for tariffs on steel and aluminium. But he added, after the high-profile visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to Washington DC this week - and with German Chancellor Angela Merkel flying in for a US visit on Thursday - the ""optics"" of such a visit were important and Britain would not want to get left behind.

Trump scraps UK February visit,"Recent disagreements over US and UK policies are understood not to have played a part Donald Trump has cancelled a planned visit to the UK in February, where he had been expected to open a new $1bn (Â£738m) US embassy in London. The US president tweeted he was not a ""big fan"" of the new embassy - which is moving from Mayfair to south London. He blamed Barack Obama's administration for a ""bad deal"" despite the fact the move was agreed under George W Bush. The trip was not the controversial full state visit offered by Theresa May, for which no date has yet been set. Reality Check: Who sold the US embassy in London? Trump 'in crude outburst about migrants' President's tweet mocked on social media What is a state visit? Downing Street said no date has been confirmed for any visit by Mr Trump and that the opening of the US embassy ""is a matter for the US"". The ""strong and deep"" partnership between Britain and the US ""will endure"" despite Mr Trump's cancellation, a spokesman added. However, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who has clashed with the president in the past -  said the US president had ""got the message"" that many Londoners were staunchly opposed to his policies and actions. BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said he suspected the possibility of protests in London would have also weighed in the calculation. Allow Twitter content?

The US embassy move was confirmed in October 2008, when President George W Bush was still in the White House. It was moved from its Mayfair site because it was too small to put in the modern security it needed, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said. However, Mr Trump blamed former president Mr Obama's administration for selling ""perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts"". May and Trump's festive phone call What will Donald Trump's medical reveal? Mr Trump also criticised the location of the new building in Vauxhall, south London, as an ""off location"", adding: ""Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!"" The BBC's North America editor said February's planned visit could have included meetings with Mrs May at Chequers or Downing Street and lunch with the Queen. However, no firm date for the visit had ever been agreed, nor had the White House ""nailed down the details of the trip"", James Lansdale added. By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Donald Trump says that he is not coming to open the new US embassy in London because he is not a fan of the building. Some diplomats suggest the president was unimpressed by the low key nature of the proposed trip, shorn of the pomp and bling he expected. Others say the White House was worried about the scale of the public protests that were threatened. But amid all this is the nagging fear that the real reason is that Mr Trump just does not see the UK as a priority. In his first year of office, he has visited most other G7 countries and several European nations, including Belgium, so the absence of Britain from his itinerary stands out. Of course, trips - like tweets - can be easily remedied, and a visit by Mr Trump later this year could in theory dispel the fears. But with the UK at odds with the US on an increasing numbers of issues, from Iran to Jerusalem, the lack of a visit carries greater symbolic weight. The ribbon-cutting ceremony may instead be hosted by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mr Trump accepted the Queen's invitation for an official state visit when the prime minister met him last year. A petition calling for the invitation to be withdrawn was signed by more than 1.8m people, while the issue was also debated in parliament. Reports in June suggestedMr Trump wanted to delay a potential visitamid concerns about large-scale protests. However, the BBC understands Downing Street is considering options for the visit later in the year. This video can not be played Inside the new US embassy A former British ambassador to the United States, Christopher Meyer, told BBC Radio 4's World at One he would be ""surprised"" if the US president visited the UK in his first term. Mr Meyer said: ""It would be so difficult to manage from a security point of view [and] from a public point of view if he remained as unpopular among the British people at large as he is now."" Speaking last month, US ambassador to the UK Woody Johnson told the BBC he ""absolutely""expected Mr Trump to visit Britain in 2018. During the Queen's Speech at the State Opening of Parliament last summer, there was no mention of a visit - although a Downing Street spokesman said an invitation had been ""extended and accepted"". Mrs May was thefirst foreign leader to meet Mr Trump after his inaugurationwhen she visited the Oval Office in January 2017. Typically during state visits, the government, the visiting government and the royal household agree on a detailed schedule where the Queen acts as the official host. This video can not be played Nigel Farage and Chuka Umunna fall out on the Today programme over cancelled Trump UK visit The cancellation comes after recent disagreements between the US and UK. Mr Trump clashed with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan in the aftermath of the London Bridge attack last year, when he questioned Mr Khan's statement that there was ""no reason to be alarmed"". Mr Khan, who also questioned Mr Trump's proposed US travel ban, said the US president's visit would  ""without doubt have been met by mass peaceful protests"". Allow Twitter content?

Trump 'should visit Scotland',"Donald Trump has spoken of his love for Scotland in the past Donald Trump has been urged by UK-based supporters to stay away from London and instead focus on his ""ancestral home"" of Scotland during his trip to Britain. In a letter to the US president, six conservative groups say the move would allow Mr Trump to avoid ""major protests, crime and disorder"". And they suggest he meets the Queen at Balmoral to avoid ""potential embarrassment"" in London. But opponents said they would take to Scotland's streets to protest. It has been confirmed thatMr Trump will visit the UK on 13 Julybut it is not yet known whether he will be coming to Scotland during the trip. Responding to the announcement, the Scottish government said: ""Scotland has deep and longstanding ties of family, friendship and business with the United States, which will continue to endure. ""At the same time, we will not compromise our fundamental values of equality, diversity, and human rights and we expect these values to be made clear during the presidential visit to the UK."" The letter to the president was signed by the heads of British conservative think tanks the Bow Group, Bruges Group, Parliament Street and the Freedom Association, as well as the chairman of Republicans Overseas Scotland and a contributor to ThinkScotland. Donald Trump visited his golf resorts in June 2016 They told the president the political and media establishment in London was ""far out of touch"" with the feelings of ordinary people outside the capital, many of whom they said ""strongly support"" his leadership. The letter states: ""Your ancestral homeland of Scotland represents a powerful bond between you and Britain, and given the nature of the climate in London, it is a superior destination. ""As you know, the Royal Estate of Balmoral Castle sits in Scotland's Cairgorms National Park, thus allowing you to make a full state visit as the guest of the Her Majesty the Queen. ""Scotland and the North of England also offer a variety of locations where you would be able to speak directly to ordinary British people and witness the true level of support that exists for you and the special relationship between the US and the UK."" Ben Harris-Quinney, chairman of the Bow Group, said: ""A visit to London by the president is likely to draw major protests, crime and disorder, and we do not wish to see Britain or President Trump embarrassed by this. ""It is important that the people of the United States and its government know there are many in Britain who strongly support the president and the special relationship, and wish for President Trump to be afforded the warmest of welcomes. ""Sadly that will not be the case in London."" Protests against Donald Trump in Edinburgh on his inauguration day However, Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie predicted that any visit to Scotland would be met with ""a level of protest not seen since the Iraq war"". He described the letter as ""sycophantic and grovelling"" and said it should be ""a major embarrassment"" to the Conservatives in Scotland. ""Ruth Davidson should immediately distance herself and her party from these apologists for the dangerous extremism of the Trump presidency,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, Greens and many others will prepare to take to the streets to protest the visit of this odious man."" Mr Trump, whose mother was born on the Isle of Lewis, made frequent visits to Scotland before becoming president. His last trip came during the presidential campaign in June 2016, when he visited his golf resorts. Earlier this year, he spoke of his regret at not being able to visit Scotland since he became president - describing the country as a ""very special place"" with ""very special people"". Mr Trump cancelled a planned trip to London to open the new US embassy in Vauxhall earlier this year, complaining the move to an ""off location"" south of the Thames had been a ""bad deal"". But it is thought his decision may have been driven by a fear of protests in the capital, with whose mayor Sadiq Khan he has clashed over his response to terrorism. The expectation of demonstrations is also believed to have played a part in the postponement of a state visit mooted for 2017.

FA receives Â£900m offer to sell Wembley,"Wembley Stadium cost Â£757m and opened in 2007 Fulham owner Shahid Khan has made an offer, thought to be worth Â£900m, to buy Wembley Stadium from the Football Association. It is understood Khan would pay Â£600m for the stadium and the FA will continue to run the Club Wembley hospitality business, valued at Â£300m. The FA board discussed the approach at a meeting on Thursday. ""We would strive to be the best possible steward for a venue that is iconic,"" said Khan. The owner of NFL side Jacksonville Jaguars added: ""Wembley would return to private ownership and the Football Association would be able to focus on its core mission of developing players. ""I trust many if not most of you are also supporters of the England national teams, so I hope you welcome the potential of this becoming a reality."" Fulham coach Slavisa Jokanovic said at a news conference on Thursday that Khan told him ""about his plan a year and a half ago - he's very ambitious"". BBC Sport understands selling Wembley would allow the FA to make a major investment into football at grassroots level. But, according to theFA's latest financial results,external, it still owes Â£113m to public bodies such as Sport England, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, plus the London Development Agency, which helped pay to build the stadium, which cost Â£757m and opened in 2007. The FAsaid in January,externalit would finish paying for the ground by the end of 2024. The 90,000-seat stadium, which is the largest in the United Kingdom, has been the home for Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur this season while work on their new stadium takes place. Spurs also have a deal with the NFL to stage a minimum of two games a season over 10 years once their new stadium is complete. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the link-up with the NFL was a ""compelling and exciting partnership"". NFL executive vice-president Mark Waller said having stadium options in London has been ""critical to the NFL"". His statement added: ""The potential purchase of Wembley Stadium is a further powerful sign of their commitment to the UK and their vision to help us grow the sport. ""This new relationship would allow for even greater flexibility in scheduling future NFL games in London."" This video can not be played Hodgson would be 'disappointed' if England stopped playing at Wembley It's an offer that doesn't come along all too often. The FA board has a huge decision to make now. The money, I'm told, would be ploughed by the FA into the grassroots game, with a potentially revolutionary effect on provision of coaches, coach educators, 4G pitches and money to revamp facilities. As for the England teams? Well, they will still be able to call Wembley their home. What now for FA Cup semi-finals and final? Or the other major trophy games and play-off finals? Could they stay at Wembley or will other big grounds such as Old Trafford or Emirates Stadium benefit as a result? In short, are we about to witness Wembley's status as the national stadium erode? Greater commercialisation of the stadium is perhaps almost inevitable if it is to become home, in time, to the Jacksonville Jaguars. But for a ground officially known right now as ""Wembley Stadium connected by EE"" that's maybe not such a leap. Shahid Khan bought Fulham in 2013 BBC Radio London's Andy Rowley Khan came to prominence in England when buying Fulham in 2013 from Mohamed Al-Fayed. The 67-year-old was born in Lahore, Pakistan but moved to the United States at the age of 16 to study engineering and went on to become a billionaire as an automobile parts manufacturer. Khan's current net worth is $7.2bn (Â£5.2bn), making him the 217th richest person in the world according to the 2018 Forbes rich list, and the 73rd richest in the United States. Khan bought NFL franchise Jacksonville Jaguars in 2011 and they have had a deal to play ""home"" games at Wembley since 2013. The contract for that is in place until 2020 as the Jaguars have tried to put themselves at the forefront of the NFL links with London. Fulham are pushing for a return to the Premier League, having been relegated to the Championship in 2014 soon after Khan's arrival, while Jacksonville had their best season for a decade, reaching the AFC Championship game before being beaten by New England Patriots. Khan has stated that any prospective deal for Wembley will have no impact on his commitment to Fulham and the proposed redevelopment of the Riverside stand. Khan's son, Tony, has been vice chairman and director of football operations at Fulham since February 2017, having previously advised on football operations.

Alfie dad wants to 'work with hospital',"This video can not be played The family of terminally-ill toddler Alfie Evans wants to work with Alder Hey Children's Hospital The father of seriously ill toddler Alfie Evans says he wants to ""build his relationship"" with the hospital he has been locked in a legal battle with. Tom Evans, who has been fighting to take his 23-month-old son out of Alder Hey Children's Hospital, said he now wanted to be ""left alone"" to do so. The 21-year-old praised staff where Alfie is being treated for their professionalism and ""dignity"". He also thanked supporters Alfie's Army but asked them ""to go home"". The boy's parents have lost every legal challenge to aHigh Court ruling in Februaryallowing the hospital to switch off the toddler's ventilator. Hislife support was withdrawn on Monday. Who is Alfie Evans and what is the row over his treatment? When are parents denied the final say? Hospital slams 'barrage of abuse' Mr Evans delivered a statement outside Alder Hey after a meeting with doctors at the hospital. The message, on behalf of himself and Alfie's mother, Kate James, said: ""Our lives have been turned upside down by the intense focus on Alfie and his situation. ""Our little family along with Alder Hey has become the centre of attention for many people around the world and it has meant we have not been able to live our lives as we would like. ""We are very grateful and we appreciate all the support we have received from around the world, including from our Italian and Polish supporters, who have dedicated their time and support to our incredible fight. ""We would now ask you to return back to your everyday lives and allow myself, Kate and Alder Hey to form a relationship, build a bridge and walk across it."" He said: ""Together we recognise the strains recent events have put upon us all and we now wish for privacy for everyone concerned. ""In Alfie's interests we will work with his treatment team on a plan that provides our boy with the dignity and comfort he needs."" He added there would be no more statements issued or interviews given. The couple had previously expressed strong criticism of medical staff at Alder Hey amid the legal proceedings. Mr Evans had suggested his son was a ""prisoner"" at the hospital, and it is understood the couple had argued Alfie was being deprived of his liberty in a submission to the European Court of Human Rights. He has also cast doubt on doctors' assessment of his son, and made a statement before Thursday's meeting suggesting Alfie had been misdiagnosed. A court hearing on Tuesday was told Mr Evans had, with the help of a legal adviser, lodged a private prosecution of doctors at the hospital, allegedly for murder. Tom Evans and Kate James had hoped Alfie could be taken to the Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome On Wednesday, bosses at the Liverpool hospital defended staff who they said had endured a ""barrage"" of abuse. Merseyside Police is investigating claims patients and staff were intimidated. Hospital trust chair Sir David Henshaw said in an open letter that staff had been the subject of ""unprecedented personal abuse that has been hard to bear"". The latest attempt to allow Alfie to be transported to the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome was rejected by the Court of Appeal on Wednesday. Mr Evans' barrister Paul Diamond said if the court had ruled in the family's favour then Alfie would have been taken to Italy straight after the hearing. Mr Diamond told the court a military air ambulance was on standby ""at the request of the Pope"". On Monday, the Italian government granted Alfie citizenship in the hope he would be given an ""immediate transfer"". But hours later, his ventilator was switched off and the order preventing him from travelling abroad was put in place. Alfie, who has a rare undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition, has been in Alder Hey since December 2016. Alder Hey Hospital has been unavailable for comment.

Agencies aim to bring back rocks from Mars,"Artwork: The mission would allow Martian rock and soil samples to be studied in labs on Earth The US and European space agencies are edging towards a joint mission to bring back rock and soil samples from Mars. Nasa and Esa have signed a letter of intent that could lead to the first ""round trip"" to another planet. The move was announced as a meeting in Berlin, Germany, discussed the science goals and feasibility of a Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. The venture would allow scientists to answer key questions about Martian history. Those questions include whether the Red Planet once hosted life. Scientists at the Mars meeting said that there was only so much they could learn from Martian meteorites and from the various rovers and static landers sent to the Red Planet. The next step had to be a mission that would retrieve samples from the Martian surface, blast them into space in a capsule and land them safely on Earth. Europe's Mars rover takes shape Probe despatched on methane quest Artwork: Nasa is sending a rover to Mars in 2020 that will select and cache samples They could then be subjected to detailed analysis in laboratories, using instruments that are too big and power-hungry to carry as part of a robotic rover's payload and techniques that are difficult to perform from 55 million kilometres away. Making the announcement at theILA Berlin Air and Space Show,external, which is taking place at the same time as the Mars science meeting, Dr Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa's associate administrator for science, said: ""We want to partner with the European Space Agency, but also with other partners."" He said this included potential link-ups with the commercial space sector, adding: ""We will at every point look at what is available in the commercial market. Nasa has no interest whatsoever in developing things that we can buy."" Dave Parker, director of human and robotic exploration at Esa, commented: ""It's very important that every mission we send to Mars discovers something slightly unusual. It's on the basis of that that we tend to plan the next mission or next missions."" Even a small collection of material would help transform our understanding Nasa's 2020 rover mission is expected to help pave the way for Mars Sample Return, by drilling into the surface and caching the cores in containers. But this is intended as a demonstration. A mission design would need to be drawn up in coming years. Previous sample return concepts envisaged a rover storing geological samples from scientifically desirable locations on Mars. The cached samples would then be loaded on to an ascent vehicle which would lift off from the Martian surface. After the cruise back to Earth, a descent module would parachute down through Earth's atmosphere, delivering the first retrieved Martian samples directly into the hands of experts waiting on the ground. Dr Caroline Smith, head of Earth sciences collections at London's Natural History Museum, is attending the Berlin meeting. ""I would say it's a reinvigoration of the process,"" she told BBC News. ""Numerous studies have said the only way it's going to be achieved is through international co-operation. So I think this is a really good message from Nasa and Esa, that we are really going to work together to achieve this - the next frontier of exploration of the Solar System."" She added: ""There's a real buzz in the room. I've spoken to my colleagues and they've said: 'Wow, we're really going to do this'!"" If life existed in the past on the Red Planet, it would likely have been microbial in nature. Scientists want to first know whether conditions were right for life to get started in the past and, if so, whether evidence of fossil microbes remains. They also want to resolve whether there's life on the Red Planet now. ""We'll only be able to conclusively answer those questions by bringing samples back,"" she explained. Thomas Zurbuchen (L) and Dave Parker (R) signed the letter of intent in Berlin The current high levels of cosmic radiation on Mars' surface - a consequence of its thin atmosphere - would create a hostile environment for any organisms. But there are ways life might be able to cling on. The possibility that organisms live in the Martian subsurface today means the mission would be subject to strict quarantine, or ""planetary protection"", measures. ""We have to be careful we're not contaminating Mars with material from our planet, and we want to make sure we're not accidentally contaminating the samples in a way that would interfere with experiments we want to do on Earth,"" explained Dr Smith. She added: ""If there's something hazardous on Mars, we don't want to accidentally release that into Earth's biosphere. ""We are used to handling hazardous materials, whether they be biological or nuclear. There are technologies that exist to be able to handle these in a safe way."" Dr Zurbuchen said the sample return mission could also be crucial for later planned human exploration of Mars, which he said Nasa should start thinking about in the 2030s. ""I can imagine a lot of scenarios where the samples are actually critical for how we explore as humans,"" he said. Korolev crater: TGO's first image since arriving in its science orbit at Mars For example, scientists want to sample dust from both the atmosphere and soil, because it could have an important impact. If future human ""bases"" were to rely on solar cells, atmospheric dust might block out sunlight - hampering electricity generation. It might also cause problems inside the crew habitats. Dr Smith commented: ""If that dust is ubiquitous, and gets everywhere and you've got people living there who are breathing in the dust, is it going to be a potential hazard to astronauts?"" While rocks relevant to the life question are an obvious target for sample return, igneous rocks formed by magma from Mars' interior are also on the wish-list. ""By collecting igneous rocks, we get to understand the geochemical evolution of the planet Mars, we get to know when lavas were being erupted,"" said Caroline Smith. Analysis of these rocks could help provide a much more accurate chronology for the Red Planet, which currently relies in part on values worked out from studies of the Moon. In 2009, Nasa and Esa agreed to collaborate on the Mars Joint Exploration Initiative,external, which would have culminated in the recovery of samples in the 2020s. But in 2011, Nasa cancelled its participation amid a budgetary squeeze. The 2nd International Mars Sample Return Conference,externalis taking place from 25-27 April 2018 in Berlin.

Save the Children suspends government bids,"Former Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth at a displacement camp in Somalia Save the Children has said it will not seek new government money while its handling of sexual harassment allegations is investigated. The charity's chief executive said the move was voluntary and that the accusations made his ""stomach churn"". It receives up to Â£100m a year through the government, Kevin Watkins added. TheCharity Commission began its inquiry into Save the Childrenafter it revealed evidence of ""unsafe behaviour"" towards staff in 2012 and 2015. The charity has been accused of failing to deal with claims of inappropriate behaviour towards female employees by staff including its former chief executive, Justin Forsyth. Mr Watkins told BBC Radio 4's the World at One he was ""heartbroken"" the charity would have to scale back its work. He emphasised that the moratorium would not apply to existing programmes. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said she accepted the organisation's decision. ""I expect every organisation that we work with to have rigorous reporting and complaints mechanisms,"" she said. Earlier in the year Oxfam agreed to stop bidding for government money after claims emerged that it had soughtto cover up allegations of prostitution use by staff delivering aid in Haiti. This video can not be played Kevin Watkins told Radio 4's World at One that he is ""heartbroken"" that work has to be scaled back In February it emerged that Mr Forsyth hadfaced three complaints over his behaviour towards female staff,before leaving the charity. Mr Forsyth said he ""strongly refutes a number of the claims"". Leaked documentsfrom 2015, seen by the BBC, said Save the Children had ""failed"" to adequately deal with allegations against Mr Forsyth. The 2015 report suggested that then chairman Sir Alan Parker's response to these allegations may have been impacted by his friendship with Mr Forsyth. Last week Sir Alan Parker resigned as Save the Children's international chairman. In his resignation letter he wrote: ""There is an urgent and pressing need to rebuild trust and confidence."" ""If we do not, some of the world's poorest and most vulnerable children will suffer."" Writing to Ms Mordaunt Mr Watkins said: ""I want to underscore how seriously we take the sexual harassment cases reported at our headquarters in 2012 and 2015.

Alfie doctors to discuss sending him home,"Alfie Evans was taken off life support on Monday evening The parents of seriously ill toddler Alfie Evans are to meet doctors to discuss taking him home, his father has said. The Court of Appeal upheld a ruling on Wednesday preventing the 23-month-old from travelling abroad after life support was withdrawn. Tom Evans and Kate James wanted their son to be transported to a hospital in Rome for care. Mr Evans said he will meet doctors and ""we now start asking to go home"". Outside Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool, Mr Evans said: ""We got rejected yesterday to go to Italy unfortunately. We could take it further but would that be the right thing to do, would there be more criticism?"" He did not rule out further legal action and said the family has ""appeals to explore"". Who is Alfie Evans and what is the row over his treatment? When are parents denied the final say? Hospital slams 'barrage of abuse' ""So what we do today is we have a meeting with the doctors at Alder Hey and we now start asking to go home,"" he said. Tom Evans and Kate James had hoped Alfie could be taken to the Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome He added: ""Alfie doesn't need intensive care any more. Alfie is lying on the bed with one litre of oxygen going into his lungs and the rest is him. ""Some people say it's a miracle, it's not a miracle, it's a misdiagnosis."" Mr Justice Hayden said on Monday that Alder Hey would discuss the next steps for Alfie with his parents to ""explore"" the options of removing him from intensive care either to a ward, a hospice or his home. The hospital's doctors and independent medical experts agree there is no cure for the boy's rare, undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition. Roger Kiska, a solicitor at the Christian Legal Centre which is part of the legal team supporting Mr Evans, disagrees and told Radio 4's Today programme the legal battle was not over and ""there are other options"". Mr Evans said: ""All I ask for now is for this meeting to be a positive one and I hope to have Alfie, on the terms of mine and Alder Hey, to be home within a day or two"". ""If the meeting doesn't go well today, well then I'll go back to court."" Steven Woolfe, Member of the European Parliament for North West England, is launching a campaign for ""Alfie's Law"" to give parents of terminally-ill children more say in end-of-life hospital care. The campaign claims that, while recognising the dedication of doctors and nurses treating sick children, parents also have ""moral rights"" about the care of their loved ones. He said: ""The cases of Charlie Gard, Ashya King, and now Alfie Evans, show a dangerous trend of public bodies depriving parents and families of the right to make decisions they believe are in the best interests of their children. ""Parents' rights should neither be ignored nor dismissed as irrelevant by hospitals and courts, who believe they know best and have the power, money and resources to overwhelm families who simply want to save their child. ""We demand a change in the law to restore the rights of parents in such decisions."" This video can not be played BBC News went to meet the people calling themselves 'Alfie's Army' The latest attempt to allow Alfie to be transported to the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome was rejected on Wednesday. Lord Justice McFarlane, who led the appeal court panel, said there was no prospect of the challenge succeeding and Alfie was in ""the middle"" of a palliative care plan. Alfie has been cared for at Alder Hey Children's Hospital since December 2016 and has been in a semi-vegetative state for more than a year. The hospital has seen several protests in recent weeks organised by a campaign group calling itself ""Alfie's Army"". On Wednesday, bosses at the hospital defended staff who they said had endured a ""barrage"" of abuse. Merseyside Police is investigating claims patients and staff were intimidated. Chairman of the hospital trust Sir David Henshaw said in an open letter that staff had been the subject of ""unprecedented personal abuse that has been hard to bear"".

Sir Cliff police helped BBC 'too much',"The former head of South Yorkshire Police has said never in his ""wildest dreams"" did he imagine that the BBC would cover the force's inquiry into Sir Cliff Richard in the way it did. David Crompton told the High Court his force had assisted the BBC ""too much"" after sharing the date and time of the search at Sir Cliff's Berkshire home. Sir Cliff is suing the BBC for naming him and broadcasting helicopter images. The BBC says its report of the 2014 inquiry was in the public interest. But Sir Cliff says broadcasting the images of the search of his home was a ""very serious invasion"" of privacy. The 77-year-old, who denied an historical sexual assault allegation, was not arrested or charged as the result of the South Yorkshire Police investigation. Giving evidence on Thursday, Mr Crompton, who was the force's chief constable at the time, told Mr Justice Mann he was expecting ""limited footage"" to be shown of police officers entering Sir Cliff's property, but ""nothing more than that"". He said he thought the helicopter footage was ""disproportionate"". It was his view, he went on, that there was a ""running commentary"" between BBC reporter Dan Johnson and the South Yorkshire Police press officer, Lesley Card - who was at the property during the search. He told Judge Mann he thought this was ""assisting the BBC too much"". ""We told them the time and date of search. This... was too much,"" he added. Representing the BBC, Gavin Millar QC, put it to Mr Crompton that South Yorkshire Police wanted television coverage of the search. ""We were put in a difficult position,"" Mr Crompton replied. ""I considered it to be of paramount importance that we were able to complete an unhindered and untainted investigation and one might say the relationship with the BBC became a shotgun wedding."" David Crompton was Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police at the time of the inquiry Mr Crompton added: ""We should be able to complete the investigation without it being compromised. ""I did not want the TV coverage... this was, in effect, the price to pay. ""Never did I imagine in my wildest dreams the BBC would do what they did. I've not seen coverage like this ever in my police career."" Mr Crompton said he ""fundamentally disagreed"" with the notion that he wanted to show his force pro-actively investigating a prominent suspect. Mr Millar put it to him that in the days following the coverage, he made it in his interest to say the force was blackmailed by the BBC. Mr Crompton disagreed. In 2014 South Yorkshire Police searched Sir Cliff's flat in Sunningdale, Berkshire while investigating an allegation the singer sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985. In June 2016 it was announced he would not face any charges. Sir Cliff has saidthe coverage ""smeared"" his name. He is suing the BBC over the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. The BBC disputes his allegations and says the BBC report on the police inquiry was in the public interest. South Yorkshire Police has settled its own case with Sir Cliff by paying him Â£400,000 and argues that the BBC should pay a share of this because its actions were ""far more causative of the damage suffered"".

Macron sees Trump dropping Iran deal,"This video can not be played Five times Macron ripped up Trump agenda French President Emmanuel Macron has said he may have failed in efforts to persuade Donald Trump to stick to an international nuclear deal with Iran. ""My view is... that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons,"" Mr Macron said at the end of a three-day state visit to the US. Mr Trump has until 12 May to decide on the deal, which aimed to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. He has been a strong critic of the accord, calling it ""insane"". On Wednesday, Mr Macron used similar language to describe frequent shifts in the US position on global issues, including climate change and the Iran agreement. ""It can work in the short term, but it's very insane in the medium to long term,"" he is quoted as telling reporters following a question-and-answer session with students at George Washington University. Macron urges Trump to stick with Iran deal Could the Iran nuclear deal collapse? Analysis: Macron delivers a rebuke to Trump Brigitte Macron on life at the top Mr Macron made changing the US president's mind on Iran a top priority for his visit but ended up admitting there was a ""big risk"" Mr Trump would abandon the deal. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal He agreed with Mr Trump that any deal should include a wider agreement on Iran's influence in the Middle East and should cover the country's nuclear activities longer term, as well as its ballistic missile programme. He said he would work with Mr Trump to build a ""new framework"" in the Middle East - and especially in Syria. His comments came at the end of a state visit in which the two leaders discussed differences on global trade and the environment, including the possibility of the US rejoining the Paris climate accord. Earlier on Wednesday,Mr Macron used a speech to the joint houses of the US Congressto denounce nationalism and isolationism, in what was seen as a thinly veiled attack on Mr Trump's America First agenda. Under the terms of the agreement, reached under Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Iran agreed to limit its controversial nuclear programme in return for an easing of economic sanctions. The deal was struck between Iran and six world powers - the US, UK, France, Germany, China and Russia. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Under the deal, Iran's ability to enrich uranium is severely restricted - the number of centrifuges it can install has been limited and its uranium stockpile is being drastically reduced. The restrictions are set to expire in 2025. Iran also agreed to redesign the nuclear reactor at Arak so that it could not produce weapons-grade plutonium, and to allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency into any site in the country they regarded as suspicious. If any aspect of the deal is violated, the UN sanctions will resume for 10 years. Warning of ""big problems"" if Iran resumed its nuclear programme, Mr Trump on Tuesday said a ""bigger"" deal was possible but it must be built on ""solid"" foundations. ""They should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of the Middle East,"" he said. The US president has long complained that the accord - signed by the US, Iran, Russia, China, France, the UK and Germany - does nothing to halt Iran's support for militant groups in the region such as the Lebanese Shia Muslim group Hezbollah. Trump threatens 'big problems' for Iran Mr Trump is also demanding that signatories to the pact agree permanent restrictions on uranium enrichment. In January, he signed a waiver suspending US sanctions on Iran for 120 days, saying this was the last time he would extend the sanctions relief. The next waiver is due to be signed on 12 May. Echoing Mr Trump's concern over Iran's influence in the region, Gen Joseph Votel, head of the US military's Central Command, described the country as the biggest long-term threat to security in the Middle East. ""[Iran's] very aggressive approach to the region in trying to spread their revolutionary rhetoric and regime focus here is I think very, very evident"", he told the BBC. A senior aide to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tehran would not accept any change to the nuclear deal. Ayatollah Khamenei said Tehran would never agree to restricting its influence in the Middle East ""If Trump exits the deal, Iran will surely pull out of it... Iran will not accept a nuclear deal with no benefits for us,"" said Ali Akbar Velayati. He also ruled out Iran restricting its influence in the Middle East. ""This is our region,"" he said. ""We are in our own region and it is legitimate."" Iranian PresidentHassan Rouhani has said the US and French leaders have no ""right"" to renegotiate a seven-party agreement. Iran would take ""important steps regarding our nuclear technology"", he said on Wednesday, but added that the measures would be ""peaceful"". Could Iran nuclear deal collapse?

FA receives Â£800m offer to sell Wembley,"Wembley Stadium cost Â£757m and opened in 2007 Fulham owner Shahid Khan has made an offer, thought to be worth Â£900m, to buy Wembley Stadium from the Football Association. It is understood Khan would pay Â£600m for the stadium and the FA will continue to run the Club Wembley hospitality business, valued at Â£300m. The FA board discussed the approach at a meeting on Thursday. ""We would strive to be the best possible steward for a venue that is iconic,"" said Khan. The owner of NFL side Jacksonville Jaguars added: ""Wembley would return to private ownership and the Football Association would be able to focus on its core mission of developing players. ""I trust many if not most of you are also supporters of the England national teams, so I hope you welcome the potential of this becoming a reality."" Fulham coach Slavisa Jokanovic said at a news conference on Thursday that Khan told him ""about his plan a year and a half ago - he's very ambitious"". BBC Sport understands selling Wembley would allow the FA to make a major investment into football at grassroots level. But, according to theFA's latest financial results,external, it still owes Â£113m to public bodies such as Sport England, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, plus the London Development Agency, which helped pay to build the stadium, which cost Â£757m and opened in 2007. The FAsaid in January,externalit would finish paying for the ground by the end of 2024. The 90,000-seat stadium, which is the largest in the United Kingdom, has been the home for Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur this season while work on their new stadium takes place. Spurs also have a deal with the NFL to stage a minimum of two games a season over 10 years once their new stadium is complete. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the link-up with the NFL was a ""compelling and exciting partnership"". NFL executive vice-president Mark Waller said having stadium options in London has been ""critical to the NFL"". His statement added: ""The potential purchase of Wembley Stadium is a further powerful sign of their commitment to the UK and their vision to help us grow the sport. ""This new relationship would allow for even greater flexibility in scheduling future NFL games in London."" This video can not be played Hodgson would be 'disappointed' if England stopped playing at Wembley It's an offer that doesn't come along all too often. The FA board has a huge decision to make now. The money, I'm told, would be ploughed by the FA into the grassroots game, with a potentially revolutionary effect on provision of coaches, coach educators, 4G pitches and money to revamp facilities. As for the England teams? Well, they will still be able to call Wembley their home. What now for FA Cup semi-finals and final? Or the other major trophy games and play-off finals? Could they stay at Wembley or will other big grounds such as Old Trafford or Emirates Stadium benefit as a result? In short, are we about to witness Wembley's status as the national stadium erode? Greater commercialisation of the stadium is perhaps almost inevitable if it is to become home, in time, to the Jacksonville Jaguars. But for a ground officially known right now as ""Wembley Stadium connected by EE"" that's maybe not such a leap. Shahid Khan bought Fulham in 2013 BBC Radio London's Andy Rowley Khan came to prominence in England when buying Fulham in 2013 from Mohamed Al-Fayed. The 67-year-old was born in Lahore, Pakistan but moved to the United States at the age of 16 to study engineering and went on to become a billionaire as an automobile parts manufacturer. Khan's current net worth is $7.2bn (Â£5.2bn), making him the 217th richest person in the world according to the 2018 Forbes rich list, and the 73rd richest in the United States. Khan bought NFL franchise Jacksonville Jaguars in 2011 and they have had a deal to play ""home"" games at Wembley since 2013. The contract for that is in place until 2020 as the Jaguars have tried to put themselves at the forefront of the NFL links with London. Fulham are pushing for a return to the Premier League, having been relegated to the Championship in 2014 soon after Khan's arrival, while Jacksonville had their best season for a decade, reaching the AFC Championship game before being beaten by New England Patriots. Khan has stated that any prospective deal for Wembley will have no impact on his commitment to Fulham and the proposed redevelopment of the Riverside stand. Khan's son, Tony, has been vice chairman and director of football operations at Fulham since February 2017, having previously advised on football operations.

Leaked documentsfrom 2015, seen by the BBC, said Save the Children had ""failed"" to adequately deal with allegations against Mr Forsyth.

Agencies aim to return rocks from Mars,"Artwork: The mission would allow Martian rock and soil samples to be studied in labs on Earth The US and European space agencies are edging towards a joint mission to bring back rock and soil samples from Mars. Nasa and Esa have signed a letter of intent that could lead to the first ""round trip"" to another planet. The move was announced as a meeting in Berlin, Germany, discussed the science goals and feasibility of a Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. The venture would allow scientists to answer key questions about Martian history. Those questions include whether the Red Planet once hosted life. Scientists at the Mars meeting said that there was only so much they could learn from Martian meteorites and from the various rovers and static landers sent to the Red Planet. The next step had to be a mission that would retrieve samples from the Martian surface, blast them into space in a capsule and land them safely on Earth. Europe's Mars rover takes shape Probe despatched on methane quest Artwork: Nasa is sending a rover to Mars in 2020 that will select and cache samples They could then be subjected to detailed analysis in laboratories, using instruments that are too big and power-hungry to carry as part of a robotic rover's payload and techniques that are difficult to perform from 55 million kilometres away. Making the announcement at theILA Berlin Air and Space Show,external, which is taking place at the same time as the Mars science meeting, Dr Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa's associate administrator for science, said: ""We want to partner with the European Space Agency, but also with other partners."" He said this included potential link-ups with the commercial space sector, adding: ""We will at every point look at what is available in the commercial market. Nasa has no interest whatsoever in developing things that we can buy."" Dave Parker, director of human and robotic exploration at Esa, commented: ""It's very important that every mission we send to Mars discovers something slightly unusual. It's on the basis of that that we tend to plan the next mission or next missions."" Even a small collection of material would help transform our understanding Nasa's 2020 rover mission is expected to help pave the way for Mars Sample Return, by drilling into the surface and caching the cores in containers. But this is intended as a demonstration. A mission design would need to be drawn up in coming years. Previous sample return concepts envisaged a rover storing geological samples from scientifically desirable locations on Mars. The cached samples would then be loaded on to an ascent vehicle which would lift off from the Martian surface. After the cruise back to Earth, a descent module would parachute down through Earth's atmosphere, delivering the first retrieved Martian samples directly into the hands of experts waiting on the ground. Dr Caroline Smith, head of Earth sciences collections at London's Natural History Museum, is attending the Berlin meeting. ""I would say it's a reinvigoration of the process,"" she told BBC News. ""Numerous studies have said the only way it's going to be achieved is through international co-operation. So I think this is a really good message from Nasa and Esa, that we are really going to work together to achieve this - the next frontier of exploration of the Solar System."" She added: ""There's a real buzz in the room. I've spoken to my colleagues and they've said: 'Wow, we're really going to do this'!"" If life existed in the past on the Red Planet, it would likely have been microbial in nature. Scientists want to first know whether conditions were right for life to get started in the past and, if so, whether evidence of fossil microbes remains. They also want to resolve whether there's life on the Red Planet now. ""We'll only be able to conclusively answer those questions by bringing samples back,"" she explained. Thomas Zurbuchen (L) and Dave Parker (R) signed the letter of intent in Berlin The current high levels of cosmic radiation on Mars' surface - a consequence of its thin atmosphere - would create a hostile environment for any organisms. But there are ways life might be able to cling on. The possibility that organisms live in the Martian subsurface today means the mission would be subject to strict quarantine, or ""planetary protection"", measures. ""We have to be careful we're not contaminating Mars with material from our planet, and we want to make sure we're not accidentally contaminating the samples in a way that would interfere with experiments we want to do on Earth,"" explained Dr Smith. She added: ""If there's something hazardous on Mars, we don't want to accidentally release that into Earth's biosphere. ""We are used to handling hazardous materials, whether they be biological or nuclear. There are technologies that exist to be able to handle these in a safe way."" Dr Zurbuchen said the sample return mission could also be crucial for later planned human exploration of Mars, which he said Nasa should start thinking about in the 2030s. ""I can imagine a lot of scenarios where the samples are actually critical for how we explore as humans,"" he said. Korolev crater: TGO's first image since arriving in its science orbit at Mars For example, scientists want to sample dust from both the atmosphere and soil, because it could have an important impact. If future human ""bases"" were to rely on solar cells, atmospheric dust might block out sunlight - hampering electricity generation. It might also cause problems inside the crew habitats. Dr Smith commented: ""If that dust is ubiquitous, and gets everywhere and you've got people living there who are breathing in the dust, is it going to be a potential hazard to astronauts?"" While rocks relevant to the life question are an obvious target for sample return, igneous rocks formed by magma from Mars' interior are also on the wish-list. ""By collecting igneous rocks, we get to understand the geochemical evolution of the planet Mars, we get to know when lavas were being erupted,"" said Caroline Smith. Analysis of these rocks could help provide a much more accurate chronology for the Red Planet, which currently relies in part on values worked out from studies of the Moon. In 2009, Nasa and Esa agreed to collaborate on the Mars Joint Exploration Initiative,external, which would have culminated in the recovery of samples in the 2020s. But in 2011, Nasa cancelled its participation amid a budgetary squeeze. The 2nd International Mars Sample Return Conference,externalis taking place from 25-27 April 2018 in Berlin.

Trump to visit UK in July,"Theresa May and Donald Trump met in Davos earlier this year US President Donald Trump is to visit the UK on Friday 13 July, after previously cancelling a trip amid claims he would face mass protests. It will not be the full-blown state visit Mr Trump was promised when Prime Minister Theresa May visited the White House in January last year. But an invitation to a state visit still stands, the BBC understands. BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said he understood the president was likely to meet the Queen during the visit. Mr Trump will hold talks with Mrs May, Downing Street said, with further details to be ""set out in due course"". The prime minister said she was ""looking forward to welcoming President Trump to the United Kingdom for a working visit on July 13"". The July date follows the Nato summit in Brussels which the president is expected to attend. Donald Trump scraps UK February visit Trump 'should visit Scotland, not London' Downing Street and the White House hoped to co-ordinate releasing details of the trip, but Mr Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders apparently let slip the information first. UK ambassador Sir Kim Darroch confirmed the date on Twitter, saying he was ""delighted"" that Mr Trump would visit the UK. Will the president fit in a day at his golf course in Scotland? By Jon Sopel, BBC North American editor The White House announcement confirming the date of the president's visit came sooner than Downing Street had anticipated, which means there is still a lot of detail to work out. The centrepiece will be his talks with Theresa May, but most attention is likely to focus on any audience he has with the Queen. I understand they will meet, either at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. She has, after all, met every serving US president during her reign except of Lyndon B Johnson. What will also be fascinating is to see if Mr Trump meets Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. It's also conceivable that he will bolt on an extra day to his trip to visit Turnberry, the championship golf course he owns on the west coast of Scotland. And then there is the likely logistical issue of policing, and how to keep demonstrators at bay. One minister has been quoted as saying Donald Trump won't go anywhere where he can be publicly shouted at. Mr Trump cancelled a planned trip to London to open the new US embassy in Vauxhall earlier this year, complaining the move to an ""off location"" south of the Thames had been a ""bad deal"". But critics said his decision may have been driven by a fear of protests. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted that it was ""fantastic"" news that Mr Trump would ""at last"" be visiting Britain.

Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK's director, said: ""When Donald Trump arrives on these shores, we and thousands of our supporters will very definitely be making our voices heard."" And Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson said the ""scaled-down trip must not be met by scaled-down protests"". Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said on BBC One's Question Time that she would not join protests, but defended the rights of others to do so - saying Mr Trump's ""actions and his attitudes have made him so frightening to so many people in this country"". This video can not be played Donald Trump and Theresa May held hands briefly in Washington Culture Secretary Matt Hancock told the same programme that the US-UK relationship was ""much deeper than any one person"" and ""we have to make sure that we influence the strongest economy on earth"". ""The United States kicked out more Russian diplomats than any other country in response to the Salisbury attack,"" he said. ""They have been strong supporters when we have needed them recently in the face of Russian aggression."" More than 33,000 people on Facebook have already said they will attend a protest organised by left-wing journalist Owen Jones. Six Conservative groups - including the think tanks the Bow Group and the Bruges Group - have written to Mr Trump urging him to focus his visit on his ""ancestral home"" of Scotland, where his mother was born. Ben Harris-Quinney, chairman of the Bow Group, said: ""A visit to London by the president is likely to draw major protests, crime and disorder, and we do not wish to see Britain or President Trump embarrassed by this. ""It is important that the people of the United States and its government know there are many in Britain who strongly support the president and the special relationship, and wish for President Trump to be afforded the warmest of welcomes. ""Sadly that will not be the case in London."" Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit Mr Trump in the White House following his inauguration in January 2017. She conveyed an invitation from the Queen for Mr Trump to come for a state visit - a formal occasion with much pomp and ceremony. Mr Trump accepted the invitation but a date has yet to be set, amid speculation it has been postponed indefinitely. Plans for a working visit to the UK in 2018 were announced when Mr Trump met Mrs May at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said Mrs May would have lots of business to discuss with Mr Trump, from the framework of a future trade deal to his plans for tariffs on steel and aluminium. But he added, after the high-profile visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to Washington DC this week - and with German Chancellor Angela Merkel flying in for a US visit on Thursday - the ""optics"" of such a visit were important and Britain would not want to get left behind.

Kuenssberg: Who knew what?,"The government is a big machine. There is no way that any one person could ever be aware of what every cog and widget is up to at any one point. It's not reasonable to expect them to know about absolutely everything. But it is, however, the expectation that ministers are responsible for what is being done in the public's name, and at the taxpayer's expense. That's why when things go wrong in Westminster and Whitehall, which they of course do from time to time, that the two big questions that are often asked are who knew, and when. Home Office 'knew about Windrush issues' Who are the Windrush generation? Rethink 'cruel' migration policy - Corbyn Windrush cancer patient gets treatment date As the Windrush scandal has unfolded it has been said again and again that the Home Office were not aware of the problem as a pattern where one particular group was being scooped up into the immigration system unfairly, on multiple occasions. Yes, individual cases reared their heads, we know they were raised as far back as 2011. But Amber Rudd repeated to MPs again today she wasn't aware of the issue as being ""systemic"", even though she ""bitterly regrets"" not spotting the pattern. Ministers' defence has been: we simply didn't realise, but we know now it was a big mistake. That defence looks a bit shakier tonight. It's not just that some of the government's own work on immigration policy warned in advance of the rules changing that it could hypothetically hit the wrong people. But we know now that the foreign secretary in 2016, who happens to have been Philip Hammond, was told by ministers in the Caribbean in April of that year about the problem. I'm told it was in the margins of the meeting rather than the subject of a huge ding dong. But shortly after, in May 2016, they also received a letter from the Barbados government about the scale of the concern. This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? The point of diplomacy is to convey messages to governments. So as you might expect, what happened subsequently, I'm told, was that the Foreign Office raised the concern with Number 10 at the time, and also with the Home Office which was in charge of the policy. And of course, guess who was in charge of the Home Office at that moment? One Theresa May. That's the 'when'. What's less clear is the 'what'. We don't know precisely what was said, or how seriously the issues were presented. We don't know if the home secretary at the time herself saw the warning. But we do know that almost two years ago the problems of the Windrush generation were raised, however briefly, at the highest levels of government. In the coming weeks, we might find out what really happened next. That won't exactly provide much of a relief for Amber Rudd, the current incumbent. With Labour calling for her resignation, and a difficult afternoon being questioned by MPs earlier, she has other problems to try to resolve. On one point of fact there is confusion tonight. The ISU, the immigration union, told MPs that there are removals targets for forcing those here illegally out of the country. And it's been suggested in many quarters in recent days that the pressure to remove illegal immigrants and the focus on getting the numbers down has been part of the problem at the Home Office. But neither the home secretary, nor the senior civil servant alongside her, accepted that those targets really exist. So who's right? Tonight, all the Home Office can say is: ""We want immigration enforcement to deport more people who are here illegally and tackle illegal immigration which puts pressure on taxpayer-funded public services and exploits the vulnerable. ""But it's never been Home Office policy to take decisions arbitrarily to meet a target."" Note that does not mean there are no targets, it simply says they don't use them, if they exist, in an arbitrary and unfair way. The home secretary's reputation depends on getting a handle on this mess. One of her cabinet colleagues told me the ""suspicious attitude"" of the Home Office culture had to change. But there is still a tangle of loose ends - right now it's not possible to be sure exactly what is going on.

"'Wolf pack' jailed for sex attack in SpainFive men are convicted of abusing, but not raping, a woman in a case seen as Spain's MeToo moment.28m28 minutes agoEurope","This video can not be played The ""wolf pack"" verdict was met with anger outside court A Spanish court has jailed five men for sexually abusing a young woman during the famous San Fermin bull-running festival but acquitted them of rape. All five were sentenced to nine years in prison for their part in the attack, which they filmed, during the festival in Pamplona in July 2016. The 18-year-old victim's ordeal caused a national outcry, and protests continued outside the court. Both the woman and the defendants say they will appeal against the verdict. ""It's rape, not abuse,"" demonstrators said outside the court. Rallies have been called in Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Alicante and more than a dozen other cities across Spain against the verdict and in support of the victim. The five, in their late 20s and originally from Seville, and the victim, from Madrid, were not present when the judgement was read out after a five-month trial, which was held behind closed doors to protect the woman's identity. 'Wolf pack' gang rape trial angers Spain Under Spanish law, the charge of sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. But senior politicians and human rights groups questioned whether a prolonged sexual assault involving intercourse by five men could be anything but intimidation or rape. The men, who have been in custody since 2016, have also been ordered to pay the woman â¬50,000 ($61,000; Â£43,500) in compensation. Prosecutors had asked for sentences of more than 20 years. However, one judge had argued that the men should have been acquitted of all charges except stealing the victim's phone. Videos of the late-night encounter between the men and the young woman showed how the five men had wandered the streets among other drunken revellers before two of them led her into a basement by the hand. According to a police report, the men - who belonged to a WhatsApp group calledLa manada(wolf pack) - surrounded the woman in a small alcove, removed her clothes and had unprotected sex. A picture of the accused is seen on screen in the courtroom Some of them filmed the sexual act on their phones - there were seven videos, totalling 96 seconds. One of the men posted messages in a WhatsApp group celebrating what they had done and promising to share the recording. According to the police report, the victim maintained a ""passive or neutral"" attitude throughout the scene, keeping her eyes closed at all times. Her phone was then stolen. She was found in a reportedly distraught state by a couple in the street outside the scene of the attack. She told the trial she was still having psychological treatment to deal with trauma. Some of the men were found to be in a video in which they apparently abused another woman, who seemed to be unconscious. By James Badcock, Madrid The ""wolf pack"" case has been Spain's #MeToo over the past two years, with thousands of supporters of the victim uniting under the sloganYo te creo(I believe you). The shocking nature of the group abuse, the youth of the victim and the obnoxious celebratory messages about their ""conquest"" on their WhatsApp chat combined to make the case fertile fodder for black-and-white public opinion. That the two majority verdict judges have chosen to see shades of grey by not interpreting the criminals' acts as violent or intimidatory will fuel indignant criticism from feminist groups. Several leading left-wing politicians have already questioned the verdict. The apparent certainty of an appeal hearing means the debate over whether the law protects women will continue. JosÃ© Ãngel Prenda, 28: considered the leader of the five, wrote a message in the WhatsApp group about the video showing them having sex with the woman. He had been sentenced to two years in prison in 2011 for theft with force Antonio Manuel Guerrero: a Civil Guard police officer, born in 1989, is thought to have recorded six videos. He also admitted to stealing the victim's phone Ãngel Boza, 26: his criminal records include theft with force and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs Alfonso JesÃºs Cabezuelo, 29: a military officer, is thought to have recorded one video JesÃºs Escudero, 27: a hairdresser Supporters of the victim gathered outside the courthouse for the verdict, and were furious when it was read out. Some donned red gloves in protest. Women's rights groups and many politicians reacted angrily, with Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya SÃ¡enz de SantamarÃ­a calling on officials to analyse the verdict so that similar cases could be avoided. UN Women programme director MarÃ­a Noel Vaeza said this was a ""lost opportunity"", El PaÃ­s newspaper reports (in Spanish),,externalurging an end to the ""social impunity [in cases of] rape"". Dozens of people gathered outside the court ahead of the verdict, some wearing red gloves in protest Altamira Gonzalo, vice-president of Themis, a Spanish organisation of women jurists, told Efe news agency: ""It should have been a courageous sentence. The courts can't be so distant from society"". Socialist party leader Pedro Sanchez tweeted his outrage (in Spanish),external: ""If what the 'wolfpack' did wasn't group violence against a defenceless woman, then what do we understand by rape?"" The victim's lawyer said he was ""disappointed"" while lawyers for the five men said they would appeal, calling the verdict ""unfair"".

"'Freak wave' washed girl, 5, out to sea","Police and the coastguard were called to Durdle Door on 18 April after Rose Carter was swept out to sea A five-year-old girl was killed when a ""freak wave"" washed her out to sea as she walked along the beach, an inquest has heard. Rose Carter, from Salisbury, was walking with her mother and sister at Durdle Door in Dorset on 18 April when she was swept into the water. ""Frantic efforts"" by her mother and a passer-by to save her failed, Bournemouth Coroner's Court was told. The inquest was opened and adjourned until 3 October. Rose was pulled from the sea near Lulworth by a nearby Ministry of Defence vessel but was later pronounced dead at Dorset County Hospital. Her mother was pulled to safety from the water by a member of the public. Coroner's officer Andy Lord told the inquest the cause of Rose's death was so far ""unascertained pending further investigation"". He said: ""Rose was walking along the beach at Durdle Door with her mother and sister at about 11:30 BST when a sudden freak wave washed her into the sea.""

'My son was raped on a play date',"The number of cases of peer-on-peer abuse in schools reported to a support charity has doubled in four years. And the NSPCC, which has also seen a rise, says such cases are occurring ""thousands of times a year"". Mosac, which helps parents and carers of abused children, says calls have risen from 27 in 2013 to 58 in 2017. A mother who says her son was raped by a boy from school during a play date told Victoria Derbyshire even primary-age children were capable of sex abuse. She said she wanted to make people aware and called for policy advice to help schools and social services cope. Sarah (not her real name) had invited the boy, from her son's primary school, to their home when he suggested the boys ""do something special with Lego"" in her son's bedroom. She said her son later told her he wedged a chair against the door handle and drew the curtains. She said the boy, who was younger than her son, repeatedly asked to see her son's genitals, saying other boys always showed him theirs, and kept trying to pull his trousers and underpants down. He allegedly said he would not be his friend if he didn't play with him, saying this was how he played with other boys. Sarah said he then raped her son. The boy told her son not to tell his parents, saying he would be angry with him if he did. The abuse emerged at bedtime when Sarah's son explained why he had become so upset when the boy left - because someone had been hurting him. When she asked whether the boy had done anything like this before, he replied that every time he had been to the boy's house, he had said the same things and attempted to rape him. This happened on four separate visits, starting when he was eight. Sarah said sexual abuse among young children was more common than people realised. She had not realised that some primary school-age children were physically capable of raping their peers. Mosac, which supports non-abusive parents and carers of children who have been sexually abused, says it believes the scale of the problem is far greater. ""It's seismic. We should be really really concerned as a society,"" the charity's chief executive, Fiona Sim, said. ""Why on earth is this happening? What measures can we put in place? We must address this problem."" Of the 58 calls it received last year about child-on-child abuse, 19 related to children of primary-school age and 13 were of secondary-school age. Twenty-six were unknown. The cases related to abuse both in and outside of the school environment. The NSPCC has also said it has noticed an increase in calls about peer-on-peer sexual abuse - and many of the callers were now younger. It is lobbying the government to launch a study to assess the scale of sexual abuse of children, to include this kind of abuse. Jon Brown from the charity, said society had to wake up to the fact that this was happening across the UK thousands of times each year. ""Tackling this problem demands all children are introduced to key learning concepts, such as boundaries and consent, from primary school onwards,"" he said. After Sarah's son told her what had happened she called the NSPCC support line, which advised her to contact the school's safeguarding officer and to call the police. The mother said the head teacher was stunned and sympathetic about why she did not want to send her son back to school. Sarah says she believed the school subsequently introduced safeguarding measures, especially around the perpetrator, and that local child-protection services were also contacted. Last December the Department for Education released interim guidance to give schools a framework to form individual policies on sexual violence and harassment in schools and colleges. But Sarah says the advice did not properly address primary schools - where the children are below the age of criminal responsibility and need to be treated differently. She is also concerned about what measures are taken to safeguard children interacting with alleged perpetrators at after-school clubs, play dates, parties or locally run groups and clubs. And Mosac says professionals who don't know what to do or where to get help have also been in touch. A specialist police officer spoke to their son but advised that because the other boy was under the age of criminal responsibility - 10 - no charges would be brought. The case was referred to social services and her son was awarded compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority after his case was reviewed. Sarah says her son has suffered. ""He's not the same boy. He's still regularly prone to low moods,"" she said. ""He's had two rounds of counselling, which has helped. Thankfully he's now made new friends - but he's the one who has had to start afresh."" Sarah said society needed to talk about this kind of abuse. ""Our society's approach to this is hiding away - how do we/should we react? I shouldn't be ashamed, yet it is shameful and embarrassing to talk about - I feel to blame despite having done nothing wrong."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Pupils and parents rightly expect schools to be safe places where children are protected from all kinds of abuse. That's why we are clear that all schools must have a child protection policy in place that addresses abuse between pupils. ""We know that these cases can be incredibly complex and sensitive and following feedback from parents and schools, we recently published updated advice to help schools prevent and respond to incidents of sexual violence and sexual harassment between children.""

'Alcohol' pilots cleared after blunder,"Captain Perreault and First Officer Syed were arrested shortly before taking off from Glasgow airport Two pilots accused of planning to fly a passenger jet from Scotland to Canada while under the influence of alcohol have been cleared after key evidence was destroyed by prison staff. Jean-Francois Perreault, 41, and Imran Zafar Syed, 39, were arrested in 2016, minutes before a flight from Glasgow to Toronto was due to take off. Blood tests were said to have found them above the legal alcohol limit. But the case collapsed when prison staff destroyed some of the samples. The case was due to call at Paisley Sheriff Court on Thursday, but prosecutors offered no evidence against the men and the hearing was cancelled. They will now be offered reinstatement by their airline and the chance to fly again once refresher training has been completed. The Canadian pair were due to fly an Air Transat plane with 250 passengers on board when they were arrested at Glasgow Airport on 18 July 2016. They were taken to Helen Street Police Station in Glasgow, where they were interviewed and blood samples were taken. The charge stated that Captain Perreault had 32 milligrams of alcohol in 100ml of blood, while First Officer Syed had 49 milligrams in 100ml of blood. The blood alcohol limit for flying is set at 20 milligrams. The pilots were due to take control of this Air Transat Airbus A310 They were also accused of acting in a threatening manner and fighting at the Hilton Hotel in the city on the same day. At the police station each blood sample was split in two - one of each for the prosecution and one for each pilot. The pilots' samples were placed within their property, as they were in custody, and remained there during their initial court appearance, during which they were remanded in custody. When the pilots arrived at Low Moss Prison in East Dunbartonshire, prison guard Paul Scoular said he thought the samples would be worthless evidentially and, along with  prison nurse Mara Fraser, destroyed them. Mr Scoular, 46, gave evidence at a hearing in September, which can only be reported now the case has concluded. He said he was ""unsure"" what to do as he had ""no previous experience of receiving a blood sample in to custody"" during his 20-year career working at Scottish jails  - and he said no official protocol existed. Mr Scoular said: ""My understanding was they should've been stored and kept in a cooled environment. ""I asked Mara Fraser whether the samples would still have integrity or whether there may have been a deterioration due to them not being stored in a chilled environment. ""I spoke to Mr Syed and Mr Perreault and raised my concerns. I wasn't sure if it was worth retaining the sample."" He did not seek the advice of the police, prosecutors, or managers -  and told the pilots he was going to destroy them He added: ""There was no facility in the prison for storing them. They both gave me a verbal consent to destroy it."" Prison nurse Mara Fraser, 54, said in evidence: ""I informed him [Paul Scoular] I'd have to find out what to do with them. ""I put them in to a locked drawer in the nurses' office. None of the nurses knew what to do. ""I didn't know the protocol. I later found out the patients were liberated so I destroyed them [the samples] - I put them in to a sharps bin."" Lawyers for the pilots argued their right to a fair trial was compromised because there was now no opportunity for them to have the samples independently tested. The pilots were arrested under section 93 of the Act. It focuses on the limit of any alcohol consumption and says it is an offence to perform or prepare to perform certain aviation-related functions with more than a prescribed level of alcohol in the body. That limit is set at 20 milligrams of alcohol per 100 ml of blood for those activities carried out by aircrew and air traffic controllers. In the case of breath, nine micrograms of alcohol in 100 ml are allowed and in urine the limit is 27 milligrams of alcohol in 100 ml. The drink-drive limit in Scotland is more than twice the blood limit, which currently stands at 50micrograms in 100ml and reflects the speed of reaction needed by aircrew and air traffic controllers to respond to potential emergency situations. Aviation functions can be defined as acting as a pilot during a flight, acting as navigator of an aircraft or as a flight radio-telephony operator during a flight, as well as acting as a member of the cabin crew. Anyone convicted of committing an offence under the act can face up to two years in prison or a fine or both. A Crown Office spokesman said: ""It is the duty of the Crown to keep cases under review. ""After full and careful consideration of the facts and circumstances, including the recent decision of the Court of Appeal, Crown Counsel instructed there should be no further proceedings at this time. ""We are working with Police Scotland to ensure there are proper processes and guidance in place covering the retention and storage of samples when an accused person is remanded in custody."" Mr Perreault, of Ontario and Mr Syed of Toronto had denied all the charges against them. Both men were suspended by their employer Air Transat following their arrest but will now be reinstated and offered the chance to fly again. An Air Transat spokesman said: ""We will be meeting with them in the next few days to plan their reinstatement since there is no charge against them and we have no evidence that they have broken any law nor our internal rules ""They will need to undergo retraining and requalification as per applicable legislation, and we will put in place measures to ensure that their behaviour is exemplary."" This video can not be played Justin Ryan and Colin McAllister were due to travel on the flight which was held up Glasgow-based TV presenters and interior designers, Colin McAllister and Justin Ryan, were due to be on the flight to Canada. They explained that passengers had been told the plane could not take off due to ""operational reasons"". Mr Ryan, who along with Mr McAllister presented a TV show in Canada, said it was a ""real hassle"" that their flight had been delayed ""first by a couple of hours, then by 21 hours, and then cancelled"". The flight eventually lifted off at 10:30 the following day and passengers received compensation from the airline.

Facebook accused of bullying by MPs,"Mr Schroepfer answered questions from MPs about political advertising MPs have urged Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to speak to them after evidence given by his chief technology officer was deemed unsatisfactory. A parliamentary committee said Mr Schroepfer had failed to fully answer 40 points put to him as part of an inquiry into fake news. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee's chairman said a formal summons to Mr Zuckerberg could follow. Mr Schroepfer has promised to address the MPs' unresolved queries. ""Mark Zuckerberg's right-hand man, whom we were assured could represent his views, today failed to answer many specific and detailed questions about Facebook's business practices,"" said committee chair Damian Collins. ""We will be asking him to respond in writing to the committee on these points; however, we are mindful that it took a global reputational crisis and three months for the company to follow up on questions we put to them in Washington DC on 8 February."" He added that if Mr Zuckerberg did not respond positively, the committee would issue a ""formal summons for him to appear when he is next in the UK"". ""There are over 40 million Facebook users in the UK and they deserve to hear answers from Mark Zuckerberg about the company he created and whether it is able to keep its users' data safe."" During testimony from chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer, MPs accused Facebook of ""bullying"" the Guardian newspaper when it informed the company about a major data breach. Mr Schroepfer was asked why Facebook had threatened to sue the newspaper over its story about the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. He was also asked why it did not immediately inform users that their data had been used without consent. ""It was a mistake that we didn't inform people at the time,"" he said. On the issue of bullying, he said: ""I am sorry that journalists think we are preventing them getting the truth out."" Facebook to vet UK ads for 2019 vote Facebook sales soar 'despite challenges' Was Facebook data's value 'literally nothing'? Facebook threw us under bus, says data firm There were a series of questions put to Mr Schroepfer to which he replied: ""I don't know."" He admitted that the company had not known until recently that a current Facebook employee had been the business partner of Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge academic who designed the app that harvested user data on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. He also revealed that no-one at Facebook had read the terms and conditions that Dr Kogan had put on the app he had designed, which went on to harvest information from millions of users. At one point, MPs voiced their frustration with his replies. ""You are the chief technology officer, why don't you know?"" he was asked. Mr Schroepfer was also grilled on the wider issue of political advertising. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee's chairman Damian Collins accused Facebook of having tools on its platform that ""work for the advertiser more than they work for the consumer"". Mr Zuckerberg testified before US politicians about the data-grabbing scandal Mr Schroepfer promised to make political advertising far more transparent in the future but admitted that there was currently no way for people to opt out of it entirely. ""You can mute an ad from a specific advertiser, and there are a set of controls of your basic interests and preferences that you can change or remove."" ""That puts a lot of work on the user,"" replied Mr Collins. His questions to Mr Schroepfer were tough from the outset. ""What is the next car you will buy, what is the square footage of your house?"" asked Mr Collins in his opening question. ""I don't know,"" replied Mr Schroepfer. ""But these are things that Facebook knows about us, isn't it?"" pressed Mr Collins. Mr Schroepfer said he thought it ""unlikely"" that Facebook had that level of data about his life. ""It knows I like coffee and there are certain things that I am interested in like technology, travel and cats,"" he said. Mr Collins asked whether the Internet Research Agency, a Russian-based troll farm that churned out fake news during the US presidential campaign, had used Facebook's targeting tools. ""I don't know specifically,"" said Mr Schroepfer. ""It is a terrible idea that a nation state is using our product to interfere in a democratic election by masquerading as citizens of the US. We were slow to understand the impact of this,"" he said. MPs had wanted Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to appear before them, but he declined.

"British-Iranian academic 'arrested as spy'The Foreign Office says it is ""urgently looking into"" Iranian news reports of Abbas Edalat's arrest.1han hour agoUK","Abbas Edalat was reportedly detained on 15 April An Iranian-British academic detained in Iran was arrested for spying, according to Iranian news agencies, quoting an ""unidentified informed source"". Abbas Edalat, a professor at London's Imperial College, was reportedly detained on 15 April while attending an academic workshop in Tehran. The Foreign Office says it is ""urgently looking into"" reports of his arrest. Imperial College said it was ""understandably concerned"" for Prof Edalat's welfare. According to the agencies the source described Prof Edalat as part of a ""network"" of British spies whose members have been identified and arrested. So far the Foreign Office has not commented on the spying allegations. But the Center for Human Rights in Iran  - which first highlighted Prof Edalat's arrest  - condemned what it called Iran's ""continued arbitrary arrests of dual nationals without transparency and lack of due process"". Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Johnson criticised over jailed mother The group says he was detained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. BBC Persian TV correspondent Kasra Naji said it was ""ironic"" that Prof Edalat, who regularly travelled to Iran and was a regular commentator on Iranian state media, had been a founder of an anti-war protest group that opposed sanctions. ""The arrest of Professor Edalat indicates that talks between Iran and Britain to sort out a host of outstanding issues may have hit a dead-end,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

Italian men charged over Anfield violence,"Sean Cox remains in a critical condition at Walton Neurological Centre Two Italian men have been charged over violence before Liverpool's Champions League semi-final against Roma in which a man was left seriously injured. Filippo Lombardi, 20, has been charged with violent disorder and wounding/inflicting grievous bodily harm and Daniele Sciusco, 29, is charged with violent disorder. They have appeared in court and were remanded in custody until 24 May. Sean Cox, 53, described as ""amazing"", remains in a critical condition. Neither Mr Lombardi nor Mr Sciusco entered a plea at South Sefton Magistrates' Court and they will next appear at Liverpool Crown Court. Mr Cox, from Dunboyne, County Meath in the Irish Republic, suffered head injuries outside The Albert pub in Walton Breck Road, next to Anfield stadium, shortly before kick-off on Tuesday. Eyewitnesses reported seeing a group of Roma fans descend on the road outside Anfield where Liverpool supporters had gathered. Sean Cox suffered serious injuries close to Anfield stadium on Tuesday evening Mr Cox's family said he is the ""most amazing and wonderful"" husband, dad, friend, son, uncle and brother. ""We hope Sean makes a full recovery from the injuries he sustained and that we will all be back together soon as a family in Ireland spending precious time together,"" they said. He is being treated at Walton Neurological Centre in Liverpool. Edoardo Ranalli, 28, from Rome, pleaded guilty at South Sefton Magistrates' Court earlier to throwing a missile onto a football playing area. He admitted throwing coins and was fined Â£300 and ordered to pay a Â£30 statutory surcharge and Â£85 towards prosecution costs.

Lionel Messi scores trademark victory,"A European court has ruled that Lionel Messi, the world's top earning footballer, can trademark his own name. The Barcelona and Argentina striker fought a seven-year fight to be able to use his name on sports goods. His original application was challenged by the Spanish cycling brand, Massi, which argued that the names were too similar and would cause confusion. But the EU's General Court ruled that the footballer was too well known for confusion to arise. The ruling comes days after France Football magazine reported Mr Messi had overtaken Cristiano Ronaldo as the highest earner in football, with an income of â¬126m (Â£108m). Mr Ronaldo is making â¬94m, the magazine said. Mr Messi's application to trademark his name was made to the European Union Office for Intellectual Property (EUIPO) in 2011. It ruled against the footballer, saying the names were similar, because their dominant elements, ""consisting of the terms 'Massi' and 'Messi', are almost identical visually and phonetically"". EUIPO said that only some people would be aware the two were different. But the General Court, the EU's second highest court, disagreed. It said on Thursday: ""The football player's fame counteracts the visual and phonetic similarities"" with Massi. ""Mr Messi is, in fact, a well-known public figure who can be seen on television and who is regularly discussed on television or on the radio,"" the court said. Widely considered one of the world's greatest soccer players, Mr Messi, 30, scored his 600th professional goal last month and is the all-time highest scorer for both Barcelona and Argentina's national team.

But the Center for Human Rights in Iran  - which first highlighted Prof Edalat's arrest  - condemned what it called Iran's ""continued arbitrary arrests of dual nationals without transparency and lack of due process"". Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Johnson criticised over jailed mother The group says he was detained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. BBC Persian TV correspondent Kasra Naji said it was ""ironic"" that Prof Edalat, who regularly travelled to Iran and was a regular commentator on Iranian state media, had been a founder of an anti-war protest group that opposed sanctions. ""The arrest of Professor Edalat indicates that talks between Iran and Britain to sort out a host of outstanding issues may have hit a dead-end,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

There are nearly 30 dual nationals in jail in Iran - among them several dual British-Iranian nationals.

Waterstones sold to US hedge fund,"Book chain Waterstones has been bought by activist investment firm Elliott Advisors for an undisclosed amount. James Daunt, the chain's chief executive since 2011, will remain in the post under the new ownership, along with his key management team. Mr Daunt said the sale should mean the chain could grow a lot faster. Waterstones has 283 bookshops and 3,000 staff in the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium, and sales of more than Â£400m a year. Lynwood Investments, which has been the controlling shareholder in Waterstones since 2011, will keep a minority stake. Lynwood boss, Marina Groenberg, said she was ""very proud that the business has been restored to profitability and good health during our ownership and thank James Daunt and the wider management team for delivering a successful turnaround"". Hedge fund Elliott has about Â£35bn of funds under management worldwide. It has earned a reputation over 40 years as a no-holds-barred activist investor. The firm famously pursued Argentine debt for more than a decade, seizing one of the country's naval ships while it was docked in Ghana and prompting the country to default. More recentlyit bought a 6% stake in Whitbread. Elliott wanted Whitbread to split its coffee chain from its hotel business to improve shareholder value, and this week Whitbread announced plans to do just that. Whitbread to spin off Costa chain The hedge fund not afraid of a fight However, Mr Daunt told the BBC that Elliott was buying Waterstones as an investment which would grow, not in order to force through change. He said he expected Elliott to ""see us grow and ultimately sell us for a nice profit - that's what private equity people do"". Mr Daunt said Waterstones was opening more shops at the moment, because the retail downturn was leaving empty space in desirable locations which the book chain could snap up. Normally Waterstones aims to open about 10 shops a year. However, investment from Elliott combined with greater availability of store space meant he expected the chain to open ""a lot more now"". 1982 - Founded by Tim Waterstone 1989 - Bought by WH Smith 1998 - Bought by HMV 2006 - Waterstones buys rival bookshop chain Ottakars July 2011 - Bought by Alexander Mamut's AN&N (subsequently renamed Lynwood Investments). James Daunt is appointed chief executive.

The shift to online and the impact of rivals like Amazon meant they had been operating in a part of the market under ""significant pressure"". ""In the last few years they've managed to turn around the business through the good work that James Daunt has put into it,"" he said. Changes included making a store visit into more of an ""experience"" by opening coffee bars and inviting authors to give readings. Mr Lim said Waterstones had attracted a buyer because the chain had ""come out the other end much leaner and more flexible"" and was now a profitable business.

"FA receives Â£800m offer to sell WembleyThe Football Association receives an offer to sell Wembley Stadium, in a deal understood to be worth Â£800m.1m2 minutes agoBBC SportComments","Wembley Stadium cost Â£757m and opened in 2007 Fulham owner Shahid Khan has made an offer, thought to be worth Â£900m, to buy Wembley Stadium from the Football Association. It is understood Khan would pay Â£600m for the stadium and the FA will continue to run the Club Wembley hospitality business, valued at Â£300m. The FA board discussed the approach at a meeting on Thursday. ""We would strive to be the best possible steward for a venue that is iconic,"" said Khan. The owner of NFL side Jacksonville Jaguars added: ""Wembley would return to private ownership and the Football Association would be able to focus on its core mission of developing players. ""I trust many if not most of you are also supporters of the England national teams, so I hope you welcome the potential of this becoming a reality."" Fulham coach Slavisa Jokanovic said at a news conference on Thursday that Khan told him ""about his plan a year and a half ago - he's very ambitious"". BBC Sport understands selling Wembley would allow the FA to make a major investment into football at grassroots level. But, according to theFA's latest financial results,external, it still owes Â£113m to public bodies such as Sport England, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, plus the London Development Agency, which helped pay to build the stadium, which cost Â£757m and opened in 2007. The FAsaid in January,externalit would finish paying for the ground by the end of 2024. The 90,000-seat stadium, which is the largest in the United Kingdom, has been the home for Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur this season while work on their new stadium takes place. Spurs also have a deal with the NFL to stage a minimum of two games a season over 10 years once their new stadium is complete. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the link-up with the NFL was a ""compelling and exciting partnership"". NFL executive vice-president Mark Waller said having stadium options in London has been ""critical to the NFL"". His statement added: ""The potential purchase of Wembley Stadium is a further powerful sign of their commitment to the UK and their vision to help us grow the sport. ""This new relationship would allow for even greater flexibility in scheduling future NFL games in London."" This video can not be played Hodgson would be 'disappointed' if England stopped playing at Wembley It's an offer that doesn't come along all too often. The FA board has a huge decision to make now. The money, I'm told, would be ploughed by the FA into the grassroots game, with a potentially revolutionary effect on provision of coaches, coach educators, 4G pitches and money to revamp facilities. As for the England teams? Well, they will still be able to call Wembley their home. What now for FA Cup semi-finals and final? Or the other major trophy games and play-off finals? Could they stay at Wembley or will other big grounds such as Old Trafford or Emirates Stadium benefit as a result? In short, are we about to witness Wembley's status as the national stadium erode? Greater commercialisation of the stadium is perhaps almost inevitable if it is to become home, in time, to the Jacksonville Jaguars. But for a ground officially known right now as ""Wembley Stadium connected by EE"" that's maybe not such a leap. Shahid Khan bought Fulham in 2013 BBC Radio London's Andy Rowley Khan came to prominence in England when buying Fulham in 2013 from Mohamed Al-Fayed. The 67-year-old was born in Lahore, Pakistan but moved to the United States at the age of 16 to study engineering and went on to become a billionaire as an automobile parts manufacturer. Khan's current net worth is $7.2bn (Â£5.2bn), making him the 217th richest person in the world according to the 2018 Forbes rich list, and the 73rd richest in the United States. Khan bought NFL franchise Jacksonville Jaguars in 2011 and they have had a deal to play ""home"" games at Wembley since 2013. The contract for that is in place until 2020 as the Jaguars have tried to put themselves at the forefront of the NFL links with London. Fulham are pushing for a return to the Premier League, having been relegated to the Championship in 2014 soon after Khan's arrival, while Jacksonville had their best season for a decade, reaching the AFC Championship game before being beaten by New England Patriots. Khan has stated that any prospective deal for Wembley will have no impact on his commitment to Fulham and the proposed redevelopment of the Riverside stand. Khan's son, Tony, has been vice chairman and director of football operations at Fulham since February 2017, having previously advised on football operations.

Thousands more children are home-schooledMental health and avoiding exclusion are among reasons given for removing children from classrooms.13h13 hours agoEngland,"This video can not be played Oliver Wood, 15, is one of thousands of children being taught outside of a school The number of children being homeschooled has risen by about 40% over three years, the BBC has found. Across the UK 48,000 children were being home-educated in 2016-17, up from about 34,000 in 2014-15. Mental health issues and avoiding exclusion are two reasons parents gave for removing children from classrooms. The government will publish new guidance on the ""rights and responsibilities on home education"" but councils want more monitoring powers. They are concerned about the quality of the education homeschooled children receive as well as ""safeguarding"" issues, such as the ability to properly protect children from abuse or maltreatment. Dr Carrie Herbert, the founder of a charity for children outside mainstream education, said the rise in homeschooling suggested ""something quite tragic about the state of the education system"". She said she was concerned some parents might also feelpressured into home-schooling their childrento avoid exclusion or prosecution over poor attendance. ""I'm not sure it's very useful anymore to put 30 children in one classroom with an adult all doing the same thing in the same way at the same time,"" said Dr Herbert, of The Red Balloon charity. ""We should really be thinking more 21st century and outside the box about this and teaching online in real time can help do this."" Oliver Wood is taught at home in Thetford by Laura Saggers Oliver Wood, from Thetford in Norfolk, was severely bullied at his former school before becoming a pupil of Red Balloon. The 15-year-old has autism and suffers from anxiety. ""Every school we were offered was looking at him like a problem to solve, rather than a person they could work with,"" said his mother, Sophie. Oliver hopes to take four GCSEs next June. Red Balloon has anonline school,externalthat follows a ""normal"" school day as much as possible. Its curriculum is tailored to suit the child's interests, with the aim of getting them back into the habit of learning, socialising with others and for some, returning to school. The charity has 93 pupils and has had to close its books until it can afford to hire more teachers. The BBC contacted councils in England, Wales and Scotland and the Northern Ireland Department of Education for figures on homeschooling. Of the 177 authorities that were able to provide data for all three years, 164 reported an increase. Only 11 with figures for all three years had fewer homeschooled children in 2016-17 than in 2014-15. While they make up just 0.5% of the school age population for England and Wales, the large rise has prompted calls from councils and education bodies for more statutory monitoring powers of homeschooled children. Companies pledge to cut plastic pollution Drugs used by two in five students Home Office had migrant removal targets There is no legal obligation for children to attend school but the law says they must receive an education. They can be taught by parents or private tutors and the guidance from both the English and Welsh education departments is that it must be a ""suitable education"". The Association of Directors of Children's Services (ADCS) in England wants parents and carers who home-educate to be obliged to register with their local authority and for inspectors to be able to take action if they find a problem. Councils should have resources to ensure homeschooled children receive ""a good standard of education, delivered in a suitable learning environment and that they are safe,"" theADCS said in a report,externalin December 2017. Safety of pupils was also raised in astudy by Norfolk County Council,external. Its children's services reported an ""unprecedented year-on-year rise"" in home-schooling with 1,309 (1.1%) of its school-aged pupils being home taught during the 2016-17 academic year. ""Given that children by the nature of being home-educated can be essentially 'invisible', an inability to make timely and appropriate contact with these families has an inherent risk attached,"" they said. The Isle of Wight has the highest proportion of home-educated pupils, almost one in 50. Criticisms by Ofsted over the island'shigh proportion of ""inadequate"" schoolsmay have had an impact, the council said, adding it was tackling ""lower educational standards"". A spokeswoman said it had a ""good relationship"" with many families contacting it ""directly when they are thinking of home-educating"" as another possible explanation for the figures. In Wales just over 1,800 out of about 430,000 children, about 0.4%, were homeschooled in 2016-17. In Scotland, just 0.1% of children are home-educated, 969 in total. The department of education in Northern Ireland saw just 293 pupils being home educated out of a possible 343,082, representing less than 0.1% of the school-aged population in 2017. Why are parents choosing to educate children at home? Many authorities could not provide reasons why more parents appeared to be choosing homeschooling. Of those that did, the reasons included: Devon: Most parents who offered a reason for homeschooling blamed ""dissatisfaction with the school environment"" East Sussex: Lack of school choice, unmet special educational needs and the ""rigour and limits"" of the current school curriculum Gateshead: Parents felt some pressure from school to remove their children especially if the young person had poor attendance Cambridgeshire: The council said it had increased support for the home-educated community, including extending ""borrowing rights"" at libraries Darlington: Local authority staff are ""currently working with the police and health to ensure the safeguarding of home educated children and this may have contributed to the rise in numbers identified"" In December Ofsted's chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, found overseeing the growing number of home-educated children was ""becoming a challenge for local authorities."" The education watchdog also observed the numbers of children with special educational needs or disabilities guided towards home-education ""was typically high"". Ms Spielman said it was ""unacceptable"" that parents reported being asked to keep their children at home because school leaders said they could not meet their children's needs. Abill,externalseeking more powers for local authorities to assess children receiving home education has gone through a second reading in the House of Lords. Speaking in parliament,external, education minister Lord Agnew said many parents home-educate for ""positive reasons"" and it should be allowed to continue ""with a minimum of fuss and bureaucracy"". ""There is a need to ensure that, where there is genuine cause for concern about a child, local authorities are clear about the powers open to them,"" he said. The Department for Education (DfE), which covers England, and the Welsh government will both consult on ways to improve home-education guidance for parents and councils. A spokesman for the DfE said this would ensure local authorities ""are clear on the action âthey can take where these responsibilities are not being metâ"". A spokesman for the Welsh government said: ""We recognise that we are currently unable to provide reliable figures on how many children are educated at home and that is one of the reasons why we will be consulting on a database as well as statutory guidance for elective home education.""

"Trump to drop Iran deal, Macron says","This video can not be played Five times Macron ripped up Trump agenda French President Emmanuel Macron has said he may have failed in efforts to persuade Donald Trump to stick to an international nuclear deal with Iran. ""My view is... that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons,"" Mr Macron said at the end of a three-day state visit to the US. Mr Trump has until 12 May to decide on the deal, which aimed to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. He has been a strong critic of the accord, calling it ""insane"". On Wednesday, Mr Macron used similar language to describe frequent shifts in the US position on global issues, including climate change and the Iran agreement. ""It can work in the short term, but it's very insane in the medium to long term,"" he is quoted as telling reporters following a question-and-answer session with students at George Washington University. Macron urges Trump to stick with Iran deal Could the Iran nuclear deal collapse? Analysis: Macron delivers a rebuke to Trump Brigitte Macron on life at the top Mr Macron made changing the US president's mind on Iran a top priority for his visit but ended up admitting there was a ""big risk"" Mr Trump would abandon the deal. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal He agreed with Mr Trump that any deal should include a wider agreement on Iran's influence in the Middle East and should cover the country's nuclear activities longer term, as well as its ballistic missile programme. He said he would work with Mr Trump to build a ""new framework"" in the Middle East - and especially in Syria. His comments came at the end of a state visit in which the two leaders discussed differences on global trade and the environment, including the possibility of the US rejoining the Paris climate accord. Earlier on Wednesday,Mr Macron used a speech to the joint houses of the US Congressto denounce nationalism and isolationism, in what was seen as a thinly veiled attack on Mr Trump's America First agenda. Under the terms of the agreement, reached under Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Iran agreed to limit its controversial nuclear programme in return for an easing of economic sanctions. The deal was struck between Iran and six world powers - the US, UK, France, Germany, China and Russia. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Under the deal, Iran's ability to enrich uranium is severely restricted - the number of centrifuges it can install has been limited and its uranium stockpile is being drastically reduced. The restrictions are set to expire in 2025. Iran also agreed to redesign the nuclear reactor at Arak so that it could not produce weapons-grade plutonium, and to allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency into any site in the country they regarded as suspicious. If any aspect of the deal is violated, the UN sanctions will resume for 10 years. Warning of ""big problems"" if Iran resumed its nuclear programme, Mr Trump on Tuesday said a ""bigger"" deal was possible but it must be built on ""solid"" foundations. ""They should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of the Middle East,"" he said. The US president has long complained that the accord - signed by the US, Iran, Russia, China, France, the UK and Germany - does nothing to halt Iran's support for militant groups in the region such as the Lebanese Shia Muslim group Hezbollah. Trump threatens 'big problems' for Iran Mr Trump is also demanding that signatories to the pact agree permanent restrictions on uranium enrichment. In January, he signed a waiver suspending US sanctions on Iran for 120 days, saying this was the last time he would extend the sanctions relief. The next waiver is due to be signed on 12 May. Echoing Mr Trump's concern over Iran's influence in the region, Gen Joseph Votel, head of the US military's Central Command, described the country as the biggest long-term threat to security in the Middle East. ""[Iran's] very aggressive approach to the region in trying to spread their revolutionary rhetoric and regime focus here is I think very, very evident"", he told the BBC. A senior aide to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tehran would not accept any change to the nuclear deal. Ayatollah Khamenei said Tehran would never agree to restricting its influence in the Middle East ""If Trump exits the deal, Iran will surely pull out of it... Iran will not accept a nuclear deal with no benefits for us,"" said Ali Akbar Velayati. He also ruled out Iran restricting its influence in the Middle East. ""This is our region,"" he said. ""We are in our own region and it is legitimate."" Iranian PresidentHassan Rouhani has said the US and French leaders have no ""right"" to renegotiate a seven-party agreement. Iran would take ""important steps regarding our nuclear technology"", he said on Wednesday, but added that the measures would be ""peaceful"". Could Iran nuclear deal collapse?

Facebook to vet UK ads for 2019 vote,"Facebook's chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer will answer questions from MPs Facebook's chief technology officer is to promise MPs that the social network will act to make political advertising far more transparent for UK users. Mike Schroepfer will say that his firm will be ready to authorise ads in time for England and Northern Ireland's May 2019 local elections. He will make the pledge while giving evidence to a parliament committee. Facebook hadpreviously committed itself to similar action,externalin the US later this year. Mr Schroepfer is being questioned as part of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee's inquiry into fake news. But the politicians also want to know more about the leak of Facebook data to the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The committee had wanted to hear from Facebook's founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook sales soar 'despite challenges' Was Facebook data's value 'literally nothing'? Facebook threw us under bus, says data firm 'Facebook in PR crisis' on data row However, he opted to send other executives to answer questions from politicians outside the US, having given two days of testimony in Washington earlier this month. In his opening remarks, Mr Schroepfer will tell MPs that he and his boss are deeply sorry about what happened with Cambridge Analytica, which he will describe as a breach of trust. He will also promise to deploy a new ""view ads"" button in the UK by June 2018, which will let members see all the adverts any page is showing to users via Facebook, Messenger and Instagram.  The company first launched the facility in Canada last October. Mr Zuckerberg has answered questions from US politicians but declined to do likewise in the UK In addition, Mr Schroepfer will promise the following will be up and running in time for the 2019 local elections: political ads will only be allowed if they are submitted by authenticated accounts such ads will be labelled as being ""political"" and it will be made clear who paid for them the adverts will subsequently be placed in a searchable archive for seven years, where information will be provided about how many times they may have been seen and how much money was spent on them This video can not be played WATCH: Meet people who review Facebook's reported content But MPs are likely to have questions about the use of Facebook in past elections, notably the EU referendum, and whether there was any foreign involvement. They will also want to drill down into the Cambridge Analytica affair and find out whether Facebook has uncovered similar cases during an audit of developer behaviour.

Knife crime up 22% in England and Wales,"This video can not be played 'Young people don't want to talk to police' Knife crime rose by 22% in England and Wales in 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The figures, which cover crimes recorded by the police, also showed an 11% increase in firearms offences. A separate survey on the public's experience of crimes in the two countries said there had been no change in overall violent offences. The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) said most types of crime stayed at similar levels to 2016. It added that eight-in-10 adults had not experienced any crimes asked about in the survey throughout 2017. 'I realised I don't need to carry a knife' Knife-related hospital admissions rise How can we solve violence at a local level? While some of the increases in recorded crimes are explained by changes in the way police report them, the ONS warned that some of the statistics showed a genuine rise in the offence - such as the 9% increase in burglaries and the 33% increase in robbery. Recorded homicides were also up by 9% in 2017, to 653 from 599 the previous year. However, when the victims of terror attacks in London and Manchester are included in the 2017 figures, and those who died in Hillsborough in 1989 - which were ruled as manslaughter by a coroner in 2016 and included in that year's figures - the number of recorded homicides fell slightly between 2016 and 2017 from 695 to 688.

Alexa Bradley, who focuses on crime statistics and analysis for the ONS, said the two sets of figures showed the ""picture of crime"" had been ""fairly stable"", with levels much lower than the peak seen in the mid-1990s. But she said the ""high harm"" offences, such as homicide, knife crime and gun crime, were on the up, which was ""a trend that has been emerging over the previous two years"".

The 28% drop in incidents, apparently down to a reduction in computer viruses, led to an overall fall in the number of crimes estimated by the survey. But both the CSEW and police recorded figures showed a rise in vehicle crime, with the former estimating a 17% rise in vehicle-related theft and the latter recording a 16% increase in vehicle offences. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Last week, the Home Office set out a strategy to combat serious violence because of a surge in stabbings and shootings that is reflected in the latest figures. But what is likely to worry ministers as much, if not more, is evidence that, after 20 years of decline, burglaries and car crime are on the increase. Thefts of and from cars is rising, according to both the police (by 16%) and the survey (17%), while the ONS says the 9%, apparently genuine, rise in burglaries logged by police is likely to show up in the survey in the near future. Whereas serious violence is concentrated in big cities, property offences affect a broader sweep of people and areas - though the rates of offending are nowhere near the levels they were in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard has released its own figures, showing a significant rise in homicides in London. Comparing April with March 2016-17 with April to March 2017-18, the number rose from 109 to 157 - a 44% increase. Eight of these were as a result of the terror attacks on Westminster Bridge, London Bridge and Finsbury Park. The Metropolitan Police said the number was lower than in 2003-04, when there were 205 incidents, but added: ""Nevertheless, any murder is one murder too many and detectives are working 24/7 to catch those responsible, using all resources available to them."" The new statistics come after a spate of violent crime in the first three months of 2018.

Facebook to vet UK ads for 2019 voteFirm pledges to authorise political ads in time for England and Northern Ireland's 2019 local elections.5h5 hours agoTechnologyComments,"Facebook's chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer will answer questions from MPs Facebook's chief technology officer is to promise MPs that the social network will act to make political advertising far more transparent for UK users. Mike Schroepfer will say that his firm will be ready to authorise ads in time for England and Northern Ireland's May 2019 local elections. He will make the pledge while giving evidence to a parliament committee. Facebook hadpreviously committed itself to similar action,externalin the US later this year. Mr Schroepfer is being questioned as part of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee's inquiry into fake news. But the politicians also want to know more about the leak of Facebook data to the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The committee had wanted to hear from Facebook's founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook sales soar 'despite challenges' Was Facebook data's value 'literally nothing'? Facebook threw us under bus, says data firm 'Facebook in PR crisis' on data row However, he opted to send other executives to answer questions from politicians outside the US, having given two days of testimony in Washington earlier this month. In his opening remarks, Mr Schroepfer will tell MPs that he and his boss are deeply sorry about what happened with Cambridge Analytica, which he will describe as a breach of trust. He will also promise to deploy a new ""view ads"" button in the UK by June 2018, which will let members see all the adverts any page is showing to users via Facebook, Messenger and Instagram.  The company first launched the facility in Canada last October. Mr Zuckerberg has answered questions from US politicians but declined to do likewise in the UK In addition, Mr Schroepfer will promise the following will be up and running in time for the 2019 local elections: political ads will only be allowed if they are submitted by authenticated accounts such ads will be labelled as being ""political"" and it will be made clear who paid for them the adverts will subsequently be placed in a searchable archive for seven years, where information will be provided about how many times they may have been seen and how much money was spent on them This video can not be played WATCH: Meet people who review Facebook's reported content But MPs are likely to have questions about the use of Facebook in past elections, notably the EU referendum, and whether there was any foreign involvement. They will also want to drill down into the Cambridge Analytica affair and find out whether Facebook has uncovered similar cases during an audit of developer behaviour.

Companies pledge to cut plastic pollutionMore than 40 firms including Coca-Cola have promised to reduce harmful packaging.11h11 hours agoBusiness,"More than 40 companies have signed up to a pact to cut plastic pollution over the next seven years. The firms, which include Coca-Cola and Asda, have promised to honour a number of pledges such as eliminating single-use packaging through better design. They have joined the government, trade associations and campaigners to form the UK Plastics Pact. The signatories are responsible for more than 80% of plastic packaging on products sold through UK supermarkets. One of the promises which companies, such as consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble and Marks & Spencer, have signed up to is to make 100% of plastic packaging ready for recycling or composting by 2025. Led by the sustainability campaign group WRAP, the pact is described as a ""once-in-a lifetime opportunity"" to rethink plastic both to make use of its value and to stop it damaging the environment. What are the alternatives to plastic? What are supermarkets doing to fight plastic? A month without plastic - 10 years on The plastic choking Indonesian rivers WRAP's chief executive Marcus Gover, said: ""This requires a whole scale transformation of the plastics system and can only be achieved by bringing together all links in the chain under a shared commitment to act. ""That is what makes the UK Plastics Pact unique.  It unites every body, business and organisation with a will to act on plastic pollution. We will never have a better time to act, and together we can."" This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic The set of pledges to tackle plastic pollution over the next seven years include: Eliminate difficult or unnecessary single use plastic packaging through better design Make 100% of plastic packaging reusable or recyclable or compostable Make sure 70% of plastic packaging is recycled or composted 30% of all plastic packaging to include recycled material The pact is also supported by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The yachtswoman, who broke the solo record for sailing around the world in 2005, has long campaigned for plastic products to be re-used and not allowed to enter the oceans. Research conducted by her foundation concluded that 95% of plastic packaging around the world is used only once. She said the Plastics Pact would create ""a circular economy for plastics that tackles the causes of plastics waste and pollution, not just the symptoms."" ""Focusing on innovation, better packaging design and end-of-use systems will not only generate long-term benefits for the environment, but is also a huge economic opportunity."" The agreement has been welcomed by environmental groups who have for years been critical of businesses for failing to design products with recycling in mind. Friends of the Earth said government measures were also needed to make sure the targets are met. Reality Check: Why are 99.75% of coffee cups not recycled? Festivals aim to go plastic-free by 2021 Reality Check: Is this how to cut plastic waste? Julian Kirby, plastics campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said: ""To discourage industry from using virgin plastic, and to boost their recycling and re-use of the material, regulations and taxes should be introduced."" The pact is the latest in a flurry of actions designed to meet public concern about plastic waste, the so-called ""Blue Planet"" effect following the television series narrated by Sir David Attenborough. This video can not be played The plastic choking Indonesian rivers The test will be whether the pledges are translated into real changes to products and the ways they are sold, to make recycling easier and more effective and to do that quickly. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said that government, businesses and the public had to work together to fight plastic waste.

"Trump to drop Iran deal, Macron saysFrance's leader admits he may have failed to persuade his US counterpart to retain the 2015 accord.3m3 minutes agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played Five times Macron ripped up Trump agenda French President Emmanuel Macron has said he may have failed in efforts to persuade Donald Trump to stick to an international nuclear deal with Iran. ""My view is... that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons,"" Mr Macron said at the end of a three-day state visit to the US. Mr Trump has until 12 May to decide on the deal, which aimed to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. He has been a strong critic of the accord, calling it ""insane"". On Wednesday, Mr Macron used similar language to describe frequent shifts in the US position on global issues, including climate change and the Iran agreement. ""It can work in the short term, but it's very insane in the medium to long term,"" he is quoted as telling reporters following a question-and-answer session with students at George Washington University. Macron urges Trump to stick with Iran deal Could the Iran nuclear deal collapse? Analysis: Macron delivers a rebuke to Trump Brigitte Macron on life at the top Mr Macron made changing the US president's mind on Iran a top priority for his visit but ended up admitting there was a ""big risk"" Mr Trump would abandon the deal. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal He agreed with Mr Trump that any deal should include a wider agreement on Iran's influence in the Middle East and should cover the country's nuclear activities longer term, as well as its ballistic missile programme. He said he would work with Mr Trump to build a ""new framework"" in the Middle East - and especially in Syria. His comments came at the end of a state visit in which the two leaders discussed differences on global trade and the environment, including the possibility of the US rejoining the Paris climate accord. Earlier on Wednesday,Mr Macron used a speech to the joint houses of the US Congressto denounce nationalism and isolationism, in what was seen as a thinly veiled attack on Mr Trump's America First agenda. Under the terms of the agreement, reached under Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Iran agreed to limit its controversial nuclear programme in return for an easing of economic sanctions. The deal was struck between Iran and six world powers - the US, UK, France, Germany, China and Russia. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Under the deal, Iran's ability to enrich uranium is severely restricted - the number of centrifuges it can install has been limited and its uranium stockpile is being drastically reduced. The restrictions are set to expire in 2025. Iran also agreed to redesign the nuclear reactor at Arak so that it could not produce weapons-grade plutonium, and to allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency into any site in the country they regarded as suspicious. If any aspect of the deal is violated, the UN sanctions will resume for 10 years. Warning of ""big problems"" if Iran resumed its nuclear programme, Mr Trump on Tuesday said a ""bigger"" deal was possible but it must be built on ""solid"" foundations. ""They should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of the Middle East,"" he said. The US president has long complained that the accord - signed by the US, Iran, Russia, China, France, the UK and Germany - does nothing to halt Iran's support for militant groups in the region such as the Lebanese Shia Muslim group Hezbollah. Trump threatens 'big problems' for Iran Mr Trump is also demanding that signatories to the pact agree permanent restrictions on uranium enrichment. In January, he signed a waiver suspending US sanctions on Iran for 120 days, saying this was the last time he would extend the sanctions relief. The next waiver is due to be signed on 12 May. Echoing Mr Trump's concern over Iran's influence in the region, Gen Joseph Votel, head of the US military's Central Command, described the country as the biggest long-term threat to security in the Middle East. ""[Iran's] very aggressive approach to the region in trying to spread their revolutionary rhetoric and regime focus here is I think very, very evident"", he told the BBC. A senior aide to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tehran would not accept any change to the nuclear deal. Ayatollah Khamenei said Tehran would never agree to restricting its influence in the Middle East ""If Trump exits the deal, Iran will surely pull out of it... Iran will not accept a nuclear deal with no benefits for us,"" said Ali Akbar Velayati. He also ruled out Iran restricting its influence in the Middle East. ""This is our region,"" he said. ""We are in our own region and it is legitimate."" Iranian PresidentHassan Rouhani has said the US and French leaders have no ""right"" to renegotiate a seven-party agreement. Iran would take ""important steps regarding our nuclear technology"", he said on Wednesday, but added that the measures would be ""peaceful"". Could Iran nuclear deal collapse?

Kim to cross border for Korea talksThey will walk together to the Peace House for historic talks addressing hostilities on the peninsula.1h34 minutes agoAsia,"Mr Kim, right, is set to take a historic step when he attends his first summit Kim Jong-un is set to become the first North Korean leader to cross into South Korean territory since the end of the Korean War in 1953, as final details are put in place for the summit. South Korea said President Moon Jae-in would personally meet Mr Kim at the border at 09:30 (00:30 GMT) on Friday. The historic summit will focus on the North's recent indications it could be willing to give up its nuclear weapons. Talks are also proposed between Mr Kim and US President Trump by early June. Mr Kim is set to cross the military demarcation line - a clearly defined marker of the official land border between the territories. He will, however, remain within the Demilitarised Zone. Seoul has warned reaching an agreement aimed at ridding Pyongyang of its nuclear weapons will be ""difficult"", because North Korea's nuclear and missile technology has advanced so much since the sides' leaders last met more than a decade ago. ""The difficult part is at what level the two leaders will be able to reach an agreement regarding willingness to denuclearise,"" South Korean presidential spokesperson Im Jong-seok said. What to expect from Kim-Moon talks North Korea crisis in 300 words Talks with Kim: The political gamble of the 21st Century The meeting - the third of its kind following summits in 2000 and 2007 - is the result of months of improving relations between the two Koreas, and paves the way for a planned meeting between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump. President Trump cast some doubt on that meeting on Thursday, saying in an interview with Fox News, ""maybe the meeting doesn't even take place"". He also said he was considering three or four dates as well as five possible locations, if it does go ahead. This video can not be played How to talk to North Korea - advice from three North Korean experts Mr Kim announced last week that he would suspend nuclear tests for the time being. The move was welcomed by the US and South Korea as a positive step, althoughChinese researchers have indicated that North Korea's nuclear test site may be unusableafter a rock collapse following its last test in September. As well as addressing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the leaders are expected to discuss a path to peace on the peninsula to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, and a series of economic and social issues. South Korea and the US say they are suspending annual military drills for a day while the summit takes place. Every detail of the summit has been precisely planned - from the timetable to the dinner menu. Mr Moon will meet Mr Kim and his delegation of nine officials at the concrete blocks which mark the demarcation line on the border, Mr Im told reporters on Thursday. South Korean honour guards will then escort the leaders to a welcome ceremony at a plaza in Panmunjom,a military compound in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two countries. The heavily guarded Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) divides the two Koreas - the concrete border line stretches between the buildings Official talks between Mr Moon and Mr Kim will begin at 10:30 local time (01:30 GMT) at the Peace House in Panmunjom. The pair will break after the first session and will have lunch separately - with the delegation from the North crossing back to their side of the border. At an afternoon ceremony, Mr Moon and Mr Kim will plant a pine tree using soil and water from both countries, to symbolise ""peace and prosperity"". South Korean youths: ""We're too busy for reunification"" A ""petty"" history of Korean relations Following the tree planting, they will walk together before starting the next round of talks. The summit will conclude with the leaders signing an agreement and delivering a joint statement before dinner. The banquet will be held on the South side - and a carefully planned menu has already been announced. Kim Jong-un will be served the Swiss potato dish rÃ¶sti- a nod to his time studying in Switzerland - along with the North's signature dish of cold noodles, and a North Korean liquor. One detail, however, may have been overlooked - or may have been a deliberate move. Japan objected to the choice of dessertbecause of the inclusion on the mango mousse being served of disputed islands on a map of the Korean peninsula. Japan, North Korea and South Korea all claim the islands. After dinner, the delegations will watch a video called ""Spring of One"", before Mr Kim returns home. An object of diplomatic dispute - the mango mousse Mr Kim will be accompanied by nine officials, including his sister,Kim Yo-jong, who led the North's delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea earlier this year. Kim Yong-nam, North Korea's nominal head of state, will also attend. Kim Yo-jong's visit to Pyeongchang mesmerised the crowds In a rare move - one not seen at previous inter-Korean summits - the delegation will also feature top military officials and diplomats. South Korean presidential spokesperson Mr Im said he was encouraged by this shift. The people Kim is bringing to the summit The son of refugees who became president Profile: Kim Jong-un ""I feel North Korea is sending their key military officials to the summit as they too, believe denuclearisation and peace are important,"" he said. ""North Korea appears to take into account not only the inter-Korean summit but also the subsequent North-US summit and efforts for international co-operation."" South Korea will send seven officials along with President Moon, including the ministers for defence, foreign affairs and unification. The chairman of South Korea's joint chiefs of staff was a late addition to his entourage. The summit is the high point after months of improving relations between the two countries, which few would have predicted following years of rising tension. The rapprochement began in January whenMr Kim suggested he was ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea.The following month the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations?? North Korea and South Korea set up hotline ahead of summit Mr Kim's new appetite for diplomacy led to a meeting with senior South Korean officials in March - the first time officials from Seoul had met the young leader since he came to power in 2011 - to map out details for a meeting with Mr Moon. Ahead of the summit, North Korean media praised Mr Kim for his work in the talks. ""It is a historic event for national history made possible by our brisk efforts for dialogue and peace,"" The Rodong Sinmun, official newspaper of the ruling Workers' Party, said in an editorial. ""Improving North-South relations is a necessary requirement for the achievement of homeland unification,"" it said.

"Knife crime up 22% in England and WalesThere was also an 11% rise in gun crime in 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics.6m7 minutes agoUK","This video can not be played 'Young people don't want to talk to police' Knife crime rose by 22% in England and Wales in 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The figures, which cover crimes recorded by the police, also showed an 11% increase in firearms offences. A separate survey on the public's experience of crimes in the two countries said there had been no change in overall violent offences. The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) said most types of crime stayed at similar levels to 2016. It added that eight-in-10 adults had not experienced any crimes asked about in the survey throughout 2017. 'I realised I don't need to carry a knife' Knife-related hospital admissions rise How can we solve violence at a local level? While some of the increases in recorded crimes are explained by changes in the way police report them, the ONS warned that some of the statistics showed a genuine rise in the offence - such as the 9% increase in burglaries and the 33% increase in robbery. Recorded homicides were also up by 9% in 2017, to 653 from 599 the previous year. However, when the victims of terror attacks in London and Manchester are included in the 2017 figures, and those who died in Hillsborough in 1989 - which were ruled as manslaughter by a coroner in 2016 and included in that year's figures - the number of recorded homicides fell slightly between 2016 and 2017 from 695 to 688. This video can not be played Knife crime: What's it like to be stabbed? Alexa Bradley, who focuses on crime statistics and analysis for the ONS, said the two sets of figures showed the ""picture of crime"" had been ""fairly stable"", with levels much lower than the peak seen in the mid-1990s. But she said the ""high harm"" offences, such as homicide, knife crime and gun crime, were on the up, which was ""a trend that has been emerging over the previous two years"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the rise in these violent incidents was ""unacceptably high"", and they were ""a national problem that required national solutions from the government"". 39,598 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument - up from 32,448 in 2016 6,604 offences involving firearms - up from 5,864 in 2016 688 homicides, including terror attacks in London and Manchester - but when the terror attacks and Hillsborough are excluded, there was a rise of 9% from 599 homicides to 653 74,130 recorded robbery offences - up from 55,824 in 2016 SOURCE: ONS The CSEW showed a significant fall in computer misuse cases - which were only introduced as part of the figures last year. The 28% drop in incidents, apparently down to a reduction in computer viruses, led to an overall fall in the number of crimes estimated by the survey. But both the CSEW and police recorded figures showed a rise in vehicle crime, with the former estimating a 17% rise in vehicle-related theft and the latter recording a 16% increase in vehicle offences. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Last week, the Home Office set out a strategy to combat serious violence because of a surge in stabbings and shootings that is reflected in the latest figures. But what is likely to worry ministers as much, if not more, is evidence that, after 20 years of decline, burglaries and car crime are on the increase. Thefts of and from cars is rising, according to both the police (by 16%) and the survey (17%), while the ONS says the 9%, apparently genuine, rise in burglaries logged by police is likely to show up in the survey in the near future. Whereas serious violence is concentrated in big cities, property offences affect a broader sweep of people and areas - though the rates of offending are nowhere near the levels they were in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard has released its own figures, showing a significant rise in homicides in London. Comparing April with March 2016-17 with April to March 2017-18, the number rose from 109 to 157 - a 44% increase. Eight of these were as a result of the terror attacks on Westminster Bridge, London Bridge and Finsbury Park. The Metropolitan Police said the number was lower than in 2003-04, when there were 205 incidents, but added: ""Nevertheless, any murder is one murder too many and detectives are working 24/7 to catch those responsible, using all resources available to them."" The new statistics come after a spate of violent crime in the first three months of 2018. In the first 100 days of 2018,52 people were killed in the capital- many of which were stabbings - raising serious concerns about how to tackle violent crime on the city's streets.

TSB drafts in outside help to fix IT chaos,"This video can not be played TSB chief Paul Pester told 5 live Breakfast he 'hasn't had time to think' about resigning. TSB boss Paul Pester has told the BBC the bank is ""on our knees"" after six days of computer chaos, but pledged ""we will get up and come back fighting"". The bank has been forced to call in outside help to help fix the banking system breakdown. Mr Pester, said he would take direct control of the issue, and had drafted in experts from IBM, who would report ""directly"" to him. He also promised no customer would pay overdraft fees or charges for April. The problems arose last Friday  when the bank attempted to move customers' accounts from former owner Lloyds to a platform, newly built, by its Spanish-owner Sabadell. But since the migration began, around half of TSB's customers have been unable to access their online accounts. Asked by the BBC if he would give up his bonus for this year, Mr Pester said: ""The last thing I'm worried about is bonuses and pay."" When asked if he would resign over the issues, he responded: ""I haven't even had time to think about it"". The BBC has spoken to a fed-up TSB branch manager who made it clear that it's not just customers who are suffering. ""Multiple staff members have been sent home physically and emotionally exhausted."" ""In my branch, every member of staff has been in tears and all saying this has been the worst working experience of their lives."" ""It is heartbreaking for me as a manager seeing my amazing team break down one by one."" ""I am desperate for chief executive Paul Pester to recognise how awful it is in the branches."" Read the full story The BBC asked Mr Pester what sort of expenses TSB customers could be compensated for. He was told about Phil, a tiler who has lost Â£2,000 worth of business because he could not pay contractors. Do people like him have a case for compensation? ""Of course they do,"" said Mr Pester. ""We will work through what we think and he thinks is reasonable. He added: ""TSB has caused this problem, we should be able to provide a service to our customers, and we haven't. ""The last thing we are going to be doing is penny-pinching when we are dealing with an issue with our customers."" However, despite Mr Pester's attempts at reassurance, exasperated TSB customers have continued to vent their fury on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

MPs to debate plan to leave customs union,"The prime minister has ruled out remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit Home Secretary Amber Rudd has appeared to cast doubt on the government's policy of not being in a customs union with the EU after Brexit. She told journalists she would not be ""drawn"" on the issue and said there were discussions to be had about it in cabinet to agree a ""final position"". Later she tweeted that she ""should have been clearer"" but had not wanted to get into ""ongoing cabinet discussions"". The PM Theresa May has ruled out being in an EU customs union after Brexit. Kuenssberg: Rudd breaks with May's Home Office approach :As it happened: MPs debate customs union plan Reality Check: What is a customs union? Home Office 'to scrap immigration removals targets' The comments came on the day Ms Rudd faced fresh calls to resign over her handling of the Windrush scandal, which has seen relatives of people from Caribbean countries who settled in the UK decades ago being declared illegal immigrants, if they could not prove they had lived continuously in the UK. She was forced to admit in the House of Commons that immigration removal targets had existed, a day after telling a committee of MPs that there weren't any. But the issue of whether or not the UK would be in a customs union after Brexit came up as she addressed a lunch for parliamentary journalists She replied: ""I'm not going to be drawn on that. We still have a few discussions to be had in a really positive, consensual and easy way among some of my cabinet colleagues in order to arrive at a final position."" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Amber Rudd appears to have let slip that discussions around the cabinet table about negotiating a customs union with the EU have not in fact concluded. ""If that is so, then the prime minister should rethink her approach and listen to the growing chorus of voices in Parliament and in the businesses community that believe she has got it wrong on a customs union.""

Brexiteers have criticised a suggested ""customs partnership"" to replace the current arrangements, while pro-EU campaigners say a customs union is the only way to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. MPs debated a non-binding motion on Thursday calling on the government to include in its negotiating objectives with the EU ""the establishment of an effective customs union between the two territories"". With few pro-Brexit MPs attending the debate, the motion was approved without a vote, prompting Labour's Chris Leslie to suggest it ""was now the default consensus view of this House"" and said the government should respond. Crunch votes are expected next month when Remain-supporting MPs will push for a change of course. This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? A customs union is when countries agree to apply the same taxes on imports to goods from outside the union. This means when goods have cleared customs in one country, they can be shipped to others in the union without further tariffs being imposed. If the UK remains part of the customs union, it would be unable to strike trade deals with countries around the world, but supporters say it would help keep an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. During the debate, Labour's Yvette Cooper said the UK exported more than Â£230bn of goods and services to the EU every year and warned that to ""rip up"" existing trade arrangements would be ""deeply damaging"". She argued that existing trade deals should be ""cherished"" as it was becoming harder to negotiate new ones ""as communities across different individual countries become more worried about both the losers and the winners of big changes to trade arrangements"". UK will leave customs union, insists No 10 Reality Check: Why is the customs union so important? Pro-European Conservative Ken Clarke told MPs: ""You will damage the economy of this country... if you suddenly decide to erect new barriers at the border between the UK and our major trading partners."" And former Conservative cabinet minister Nicky Morgan warned: ""If we undermine and ignore the evidence for peace in Northern Ireland, and we undermine the business and financial security of the people in this country, we will not be forgiven for a generation."" Labour MP Kate Hoey, one of the few Brexiteers at the debate, said she felt ""alone"" in the chamber: ""There are a lot of people here today who are using the issue of the customs union to start the process again of wanting to stay in the European Union."" She argued that if the UK stayed in the customs union, it would be a ""transition"" to remaining, and would not allow Britain to ""take back control"" of its trade. Please upgrade your browser Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed a customs union, but only if the UK had a say in future EU trade deals. Mrs May has ruled out joining a customs union but has come up with two options to avoid a hard border in Ireland. One of them is a ""customs partnership"" that would involve the UK collecting the EU's tariffs on goods coming from other countries on the EU's behalf. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. This option has been heavily criticised by some Brexiteers, with influential backbench Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg branding it ""completely cretinous"". The other option being proposed by the government would be to minimise checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and putting in place a trusted trader scheme.

Italian men charged over Anfield violenceThe men are due in court following violence before Liverpool's Champions League game against Roma.9m9 minutes agoLiverpool,"Sean Cox remains in a critical condition at Walton Neurological Centre Two Italian men have been charged over violence before Liverpool's Champions League semi-final against Roma in which a man was left seriously injured. Filippo Lombardi, 20, has been charged with violent disorder and wounding/inflicting grievous bodily harm and Daniele Sciusco, 29, is charged with violent disorder. They have appeared in court and were remanded in custody until 24 May. Sean Cox, 53, described as ""amazing"", remains in a critical condition. Neither Mr Lombardi nor Mr Sciusco entered a plea at South Sefton Magistrates' Court and they will next appear at Liverpool Crown Court. Mr Cox, from Dunboyne, County Meath in the Irish Republic, suffered head injuries outside The Albert pub in Walton Breck Road, next to Anfield stadium, shortly before kick-off on Tuesday. Eyewitnesses reported seeing a group of Roma fans descend on the road outside Anfield where Liverpool supporters had gathered. Sean Cox suffered serious injuries close to Anfield stadium on Tuesday evening Mr Cox's family said he is the ""most amazing and wonderful"" husband, dad, friend, son, uncle and brother. ""We hope Sean makes a full recovery from the injuries he sustained and that we will all be back together soon as a family in Ireland spending precious time together,"" they said. He is being treated at Walton Neurological Centre in Liverpool. Edoardo Ranalli, 28, from Rome, pleaded guilty at South Sefton Magistrates' Court earlier to throwing a missile onto a football playing area. He admitted throwing coins and was fined Â£300 and ordered to pay a Â£30 statutory surcharge and Â£85 towards prosecution costs. He was also banned from attending regulated football matches in England and Wales for five years. In total, nine men were arrested for various offences at the match.

Kate Bush creates Bronte moors memorialThe musician's words about the Wuthering Heights author will be carved in stone.,"This video can not be played Kate Bush performs Wuthering Heights on Top of the Pops in 1978 Forty years after she sang her hit Wuthering Heights, inspired by Emily Bronte's novel, singer Kate Bush is contributing to a monument to the Bronte sisters on the Yorkshire moors. In a rare public work, she has written an inscription for a stone that will be placed near the Brontes' home. Bush said being asked to pen a passage about Emily was ""an honour and, in a way, a chance to say thank you to her"". She's one of four artists who have written messages about the sisters. Poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy has crafted a passage for a stone dedicated to Charlotte Bronte, fellow poet Jackie Kay has created a tribute to Anne, and the fourth inscription, by author Jeanette Winterson, will reflect on the Bronte legacy as a whole. The four stones will form a trail between the family home in Haworth and the sisters' birthplace seven miles away in Thornton. They will be unveiled as part of Bradford Literature Festival on 7 July. Anne, Emily and Charlotte Bronte in a painting by their brother Branwell In a statement, Bush said: ""I am delighted to be involved in this project. Each sister being remembered by a stone in the enigmatic landscape where they lived and worked is a striking idea. ""Emily only wrote the one novel - an extraordinary work of art that has truly left its mark. To be asked to write a piece for Emily's stone is an honour and, in a way, a chance to say thank you to her."" The musician and songwriter seldom takes part in public projects and has been out of the spotlight since performing 22 shows in London in 2014 and releasing an accompanying live album two years later. Bradford Literature Festival director Syima Aslam said the four passages were each under 100 words, but that ""fans of Kate Bush won't be disappointed"". ""We felt that Kate would be a great person to write about Emily Bronte,"" she told BBC News. ""She's such an icon and so much of her work references literature, so it felt like she would be the perfect person to respond to Emily and write something for the stone. ""We weren't sure whether she would do it but we were absolutely delighted when she said yes. It was one of those - we won't know unless we ask.

Home Office 'had' removal targets,"This video can not be played Amber Rudd rejects calls to quit over Windrush scandal The Home Office is to axe immigration removal targets - a day after Home Secretary Amber Rudd said they did not exist, the BBC understands. Ms Rudd told MPs investigating the Windrush scandal on Wednesday targets were not set for immigration officials. But after fresh evidence emerged overnight she was forced on Thursday to admit to MPs that ""local"" targets for ""internal"" use had been set. The Home Office is now scrapping them, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg understands. The instruction to axe the targets is likely to be sent out from Immigration and Enforcement, a division of the Home Office, in the coming days. However, the government's overall target of reducing net migration to under 100,000 a year will stay in place, the BBC's political editor said. The home secretary faced fresh calls to quit following her admission that the targets did exist and, according to union officials, are prominently displayed on posters at regional immigration centres. Who are the Windrush generation? Home Office 'knew about Windrush issues' What is the 'hostile environment' policy? In a separate development on Thursday,she appeared to cast doubt on the government's policy of not being in a customs union with the EU after Brexit- although she later said she ""should have been clearer"" that ""we will be leaving the customs union"". Ms Rudd said she had not been aware of the immigration removal targets but Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said she was ""trying to blame officials"" and the ""direction will have come from the centre"". Ms Abbott said she did not see how Ms Rudd could survive in her job ""unless she is only there as a human shield for Theresa May"". Asked how the targets had impacted on Windrush migrants, Ms Abbott said: ""Immigration officials may have been looking for soft targets in the shape of West Indian pensioners who don't have hot shot lawyers."" Her Labour frontbench colleague, Dawn Butler, told the BBC's Daily Politics Mrs May was ""presiding over a government that has policies that are institutionally racist"". By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor What is remarkable is how the Home Office suddenly ditched the targets. They were introduced under Labour and tightened up under the Tories to try to cut the numbers of people living in the UK without the legal right to do so. Ministers believed then, and still now, that the public demand for tighter rules must be heeded. It is remarkable then that, in less than 24 hours, the home secretary seemed to suddenly ditch that whole approach. In the commotion, she has made a significant break with Theresa May's approach. Read more from Laura The SNP's home affairs spokeswoman Alison Thewlis also called for Ms Rudd's resignation, saying she was presiding over a department ""out of control"" and it was ""no surprise"" targets existed as there was ""a litany of callous incompetence"" at the Home Office. Conservative backbenchers, including Sir Nicholas Soames and Philip Davies, rallied behind Ms Rudd, with Mr Davies saying most members of the public backed tougher action against illegal immigration and accused Labour and the SNP of being ""out of touch with working class communities"". This video can not be played Appearing before a select committee, Home Secretary Amber Rudd denies there are targets Answering an urgent question in the Commons earlier on Thursday, Ms Rudd said: ""I have never agreed that there should be specific removal targets and I would never support a policy that puts targets ahead of people. ""The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. ""These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change. ""I have asked officials to provide me with a full picture of performance measurement tools which are used at all levels, and will update the House and the Home Affairs select committee as soon as possible."" Aninspection report from December 2015,external, seen by the BBC, showed targets for the voluntary departures of people regarded as having no right to stay in the UK existed at that time. A 2015 report from the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration details an annual target of 12,000 voluntary departures for 2015/16 The Windrush row erupted after it emerged relatives of migrants from Commonwealth Caribbean countries who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s had been declared illegal immigrants if they could not provide a range of documentation that proved they had lived in the UK continuously. Some of the Windrush generation have been threatened with deportation, lost their jobs or been refused access to medical treatment. Cancer patient Albert Thompson, the man who has been the focus of much of the Windrush row, has now beengiven a date to start his treatment on the NHSand granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. It comes after he was told last year he would have to pay Â£54,000 unless he could produce the right documentation. This video can not be played Albert Thompson: ""I was denied NHS cancer treatment"" Addressing the Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday, Ms Rudd said she had asked for more removals of illegal immigrants to take place, but added: ""We don't have targets for removals."" Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Service Union, had told the MPs a national target, broken down regionally, had been set to remove people in the UK illegally, and staff were under ""increasing pressure"" to meet it. There are three types of enforceable departures: deportations, administrative removals, and voluntary departures. The term ""voluntary"" describes the method of departure rather than the choice of whether or not to depart, theMigration Observatory explains,external. Those leaving in this way are able to approach the Home Office for financial assistance with their travel arrangements. This video can not be played Who are the Windrush generation? The Green Party has echoed calls for Ms Rudd to quit, saying that her confirmation of the existence of targets had ""confirmed our worst fears about the Home Office"". ""You can't set targets for people you want to kick out without deciding that some people won't get a fair hearing, because there's a quota to meet by the end of the year,"" said co-leader Jonathan Bartley. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable has raised concerns about the Home Office's ability to process applications from millions of EU nationals who want to stay in the UK after Brexit if it cannot deal properly with the Windrush generation. The government has set up a task force to help those affected by the Windrush cases formalise their status. So far 3,800 calls have been made to the helpline, of which 1,364 were potentially Windrush cases, MPs were told on Wednesday.

How are shops cutting plastic?,"Plastic waste is ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"". These are the words of Prime Minister Theresa May, who has pledged to ban all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042. About 6.3bn tonnes of plastic waste had been generated globally by 2015, with almost 80% of it going to landfills or the natural environment. And despite extending the 5p charge on single-use plastic bags, major retailers in England stillsold 2.1 billion,externalin the last financial year. In a bid to tackle the problem, the PM has called on supermarkets to introduce ""plastic-free"" aisles and consider taxes and charges on single-use plastic items like food containers. But organisations like Greenpeace UK are sceptical about the plan, citing Mrs May's ""vague aspirations"" and calling for ""concrete action"", such as a bottle deposit return scheme or a ""latte levy"" on disposable coffee cups. So what are Britain's 10 biggest supermarkets doing to combat the ""scourge"" of plastic? By 2025, Tesco wantsall its packaging to be recyclable or compostable,externaland its total packaging weight to be halved compared to 2007. It has removedall polystyrene from its fish packaging,external, and claims that more than 78% of its packaging is recyclable, though this depends on the type of material accepted by local authorities. Replacing two layer plastic trays with single layer plastic has also helped them toremove 92 tonnes of plastic,external. Sainsbury's has set a target toreduce packaging by a half by 2020,external, compared to 2005. It has also committed to remove all plastic cotton buds, a major source of ocean plastic pollution. The supermarket recycles carrier bags, and has achieved a33% reduction,externalin its own brand-packaging since 2006. Between 2015 and 2016, it also redesigned its two-pint milk bottles, saving580 tonnes of plastic a year,external. Asda has reduced the weight of its packagingby 27% since 2007,external, partly by introducing ""skin"" packaging on some of its meat products. It also saved82 tonnes of plastic,externalby making its two-litre own-brand water bottles lighter. Theresa May defends 'long-term' plastic waste plan Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Morrisons recycles its carrier bags and uses""returnable bins"",externalfor fish products to reduce the use of poly boxes. The company says it keeps95% of its store waste,externalout of direct landfill. It has also banned microbeads and plastic cotton buds in its own-brand cosmetic products, and plans to phase out drinking straws in its cafes. In September, ittrialled removing single-use carrier bags,externalentirely in six of its stores. Aldi wants tosource all its pulp-based packaging from certified forests,externalby 2020 and has seen arelative 11% reduction,externalin packaging of 11% between 2012 to 2015. It has not sent any waste directly to landfill since 2014, andrecycles 100%,externalof its cardboard and plastic. Co-Op aims for 80% of its products to have""easily recyclable"" packaging by 2020,external. It hasreplaced polystyrene pizza discs with cardboard,external, saving 200 tonnes of plastic from landfill, and uses single-plastic packaging for meat, poultry and fish products. It has alsosupported the idea,externalof a deposit return scheme for bottles. Waitrose has thinned its prepared salad bags and reduced smoked salmon packaging by 50%. It charges 30p or 40p for its food to be delivered or collected in plastic bags. Despite plastic bag charging, Waitrose says itsupplied 63 million,externalbags in England from April 2016 to April 2017. Byswitching to biodegradable cotton buds,external, Waitrose estimates it has saved 21 tonnes of plastic. Last July, the supermarketintroduced a new sandwich wrapper,external, the plastic and cardboard of which can be more easily separated for recycling than other packaging. It also trialled anon-plastic punnet,externalmade from tomato leaf and cardboard pulp in October, and does not sell any productscontaining microbeads,external. It plans to make its own-label packaging widely recyclable, reusable or home compostable by 2025. Lidl says it is in the process of setting targets for plastic waste. It removed microbeads from all its cosmetic and household products last year, and has also committed to switching to biodegradable cotton buds. For the last 24 years it has charged for plastic carrier bags, and it stopped selling single-use bags last year. Iceland announced plans in January 2018 toeliminate or drastically reduce plastic packagingof all its own-label products by the end of 2023.  It had previouslysupported the idea,externalof a deposit return scheme for bottles. Plastic bag charge: Where does the money go? M&S to stop selling 'cauliflower steak' Marks & Spencer says thatmore than 90%,externalof all its UK packaging is recyclable, and less than 1% (by weight) of all its packaging can be traced back to polystyrene. It hastrialled new materials,externalto replace its blackCPET (a type of plastic) packaging,external, and the foils in packaging for biscuits and crisps. Between 2007 and 2012 itreduced its total packaging by 25%,external, and between 2012 and 2014, its food packaging usage per itemdecreased by 10%,external. It is also looking at using plastics made from plant-based oils. Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said that while initiatives like these were good, ""more radical and comprehensive policies"" were needed to tackle the plastic waste crisis. ""We need to see supermarkets making firm commitments to move away from using disposable plastic packaging altogether, starting with going plastic free in their own brands."" Businesses should be using ""reusable containers wherever possible"", she said, and investment in research and development was ""vital"" to finding less problematic packaging materials. Supermarkets also needed to avoid solving one problem by causing another, such as reducing the weight of packaging by replacing glass with plastic, she said. But the most important step for retailers was to make an open commitment to reducing the use of resources and carbon emissions. ""None of these processes will be reliable without significantly increased transparency,"" she added. Greenpeace UK suggests retailers should: Eliminate all non-recyclable plastics from own brand products Remove single-use plastic packaging for own brand products Trial dispensers and refillable containers for own brand items like shampoos, house cleaning products, beverages Push national brand suppliers to eliminate non-recyclable plastics and to stop using single use plastic packaging Install free water fountains in-store and water re-fill stations Support deposit return schemes in-store Trial reusable packaging and product refills via home deliveries A spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was committed to stemming the damage caused by plastic waste and had made great progress in boosting recycling rates. ""We are encouraged by industry action to reduce plastic and packaging waste and look forward to seeing others following its lead,"" it said. Written and researched by Becca Meier.

Are there alternatives to plastic?,"This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic Wet wipes have been added to the list of items being targeted by government plans to eliminate plastic waste. Plastic straws and cotton buds were already on a list of items whichcould be banned in England. It comes after the prime minister pledged in January to eradicate all ""avoidable plastic waste"" by 2042. Some businessesand cafes have started stocking appropriate replacements for plastic and60 music festivals, including Bestival in Dorset and Boomtown in Hampshire, have banned plastic straws, so what are the alternatives? Paper, card and steel are all alternative materials that can be used to replace plastic straws. Paper and card will not seem much different to plastic in terms of texture but some people have raised questions about the use of steel straws. Julian Kirby, Friends of the Earth's waste expert, has tried all the different materials and says ""it's a personal preference"". ""[Steel] is comfortable for a room-temperature drink - I was drinking a smoothie and it did feel very cold, so I think if you've got sensitive teeth or sensitive gums, you might not like that."" This video can not be played Plastic pollution is killing animals in the Arctic He welcomes calls for a ban and regards straws are the most unnecessary of plastic products. ""We should always ask ourselves - do we actually need this thing? That applies to straws more than anything else. ""They're liberally dispersed, they're not necessary for most people - the drink would be just as good without a strawâ¦. if they are so necessary, why not reuse them?"" Mr Kirby points out thatfor people with certain disabilities, using a straw to eat or drink with is necessary. ""[The government] does say there will be medical exemptions. People who need straws to eat or to drink, they will still be able to use plastic straws."" He is optimistic that many more alternatives will come: ""We've seen again and again that when you ban something - for good reasons - innovations create all sorts of alternatives."" Blogger Rachael Stilgoe, who runs the lifestyle blogBe a Shade Greener,external, has been using cotton buds with card stems for the past two years. ""I've had no problem with them at all in terms of the quality of the product,"" she says. Ms Stilgoe has been using ones with stems made of stiff paper, so they can be composted. ""They're available widely online and in supermarkets, and are easy to get hold of."" Dr Abigail Entwistle, director of conservation science at Fauna & Flora International, says ""clear alternatives exist"". ""Cotton buds are a particular menace on beaches around the world, and are consistently one of themost regularly reported items on UK beaches"" she adds. She welcomed the government's ""positive leadership"" on reducing plastic, saying that it sends ""a very clear message that nonsensical use of plastic, as a default material, needs to stop. ""We encourage everyone to think carefully about their choices in using plastic - remember you can still just say no to that unnecessary plastic item!"" Wet wipes contain non-biodegradable plastic. They make up around 93% of sewer blockages in the UK and are a key component of the giant obstacles known as fatbergs, according to Water UK. Natalie Fee, founder of City to Sea, which campaigns against marine pollution, says: ""There are alternatives. You can carry around re-usable, washable cloths and washable baby wipes. ""It is quite a leap for people to think about doing that, but it is possible. There are thousands of people who do it already."" Ms Fee also suggests more can be done to deter people from buying plastic wipes. ""We can look at changing the labelling like we have with cigarettes,"" she says. ""If we had images of marine animals dying of plastic pollution on the front of baby wipes, that would certainly make people stop and think twice about flushing them down the toilet.""

'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories,"This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? Some members of the so-called Windrush generation, who arrived in the UK decades ago as children, have been incorrectly identified as illegal immigrants. Here are some of their stories. The case of Albert Thompson - not his real name - has become the focus of much coverage during the current row. The 63-year-old is not technically of the Windrush generation as he arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1973 as a teenager. Buthis case was brought to light,externalafter he was told he would have to pay Â£54,000 for prostate cancer treatment unless he could produce the right documentation. ""I was less than two weeks away from my treatment. That was really upsetting,"" he told the BBC. ""I get to the Royal Marsden and they gave me this form to fill out where they want to see passport or visa, benefits letter and bank statement. ""At the end of the day, I don't have those things to show so I've got to pay Â£54,000, which I haven't got."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has raised Mr Thompson's struggles at Prime Minister's Questions, first in March and again on Wednesday, when he accused Theresa May of declining to help him. The prime minister insisted the Home Office has been in contact with Mr Thompson's representatives, and said his NHS treatment should never have been withheld. Who are the Windrush generation? In Pictures: The Windrush generation Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? But Mr Thompson said he first heard that he would receive treatment on the TV news. ""It makes me feel a bit better but not really completely. When I get the treatment - then I'll be over the moon,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Royal Marsden Hospital in London said it had been committed to resolving Mr Thompson's eligibility for further NHS treatment with his legal advisers. They added that his cancer specialist has contacted Mr Thompson to assess him in clinic for his next stage of treatment. In response, Jeremy Bloom, Mr Thompson's lawyer, said his client had been told radiotherapy treatment would only go ahead if he paid in advance or proved he had indefinite leave to remain. The Royal Marsden disputes this. Paulette Wilson, here alongside her daughter Natalie, spent time at an immigration detention centre Paulette Wilson came to Britain from Jamaica aged 10 in the late 1960s. Now 61, she said she was confused when she received a letter saying she was in the country illegally. ""I just didn't understand it and I kept it away from my daughter for about two weeks, walking around in a daze thinking 'why am I illegal?'"" Her daughter Natalie Barnes booked an appointment with the Home Office and was told her mother had six months to leave the country. Ms Wilson then spent two years with the threat of deportation hanging over her, includinga week at Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre, which she describes as ""a nightmare"". Windrush peers attack 'incompetent' Home Office How do you prove you've been living in the UK? Her MP and a local charity intervened to prevent her removal, and she has since been given a biometric residence permit which proves she can stay in the country. ""It's not ended because I've just got a card saying I have a right to stay in England - I still have to renew it in 2024,"" she said. Ms Wilson welcomed the government's apology, but asked: ""What about all the other people who were sent away before my case became big? ""It's just upsetting to think that an ordinary person like me could go through something like that. I'm still going through hell at the moment."" This video can not be played Winston Walker has lived in the UK since he was 18 months old Winston Walker arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1966 aged 18 months, on his father's passport. ""I'm as British as anyone,"" said the 53-year-old, who grew up in Birmingham and now lives in Bristol. He ran into difficulty in 2008 when applying for a provisional driving licence. ""I kept sending documents to the DVLA and they kept on sending it back,"" he told the BBC. Mr Walker later contacted an MP to help, after which he said he was told he did not ""exist on any data in this country"". ""It was frightening. I've been schooled here - had the same National Insurance number since I was 16... To be told you don't exist, it's overwhelming."" Mr Walker was able to get a resident's permit but that does not make him a British citizen. He said he wanted a British passport, but found it ""insulting"" that it would cost him ""about Â£1,500"". ""My grandmother would be turning in her grave to find out the way her offspring had been treated,"" he added. This video can not be played Junior Green was not allowed to return to the UK for his mother's funeral Junior Green arrived in the UK from Jamaica at 15 months old, in 1958. ""Sixty years, it's a long time. I'm an Englishman,"" he told BBC Newsnight. In 2009, Mr Green tried to update his passport with the proper visa information, but was told by the Home Office he had to prove he had lived in the UK for each of the previous 10 years. His application was rejected twice. In March last year, Mr Green travelled to Jamaica to be with his dying mother, but when he tried to return to the UK in June, he was not allowed on the flight. ""I was upset - virtually in tears. I couldn't understand why,"" he said. Months passed and Mr Green's mother was repatriated to the UK, but her son was unable to return to attend her funeral. He finally came back to the UK in September, after his local MP intervened. This video can not be played Windrush migrant Nick Broderick: 'I contemplated suicide' Nick Broderick, who came to the UK as a baby in 1962, has been fighting for the past four years to prove his legal status. He was working for a recruitment company in Dunstable when his office was subject to an immigration check. ""I wrote to the Jamaican embassy, I sent Â£70 to get a birth certificate. That didn't happen 3 or 4 times... So they gave me these papers to fill out and after I filled it out, they said to me 'I'm sorry, we seem to have lost the papers that you sent in and so now you're going to be deported',"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. In the months that followed, Mr Broderick had to report to the police station every month, could not work or use his driving licence. He said he knows others, in a similar position, who have been seriously ill with cancer and denied NHS treatment. ""It was an awful, awful time"" which sent him ""into a spiral of depression"", he said. ""I always thought myself as being English. I just want to have a normal life again,"" Nick added. Whitfield Francis - here with his eldest daughter Maria - came to England with his parents at the age of nine Whitfield Francis was born in Jamaica in 1958 and came to England with his parents at the age of nine. He only realised there was an issue over his right to remain in the UK when he tried to change jobs four years ago and was unable to provide proof of his status - something he didn't have - and he hasn't been able to work since. The father-of-four says he can't afford to pay for a biometric residence permit or for legal assistance. ""No-one has given me any help,"" the 59-year-old said. ""If I haven't got these certain documents, my children could be affected. They may not be eligible for a British passport although they were born in Britain."" His former partner Helen Cappasso says the situation ""nearly destroyed him"" and being unable to provide for their four children has ""broken his heart"". ""I cannot express here what a nightmare it's been, and it's not over yet,"" she said. Mr Francis, who is currently ""sofa surfing"" in Birmingham as he is unable to rent somewhere to live, said the government's pledge to help those affected has given him renewed hope that he would finally be able to work again. Sonia Williams says she doesn't accept the government's apology Sonia Williams, who came to the UK from Barbados in 1975, aged 13, has been fighting to prove she is British for four years. She was made redundant in 2014, and lost her driving licence in 2016. ""I can't drive, I can't work, I can't claims benefits, I can't do anything,"" she said. ""Sometimes I just want to give up. ""My mum's got citizenship, my dad had right to remain. So I just presumed I had all that, because I was leaving Barbados to come and live with my family. I wasn't just coming on holiday."" May apologises to Caribbean leaders Have you been affected? She said she feels ""stressed"" and ""numb"", and doesn't accept the government's apology. ""I'm not working, I can't claim benefits, so where am I going to get this money to apply for these things that they're asking me for?"" The Home Office said it would get in touch with Ms Williams. Londoner Katrice, 18, and her mother are both unable to get British passports The impact has not only been felt by the Windrush generation, but many of their children as well. Katrice Louis, whose mother, now 59, came to England from St Lucia aged 8, was born and raised in London but is unable to get a British passport. The 18-year-old says she only found out she wasn't classed as a British citizen when her mother tried to get passports for a family holiday in 2005. Two of Katrice's older siblings, born in the 1980s, have British passports, but Katrice and two of her other sisters, born in the 1990s, are unable to get one. ""The only option we have been given is to spend thousands of pounds to apply for citizenship and a passport which we cannot afford,"" she said. ""I have never understood how I have been born and raised here, but still not classed as a British citizen and been stripped of my identity. I have been denied a job. ""I have been living in fear of being deported to a country I have never even seen."" Tanya Simms, from Sheffield, was born in the UK in 1990. Her grandparents came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s and settled in Reading, Berkshire. They were granted British citizenship in the late 1960s and Tanya's mother joined them in the UK in 1975. Last year Tanya applied for a passport so she could go on her friend's hen do but was turned down on the grounds that neither of her parents were settled at the time of her birth. ""I cried my heart out when I got the letter,"" she said. ""It hurts. I've put into the system, I've been educated here, paid national insurance here."" She fears for the future: ""Where would they send me and my daughter? I've never been to Jamaica. What are they going to do? Just stick me in the sea?""

Kim to meet Moon at Korea border for summit,"Mr Kim, right, is set to take a historic step when he attends his first summit Kim Jong-un is set to become the first North Korean leader to cross into South Korean territory since the end of the Korean War in 1953, as final details are put in place for the summit. South Korea said President Moon Jae-in would personally meet Mr Kim at the border at 09:30 (00:30 GMT) on Friday. The historic summit will focus on the North's recent indications it could be willing to give up its nuclear weapons. Talks are also proposed between Mr Kim and US President Trump by early June. Mr Kim is set to cross the military demarcation line - a clearly defined marker of the official land border between the territories. He will, however, remain within the Demilitarised Zone. Seoul has warned reaching an agreement aimed at ridding Pyongyang of its nuclear weapons will be ""difficult"", because North Korea's nuclear and missile technology has advanced so much since the sides' leaders last met more than a decade ago. ""The difficult part is at what level the two leaders will be able to reach an agreement regarding willingness to denuclearise,"" South Korean presidential spokesperson Im Jong-seok said. What to expect from Kim-Moon talks North Korea crisis in 300 words Talks with Kim: The political gamble of the 21st Century The meeting - the third of its kind following summits in 2000 and 2007 - is the result of months of improving relations between the two Koreas, and paves the way for a planned meeting between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump. President Trump cast some doubt on that meeting on Thursday, saying in an interview with Fox News, ""maybe the meeting doesn't even take place"". He also said he was considering three or four dates as well as five possible locations, if it does go ahead. This video can not be played How to talk to North Korea - advice from three North Korean experts Mr Kim announced last week that he would suspend nuclear tests for the time being. The move was welcomed by the US and South Korea as a positive step, althoughChinese researchers have indicated that North Korea's nuclear test site may be unusableafter a rock collapse following its last test in September. As well as addressing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the leaders are expected to discuss a path to peace on the peninsula to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, and a series of economic and social issues. South Korea and the US say they are suspending annual military drills for a day while the summit takes place. Every detail of the summit has been precisely planned - from the timetable to the dinner menu. Mr Moon will meet Mr Kim and his delegation of nine officials at the concrete blocks which mark the demarcation line on the border, Mr Im told reporters on Thursday. South Korean honour guards will then escort the leaders to a welcome ceremony at a plaza in Panmunjom,a military compound in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two countries. The heavily guarded Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) divides the two Koreas - the concrete border line stretches between the buildings Official talks between Mr Moon and Mr Kim will begin at 10:30 local time (01:30 GMT) at the Peace House in Panmunjom. The pair will break after the first session and will have lunch separately - with the delegation from the North crossing back to their side of the border. At an afternoon ceremony, Mr Moon and Mr Kim will plant a pine tree using soil and water from both countries, to symbolise ""peace and prosperity"". South Korean youths: ""We're too busy for reunification"" A ""petty"" history of Korean relations Following the tree planting, they will walk together before starting the next round of talks. The summit will conclude with the leaders signing an agreement and delivering a joint statement before dinner. The banquet will be held on the South side - and a carefully planned menu has already been announced. Kim Jong-un will be served the Swiss potato dish rÃ¶sti- a nod to his time studying in Switzerland - along with the North's signature dish of cold noodles, and a North Korean liquor. One detail, however, may have been overlooked - or may have been a deliberate move. Japan objected to the choice of dessertbecause of the inclusion on the mango mousse being served of disputed islands on a map of the Korean peninsula. Japan, North Korea and South Korea all claim the islands. After dinner, the delegations will watch a video called ""Spring of One"", before Mr Kim returns home. An object of diplomatic dispute - the mango mousse Mr Kim will be accompanied by nine officials, including his sister,Kim Yo-jong, who led the North's delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea earlier this year. Kim Yong-nam, North Korea's nominal head of state, will also attend. Kim Yo-jong's visit to Pyeongchang mesmerised the crowds In a rare move - one not seen at previous inter-Korean summits - the delegation will also feature top military officials and diplomats. South Korean presidential spokesperson Mr Im said he was encouraged by this shift. The people Kim is bringing to the summit The son of refugees who became president Profile: Kim Jong-un ""I feel North Korea is sending their key military officials to the summit as they too, believe denuclearisation and peace are important,"" he said. ""North Korea appears to take into account not only the inter-Korean summit but also the subsequent North-US summit and efforts for international co-operation."" South Korea will send seven officials along with President Moon, including the ministers for defence, foreign affairs and unification. The chairman of South Korea's joint chiefs of staff was a late addition to his entourage. The summit is the high point after months of improving relations between the two countries, which few would have predicted following years of rising tension. The rapprochement began in January whenMr Kim suggested he was ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea.The following month the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations?? North Korea and South Korea set up hotline ahead of summit Mr Kim's new appetite for diplomacy led to a meeting with senior South Korean officials in March - the first time officials from Seoul had met the young leader since he came to power in 2011 - to map out details for a meeting with Mr Moon. Ahead of the summit, North Korean media praised Mr Kim for his work in the talks. ""It is a historic event for national history made possible by our brisk efforts for dialogue and peace,"" The Rodong Sinmun, official newspaper of the ruling Workers' Party, said in an editorial. ""Improving North-South relations is a necessary requirement for the achievement of homeland unification,"" it said.

Drugs 'used by two in five students',"The most commonly used drug among students is cannabis About two in five students are drug users, says a study from the National Union of Students. But the students' union argues that students should not be disciplined for ""drug-related behaviour that does not constitute a criminal offence"". The most widely used drugs, in a survey of 2,800 students, were cannabis, ecstasy, nitrous oxide and cocaine. A formal warning was the most common disciplinary action taken by universities over drug use. The NUS report found drug use to be ""a common, although infrequent, behaviour"" - with 39% of students using drugs, and cannabis by far the most widely used. A further 17% had used drugs before, meaning 56% in total had at some time tried them. As well as recreational use, there was also a small number of users of ""study drugs"", intended to keep people concentrating during the exam season. The report, produced in collaboration with Release, a charity with expertise on drugs and drugs law, argues against a ""punitive"" approach from university authorities. Sir Anthony Seldon says universities must take more responsibility for giving drug advice Instead of calling the police or imposing punishments for drug-related incidents, the report says students should be given advice and health education. ""Policy responses that focus solely on disciplining students fail to recognise the complex reasons that lead people to use drugs,"" says the NUS report. It says there were more than 2,000 incidents last year of ""student misconduct for possession of drugs"", recorded by universities. The disciplinary measures were most commonly a formal warning, which could be escalated to a temporary or permanent exclusion. About a quarter of incidents were reported to police. There have been rising concerns about mental health problems and student well-being - and this report describes students as often seeing drug use in the context of stress and mental health. About a third of drug users claimed that they were using drugs to reduce stress - while another third claimed that their mental health was worsened by using drugs. The report says that for some university authorities, drug use is seen ""wholly as a problem to be eradicated through suspensions, evictions and surveillance"". ""We believe that these punitive measures rarely help,"" says the report. ""Instead, they make our educational institutions complicit in practices that prevent marginalised and potentially vulnerable students from seeking help and support."" Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said universities needed to take much greater responsibility for making students aware of the risks of drug use. ""It needs to be made far less socially acceptable. They are profoundly damaging on the minds of the young, especially those with a propensity for mental health problems,"" he said. ""Drugs wreck people's minds."" He called for tougher action against ""pushers who are making money out of the misery of others"". And he called for more education over drugs, in the manner of health campaigns against tobacco, so that students could ""make up their own minds"". Professor Steve West, chairman of Universities UK's mental health working group, said: ""Universities cannot address drug misuse alone and, working with the NUS, we need to establish closer working partnerships with schools, employers, the NHS and other statutory services to co-ordinate care for students.""

Nigeria's tin mine healing ancient riftsVideoVideoBehind the handshake that paved way for peaceHelping teens where shootings are 'normal'VideoVideoFlirting across the India-Pakistan border,"Farmers and herders now work together in the new mine Environmental changes have caused tensions between settled farmers and nomadic herders in Nigeria to flare into ethnic conflict. But could working together to serve the demands of modern consumers heal ancient ethnic rifts, asks BBC World Service correspondent Stephanie Hegarty. As the sun sets over the stony hills of Jos, long-horn cows climb awkwardly down into a rocky gorge. They shimmy their bony shoulders, navigating a path worn into the stone over decades of this same grazing ritual. In this picture-postcard of serenity it's hard to imagine that until recently this community in central Nigeria was at war with itself. It's one of the world's most ancient conflicts. Across the northern part of Africa the desert is creeping outwards, swallowing up fertile green land and pushing Fulani herdsmen into conflict with farmers over grazing rights. This video can not be played 'We didn't believe we could work together' ""My people would kill them,"" says Henry Botson, a man in his 30s from the Berom tribe. He lives in Barkin Ladi, Plateau state, where in 2011 a brutal conflict flared between his people and their neighbours. ""And if we passed into their own territory they would kill my people."" Mr Botson is short and stocky, wearing a green beret with a miniature AK-47 assault rifle on a silver chain around his neck. And this is part of the problem. Since the collapse of Libya, guns have flooded into West Africa, most of them ending up in Nigeria. Mass burials - like this in Dogo Nahaw - have been a common thing during the conflict In Barkin Ladi, 268km (167 miles) east of the capital Abuja, the period of more than five years in which thousands of people were killed in ethnic clashes is simply labelled ""the crisis"".  The death rate across central and southern Nigeria averaged more than 2,000 a year between 2011 and 2016,according to campaign group Crisis International,external. Dozens buried after Nigeria clashes Who are Nigeria's Fulani herdsmen? ""The Fulani man destroyed the Berom man's farm, and the Berom man killed the Fulani man's cattle and the children rearing the cattle,"" says Farouk Abubaker, a tall, well-built Fulani man in a dusty beige tunic. ""We saw them as very wicked people. We saw them as barbarians because they killed little children and women, even pregnant women. ""A lot of horrible things happened - but all that is now history."" Because two years ago, it stopped. Tin deposits were discovered nearby, just as global prices - driven by demand from electronic components manufacturers - were rising. Now Mr Abubaker and Mr Botson work together on the same mining shaft, digging for the metal along the same narrow gorge that Fulani herders and their cattle pass through every day. Dangerous work: Many people have died in shaft collapses It's a hole in the ground as much as 40ft (12m) deep and just wide enough for one man to crawl into. Using a bucket, shovels and a pulley system made from tree-trunks and a cable, these men plunge into the earth pulling out balefuls of dirt. It's dangerous work - many have died when mine shafts have collapsed - and they have to trust each other. ""I'm really surprised,"" Mr Botson says. ""I didn't believe that we could live together like this; work together, talk together and do something like this together."" A pulley system is made from tree-trunks and a cable Workers then pan for precious tin From dawn, the mine buzzes with the sound of hundreds of men, women and even children. Some of them crouch over shallow streams, sloshing the ochre-coloured dirt around in buckets until a dark grey metal appears. Others sell head torches, tools and batteries, or clear plastic bags of water and freshly cooked food. Everywhere on this mine Fulani and Berom are working together in small teams. But how? When a new governor was elected in Plateau state in 2015, he promised to bring an end to the crisis. When he hired Joseph Lengmang, 42, as head of the Plateau State Peace Building Agency, many doubted whether a man that young would have the authority to summon local elders to sit down together. ""This government inherited an almost anarchic environment,"" Mr Lengmang recalls. ""It took quite some time. When it started they were shouting at each other, it looked like there would be violence. But we got experienced mediators... in the end we had a peace accord"". The Plateau Peace Building Agency's work continues across the state Plateau state has been balancing on the precipice of a delicate peace ever since, with the ethnic conflict becoming a national crisis. Clashes occur across the country's Middle Belt almost every week, and six people were recently killed in Barkin Ladi. Many also blame local and national politicians for stoking the tension to rouse support as Nigeria enters an election year. It comes against a backdrop of three years of high inflation. While food prices have risen, so has the cost of fertilizers and fuel. And while many farmers rely on second jobs to subsidise meagre yields, unemployment has rocketed since 2013. Mr Lengmang believes operations like the one in Barkin Ladi have a part to play in keeping the peace. ""It's very, very important... a means of livelihood to many people"", he says. ""They've learnt also in the experience they've had... if there is chaos and instability and violence, everybody loses"". However, he adds that there can be tension even among those working together in the mines, if the proceeds of their labour are shared ""fairly"". Thomas Johji was one of a small group of Berom men who discovered this particular tin deposit a few months ago. As it was in the middle of a Fulani grazing area, it was crucial to get their neighbours' co-operation. So they invited Fulani people to mine with them. Mr Johji is in his 20s and doesn't remember how ""the crisis"" began. ""Now we can even sleep here in the bush with the Fulani; wake up together, play together,"" he says. ""The Fulani have forgotten about what happened, and we are trying to forget too."" It may not be that easy for most people. A deep sense of mistrust persists between the ethnic groups. One Berom woman working at an older tin deposit nearby says she feels uncomfortable around Fulani people. She finds it difficult to trust those she says killed many of her friends and relatives. ""Even now we are afraid - but it is up to God,"" she says, adding that she is here out of pure necessity. ""If you stay home, how will you eat?"" Mr Lengmang accepts Plateau state's uneasy peace is not yet sustainable. ""There are legitimate grievances that have not been addressed and a deep-seated sense of mistrust between ethnic groups,"" he says. ""The mining process has to be more inclusive."" When tin deposits become scarce, fighting is bound to erupt over resources. Mr Lengmang says miners have a role to play in peace-building. His agency is exploring whether they could lead training in conflict resolution, or encourage parties to sign peace accords before they start work on a deposit. But Mr Abubaker believes the industry is already doing something to foster peace. ""Mining promotes unity and understanding among the different tribes,"" he says, ""just as football does."" ""It makes us happy. I pray - and hope - that we are able to sustain it."" Crossing Divides: a week of stories about people creating connections in a polarised world.

Helping teens where shootings are 'normal'VideoVideoFlirting across the India-Pakistan border,"Armed only with food cooked by grieving mothers, Guadalupe Cruz enters the battle to prevent young people from dying on Chicago's streets. She's driving to the funeral of Jose de Jesus Aguilar, 14 - the third she's attended in six weeks. Jose entered a rival gang's territory in a stolen car with a friend. He was shot dead. ""I will pick up the chicken and bread on the way,"" says Guadalupe, better known as Lupe, braving the afternoon traffic. She needs to be at the funeral to try to persuade Jose's friends not to retaliate against the gang they believe shot him. She works forCure Violence, a public health programme,externalcreated in Chicago in 2000 to stop the spread of violence at source, the way you would treat a disease epidemic. Life and death on the lost streets of Chicago US gun culture: 10 charts Funerals are key moments for this. And food, traditionally served after Mexican burials, is essential, Lupe explains. She wants to prevent Jose's friends using eating as an excuse to go out on the street after paying their respects. Lupe is picking up food from her network of mothers who have cooked chicken, rice, salad and pastries. They began helping her after losing children to gang violence, and each greets the youth worker with a hug. Frances is accompanying her and helps load the trays into the car. Her 17-year-old son was killed some years ago, she says. ""When we talk about our children that are not here,duele- it hurts."" The Spanish word is the only one she says in her second language throughout the conversation, and it drips with her pain. They call at the home of another mother, Amy, who's cooked pasta. She also lost her son Gregory, 18, to violence. ""Closing that casket and never seeing his face again, not seeing him grow old, to see me grow old, or see him with his kids, that's the most painful thing in the world,"" she says. Too grief-stricken to get out of bed, Amy relied on Lupe to arrange the funeral. Now she will do ""whatever"" Lupe asks. ""She doesn't see rivals or gang members, she sees everybody as a community, as people. That's how we are supposed to be,"" says Amy. Jose's mother died when he was young and his father wasn't around. His death gets only a brief mention in the media, in a city where there were 650 killings in the last year - more than bigger cities like New York or Los Angeles. Lupe spends most of the day driving - hands-free set ensuring she doesn't miss a call - and fixing the final details of the funeral, far from the neighbourhoods of the two rival gangs. She talks to mothers and young people, flowing with ease between Spanish, English, formal and street. On arrival at the funeral home, Lupe and Frances carefully arrange the trays of food on a long table. Jose's friends trickle in, wearing hoodies bearing his photograph and the dates of his birth and death - so poignantly close. Some have brought their children. They huddle around the casket. They cry together and console each other. They play music for Jose. Lupe sits to talk. ""I tell them that what they're going through - going to the funeral of their 14-year-old friend - isn't normal. Because it's all been accepted and normalised. They have to carry themselves as if they were grown-ups, but they're still kids."" Lupe understands their sorrow. She grew up and works in the Little Village,La Villita, a predominantly Mexican West Side neighbourhood. She never knew her father, and her mother died when she was a child. As more young people arrive, her demeanour changes and the tension builds. ""Today is important as we could lose another life. When they get out of here, they will be carrying a lot of pain. Some of them are armed."" After the funeral, amid talk of retaliation, Lupe grabs the older, influential ones -los que los jalan(the ones who pull, lead them). She takes them for pizza, letting them spill out their emotions, and asks community leaders in both areas to take other young people away from hot spots where they usually hang out at night. The funeral is by no means the trickiest situation she has had to defuse. She tells of the time she had to go to a hospital to calm more than 50 young people who were outside. ""I talked to the hospital staff to see if I could get just one person in to find out if their friend was okay. These calls always happen at 3am."" This is typical of Cure Violence's methods. Epidemiologist Gary Slutkin, who for years battled Aids and tuberculosis in Africa, founded the organisation after concluding that violence mimics the path of these infectious diseases. The work includes detecting conflicts and cooling people down, identifying the highest risk and changing their behaviour, and changing the norms and expectations. ""Someone who's doing violence, whether they are a mass shooter or someone in a neighbourhood, has picked up that by contagion, by seeing others doing it,"" he argues, saying young people and gang members are ""miscategorised"" as bad people. ""Frankly, it's medieval - it's the way we used to look at people who had leprosy or the plague."" Lupe agrees: ""People have already put this tag on them. They're not bad people, they have a story, just like we all do. You take them out of the community and they love to go eat ice cream, they don't take advantage of you. It's the time that you give them that is important for them. We can sit for three hours and have a milkshake that will melt to water."" She knows better than to try to build bridges between gangs with long histories. Some of Chicago's biggest gangs were formed in the 1960s and 1970s and membership is inherited. Their territories - packed with foreclosed homes and boarded-up shops - are divided by long avenues, junctions and bridges. Instead, she creates links between young people who don't trust the adults they feel have failed them throughout their lives, and the adults who only read about youths in scattered press reports, or see them hanging out on corners. ""We organise activities like late night barbecues, daytime cookouts, peace festivals, vigils and marches, and other people see them cleaning, serving food, they start getting to know them. Many times they haven't even spoken to them. And they tell me 'wow, this kid's smart',"" says Lupe. Anna and Luis, a young couple with two kids, only secured their apartment after Lupe persuaded the landlord to give them a chance. ""A lot of people don't believe in us 'cause we're young"", says Anna. ""We have to show them different."" They struggle to stay on the ""right path"", Luis admits. ""It's real hard not going back to the things that I used to do 'cause I'm in the neighbourhood. I have bad times but Lupe always tells us just keep positive, doing what we're doing."" Lupe calls them daily, alerting them to stay inside whenever she hears of trouble. Luis tries to stay away from gang violence. For Luis, the key to leaving the streets was getting advice from Lupe, whom he trusted: ""You need someone who has gone through it and that's gonna go click in your mind."" Raul Gonzales, another member of the Cure Violence team, understands how youths feel. He belonged to one of the biggest gangs in the city and spent time in prison. ""[Violence is] all they know; that's how they grew. In this environment, if somebody jumps on you, you will go back and jump on them."" He takes them to a boxing club to get them off the street. If they will not listen, he thinks laterally. ""I try to talk to somebody else that I know they might listen to. Could be for example his uncle, who used to run with the group... But it's gotta be somebody credible."" ""Our programme ain't gonna stop all the conflict, but we stop a lot of problems. We do the job the police can't do, not because they don't want to do it, but because [the youths] don't want no policeman to talk to them."" It's hard to assess the impact of any programme in violence against a general backdrop of falling crime rates across the US. However, independent evaluations of the Cure Violence approach point to significant crime reductions in the communities it serves, when compared with similar areas without such programmes. In 2009, Chicago'sNorthwestern University research suggested an overall reduction,externalof between 41% and 73% across seven communities served by a combination of Cure Violence and other community efforts. It also said ""retaliation homicides"" were eradicated in five of the eight communities studied. A 2015John Jay College of Criminal Justice study,externalfound New York neighbourhoods served by Cure Violence had experienced an 18% decline in the average homicide rate between 2010 and 2013, while in comparison areas it had increased 69%. More independent studies were conducted in different cities, with similar results. The Chicago study also identified how Cure Violence workers dealt with underlying problems like unemployment, education, interpersonal relationships or more practical issues like getting identity documents. But as she sets out on her Sunday rounds, Lupe acknowledges: ""Many of these young people aren't ready for the change of life. They have to do their part."" Frankie, 17, is ready. ""I'm tired of this,"" he says. ""Tired of people getting killed every day. Watching your back."" His first step is to return to school, and Lupe gives him a letter so that they accept him the next day. She's also supporting Frankie's mother to arrange mentoring so she can help young people in her neighbourhood. ""They call her mama, and she has a lot of influence, so... she could try to guide them in the positive path,"" says Lupe. Lupe's weekend winds up at a bustling Chicago pizza restaurant where she meets Samantha, whom she mentored through high school and who is studying to become a paralegal. ""A lot of my friends were getting killed, and I just didn't want to end up like that,"" says Samantha. Over potato wedges and pizza, Lupe jokes about how tough Samantha was, recalling 2am trips to collect her from the police station. Samantha shows how she tattooed Guadalupe's name on her arm, though Lupe still isn't keen on the result. Samantha says life remains hard, describing how she and her daughter witnessed a shooting on their street corner. ""Every day someone's getting shot. Back-to-back, 10 years, I've been to, like, 10 funerals,"" she adds. Samantha pays for the meal using her own debit card, making Lupe glow with pride. As night falls, they remember when Lupe would buy pizza for Samantha and her friends every Friday - anything to keep them off the streets on a ""hot"" night. ""It's the little things, you know,"" says Lupe. ""These little things are big for them. People have failed them their whole lives. So I do this, no matter how tired I am.""
