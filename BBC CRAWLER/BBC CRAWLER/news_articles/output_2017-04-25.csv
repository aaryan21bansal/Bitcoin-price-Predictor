Ding takes charge against O'Sullivan,"Ding has not beaten O'Sullivan in a ranking event since his 9-6 victory in the Northern Ireland Trophy in 2006 World Championship 2017 Venue:The Crucible Theatre, SheffieldDates:15 April - 1 May Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC Red Button, Connected TVs, online and app. World number four Ding Junhui dominated the second session of his World Championship quarter-final with Ronnie O'Sullivan to take a 10-6 lead. Having shared eight frames in the opening session, the pair began Tuesday evening by winning a frame each. But breaks of 64, 65, 120, 59 and 56 ensured China's Ding took complete control of the 25-frame match. However, a typically rapid 104 break stopped the rot for five-time winner O'Sullivan and gave him hope. It was another two hours of gripping entertainment that maintained the trend of a break of at least 50 in every frame.

The afternoon session saw reigning championMark Selbybuild a 6-2 lead over Hong Kong'sMarco Fu,whileBarry Hawkinsis 5-3 ahead against Scottish qualifierStephen Maguire. Ronnie O'Sullivan has described himself as being ""a bit like James Blunt"" Ding, 30, has not beaten world number 12 O'Sullivan in a ranking event since his 9-6 victory in the Northern Ireland Trophy in 2006. There is a strong possibility of that run coming to an end at the Crucible after his stunning display on Tuesday evening, which began with a frame-winning 63 clearance in the ninth. O'Sullivan came from behind to win the next but was unable to repeat the feat in frame 11 as Ding seized control. Storming into a 7-5 lead before the interval, he resumed with a 120 break and went on to stretch his lead to 10-5 with a 58 in frame 15. O'Sullivan, though, produced a defiant rapid-fire 104 in the final frame to give himself a chance of matching Stephen Hendry's record of playing in 12 World Championship semi-finals. This video can not be played Why would he do that? Wilson's bad decision World number 14 Wilson had levelled from 2-0 down in the morning, helped by a 92 break, but damaged his cue tip and, after a brief stoppage for repairs, saw four-time Crucible champion Higgins open up a 5-3 lead with breaks of 62 and 59. The Scot began the evening with a 129 and, after the next two were shared, added breaks of 74 and 135 either side of the interval to lead 9-4. Wilson responded well with a 97 but Higgins won the last two to leave himself two frames from victory at 11-5. World number eight Fu has got used to doing things the hard way at this year's tournament, having fought back from 7-2 down to beat Luca Brecel and recovered from 4-1 behind to see off Neil Robertson. There seemed little chance of a comeback when he trailed world number one Selby 5-0, the Leicester man finding some of his best form to compile breaks of 80, 72 and 94. Fu went more than an hour without potting a ball before taking a scrappy sixth frame and making it 5-2 with a stylish break of 60. But Selby got Fu in a fuddle on the final red and went on to take a four-frame advantage at 6-2. They resume on Wednesday.

The organ trafficker who preys on Syrian migrants,"There's a glint of pride in Abu Jaafar's eyes as he explains what he does for a living. He used to work as a security guard in a pub but then he met a group which trades in organs. His job is to find people desperate enough to give up parts of their body for money, and the influx of refugees from Syria to Lebanon has created many opportunities. ""I do exploit people,"" he says, though he points out that many could easily have died at home in Syria, and that giving up an organ is nothing by comparison to the horrors they have already experienced. ""I'm exploiting them,"" he says, ""and they're benefitting."" His base is a small coffee shop in one of the crowded suburbs of southern Beirut, a dilapidated building covered by a plastic tarpaulin. This video can not be played ""I know what I'm doing is illegal, but I'm helping people, that's how I see it."" At the back, a room behind a rusty partition is stuffed with old furniture and has budgerigars singing in cages in each corner. From here he has arranged the sale of organs from about 30 refugees in the last three years, he says. ""They usually ask for kidneys, yet I can still find and facilitate other organs"", he says. ""They once asked for an eye, and I was able to acquire a client willing to sell his eye. ""I took a picture of the eye and sent it to the guys by Whatsapp for confirmation. I then delivered the client."" The narrow streets in which he operates are crammed with refugees. Around one in four people in Lebanon today have fled the conflict across the border in Syria. Most aren't allowed to work under Lebanese law, and many families barely get by. Among the most desperate are Palestinians who were already considered refugees in Syria, and so are not eligible to be re-registered by the UN refugee agency when they arrive in Lebanon. They live in overcrowded camps and receive very little aid. Almost as vulnerable are those who arrived from Syria after May 2015, when the Lebanese government asked the UN to stop registering new refugees. ""Those who are not registered as refugees are struggling,"" Abu Jaafar says. ""What can they do? They are desperate and they have no other means to survive but to sell their organs."" Some refugees beg on the streets - particularly children. Young boys shine shoes, dodge between cars in traffic jams to sell chewing gum or tissues through the windows, or end up exploited as child labour. Others turn to prostitution. But selling an organ is one way to make money quickly. Once Abu Jaafar has found a willing candidate he drives them, blindfolded, to a hidden location on a designated day. Sometimes the doctors operate in rented houses, transformed into temporary clinics, where the donors undergo basic blood tests before surgery. ""Once the operation is done I bring them back,"" he says. ""I keep looking after them for almost a week until they remove the stitches. The moment they lose the stitches we don't care what happens to them any longer. ""I don't really care if the client dies, I got what I wanted. It's not my problem what happens next as long as the client got paid."" His most recent client was a 17-year-old boy who left Syria after his father and brothers were killed there. He's been in Lebanon for three years with no work and mounting debt, struggling to support his mother and five sisters. So, through Abu Jaafar, he agreed to sell his right kidney for $8,000 (Â£6,250). Two days later, clearly in pain despite taking tablets, he was alternately lying down and sitting up on a tattered sofa, trying to get comfortable. His face was covered in a sheen of sweat and blood had seeped through his bandages. Abu Jaafar won't reveal how much he made from the deal. He says he doesn't know what happens to the organs after they have been removed, but he thinks they're exported. Across the Middle East there's a shortage of organs for transplant, because of cultural and religious objections to organ donation. Most families prefer immediate burial. But Abu Jaafar claims there are at least seven other brokers like him operating across Lebanon. ""Business is booming,"" he says. ""It's growing and not decreasing. It definitely boomed after the Syrian migration to Lebanon."" He knows what he does is against the law but doesn't fear the authorities. In fact he is brazen about it. His phone number is spray-painted on the walls near his home. In his neighbourhood, he is both respected and feared. As he walks around people stop to joke and argue with him. He has a handgun tucked under his leg as we talk. ""I know that what I am doing is illegal but I am helping people"", he says. ""That's how I perceive it. The client is using the money to seek a better life for himself and his family. ""He's able to buy a car and work as a taxi driver or even travel to another country. ""I am helping those people and I don't care about the law."" In fact, he says, it's the law that lets many refugees down by restricting access to work and aid. ""I am not forcing anyone to undertake the operation,"" he says. ""I am only facilitating based on someone's request."" He lights a cigarette and raises an eyebrow. ""How much for your eye?"" he asks. Abu Jaafar is not his real name - he would only agree to talk to the BBC on condition of anonymity.

The boxer who refuses to cash in on beating a champion,"Mihai Nistor was the last - and only - fighter to stop world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua. But while Joshua now earns millions, Nistor survives in his Bucharest apartment, still an amateur on a modest income. Why has he spurned boxing's riches? He sits alone on a park bench, surrounded by an endless sprawl of discoloured communist-era apartment blocks. As the midday commuter traffic bustles around him in this crowded suburb of the Romanian capital, Mihai Nistor is barely recognised by passers-by. It's just six years since Nistor stopped Anthony Joshua with a flurry of hard punches to the head in the third round of their fight at the European Amateur Championships in 2011 in Turkey, but since then their careers have taken starkly different paths. This weekend Joshua will step into the ring at London's Wembley Stadium to defend his IBF world heavyweight title in a unification fight against Wladimir Klitschko. It will be one of the biggest fights in British boxing's history, with 90,000 tickets expected to be sold, and both boxers will earn millions of pounds for a maximum 36 minutes of ring time. Anthony Joshua celebrates after defeating Charles Martin in April 2016 Nistor, 26, will watch the fight from his couch in the modest Bucharest apartment he shares with his younger rugby player brother. He still boxes as an amateur and his salary of Â£1,200 ($1,500) per month is funded by the Romanian army. But Nistor, from one of Europe's poorest and most corrupt countries, insists he doesn't dwell on the gulf between his income and Joshua's. ""I don't do this sport for money,"" he says. ""I do it for pleasure, because you don't win if you are motivated by money,"" he adds. Listen to Radio 5 live commentary from 21:00 BST and follow text updates on the BBC Sport website as Anthony Joshua takes on Wladimir Klitschko for the IBF and WBA heavyweight titles on Saturday 29 April What also gives him pleasure are his memories of beating Joshua. ""It was a special day,"" he recalls. ""My trainer said: 'Don't worry, Joshua is big but he'll go down quickly if you punch him correctly.' I didn't know who he was or what he was going to becomeâ¦ He was a good boxer, he was moving all the time and he had a strong punch."" ""I beat him in 2011 and in 2012 he was an Olympic champion,"" Nistor adds, grinning. Despite Nistor's technical knockout win in Turkey, where he won a bronze medal, he failed to qualify for the London 2012 Olympics - ""poor judges"" were to blame, he says. His old foe Joshua, on the other hand, went on to qualify and won the biggest prize in their sport - an Olympic gold. Nistor during his defeat to Iashaish of Jordan in the 2016 Olympics An Olympic boxing medal can lead amateurs to lucrative professional contracts. Indeed, not long after his spectacular London Olympics win, Joshua ditched his amateur vest and five years later, the 27-year-old is now a global superstar and a multi-millionaire. However, Nistor continues fighting amongst the amateurs, surviving on his modest income.Until recently, only amateurs could box at the Olympics and he carries an undying dream of winning a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics â despite his failed attempt to bring home a medal from Rio last year. ""I don't know what the judges were looking at,"" Nistor says, reflecting on his disappointing loss in Rio, where he was the only boxer to represent Romania. ""I lost the first round because of the emotion, but the second and third I won clearly,"" he adds. Spending time with Nistor, he gives the impression of a boxer unsure of how to advance. He keeps training, thinking about the big time, but he can't move past a marker, the Olympics, that many fighters - win or lose - would be only too glad to use as a stepping stone to launch a profitable professional career. Nistor started boxing at 16 years old, and many considered it too late for him to achieve anything meaningful in the sport. However, just three months after first lacing up his gloves, he won a national heavyweight amateur title. ""I am not too talented,"" Nistor admits. ""But I love combat and I like to workâ¦ Hard work, hard work, hard work."" He repeats it like a mantra he's grown only too familiar with during his gruelling six-day-a-week training regime. ""If you don't have much talent but you work really hard, hard work will beat talent - every time,"" he adds. Even now, Nistor's boxing style could be a tricky one for any current professional heavyweight boxer. Although Nistor is short for his division at just 6ft tall, he has an aggressive, relentless style and power in both hands. Mihai Nistor appeared on BBC Radio 5 live's Boxing with Costello and Bunce Listen to a podcast of the programme Some parts of the Romanian media have nicknamed Nistor the ""Tyson of Romania"". With his thick-set frame and looping heavy punches - like the ones that stopped Joshua six years ago - the likeness is fitting. ""I am like Tyson because I have the power and movement,"" says Nistor, strolling along a congested Bucharest street, as car horns endlessly sound and locals scramble to get their lunch, paying him no attention. Nistor is well aware that by delaying his move from the amateur to the professional code he risks missing out on some prime fighting years, but his desire to strike Olympic gold keeps on persisting. It doesn't help, either, that he wants to remain in his home country. Nistor would probably have to move abroad to a country with a more developed boxing scene than Romania if he were ever to reach his full potential as a professional fighter. Even now, Nistor has to regularly venture abroad to get quality sparring partners. ""It would be to America as that's where people make it in boxing, and people there love the boxers,"" Nistor says, matter-of-factly. Beyond his vague indifference to follow in the footsteps of Joshua, Nistor has another strong reason to delay turning professional. ""Romania has only ever had one Olympic gold-medal boxer - Nicolae Linca at the Melbourne 1956 Olympic Games,"" Nistor says. ""He's my hero. I'm delaying turning professional because I want to win a gold medal in Tokyo,"" Nistor adds. However, unlike Nistor, Linca never had the chance to cash in financially on his boxing abilities, because he fought during a period when Romania was a communist dictatorship. After boxing, Linca's life was blighted by Parkinson's Disease and he died in poverty in 2006. Nistor says that the disparity in wealth and status between him and Joshua is of little concern to him, and that he's happy with his close-knit family life, his long-term girlfriend and to have ""beaten a man who won an Olympic gold medal"". Even still, Nistor believes that he could repeat his win against Joshua if the two were to fight again. ""I see many imperfections in Joshuaâ¦ He leaves himself too visible [to take punches],"" says Nistor. ""I would study him for a month and create tactics with my coach,"" he adds. The worry for Nistor, as he gets ready to watch his old rival fighting under the bright lights of worldwide stardom, is that he might never get his own shot at the big league.

The verdict on Trump so far,"This video can not be played Donald Trump: First 100 days in 100 of his own words Determining a presidency's success by inspecting its ""first hundred days"" is a bit of an artificial construct. If humans were born with 12 fingers, then perhaps we'd be evaluating presidents based on their first 144 days instead. If the Earth rotated a bit more slowly, then presidents would have more time to notch accomplishments. Then again, 100 days is plenty of time to get a rough handle on the shape and thrust of a presidency - and to evaluate what kind of progress a leader has made toward fulfilling campaign promises. The first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency have been anything but boring or slow, but how much of it was sound and fury and how much entailed real action? Here's a quick review of some of the peaks and valleys. Let's start with the wall - not the president's only promise, but certainly one of his oldest, most high-profile ones. Candidate Trump constantly spoke of the great wall that he plans to build along the US-Mexico border at his campaign rallies, and the crowd roared in agreement when he said Mexico would pay for the project. Contrast that certainty with this tweet, which the president wrote over the weekend. ""Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall,""he tweeted,external. It's a case of Trump promises meeting political realities, in 140 characters or less. Campaign rhetoric is easy; turning talk into action in Washington is much more complicated. The administration has pledged to reshuffle some moneys to begin wall construction, but it is increasingly clear that Congress will need to find billions of dollars to make the wall a reality. That sets up a showdown between the president and legislators, with many Republicans - particularly those representing areas along the US-Mexico border - not keen on opening up the federal purse for Mr Trump's pet project. Promise kept?Nope. Mr Trump promised to choose a Supreme Court justice to fill the empty seat on the bench from a list he released during the presidential campaign - and, by tapping Neil Gorsuch, he did. ""I've always heard that the most important thing that a president of the United States does is appoint people - hopefully great people like this appointment - to the United States Supreme Court,"" Mr Trump said at Mr Gorsuch's White House swearing-in ceremony. ""And I can say this is a great honour. And I got it done in the first 100 days. That's even nice. You think that's easy?"" That kind of depends how one defines ""easy"". Mr Gorsuch's confirmation hearing was bruising, no doubt. Facing united Democratic opposition, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell broke with longstanding precedent to allow a simple majority vote for Supreme Court confirmations. Once that was done, however, it was simply a matter of the Republican majority in the Senate imposing its will. Gorsuch sworn in as justice While Mr Trump may have only had to put a name on a piece of paper and rely on Senate Republicans to do the heavy lifting, he did tick a major item of his presidential to-do list. He satisfied a Republican base that stuck with him through a tumultuous campaign on the understanding that they'd get just such a reliable conservative on the court. They may continue to stand by this president in the hope there will be more nominees like Mr Gorsuch to come. Promise kept?Definitely. ""Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated."" It's way too early for political epitaphs, but if the Trump presidency collapses under the weight of disorganisation and broken promises, this February quote from the president - made as it became increasingly clear his own party couldn't even agree on healthcare reform - will make a fitting inscription for a tombstone. At one point during the presidential campaign, Mr Trump promised that the Democratic healthcare reform legislation - Obamacare, as it has become known - would be repealed on his first day in office. Then, after the first Republican legislative effort crashed and burned in late March - 64 days into his presidency - Mr Trump backtracked on his timeline. ""I never said repeal it and replace it within 64 days,"" he said. ""I have a long time. But I want to have a great healthcare bill and plan, and we will. It will happen. And it won't be in the very distant future."" How disastrous for Trump is healthcare collapse? Since then there's been speculation that a new deal could be in the works - but such rumours have evaporated upon closer scrutiny. There's no telling what the future may bring, but the reality at this point is that healthcare reform was Mr Trump's first major legislative push - the de facto focus of his first 100 days in office - and it has done nothing but expose the Republican Party as fractured body incapable of advancing a coherent agenda. Promise kept?Uh, no. Definitely not. Mr Trump may have a bit of a mixed record when it comes to fulfilling his promises on immigration, but it's not for a lack of trying. His administration has taken two shots at curtailing the US refugee programme and preventing citizens of a handful of majority Muslim nations from entering the US, but those executive actions have been stymied by a handful of court judges (one, as Attorney General Jeff Sessions put it, residing on an ""island in the Pacific""). Mr Trump has also stepped up immigration enforcement across the US, threatened ""sanctuary cities"" that don't co-operate fully with federal immigration officials, ordered a review of immigration programmes, including H-1B visas given to high-skilled immigrants, and announced a hiring spree on border patrol agents and immigration court judges. Immigration arrests were up 32.6% in the first month and a half of the Trump presidency,according to,externalthe Washington Post, with a larger share coming from those without a prior criminal record. Meanwhile, border apprehensions have dropped. Throughout the campaign the president talked tough on immigration - even though the number of undocumented migrants entering the US had been declining over recent years. Given that the law grants the president sweeping authority over immigration policy, Mr Trump is clearly following his words with actions. Promise kept?Yes - despite the effort of ""so-called judges"" on the mainland and in Hawaii. Who is the Trump administration deporting? During the campaign, Mr Trump's foreign policy vision was a collection of sometimes contradictory, often controversial proposals. The candidate spoke of getting tough on the so-called Islamic State, Iran and China, reaffirming an alliance with Israel and mending relations with Russia. He entertained the notion of lifting restrictions on the use of torture on detainees and giving the US military more authority to act, including by targeting the families of suspected militants. Above all else, he promised to put American priorities first and downplayed support for US allies and international alliances that he deemed too burdensome. As president, the contradictions may have changed in nature but the controversy lingers. Trump Tracker: What has the US president done so far? He pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as promised and has begun a review process for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Torture remains off the table, thanks to the influence of Defence Secretary James Mattis. Mr Trump has occasionally told foreign leaders - Germany's Angela Merkel and Italy's Paolo Gentiloni, for instance - of his expectations that they increase their military spending. On the other hand, he has recently acknowledged the value of Nato membership. When it comes to China, however, he's taken a softer line. He's backed away from his promise to label the nation a ""currency manipulator"" or impose steep import tariffs, instead seeking the nation's help in dealing with North Korea. Then there's Mr Trump's missile strike on Syrian forces following that government's use of chemical weapons on its own people. It's the kind of move that candidate Trump may have dismissed as ineffective - and, in fact, reality TV star Trump had condemned in no uncertain terms in 2013, when Barack Obama proposed his own Syrian intervention. Promise kept?Yes, no, maybe. Take your pick. On 22 October, just a few weeks before election day, Candidate Trump gave a speech in Pennsylvania announcing a ""100 Day Plan to Make America Great Again"" - a contract, he said, with the American voter. Included in theaccompanying document,externalwas an outline of a series of official-sounding pieces of legislation he would ""work with Congress to introduce"" and ""fight for"" in his first 100 days. They included the Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act, the End the Offshoring Act, the Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act, the Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act, and the American Energy and Infrastructure Act. Aside from the aforementioned Obamacare repeal effort, which is currently a smoking crater somewhere on the floor of the House of Representatives, the rest of these pieces of legislation remain in the realm of unicorns and fairies. Mr Trump has said details of a tax plan are coming as soon as this week, but - as we saw with healthcare - a detailed plan creates a juicy target for opponents of all political stripes. The president signed a raft of executive actions - rolling back Obama-era regulations, authorising the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and instituting a federal hiring freeze (which has since been lifted) - but in the vast scheme of things those are low-hanging fruit for a new president. The White House has also boasted that Mr Trump has signed more laws at this point than any president since Harry Truman - but that list includes measures naming Veterans' medical clinics, making appointment to museum boards and creating a memorial to the 1991 Gulf War. Many of the remaining laws rolled back Obama-era regulations, most of which had yet to go into effect. Legislation that can last beyond any one president is a heavier lift, and Mr Trump has yet to show he has any real muscle. Promise kept?Consult your nearest unicorn. Mr Trump is far from a traditional president, so perhaps it's unfair to evaluate the first few months of his presidency in traditional ways, such as by tallying up his policy accomplishments and failures. His voters largely didn't back his candidacy based on specific promises - on the wall, on healthcare, on taxes - but because of his attitude and his promise to shake up the political system. If the performance metric is how much the Trump presidency has disrupted politics as usual, Mr Trump has posted a clear victory. He continues to dominate the national conversation with his controversial tweets and off-the cuff statements, and his actions have defied traditional political norms and standards, whether it's his apparent steadfast refusal to fill lower-level political appointments or observe precedents on open-government practices. He's lectured foreign leaders, browbeat major companies and taken a poleaxe to disfavoured media (while still giving them choice interviews when it serves his purposes, of course). Trump's potential conflicts of interest - foreign and domestic Are voters impressed with the first 100 days? A list of Trump's broken promises Mr Trump campaigned on draining the swamp, and he's taken some executive actions to limit administration officials from becoming lobbyists after they leave government service. On the other hand, his promises to avoid conflicts of interest over his wide-ranging business empire have proven vague and unenforceable and he's stocked his administration with the kind of financial insiders and Wall Street bigwigs he regularly railed against on the campaign trail. So far, however, his dedicated supporters - the ones who powered him to a narrow electoral victory if not a popular vote plurality - seem pleased as punch. According toa recent poll,external, 96% of Mr Trump's voters in November stand by their support of the man. They've apparently seen enough action to convince them that the president is doing what he said he'd do, even if it hasn't yet translated into legislative accomplishments. If the economy is humming and unemployment stays low, they'll probably remain in his corner for the long haul. For them, the apparent chaos in the nation's capital is a feature, not a bug. Promise kept?Bigly.

'Stealthing' - what you need to know,"""Stealthing"" is a term that describes when a man removes a condom during sex despite agreeing to wear one. It may not be a word you've heard before but there's a lot of discussion about it right now on social media. It's being talked about because of a US report which found cases are on the rise. Victims' charities say it must be treated as rape - and that it's a hugely under-reported problem. The study by Alexandra Brodsky inColumbia Journal of Gender and Law,externalsays it is a growing issue. ""Interviews with people who have experienced condom removal indicate that non-consensual condom removal is a common practice among young, sexually active people,"" she explains. And she says she's been contacted by lots of victims. She tweeted: It's both affirming and terrible to write about an under-acknowledged form of gender violence and hear a chorus of ""me, too"" in response.,external We've been speaking to legal experts and people who support victims of rape for a better understanding ""stealthing"". The report says it's ""non-consensual condom removal during sexual intercourse"". Put simply that means taking it off or deliberately damaging it midway through sex without telling the other person. The study warns it ""exposes victims to physical risks of pregnancy and disease"" and is ""experienced by many as a grave violation of dignity"". ""That person is potentially committing rape,"" says Sandra Paul. She's a solicitor who works at Kingsley Napley and specialises in sexual crime. She adds: ""There has to be some agreement that a condom is going to be used or there is going to be withdrawal. ""If that person then doesn't stick to those rules then the law says you don't have consent."" Sandra Paul is a solicitor who specialises in sexual crime In non-legal language, it means that if you agree to having sex with a condom and remove it, without saying, then you no longer have consent. Then it is rape. The report author speaks to a range of people who say they've been ""stealthed"". One student called Irin tells her: ""The harm mostly had to do with trust. ""He saw the risk as zero for himself and took no interest in what it might be for me, and that hurt."" The report said that ""apart from the fear of specific bad outcomes like pregnancy and STIs, all of the survivors experienced the condom removal as a disempowering, demeaning violation of a sexual agreement"". Sandra Paul tells Newsbeat that rape is when ""you penetrate another person and the other person doesn't consent"". ""Or the person doing the penetration doesn't reasonably believe that they have consent."" Sandra Paul deals with a lot of sexual assault cases and thinks ""discussing it is a good thing"". ""Starting a conversation has got to be the right thing to do,"" she explains. However not everyone is sure that it is a good idea to call it ""stealthing"". ""I always find it quite surprising when new phrases like this come up for things that are effectively just a form of sexual assault,"" says Katie Russell from the charity Rape Crisis. ""If someone consents to a specific sexual act with you using contraception, and you change the terms of that agreement mid-act then that's a sexual offence."" Katie Russell is from the charity Rape Crisis ""Giving it a term like 'stealthing' sounds relatively trivial,"" she says. ""It's a very acceptable term for something that's extremely unacceptable and actually an act of sexual violence."" ""It can be really helpful to talk to someone in confidence like a trusted friend, or family member, or a specialist confidential independent service like a Rape Crisis centre,"" Katie Russell says. ""They can just listen to you, support you and help you think through your options and what you might want to do in order to be able to cope with and recover from the traumatic experience.""

The issues dividing Le Pen and Macron,"Macron v Le Pen: Some say the contest amounts to free markets v protectionism National renewal is what both the rival French presidential candidates are promising, but they offer very different paths to get there. Liberal centrist Emmanuel Macron - winner of the first round - and nationalist Marine Le Pen are already revolutionising French politics. They have delivered a big blow to the long-dominant Socialists and conservative Republicans. Mr Macron leads a new movement called En Marche (On the Move), while Ms Le Pen is backed by the National Front (FN). They disagree on many issues, especially Europe and immigration. The decisive second round is on Sunday - and polls show Mr Macron with a firm lead. So what are the main differences between theMacron,externalandLe Pen,externalvisions? Macron: Make budget savings of â¬60bn (Â£51bn; $65bn), so that France sticks to the EU deficit limit of 3% of GDP (total output) Public investments worth â¬50bn spread over five years for environmental measures, apprenticeships, digital innovation and public infrastructure Lower corporation tax to 25% from 33.3% Le Pen: Introduce ""intelligent protectionism"", including favouring French firms in public sector contracts Turn the euro into a ""common currency"" used for trade, but restore the franc in the domestic economy Free up loans for small businesses by lowering interest charges The candidates differ over France's 35-hour working week Macron: Boost people's purchasing power by cutting their social security contributions, worth about â¬500 annually for someone on a monthly net salary of â¬2,200 Allow firms flexibility on the 35-hour working week - but extra hours worked will be free of social security deductions Maintain retirement age at 62, but unify pension rules to reduce complexity Le Pen: Impose a new tax on the hiring of foreign workers so that French citizens get priority Keep the 35-hour working week Lower the retirement age to 60 Macron: Reform the EU by giving the eurozone a separate budget, finance minister and parliament (MEPs from the 19 countries that use the euro) In Brexit negotiations, insist that EU Single Market rules apply fully to all trade partners Promote free trade deals likeCeta - the EU-Canada deal Le Pen: Negotiate with the EU to repatriate powers to France and reform the bloc, then hold an in/out referendum on France's EU membership Restore full border controls, leave the Schengen open borders system, appoint 6,000 new customs officers Scrap the EU posted workers directive, to block competition from foreign workers in France Ms Le Pen wants to suspend immigration while Mr Macron insists on fluency in French Macron: Create a 5,000-strong force of EU border guards Make fluency in French the main qualification for obtaining French nationality Give all religious leaders comprehensive training in France's secular values Le Pen: Suspend all legal immigration, restore border controls and then limit immigration to 10,000 annually Automatically deport all foreign criminals and foreigners with Islamist links, close ""extremist"" mosques Grant asylum only to people who apply for it at French diplomatic missions abroad In depth: Meteoric rise of Emmanuel Macron In depth: Is Marine Le Pen far right? Five things the French election has told us France heads into uncharted waters Mr Macron wants an EU defence fund, Ms Le Pen wants to recruit more soldiers Macron: Recruit 10,000 new police officers Expand prisons to house an extra 15,000 Create an EU defence fund to promote joint military projects and set up a permanent European headquarters Le Pen: Recruit 15,000 new police officers Create 40,000 extra prison places Boost armed forces by 50,000 personnel to return to 2007 levels and pull France out of Nato's command structure Ms Le Pen wants the return of school uniforms, Mr Macron wants to ban mobile phones in schools Macron: In areas of special need - notably poor suburbs (banlieues) - limit class sizes in primary schools to 12 pupils per teacher Ban children's use of mobile phones at school At the age of 18 French teenagers will get a ""Cultural Pass"" worth â¬500 to spend on cultural pursuits such as the cinema, theatre, books Le Pen: Get back to basics - prioritise teaching of French, history and maths Restore school uniforms and respect for teachers Make schools ""secular zones"" free of social conflict Macron: Cut the number of public servants by 120,000 - through natural wastage, but excluding hospitals MPs must not work as consultants, nor employ family members Cut the total number of parliamentary deputies and senators by about one-third Le Pen: Simplify the civil service by cutting the layers of state administration from six to three Cut the number of deputies to 300 (from 577) and senators to 200 (from 348) Introduce proportional representation in all elections (current parliamentary elections are first-past-the-post) Mr Macron is for green technology, Ms Le Pen supports nuclear energy Macron: Half of food provided in school and work canteens must be organic or locally produced France must be the world leader in developing green technologies One million poorly insulated homes must be renovated Le Pen: Support nuclear energy and modernise it - and keep Fessenheim atomic power station running Boost investment in French renewable energy firms, under the supervision of state utility EDF, but stop wind energy projects Cut pollution by maximising production in France instead of shipping goods globally % EmmanuelMacron % MarineLe Pen Please enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart.

Chris Ofili is weaving magic,"Chris Ofili's tapestry took three years to create I know some folk think Chris Ofili has gone off the boil since his Turner Prize-winning heyday, when he was considered one of Charles Saatchi's gang of Young British Artists. Back then, Ofili incorporated elephant dung and cut-outs from porn mags in his paintings, which upset Mayor Giuliani considerably (and the current President who called Ofili's painting, Holy Virgin Mary, ""absolutely gross"") when Saatchi took his Sensation show to NYC in 1999. Nowadays, the Mancunian artist lives and works in Trinidad and produces lyrical paintings full of myth and mysticism, infused with the spirits of Henri Matisse and William Blake. El Greco-like elongations have taken the place of porn, the turquoise of the Caribbean Sea now as present as was once elephant dung. I like his new work. I don't think he's lost form, just moved on. The core of what he does is the same, which is to mix pop culture and art history. From a technical point of view it seems to me that his sensitivity to colour has developed, and his line is more assured. The effect of moving from a modern metropolis to a rural island culture has clearly had a big impact on how he perceives and represents the world. Ofili was made a CBE earlier this month All of which can be seen in his latest work, a large-scale tapestry called The Caged Bird's Song (a riff on Maya Angelou's book, I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings) currently hanging at the National Gallery in London, before taking up permanent residence at the Clothworkers' Company - the London Livery Company that commissioned it. It is arranged as a triptych, with the two side panels featuring standing figures pulling back curtains to reveal a mythical world. The male figure on the right holds a cage in which a songbird is perched, while the woman on the left has a sprig of black berries clasped between her fingers drooping in anticipation of being eaten by the bird. The central panel has two lovers sitting by a rock in front of the sea. The man plays his guitar, while the woman drinks a green potion funnelling down from a tree above her head. If she looked up she would spot a man with a bow tie (based on the footballer Mario Balotelli) hiding in the branches, pouring the elixir she is knocking back. The tapestry was hand-woven by Dovecot Studios in Edinburgh, whose weavers have done a magnificent job in transposing Ofili's small watercolour painting into an enormous woollen wall-hanging. Had it been a single weaver working on the project and not four or five, it would have taken sixteen years to complete (it took just over three years). The detail is remarkable, as is the weavers' ability to capture the fluidity of a watercolour painting in wool. For the viewer, the tapestry is a celebration of nature and love. But it is also a very real celebration of a craft skill that is sadly dying out in the UK. According to Peter Langley of The Clothworkers' Company, there are only two professional hand-weaving tapestry studios left in the UK. It'd be great if this artwork were the catalyst for a weaving renaissance. Chris Ofili - Weaving Magic runs at the National Gallery in London from 26 April to 28 August 2017.

How Nepal quake turned women into builders,"Nepal needs women like Sanumaya to help rebuild Reconstruction in Nepal has been slow since a devastating earthquake two years ago. But in some rural areas women are breaking with tradition and picking up tools to speed things up. Sanumaya Kumal does everything from carrying sand and bricks, to digging foundations. In a badly affected district north-west of Kathmandu, she and other women are helping rebuild houses damaged by the quake. Women have traditionally been limited to household chores but with many men working abroad, Nepal faces a lack of manpower at a crucial time - hence Sanumaya's move into construction. ""I am very happy with my job. I can do everything that a male mason can do,"" says Sanumaya, who used to work on a farm. Her other tasks include building walls, roof-fitting and plastering. Sanumaya says she's just as good at the work as the men According to official estimates, nearly 1,500 young Nepalis travel to the Gulf and the Middle East every day in search of jobs. Officials say this has created a labour shortage locally and is even holding up reconstruction and essential work on schools and health centres. But in the areas worst hit by the 25 April 2015 earthquake, women are gradually taking up prominent roles in reconstruction. More than $4bn has been pledged in post-quake aid but progress in one of the world's poorest countries has been painfully slow. The disaster killed nearly 9,000 people and damaged a million houses. Rural women can earn a good wage building - and they say it's safe Various national and international organisations have been helping the women gain the skills they need to build. And the women say they are earning a decent living, as well as being happy that they are taking part in important national work. Nepal earthquake: One year on Patience wearing thin after quake Your quake pictures before and after then and now Sanumaya was one of eight women the BBC found working at the building site in the town of Bidur in Nuwakot district. Her fellow construction worker Srijana Kumal says she likes the work because the pay is attractive. ""Women are facing a lot of problems when they go abroad for work,"" she told the BBC. ""Almost all the houses in the villages are damaged. We have a lot of work to do here and the working conditions are very safe."" Sanumaya and her friends are making about 1,200 Nepalese rupees ($11.50; Â£9) for a day's work in their new roles, a decent sum compared with other manual jobs in rural Nepal. Many of Nepal's men are working abroad, or don't have the right building skills The Post Disaster Recovery Framework states that Nepal needs nearly 60,000 skilled building workers to complete the reconstruction of houses within five years. However, officials say that as well as the manpower shortage, many existing construction workers do not know how to build houses to earthquake-resistant specifications. There are no reliable figures on how many women are currently involved in reconstruction in Nepal. But the United Nations and other donor agencies who are providing training to construction workers say they have given high priority to enrolling women on their courses. And Sanumaya and her colleagues have no shortage of work. ""With the reconstruction going on, I am busy almost every day,"" she says.

The organ trafficker who preys on refugees,"There's a glint of pride in Abu Jaafar's eyes as he explains what he does for a living. He used to work as a security guard in a pub but then he met a group which trades in organs. His job is to find people desperate enough to give up parts of their body for money, and the influx of refugees from Syria to Lebanon has created many opportunities. ""I do exploit people,"" he says, though he points out that many could easily have died at home in Syria, and that giving up an organ is nothing by comparison to the horrors they have already experienced. ""I'm exploiting them,"" he says, ""and they're benefitting."" His base is a small coffee shop in one of the crowded suburbs of southern Beirut, a dilapidated building covered by a plastic tarpaulin. This video can not be played ""I know what I'm doing is illegal, but I'm helping people, that's how I see it."" At the back, a room behind a rusty partition is stuffed with old furniture and has budgerigars singing in cages in each corner. From here he has arranged the sale of organs from about 30 refugees in the last three years, he says. ""They usually ask for kidneys, yet I can still find and facilitate other organs"", he says. ""They once asked for an eye, and I was able to acquire a client willing to sell his eye. ""I took a picture of the eye and sent it to the guys by Whatsapp for confirmation. I then delivered the client."" The narrow streets in which he operates are crammed with refugees. Around one in four people in Lebanon today have fled the conflict across the border in Syria. Most aren't allowed to work under Lebanese law, and many families barely get by. Among the most desperate are Palestinians who were already considered refugees in Syria, and so are not eligible to be re-registered by the UN refugee agency when they arrive in Lebanon. They live in overcrowded camps and receive very little aid. Almost as vulnerable are those who arrived from Syria after May 2015, when the Lebanese government asked the UN to stop registering new refugees. ""Those who are not registered as refugees are struggling,"" Abu Jaafar says. ""What can they do? They are desperate and they have no other means to survive but to sell their organs."" Some refugees beg on the streets - particularly children. Young boys shine shoes, dodge between cars in traffic jams to sell chewing gum or tissues through the windows, or end up exploited as child labour. Others turn to prostitution. But selling an organ is one way to make money quickly. Once Abu Jaafar has found a willing candidate he drives them, blindfolded, to a hidden location on a designated day. Sometimes the doctors operate in rented houses, transformed into temporary clinics, where the donors undergo basic blood tests before surgery. ""Once the operation is done I bring them back,"" he says. ""I keep looking after them for almost a week until they remove the stitches. The moment they lose the stitches we don't care what happens to them any longer. ""I don't really care if the client dies, I got what I wanted. It's not my problem what happens next as long as the client got paid."" His most recent client was a 17-year-old boy who left Syria after his father and brothers were killed there. He's been in Lebanon for three years with no work and mounting debt, struggling to support his mother and five sisters. So, through Abu Jaafar, he agreed to sell his right kidney for $8,000 (Â£6,250). Two days later, clearly in pain despite taking tablets, he was alternately lying down and sitting up on a tattered sofa, trying to get comfortable. His face was covered in a sheen of sweat and blood had seeped through his bandages. Abu Jaafar won't reveal how much he made from the deal. He says he doesn't know what happens to the organs after they have been removed, but he thinks they're exported. Across the Middle East there's a shortage of organs for transplant, because of cultural and religious objections to organ donation. Most families prefer immediate burial. But Abu Jaafar claims there are at least seven other brokers like him operating across Lebanon. ""Business is booming,"" he says. ""It's growing and not decreasing. It definitely boomed after the Syrian migration to Lebanon."" He knows what he does is against the law but doesn't fear the authorities. In fact he is brazen about it. His phone number is spray-painted on the walls near his home. In his neighbourhood, he is both respected and feared. As he walks around people stop to joke and argue with him. He has a handgun tucked under his leg as we talk. ""I know that what I am doing is illegal but I am helping people"", he says. ""That's how I perceive it. The client is using the money to seek a better life for himself and his family. ""He's able to buy a car and work as a taxi driver or even travel to another country. ""I am helping those people and I don't care about the law."" In fact, he says, it's the law that lets many refugees down by restricting access to work and aid. ""I am not forcing anyone to undertake the operation,"" he says. ""I am only facilitating based on someone's request."" He lights a cigarette and raises an eyebrow. ""How much for your eye?"" he asks. Abu Jaafar is not his real name - he would only agree to talk to the BBC on condition of anonymity.

Battle for Welsh votes shows Tory ambitions,"This video can not be played Labour voters in Porthcawl weigh up their options She hardly cuts the jib of a radical. But despite warnings against complacency from the prime minister's own lips today, be in no doubt - the Tories are deadly serious about a potential reshaping of Britain at this election. Any day on the trail is precious campaigning time. Leaders only tend to turn up where they think they are in the game. So a Welsh visit, Theresa May's fifth in three months, is revealing. It shows the Conservatives are not just contemplating a bigger majority by scooping up traditional Tory-Labour marginal seats in England. But even if you ignore the polls, senior sources indicate they could possibly return to levels of support not seen in Wales for more than 30 years. And privately they expect gains in Scotland too. Theresa May hopes to make her claim there are no Tory no-go areas come true. The European referendum has redrawn the map. She wants to colour it blue. For that to happen here in Wales, that means overturning decades of support for Labour in many areas. Are voters ready to do that in high enough numbers? It's of course far too early to tell. Don't forget the Tories already improved their share of the vote significantly in 2015, winning 11 seats. But on the Porthcawl seafront in Bridgend, the backyard of the Welsh Labour leader Carwyn Jones, we met plenty of voters who are certainly ready to consider it. The Edwards, father and son, told me they'd both been Labour voters all their lives. But could they switch? Mark told me his 85-year-old father had already done so. He said ""she is wonderful, best we've had,"" when he started talking about Theresa May. Mr Edwards senior told me he had been 'life-long Labour' but that Jeremy Corbyn was ""30 or 40 years out of date - he wants to introduce a gimmick, communism"". He was plainly angry about what's happened to the Labour party in recent years, saying it had been led by ""conmen"". Mr Edwards parting shot was ""bye, bye Mr Corbyn"". Labour has held Bridgend for the past 30 years Another voter, Brian Holley presented his own dilemma, that could be shared by many voters in Wales, where overall, the vote was to leave the EU. Brian told me he'd voted to Leave but his local Labour MP had backed Remain. That was reason for him to be, as he expressed it, ""on the border"" between sticking with Labour and voting Tory for the first time. Sharing a morning cuppa with him was Eira Linehan, who said for the ""first time ever"" she was considering voting Tory because while she agreed with Jeremy Corbyn's ideas, they wouldn't work in the ""real world"". They said ""we're all Labour"" in their constituency, but they are likely to vote Tory because of Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, even though, ""my father will be spinning in his grave"". Conversations about voting intentions seven weeks out are absolutely no substitute for the final poll of course. And we are only at the early stages of this campaign. It's worth noting too there were warnings of Labour taking heavy fire in the Welsh Assembly elections last year. In the end, they remained the largest party, and Carwyn Jones kept his job as First Minister, albeit with the help of Plaid Cymru. Yet even the Welsh Labour leader was plain to the BBC today that Jeremy Corbyn still has to ""prove himself"", warning there is a ""mountain to climb"". In remarks that could become very significant after the election, Mr Jones was clear ""Jeremy is leading the campaign and Jeremy will take credit or responsibility"". He also called for a manifesto that has the ""widest buy-in possible from people"". But 'wide buy-in'? Support that Labour can truly bank on? Not a bit of it. Yet, as Theresa May left the community centre where she had talked to activists tonight, a small, but determined crowd had been waiting in the rain, if only for the chance to shout at her car as her convoy left at speed. As she swept away, the PM won't be in any doubt that winning Wales or any traditionally Labour territories won't be easy. And in the volatile world of 2017 politics, there is nowhere where she can be guaranteed of a universally warm welcome.

Is Labour's Brexit plan too subtle?,"Sir Keir Starmer: ""A brain the size of China""? If in years to come, students are asked an essay question - Is Nuance an Effective Weapon In  Politics? - they might cite Labour's position on Brexit in 2017 in their answer. As things stand, with the party trailing in the polls, it would appear that if it is a weapon at all, it's been decommissioned. On the surface, Labour has a difficult task. It has to attract - or at least not repel - those Labour voters that backed Leave in last year's EU referendum, as well as those who backed Remain. Labour 'day one' pledge to EU nationals Brexit: Labour wants customs union talks Where Britain's parties stand on Brexit The Liberal Democrats - starting from a low base -  need only to attract a small percentage of the 48% who voted Remain to improve their representation in Parliament. So campaigning to reverse the result of the referendum - by having a second one - carries little political risk for them. The Conservatives can pretty much go hammer and tongs for the UKIP vote by saying they can deliver on Brexit - and achieve sympathetic headlines from some of the tabloids as a bonus. Labour has a trickier balancing act to perform but some in the party's ranks wonder if their frontbench isn't making the issue more difficult for itself than it need be. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer set out Labour's position to an audience of successful business people, professionals, lobbyists and one or two trade unionists today,  the vast majority of whom were Remainers. Tim Farron has nothing to lose by promising second referendum Sir Keir tried to emphasise the differences between Labour and the Conservatives - Labour would prioritise trade with the EU; it might stay in the customs union; it would give EU citizens a unilateral guarantee that they could stay on in Britain; and, symbolically, it would ditch the Great Repeal Bill and emphasise the continuation of EU rights post-Brexit. But some in the audience were privately worried that the differences with the Conservatives were too subtle. General election campaigns are painted in primary colours, not in shades of grey. Sir Keir ruled out a second referendum because he said Labour had to ""genuinely"" accept the referendum result but also, for practical reasons, he felt there would have to be transitional arrangements at the end of the two-year Article 50 process so the final nature of any deal might not be apparent for six years. Now when Sir Keir was introduced, his audience of achievers were informed that he had a ""brain the size of China"". But some who heard him speak - while not doubting the Asiatic extent of the former Director of Public Prosecutions' legal mind - privately wondered whether his political nous was more in the Luxembourg or Monaco range. Because while a second referendum might not turn out to be practical, signalling a willingness to hold one might rally Remain votes to Labour and create a far less subtle divide between his party and the Conservatives. And while many in the audience like and sympathised with him - so much so that one of them confided that he had refrained from asking a difficult question - they were keen for more clarity. The shadow Brexit secretary told them that he would put jobs and the economy first. Sir Keir Starmer left some in his audience wanting more He said immigration shouldn't be the ""over-arching"" concern in negotiations. But he also insisted that free movement would end when Britain left the EU. He was asked by Sir Roger Lyons - a  former union leader - what was wrong with the ""Norway model"" - a country outside the EU which has traded free movement for single market access. That would indeed involve putting the economy before control of immigration. Sir Keir said that what works for Norway wouldn't necessarily work for the UK. He preferred a bespoke deal. He then made clear that migration was a key concern after all: ""We must listen to what people tell us about immigration."" It was only in an interview with the BBC's John Pienaar that he indicated that negotiations to achieve a good trade deal with the EU might involve discussion of free movement of labour (not of all people, as at present). In other words, the freedom of EU citizens to move to take up offers of work. But this wasn't said loudly and proudly in the speech itself. So not only some in the audience but former - and even two current frontbenchers - have been questioning privately whether the party's message should be more robustly opposed to Mrs May's apparent Brexit strategy, and should be more explicit about a route back to the EU if negotiations go badly. Some of them have read an analysis by polling expert Professor John Curtice, which concluded: ""Most of those who voted Labour in 2015 - including those living in Labour seats in the North and the Midlands - backed Remain. ""The party is thus at greater risk of losing votes to the pro-Remain Liberal Democrats than to pro-Brexit UKIP."" But for now the strategy, if not all the detail, is clear -  the desire to appeal to Leave voters on immigration and jobs, and to Remainers in vying to enjoy a close partnership with the EU and as many of the benefits of the single market as possible. That requires a nuanced message. So that essay question will be definitively answered in this election. But with Labour's campaign messages emphasising public services, the NHS, and the economy - and their determination not to allow this to be a ""Brexit election"" - I suspect the party's strategists already know the answer.

Reality Check: Have we seen record numbers of jobs?,"The claim:There is a record number of jobs in the UK. Reality Check verdict:The number of jobs in the UK is indeed at a record level as are the numbers of people employed and the proportion of those aged between 16 and 64 who are in work. Prime Minister Theresa May has been speaking to a Conservative rally in south Wales. She claimed that the evidence for her strong leadership could be seen, among other things, in the ""record number of jobs"". Thelatest figures from the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) suggest that between December 2016 and February 2017 there were 31.84 million people in work. The figure is actually a touch below the one for November to January, but the difference is well within the margin of error. The November to January figure was indeed a record number, but with a growing population the employment rate is probably more relevant. The employment rate for those aged between 16 and 64 was 74.6% in the latest figures, which is also the highest since comparable records began, in 1971. That picture wasnot uniform across the UK,externalthough, with Wales, where the prime minister was speaking, having a 73% employment rate between December and February. Only north-east of England, the West Midlands and Northern Ireland have lower rates. While those are the figures everyone usually reports, they are not, strictly speaking, the same as there being a record number of jobs, because one employed person can have more than one job. The ONS also releases figures forworkforce jobs,external, which are collected from businesses rather than workers. That suggests there were 34.62 million jobs in December 2016, the highest since comparable records began in 1958. The number of people working part-time has risen considerably since 2010, although it has been relatively stable for the past couple of years. The vast majority (85%) of UK workers are employees rather than being self-employed, but since 2008, 40% of the overall increase in the workforce has been down to a growth in the number of people who are self-employed. Some of this shift will be down to people working in the so-called ""gig economy"" - that is, people in fairly insecure work such as driving cabs or delivering takeaways. Because these changes have been so recent and rapid, there is no breakdown in the official statistics, which means we can't say how much of the increase in self-employment is down to insecure working and how much to entrepreneurship. Think tank the New Economics Foundationpublished research,externalin December, which suggested that in London the gig economy had grown by almost three-quarters since 2010.

Could 2017 be a tactical election?,"Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system means that lots of MPs are elected on fewer than half of the votes cast in their constituencies. At the last election, 333 out of 650 winning candidates received less than 50% of the vote. Those MPs could have been defeated if all the people who voted against them had gone for the same alternative candidate. Clearly, that would never happen everywhere. But parties who agree on some of the main issues potentially have a lot to gain if they can co-ordinate their supporters. One option is to encourage tactical voting. A more direct approach is to enter some sort of alliance or pact which sees parties choosing not to put forward candidates in certain seats. Even without an agreement, parties can try to affect the result simply by choosing not to contest some constituencies. It looks as though there's going to be considerably more co-ordination of this kind in 2017 than we've seen at previous elections. As a strategy, though, it does rely on voters being prepared to vote for a candidate from a party which would not have been their first choice. One part of the country where electoral deals have been used before is Northern Ireland. In 2015, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) agreed a pact not to stand against each other in four constituencies: Belfast North, Belfast East, Fermanagh & South Tyrone, and Newry & Armagh. The deal was pretty successful. The unionist candidate won in three of the four seats. And the Sinn Fein majority was halved in Newry & Armagh. General election: What you need to know The seats that could decide the election This year, the deal looks as though it may be extended. The UUP have already said they won't run in three seats and the two parties are having discussions about a new pact. And for the first time, the SDLP say they're prepared to co-operate with Sinn Fein as part of a wider deal between anti-Brexit parties that could also involve the Greens and the Alliance Party. The outcome of negotiations could have a significant impact in quite a few constituencies. In the rest of the UK, this kind of deal has been very rare in recent years but it looks as though there will be more co-operation between parties this time. One reason is Brexit. It's a crucial issue for all of the parties and, significantly, an issue which cut across parties but cleanly divided voters into two camps. UKIP leader Paul Nuttall has said he will put ""country before party"" by not standing candidates in some Conservative/Labour marginals where there is a strongly pro-Brexit MP or where a pro-Brexit candidate has a chance of ousting a pro-Remain MP. On the other side of the debate, former Prime Minister Tony Blair has also said that he was prepared to ""work with anyone"" to stop candidates who back ""Brexit at any cost"" although he didn't suggest a formal electoral pact. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  Brexit isn't the only issue. The Green Party is seeking support for what they call a ""progressive alliance"". Co-leaders Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley have written to Labour and the Liberal Democrats calling for a meeting ""to discuss ways to beat the Tories at the general election and deliver a fairer voting system"". Some of their local parties have suggested deals with Labour and Liberal Democrat rivals. For example, Greens have saidthey would stand aside in Plymouth Sutton & Devonportif Labour returned the favour in Totnes. Liberal Democrats in Brighton are considering standing aside in the Greens' only seat - Brighton Pavilion. Former Lib Dem MP, Sir Vince Cable, who is seeking re-election tweeted his support for the idea. The Greens have also unilaterally decided not to contest Labour-held Ealing Central & Acton, just as they did at the Richmond Park by-election in December where the Lib Dems overturned Zac Goldsmith's 23,000 majority. And there are reports of several other possible deals and arrangements around the country. All of this negotiating will only be worth it if voters are prepared to back a party that isn't their first choice. There can be no guarantee that the Green voters will agree to switch en masse to the Labour candidate if the Greens stand aside. The evidence from Northern Ireland is that pacts can work. But in that case they're based on a long-established division between unionist and nationalist voters. In the rest of the country it's harder to split the parties into two blocs so neatly. However, voters do not identify as strongly with individual parties as they did in the past so there is probably more scope than previously for switching between parties. And Brexit may well give voters a reason to vote for a candidate from a party that they wouldn't previously have considered.

Can the Tories really win in Wales?,"This video can not be played Labour voters in Porthcawl weigh up their options She hardly cuts the jib of a radical. But despite warnings against complacency from the prime minister's own lips today, be in no doubt - the Tories are deadly serious about a potential reshaping of Britain at this election. Any day on the trail is precious campaigning time. Leaders only tend to turn up where they think they are in the game. So a Welsh visit, Theresa May's fifth in three months, is revealing. It shows the Conservatives are not just contemplating a bigger majority by scooping up traditional Tory-Labour marginal seats in England. But even if you ignore the polls, senior sources indicate they could possibly return to levels of support not seen in Wales for more than 30 years. And privately they expect gains in Scotland too. Theresa May hopes to make her claim there are no Tory no-go areas come true. The European referendum has redrawn the map. She wants to colour it blue. For that to happen here in Wales, that means overturning decades of support for Labour in many areas. Are voters ready to do that in high enough numbers? It's of course far too early to tell. Don't forget the Tories already improved their share of the vote significantly in 2015, winning 11 seats. But on the Porthcawl seafront in Bridgend, the backyard of the Welsh Labour leader Carwyn Jones, we met plenty of voters who are certainly ready to consider it. The Edwards, father and son, told me they'd both been Labour voters all their lives. But could they switch? Mark told me his 85-year-old father had already done so. He said ""she is wonderful, best we've had,"" when he started talking about Theresa May. Mr Edwards senior told me he had been 'life-long Labour' but that Jeremy Corbyn was ""30 or 40 years out of date - he wants to introduce a gimmick, communism"". He was plainly angry about what's happened to the Labour party in recent years, saying it had been led by ""conmen"". Mr Edwards parting shot was ""bye, bye Mr Corbyn"". Labour has held Bridgend for the past 30 years Another voter, Brian Holley presented his own dilemma, that could be shared by many voters in Wales, where overall, the vote was to leave the EU. Brian told me he'd voted to Leave but his local Labour MP had backed Remain. That was reason for him to be, as he expressed it, ""on the border"" between sticking with Labour and voting Tory for the first time. Sharing a morning cuppa with him was Eira Linehan, who said for the ""first time ever"" she was considering voting Tory because while she agreed with Jeremy Corbyn's ideas, they wouldn't work in the ""real world"". They said ""we're all Labour"" in their constituency, but they are likely to vote Tory because of Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, even though, ""my father will be spinning in his grave"". Conversations about voting intentions seven weeks out are absolutely no substitute for the final poll of course. And we are only at the early stages of this campaign. It's worth noting too there were warnings of Labour taking heavy fire in the Welsh Assembly elections last year. In the end, they remained the largest party, and Carwyn Jones kept his job as First Minister, albeit with the help of Plaid Cymru. Yet even the Welsh Labour leader was plain to the BBC today that Jeremy Corbyn still has to ""prove himself"", warning there is a ""mountain to climb"". In remarks that could become very significant after the election, Mr Jones was clear ""Jeremy is leading the campaign and Jeremy will take credit or responsibility"". He also called for a manifesto that has the ""widest buy-in possible from people"". But 'wide buy-in'? Support that Labour can truly bank on? Not a bit of it. Yet, as Theresa May left the community centre where she had talked to activists tonight, a small, but determined crowd had been waiting in the rain, if only for the chance to shout at her car as her convoy left at speed. As she swept away, the PM won't be in any doubt that winning Wales or any traditionally Labour territories won't be easy. And in the volatile world of 2017 politics, there is nowhere where she can be guaranteed of a universally warm welcome.

Key elements include: No longer being bound by EU law and European Court of Justice rulings Quitting the EU single market and seeking a ""comprehensive"" free trade deal in its place Striking trade deals with other countries around the world A ""great repeal bill"" to convert existing EU law into UK legislation to be retained or scrapped Being prepared to walk away from talks: ""No deal is better than a bad deal."" Aiming for an ""early agreement"" to resolve the status of expats in the UK and EU Leaving the EU customs union and seeking a new customs agreement An as-yet unspecified immigration system to replace the free movement of EU citizens, aiming to bring total net migration below 100,000 Keeping all employment rights currently guaranteed by EU law Promising the ""voices and interests"" of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be heard What we don't know:The Conservatives have not said how they will control migration from the EU after Brexit. They have also not committed to the size of any separation payment they would accept, beyond saying the UK would meet its international obligations. They have not specified which matters returning from Brussels will be handed to devolved administrations and which will be kept at Westminster. Negotiating style:Mrs May has talked tough towards the EU in recent weeks, claiming some key figures were trying to interfere in the general election and promising to be a ""bloody difficult woman"" during negotiations. Where the MPs stand: More Tory MPs backed Remain than Leave in last year's referendum - but they now strongly support the UK leaving - in February, only one voted against the government beginning Brexit by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. All but one Tory MPs supported Theresa May in invoking Brexit Risks and rewards:Theresa May would use an election victory to say the country is uniting around her approach to Brexit, and has moved on from the divisions of the referendum campaign. But her uncompromising approach to leaving could upset some of the 48% who wanted to stay in, with the Lib Dems hoping to capitalise in areas - like London's Richmond Park in last year's by-election - that backed Remain. In short:The Labour Party campaigned against Brexit in the referendum but now says the result must be honoured, and is aiming for a ""close new relationship with the EU"" with workers' rights protected. How the party sees Brexit:Labour has set out several demands and tests it says Brexit must meet: Protecting all existing workers' rights, consumer rights and environmental protections Aiming for ""tariff-free access"" to the EU single market, while accepting ""unchanged access"" is impossible Leaving the option of the customs union on the table Refusing to accept a ""no deal"" scenario No second referendum on the final deal - but giving MPs a decisive say on what happens next Guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals living and working in the UK to stay in the country from ""day one"" No target numbers for migration levels Remaining in EU schemes like Erasmus and the 80bn euro (Â£69bn) Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme Protecting EU structural funding for the rest of the Parliament A ""presumption of devolution"" whereby devolved powers transferred from Brussels will automatically go to devolved nations and regions What we don't know:Like the Conservatives, Labour has yet to spell out how it will manage migration after Brexit, and has not been drawn on the size of ""divorce bill"" it would be willing to pay. Negotiating style:Jeremy Corbyn says he is aiming for ""sensible and serious negotiations"" and will not be ""threatening Europe"". Where the MPs stand:The vast majority of Labour MPs backed Remain ahead of the referendum - but most followed party orders to allow Article 50 to be invoked in February's vote. Risks and rewards:Labour is hoping its acceptance of the result will fend off attacks from the Tories and UKIP in Leave-backing areas - including Stoke Central where it won February's by-election. But there are divisions among MPs on the best way forward, and Labour faces the challenge of having to appeal to both sides of a polarising debate. General election: Your questions answered Brexit: All you need to know The Lib Dems hope a pro-EU stance will help them repeat their Richmond Park success In short:The Liberal Democrats are strongly pro-EU, and have promised to stop what they call a ""disastrous hard Brexit"". How they see Brexit:Central to the Lib Dems' offer is another referendum - this time on the terms of the final Brexit deal - in which the party would campaign to stay in the EU. The Lib Dems also say they will fight with ""every fibre of their being"" to protect existing aspects of EU membership, such as the single market, customs union and the free movement of people. They would guarantee EU citizens' rights and remain in Europe-wide schemes like Erasmus. Where the MPs stand:All of the Lib Dem MPs backed staying in the EU, and seven out of nine opposed triggering Article 50, with two abstaining. Risks and rewards:The Lib Dems are hoping their pro-EU pitch will help them gather voters in pro-Remain areas, as when they captured Richmond Park in London in December's by-election. But according to estimates based on the referendum results, two of their sitting MPs represent areas that backed Leave last June - which might make the party's second referendum policy a tough sell on the doorstep. In short:SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon wants Scotland to have a special status after Brexit and for a second independence referendum to take place before the UK leaves. How they see Brexit:The SNP's manifesto says it will demand a place for the Scottish government at the Brexit negotiating table. It says it will fight to keep Scotland in the EU single market. The SNP says it will also press the UK government to guarantee the status of NHS workers from mainland Europe, and oppose any attempt to treat the fishing industry as a ""bargaining chip"". Once negotiations are complete, and before the UK has left, the SNP wants a referendum on Scottish independence to take place. Where the MPs stand:The SNP's 54 MPs voted en masse against triggering Article 50 and are expected to maintain their vocal opposition to Brexit in the next Parliament. Risks and rewards:The SNP will hope to harness Scotland's support for remaining in the EU (it voted Remain by 62% to 38%). But a significant minority of its supporters are thought to have backed Leave - while the Tories are said to be targeting the Moray seat of SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson, where Remain only narrowly saw off the Leave campaign in the EU referendum. UKIP says it will ensure the government does not ""backslide"" on Brexit In short:UKIP has long campaigned to leave the EU - and having finished on the winning side in the referendum, is now styling itself as the ""guard dog of Brexit"". How they see Brexit:The party has set six ""key tests"" for Brexit: Supremacy of Parliament, full control of migration, a ""maritime exclusive economic zone"" around the UK's coastline, a seat on the World Trade Organisation, no ""divorce"" payment to the EU and for Brexit to be ""done and dusted"" by the end of 2019. Green Party of England and Wales joint leader Caroline Lucas has called for a second EU referendum on the Brexit deal reached with Brussels, and the Greens have promised ""full opposition"" to what they call ""extreme Brexit"". Plaid Cymru, which campaigned to stay in the EU, says it accepts that the people of Wales voted to leave, but says single market membership should be preserved to protect Welsh jobs. The DUP campaigned in favour of leaving the EU - and, in its manifesto for this year's Assembly elections, said it wanted to see a ""positive"" relationship with the rest of Europe, involving ""mutual access to our markets to pursue common interests"". Having campaigned to stay in the EU, the SDLP's MPs have opposed the invoking of Article 50, saying it is being done ""against the will of people in Northern Ireland"", where most people voted to Remain in the EU. Before the referendum, the Ulster Unionist party said that on balance, it was better for Northern Ireland to stay in the EU - although not all its members agreed. It says it would honour the referendum result, and wants ""unfettered"" access to the single market and no hard border with the Republic of Ireland. Sinn Fein has accused the Conservative government of ""seeking to impose Brexit on Ireland"". It wants Northern Ireland to have a ""designated special status"" inside the EU.

O'Sullivan recovers to level with Ding,"Ding has not beaten O'Sullivan in a ranking event since his 9-6 victory in the Northern Ireland Trophy in 2006 World Championship 2017 Venue:The Crucible Theatre, SheffieldDates:15 April - 1 May Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC Red Button, Connected TVs, online and app. World number four Ding Junhui dominated the second session of his World Championship quarter-final with Ronnie O'Sullivan to take a 10-6 lead. Having shared eight frames in the opening session, the pair began Tuesday evening by winning a frame each. But breaks of 64, 65, 120, 59 and 56 ensured China's Ding took complete control of the 25-frame match. However, a typically rapid 104 break stopped the rot for five-time winner O'Sullivan and gave him hope. It was another two hours of gripping entertainment that maintained the trend of a break of at least 50 in every frame. Latest scores, results & schedule Pick your most memorable Crucible moment Ding's dynasty and China's snooker takeover In the other game to resume on Tuesday evening, Scotland'sJohn Higginsstormed into an 11-5 lead against 25-year-oldKyren Wilson. The afternoon session saw reigning championMark Selbybuild a 6-2 lead over Hong Kong'sMarco Fu,whileBarry Hawkinsis 5-3 ahead against Scottish qualifierStephen Maguire. Ronnie O'Sullivan has described himself as being ""a bit like James Blunt"" Ding, 30, has not beaten world number 12 O'Sullivan in a ranking event since his 9-6 victory in the Northern Ireland Trophy in 2006. There is a strong possibility of that run coming to an end at the Crucible after his stunning display on Tuesday evening, which began with a frame-winning 63 clearance in the ninth. O'Sullivan came from behind to win the next but was unable to repeat the feat in frame 11 as Ding seized control. Storming into a 7-5 lead before the interval, he resumed with a 120 break and went on to stretch his lead to 10-5 with a 58 in frame 15. O'Sullivan, though, produced a defiant rapid-fire 104 in the final frame to give himself a chance of matching Stephen Hendry's record of playing in 12 World Championship semi-finals. This video can not be played Why would he do that? Wilson's bad decision World number 14 Wilson had levelled from 2-0 down in the morning, helped by a 92 break, but damaged his cue tip and, after a brief stoppage for repairs, saw four-time Crucible champion Higgins open up a 5-3 lead with breaks of 62 and 59. The Scot began the evening with a 129 and, after the next two were shared, added breaks of 74 and 135 either side of the interval to lead 9-4. Wilson responded well with a 97 but Higgins won the last two to leave himself two frames from victory at 11-5. World number eight Fu has got used to doing things the hard way at this year's tournament, having fought back from 7-2 down to beat Luca Brecel and recovered from 4-1 behind to see off Neil Robertson. There seemed little chance of a comeback when he trailed world number one Selby 5-0, the Leicester man finding some of his best form to compile breaks of 80, 72 and 94. Fu went more than an hour without potting a ball before taking a scrappy sixth frame and making it 5-2 with a stylish break of 60. But Selby got Fu in a fuddle on the final red and went on to take a four-frame advantage at 6-2. They resume on Wednesday.

Eight ways intelligent machines are in your life,"Voice recognition allows virtual personal assistants to carry out commands Many people are unsure about exactly what machine learning is. But the reality is that it is already part of everyday life. A form of artificial intelligence, it allows computers to learn from examples rather than having to follow step-by-step instructions. The Royal Society believes it will have an increasing impact on people's lives and iscalling for more research,external, to ensure the UK makes the most of opportunities. Machine learning is already powering systems from the seemingly mundane to the life-changing. Here are just a few examples. Using spoken commands to ask your phone to carry out a search, or make a call, relies on technology supported by machine learning. Virtual personal assistants - the likes of Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant - are able to follow instructions because of voice recognition. They process natural human speech, match it to the desired command and respond in an increasingly natural way. The assistants learn over a number of conversations and in many different ways. They might ask for specific information - for example how to pronounce your name, or whose voice is whose in a household. Data from large numbers of conversations by all users is also sampled, to help them recognise words with different pronunciations or how to create natural discussion. Many of us are familiar with shopping recommendations - think of the supermarket that reminds you to add cheese to your online shop, or the way Amazon suggests books it thinks you might like. Machine learning allows Amazon to make recommendations to individual shoppers Machine learning is the technology that helps deliver these suggestions, via so-called recommender systems. By analysing data about what customers have bought before, and any preferences they have expressed, recommender systems can pick up on patterns in purchasing history. They use this to make predictions about the products you might like. Similar systems are used to recommend films or TV shows on streaming services like Netflix. Recommender systems use machine learning to analyse viewing habits and pick out patterns in who watches - and enjoys - which shows. By understanding which users like which films - and what shows you have watched or awarded high ratings - recommender systems can identify your tastes. They are also used to suggest music on streaming services, like Spotify, and articles to read on Facebook. Machine learning can also be used to distinguish between different categories of objects or items. Artificial intelligence plays a role in filtering out spam emails This makes it useful when sorting out the emails you want to see from those you don't. Spam detection systems use a sample of emails to work out what is junk - learning to detect the presence of specific words, the names of certain senders, or other characteristics. Once deployed, the system uses this learning to direct emails to the right folder. It continues to learn as users flag emails, or move them between folders. Ever wondered how Facebook knows who is in your photos and can automatically label your pictures? The image recognition systems that Facebook - and other social media - uses to automatically tag photos is based on machine learning. When users upload images and tag their friends and family, these image recognition systems can spot pictures that are repeated and assigns these to categories - or people. Robots to affect up to 30% of UK jobs Will a robot take your job? Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors' Will AI kill or save humankind? By analysing large amounts of data and looking for patterns, activity which might not otherwise be visible to human analysts can be identified. One common application of this ability is in the fight against debit and credit card fraud. Machine learning systems can be trained to recognise typical spending patterns and which characteristics of a transaction - location, amount, or timing - make it more or less likely to be fraudulent. When a transaction seems out of the ordinary, an alarm can be raised - and a message sent to the user. Doctors are just starting to consider machine learning to make better diagnoses, for example to spot cancer and eye disease. Patients at eye hospitals often have photographs taken of their retinas - this can reveal problems Learning from images that have been labelled by doctors, computers can analyse new pictures of a patient's retina, a skin spot, or an image of cells taken under a microscope. In doing so, they look for visual clues that indicate the presence of medical conditions. This type of image recognition system is increasingly important in healthcare diagnostics. Machine learning is also powering scientists' ability to make new discoveries. In particle physics it has allowed them to find patterns in immense data sets generated from theLarge Hadron Collider at Cern. It was instrumental in the discovery of the Higgs Boson, for example, and is now being used to search for ""new physics"" that no-one has yet imagined. Similar ideas are being used to search for new medicines, for example by looking for new small molecules and antibodies to fight diseases. The focus will be on making systems that perform specific tasks well which could therefore be thought of as helpers. Self-driving cars will use machine learning to help avoid accidents In schools they could track student performance and develop personal learning plans. They could help us reduce energy usage by making better use of resources and improve care for the elderly by finding more time for meaningful human contact. In the area of transport, machine learning will power autonomous vehicles. Many industries could turn to algorithms to increase productivity. Financial services could become increasingly automated and law firms may use machine learning to carry out basic research. Routine tasks will be done faster, challenging business models that rely on charging hourly rates. Over the next 10 years machine learning technologies will increasingly be part of our lives, transforming the way we work and live.

The issues that divide Le Pen and Macron,"Macron v Le Pen: Some say the contest amounts to free markets v protectionism National renewal is what both the rival French presidential candidates are promising, but they offer very different paths to get there. Liberal centrist Emmanuel Macron - winner of the first round - and nationalist Marine Le Pen are already revolutionising French politics. They have delivered a big blow to the long-dominant Socialists and conservative Republicans. Mr Macron leads a new movement called En Marche (On the Move), while Ms Le Pen is backed by the National Front (FN). They disagree on many issues, especially Europe and immigration. The decisive second round is on Sunday - and polls show Mr Macron with a firm lead. So what are the main differences between theMacron,externalandLe Pen,externalvisions?

Macron - not the only young achiever,"He's young and he looks it. And at 39, Emmanuel Macron has won the final round of the French presidential election to become the country's youngest president - ever. But he's not the youngest young achiever, by a long way. From ancient warriors to high-tech wizards, here's a random selection to rival Mr Macron. The clue's in the name. At just 24, William Pitt the Younger became British prime minister in 1783. He stayed in the post almost continuously until his death in 1806. Key events during his premiership: defeating the French at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805; the introduction of income tax; the Act of Union with Ireland. William Pitt the Younger Coming back to the present day, Mr Macron will not be the only world leader under 40. This group includes Macedonian Prime Minister Emil Dimitriev, 38, and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, 36. Not forgetting the ever prominent Kim Jong-un, 33, leader of North Korea. The last two have, of course, inherited the role. And if you happen to be strolling through the European microstate ofSan Marino,external- location, north-eastern Italy - you might come across 28-year-old Vanessa d'Ambrosio, one its two leaders, or captains regent. Vanessa d'Ambrosio, 28, is captain regent of San Marino The US tech entrepreneur was 19 when he launched Facebook with four other Harvard students in 2004. With more than 1.8 billion users and market capitalisation of around $400bn (Â£312bn), it is widely seen as the world's most successful social networking site. Mark Zuckerberg lays out his vision Mark Zuckerberg is now 32 One of the greatest military commanders of all time, Alexander the Great inherited the Macedonian throne in 336 BC aged 20. After conquering the huge Persian empire, still in his 20s, he went on to rule over an empire spanning three continents. Biggest single victory: the Battle of Gaugamela, in present-day Iraq. Sean Connery played Alexander in a BBC adaptation of Terence Rattigan's play, Adventure Story, in 1961 In sport there are many firsts and youngests, but Romanian Nadia Comaneci caught the imagination more than most at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal. Aged just 14, she was the first gymnast in Olympic history to score a perfect 10.0 - on the uneven bars. The gold medallist, who began in the discipline at the age of six, went on to score six more 10.0s. Comaneci retired in 1981, later defecting to the United States from then Communist Romania. In 1997, gymnastics' world governing body raised the minimum age for senior competition to 16. Here's Comaneci again, four decades later at a Golden Globes after-party in California in January: For those of us who have failed to reach pinnacles of achievement at an early age, there is hope however. Here are a couple of late bloomers, who took time to reach their full potential. The founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken opened his first franchise in Utah in 1952. Harland Sanders was 62. His early career included tyre salesman, motel manager and ferry operator. KFC now has outlets in more than 100 countries. A statue of Harland Sanders, on the left, and business partner Pete Harman was erected in 2004 at the site in Salt Lake City of the first KFC outlet. The Edinburgh-born author of The Wind in the Willows worked for the Bank of England from the age of 20 but was already known in literary circles and went on to publish essays and stories about children. The Wind in the Willows, a mystical adventure starring animals Mole, Ratty, Badger and Toad, was not published until 1908 when Grahame was 49. Grahame's work became a global best-seller.

Laura Kuenssberg: Labour's Brexit plan takes shape,"Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer wants to guarantee migrant rights Dividing lines. Now, where have we heard that before? Gordon Brown loved them. George Osborne relished them. In an era that had been dominated by centre ground politics where everyone fought over the middle, those lines were important to answer voters' claims that ""they're all the same"". Today, Labour is spelling out ""dividing lines"" for a different reason. For months the party has agonised over its position on Brexit. Wrangling with four seemingly incompatible truths - millions of their voters in traditional Labour areas wanted Brexit; the vast majority of the party's MPs wanted to stay, in line with its official position; the leader was Remain but not exactly in love with the idea, but an important constituency of Labour voters at the New Labour end of things were ardent Remainers. Got it? In the end, Labour concluded it had to back the government's triggering of Article 50 with a few notable exceptions. And now it has officially backed Brexit. How, on this issue, can they show they are different to the Tories? Enter Sir Keir Starmer's speech this morning, interestingly, well ahead of the party's manifesto. He'll promise Labour would guarantee rights for EU nationals who live in the UK, sources say a '9am, day one' action for a Labour government. He'll say Labour would scrap the Tories' Brexit plan and in its place put forward legislation that would more fulsomely and explicitly protect all rights currently enshrined in European legislation. He'll say the idea of walking away with no deal must not be an option, and give Parliament a say on the final deal as well as regular formal updates. It is very different to the Tory plan and there has been a very active campaign to protect EU citizens who live in the UK. And a second referendum will not be in the party's manifesto. Labour will hope not to get bogged down in arguments over that. Privately senior figures say it's not possible to see how you get to a second vote, logistically or politically. But on the fairly understandable basis that in 2017 politics it is foolish to rule absolutely anything out, they can't or won't say explicitly say that under no circumstances could there ever be a second vote, or under no circumstances could we ever stay in. A senior source told me they would never argue to stay in the EU as it is, but IF there were significant reforms that situation could hypothetically change. It is a massive IF, even worth putting in capital letters in bold! For some of their voters, particularly in London, that's the kind of approach they crave. But claims from their critics that Labour could potentially seek to stay in the EU is a dividing line the party hardly needs. Brexit triggered: What happens now?

Washed up? Clock ticking for Tory bills,"The sun could set on a number of government bills One of the knock-on effects of the snap election on 8 June is that the current session of Parliament is coming to an abrupt end. The formal business will stop on Thursday, when the current Parliament is - to use its terminology - prorogued. It will then be officially dissolved by the Queen on 3 May. But before that happens, there will be a flurry of action as the fate of outstanding legislation is decided. In what is known as the wash-up period, the Commons and Lords will decide what bills they want to let through and which they will effectively put out to grass. Mark D'Arcy: Week ahead in Parliament Speaking on Monday, Commons Leader David Lidington said he hoped there would be a ""swift and orderly conclusion"" of parliamentary business. One bill guaranteed to pass is the Northern Ireland Bill. This is emergency legislation drafted to enable domestic rate bills to be calculated in Northern Ireland in the absence of a sitting assembly. The bill, which will extend the period by which a functioning executive can be formed, in an attempt to resolve the current political deadlock, will be fast-tracked through Parliament on Monday. Other bills that do not make the cut this time could be revived after the election should the Conservatives be re-elected. Brexit looms But with Brexit looming large on the horizon, the scope for other legislation in the next few years is expected to be substantially reduced. Some of the bills may never see the light of day again. Just as intriguing are the changes that MPs and peers may demand from the government's business managers in return for approving legislation. In past years, these have often been quite substantial, with whole sections of bills removed or, in some cases, clauses added to salvage them as they ""ping-pong"" between the two Houses. So which bills are still in the mix and what is likely to happen to them? The bill, which enacts measures included in Philip Hammond's Budget last month, will be given priority and is expected to be rushed through its remaining stages in the Commons on Tuesday. As well as enacting changes to duties, the legislation - whose approval by the Lords is a formality - includes provisions on tax avoidance and tackling childhood obesity. This bill, which is designed to increase competition and choice in higher education and raise standards in research and innovation, has been agreed in principle by both the Commons and Lords. But amendments have yet to be hammered out as part of the process of ""ping pong"". Given ministers have been defeated in the Lords on issues such as the scope of degree-granting powers, it might require compromises to get on the statute book. No date has so far been set for final consideration. This bill is on its final lap, with MPs due to consider a single Lords amendment relating to the life sciences sectors on Tuesday. The legislation is designed to bear down on the spiralling cost of NHS medicines and other medical supplies and secure ""best value"" for the health service and taxpayers. This wide-ranging legislation will entitle consumers to minimum broadband speeds, increase protection for intellectual property online, restrict access to online pornography, provide more scope for data-sharing within the public sector and increase the powers of Ofcom with regard to BBC regulation. It has commanded cross-party support throughout and is likely to become law, pending MPs' consideration of Lords amendments on Wednesday. There is not much time for this big bill, which begins report stage in the Lords on Tuesday, to become law. Peers have tabled 50 amendments, which could slow things down, but if the government and opposition can agree, possibly by setting aside the most controversial aspects, it still has a chance of making it through. It includes new powers to oblige suspects to explain the origin of their assets and for the authorities to seize the proceeds of crime stored in bank accounts or used to purchase property or jewels. It would also create a new offence enabling companies facilitating tax evasion to be prosecuted as well as measures on combating terrorist finance. Peers are due to consider Commons amendments to this bill - which is designed to improve the quality of technical education and apprenticeships while addressing skill shortages - on Tuesday. If there is enough time, the bill is likely to pass. Peers are due to consider Commons amendments to this bill - which aims to identify and free up more land for homebuilding and speed up the delivery of new homes - on Tuesday. If there is enough time, the bill is likely to pass. Peers are due to consider Commons amendments to this bill - which will give new powers to English local transport authorities to introduce franchising and new partnership arrangements and to offer multi-operator ticketing services - on Tuesday. The government has already admitted this bill, put forward by the former Justice Secretary Michael Gove before the EU referendum, will be shelved, at least temporarily. This is after MPs and peers stated there was not enough time to scrutinise its contents - which included changes to prison inspections and the use of mobile phones by prisoners, a new online dispute resolution system for civil cases as well as changes to judicial appointments and compensation for whiplash injuries. This bill, which would, among other things, change the motor insurance system to prepare for the arrival of driverless cars and incentivise the take-up of electric vehicles, has also come to a halt for now. It hadn't progressed far enough in the Commons and has yet to be even considered by the Lords. A motion has been passed carrying it over to the next Parliament. The Local Government Finance Bill has also been parked for another day. A host of bills tabled by backbenchers are currently working their way through the legislative system. Most are likely to run out of time, but a handful that have the support of the government could possibly become law if the Lords gets around to approving them. Guardianship (Missing Persons) Bill:Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake's bill would give the families of missing people greater control over their affairs. Dubbed Claudia's law, in memory of the chef Claudia Lawrence, who disappeared in 2009, it would establish a new legal mechanism to deal with the property and financial affairs of a missing person. Set to be debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday. Merchant Shipping (Homosexual Conduct) Bill:Tory MP John Glen's bill would repeal aspects of the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act that suggest it would be lawful to dismiss a seafarer for a homosexual act. Set to be debated in the Lords on Wednesday. Farriers (Registration) Bill:Proposed by Conservative Byron Davies but prepared by the Department for the Environment, this bill would alter the governance and membership of the Farriers Registration Council, which was set up in 1975. Set to be debated in Lords on Wednesday. Local Audit Bill:This would allow journalists to examine the accounting records of local authorities and other public offices, including parish councils, police and crime commissioners, fire authorities and NHS clinical commissioning groups. Set to be debated in Lords on Wednesday. The early election could also mean delays to changes in the following areas. Air pollution plan (publication delayed until September) Boundary review of UK constituencies (put back until 2022 election) The national funding formula for schools in England (consultation closed in March) White Paper on grammar schools (due in June but could be delayed) Consultation on industrial strategy documents (concluded on 17 April) General Election 2017: Parliamentary plans postponed LA firefighters say 'no possibility' of containing blazes as fifth wildfire breaks out Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires Starmer and Badenoch clash over call for grooming inquiry How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

Has Trump kept his promises?,"This video can not be played Donald Trump: First 100 days in 100 of his own words Determining a presidency's success by inspecting its ""first hundred days"" is a bit of an artificial construct. If humans were born with 12 fingers, then perhaps we'd be evaluating presidents based on their first 144 days instead. If the Earth rotated a bit more slowly, then presidents would have more time to notch accomplishments. Then again, 100 days is plenty of time to get a rough handle on the shape and thrust of a presidency - and to evaluate what kind of progress a leader has made toward fulfilling campaign promises. The first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency have been anything but boring or slow, but how much of it was sound and fury and how much entailed real action? Here's a quick review of some of the peaks and valleys. Let's start with the wall - not the president's only promise, but certainly one of his oldest, most high-profile ones. Candidate Trump constantly spoke of the great wall that he plans to build along the US-Mexico border at his campaign rallies, and the crowd roared in agreement when he said Mexico would pay for the project. Contrast that certainty with this tweet, which the president wrote over the weekend. ""Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall,""he tweeted,external. It's a case of Trump promises meeting political realities, in 140 characters or less. Campaign rhetoric is easy; turning talk into action in Washington is much more complicated. The administration has pledged to reshuffle some moneys to begin wall construction, but it is increasingly clear that Congress will need to find billions of dollars to make the wall a reality. That sets up a showdown between the president and legislators, with many Republicans - particularly those representing areas along the US-Mexico border - not keen on opening up the federal purse for Mr Trump's pet project. Promise kept?Nope. Mr Trump promised to choose a Supreme Court justice to fill the empty seat on the bench from a list he released during the presidential campaign - and, by tapping Neil Gorsuch, he did. ""I've always heard that the most important thing that a president of the United States does is appoint people - hopefully great people like this appointment - to the United States Supreme Court,"" Mr Trump said at Mr Gorsuch's White House swearing-in ceremony. ""And I can say this is a great honour. And I got it done in the first 100 days. That's even nice. You think that's easy?"" That kind of depends how one defines ""easy"". Mr Gorsuch's confirmation hearing was bruising, no doubt. Facing united Democratic opposition, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell broke with longstanding precedent to allow a simple majority vote for Supreme Court confirmations. Once that was done, however, it was simply a matter of the Republican majority in the Senate imposing its will. Gorsuch sworn in as justice While Mr Trump may have only had to put a name on a piece of paper and rely on Senate Republicans to do the heavy lifting, he did tick a major item of his presidential to-do list. He satisfied a Republican base that stuck with him through a tumultuous campaign on the understanding that they'd get just such a reliable conservative on the court. They may continue to stand by this president in the hope there will be more nominees like Mr Gorsuch to come. Promise kept?Definitely. ""Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated."" It's way too early for political epitaphs, but if the Trump presidency collapses under the weight of disorganisation and broken promises, this February quote from the president - made as it became increasingly clear his own party couldn't even agree on healthcare reform - will make a fitting inscription for a tombstone. At one point during the presidential campaign, Mr Trump promised that the Democratic healthcare reform legislation - Obamacare, as it has become known - would be repealed on his first day in office. Then, after the first Republican legislative effort crashed and burned in late March - 64 days into his presidency - Mr Trump backtracked on his timeline. ""I never said repeal it and replace it within 64 days,"" he said. ""I have a long time. But I want to have a great healthcare bill and plan, and we will. It will happen. And it won't be in the very distant future."" How disastrous for Trump is healthcare collapse? Since then there's been speculation that a new deal could be in the works - but such rumours have evaporated upon closer scrutiny. There's no telling what the future may bring, but the reality at this point is that healthcare reform was Mr Trump's first major legislative push - the de facto focus of his first 100 days in office - and it has done nothing but expose the Republican Party as fractured body incapable of advancing a coherent agenda. Promise kept?Uh, no. Definitely not. Mr Trump may have a bit of a mixed record when it comes to fulfilling his promises on immigration, but it's not for a lack of trying. His administration has taken two shots at curtailing the US refugee programme and preventing citizens of a handful of majority Muslim nations from entering the US, but those executive actions have been stymied by a handful of court judges (one, as Attorney General Jeff Sessions put it, residing on an ""island in the Pacific""). Mr Trump has also stepped up immigration enforcement across the US, threatened ""sanctuary cities"" that don't co-operate fully with federal immigration officials, ordered a review of immigration programmes, including H-1B visas given to high-skilled immigrants, and announced a hiring spree on border patrol agents and immigration court judges. Immigration arrests were up 32.6% in the first month and a half of the Trump presidency,according to,externalthe Washington Post, with a larger share coming from those without a prior criminal record. Meanwhile, border apprehensions have dropped. Throughout the campaign the president talked tough on immigration - even though the number of undocumented migrants entering the US had been declining over recent years. Given that the law grants the president sweeping authority over immigration policy, Mr Trump is clearly following his words with actions. Promise kept?Yes - despite the effort of ""so-called judges"" on the mainland and in Hawaii. Who is the Trump administration deporting? During the campaign, Mr Trump's foreign policy vision was a collection of sometimes contradictory, often controversial proposals. The candidate spoke of getting tough on the so-called Islamic State, Iran and China, reaffirming an alliance with Israel and mending relations with Russia. He entertained the notion of lifting restrictions on the use of torture on detainees and giving the US military more authority to act, including by targeting the families of suspected militants. Above all else, he promised to put American priorities first and downplayed support for US allies and international alliances that he deemed too burdensome. As president, the contradictions may have changed in nature but the controversy lingers. Trump Tracker: What has the US president done so far? He pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as promised and has begun a review process for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Torture remains off the table, thanks to the influence of Defence Secretary James Mattis. Mr Trump has occasionally told foreign leaders - Germany's Angela Merkel and Italy's Paolo Gentiloni, for instance - of his expectations that they increase their military spending. On the other hand, he has recently acknowledged the value of Nato membership. When it comes to China, however, he's taken a softer line. He's backed away from his promise to label the nation a ""currency manipulator"" or impose steep import tariffs, instead seeking the nation's help in dealing with North Korea. Then there's Mr Trump's missile strike on Syrian forces following that government's use of chemical weapons on its own people. It's the kind of move that candidate Trump may have dismissed as ineffective - and, in fact, reality TV star Trump had condemned in no uncertain terms in 2013, when Barack Obama proposed his own Syrian intervention. Promise kept?Yes, no, maybe. Take your pick. On 22 October, just a few weeks before election day, Candidate Trump gave a speech in Pennsylvania announcing a ""100 Day Plan to Make America Great Again"" - a contract, he said, with the American voter. Included in theaccompanying document,externalwas an outline of a series of official-sounding pieces of legislation he would ""work with Congress to introduce"" and ""fight for"" in his first 100 days. They included the Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act, the End the Offshoring Act, the Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act, the Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act, and the American Energy and Infrastructure Act. Aside from the aforementioned Obamacare repeal effort, which is currently a smoking crater somewhere on the floor of the House of Representatives, the rest of these pieces of legislation remain in the realm of unicorns and fairies. Mr Trump has said details of a tax plan are coming as soon as this week, but - as we saw with healthcare - a detailed plan creates a juicy target for opponents of all political stripes. The president signed a raft of executive actions - rolling back Obama-era regulations, authorising the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and instituting a federal hiring freeze (which has since been lifted) - but in the vast scheme of things those are low-hanging fruit for a new president. The White House has also boasted that Mr Trump has signed more laws at this point than any president since Harry Truman - but that list includes measures naming Veterans' medical clinics, making appointment to museum boards and creating a memorial to the 1991 Gulf War. Many of the remaining laws rolled back Obama-era regulations, most of which had yet to go into effect. Legislation that can last beyond any one president is a heavier lift, and Mr Trump has yet to show he has any real muscle. Promise kept?Consult your nearest unicorn. Mr Trump is far from a traditional president, so perhaps it's unfair to evaluate the first few months of his presidency in traditional ways, such as by tallying up his policy accomplishments and failures. His voters largely didn't back his candidacy based on specific promises - on the wall, on healthcare, on taxes - but because of his attitude and his promise to shake up the political system. If the performance metric is how much the Trump presidency has disrupted politics as usual, Mr Trump has posted a clear victory. He continues to dominate the national conversation with his controversial tweets and off-the cuff statements, and his actions have defied traditional political norms and standards, whether it's his apparent steadfast refusal to fill lower-level political appointments or observe precedents on open-government practices. He's lectured foreign leaders, browbeat major companies and taken a poleaxe to disfavoured media (while still giving them choice interviews when it serves his purposes, of course). Trump's potential conflicts of interest - foreign and domestic Are voters impressed with the first 100 days? A list of Trump's broken promises Mr Trump campaigned on draining the swamp, and he's taken some executive actions to limit administration officials from becoming lobbyists after they leave government service. On the other hand, his promises to avoid conflicts of interest over his wide-ranging business empire have proven vague and unenforceable and he's stocked his administration with the kind of financial insiders and Wall Street bigwigs he regularly railed against on the campaign trail. So far, however, his dedicated supporters - the ones who powered him to a narrow electoral victory if not a popular vote plurality - seem pleased as punch. According toa recent poll,external, 96% of Mr Trump's voters in November stand by their support of the man. They've apparently seen enough action to convince them that the president is doing what he said he'd do, even if it hasn't yet translated into legislative accomplishments. If the economy is humming and unemployment stays low, they'll probably remain in his corner for the long haul. For them, the apparent chaos in the nation's capital is a feature, not a bug.

Serena calls Nastase's comments 'racist',"Nastase won two Grand Slam singles titles in the 1970s Serena Williams says Ilie Nastase's recent comments about her unborn child are ""racist"" and has given her backing to a full investigation. Nastase, a former world number one, was heard speculating whetherWilliams' child would be ""chocolate with milk?"" ""It disappoints me to know we live in a society where people like Ilie Nastase can make such racist comments,"" Williams said in astatement.,external Williams, 35, is due to give birth to her first child in the autumn. ""I have said it once and I'll say it again, this world has come so far but yet we have so much further to go,"" Williams added. ""Yes, we have broken down so many barriers - however there are a plethora more to go. ""This or anything else will not stop me from pouring love, light and positivity into everything that I do. I will continue to take a lead and stand up for what's right."" The International Tennis Federation (ITF) has launched an investigation into the comments made by 70-year-old Nastase, Romania's Fed Cup captain, at a news conference before their tie with Great Britain in Constanta last week. ""I humbly thank the ITF for any consideration given to all the facts in this case. They will have my full support,"" added Williams, who announced her engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in December. The 23-time Grand Slam champion also included passages from the poem Still I Rise by American civil rights activist Maya Angelou in her statement. ""I am not afraid like you. You see, I am no coward. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? You may shoot me with your wordsâ¦ you may try to kill me with your hatefulness, but still like the air, I rise."" Williams, whowon her record-breaking Grand Slamat the Australian Open while eight weeks pregnant, thanked her unborn child as she regained the world number one ranking on Monday.

Eight ways machine learning is in your life,"Voice recognition allows virtual personal assistants to carry out commands Many people are unsure about exactly what machine learning is. But the reality is that it is already part of everyday life. A form of artificial intelligence, it allows computers to learn from examples rather than having to follow step-by-step instructions. The Royal Society believes it will have an increasing impact on people's lives and iscalling for more research,external, to ensure the UK makes the most of opportunities. Machine learning is already powering systems from the seemingly mundane to the life-changing. Here are just a few examples. Using spoken commands to ask your phone to carry out a search, or make a call, relies on technology supported by machine learning. Virtual personal assistants - the likes of Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant - are able to follow instructions because of voice recognition. They process natural human speech, match it to the desired command and respond in an increasingly natural way. The assistants learn over a number of conversations and in many different ways. They might ask for specific information - for example how to pronounce your name, or whose voice is whose in a household. Data from large numbers of conversations by all users is also sampled, to help them recognise words with different pronunciations or how to create natural discussion. Many of us are familiar with shopping recommendations - think of the supermarket that reminds you to add cheese to your online shop, or the way Amazon suggests books it thinks you might like. Machine learning allows Amazon to make recommendations to individual shoppers Machine learning is the technology that helps deliver these suggestions, via so-called recommender systems. By analysing data about what customers have bought before, and any preferences they have expressed, recommender systems can pick up on patterns in purchasing history. They use this to make predictions about the products you might like. Similar systems are used to recommend films or TV shows on streaming services like Netflix. Recommender systems use machine learning to analyse viewing habits and pick out patterns in who watches - and enjoys - which shows. By understanding which users like which films - and what shows you have watched or awarded high ratings - recommender systems can identify your tastes. They are also used to suggest music on streaming services, like Spotify, and articles to read on Facebook. Machine learning can also be used to distinguish between different categories of objects or items. Artificial intelligence plays a role in filtering out spam emails This makes it useful when sorting out the emails you want to see from those you don't. Spam detection systems use a sample of emails to work out what is junk - learning to detect the presence of specific words, the names of certain senders, or other characteristics. Once deployed, the system uses this learning to direct emails to the right folder. It continues to learn as users flag emails, or move them between folders. Ever wondered how Facebook knows who is in your photos and can automatically label your pictures? The image recognition systems that Facebook - and other social media - uses to automatically tag photos is based on machine learning. When users upload images and tag their friends and family, these image recognition systems can spot pictures that are repeated and assigns these to categories - or people. Robots to affect up to 30% of UK jobs Will a robot take your job? Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors' Will AI kill or save humankind? By analysing large amounts of data and looking for patterns, activity which might not otherwise be visible to human analysts can be identified. One common application of this ability is in the fight against debit and credit card fraud. Machine learning systems can be trained to recognise typical spending patterns and which characteristics of a transaction - location, amount, or timing - make it more or less likely to be fraudulent. When a transaction seems out of the ordinary, an alarm can be raised - and a message sent to the user. Doctors are just starting to consider machine learning to make better diagnoses, for example to spot cancer and eye disease. Patients at eye hospitals often have photographs taken of their retinas - this can reveal problems Learning from images that have been labelled by doctors, computers can analyse new pictures of a patient's retina, a skin spot, or an image of cells taken under a microscope. In doing so, they look for visual clues that indicate the presence of medical conditions. This type of image recognition system is increasingly important in healthcare diagnostics. Machine learning is also powering scientists' ability to make new discoveries. In particle physics it has allowed them to find patterns in immense data sets generated from theLarge Hadron Collider at Cern. It was instrumental in the discovery of the Higgs Boson, for example, and is now being used to search for ""new physics"" that no-one has yet imagined. Similar ideas are being used to search for new medicines, for example by looking for new small molecules and antibodies to fight diseases. The focus will be on making systems that perform specific tasks well which could therefore be thought of as helpers. Self-driving cars will use machine learning to help avoid accidents In schools they could track student performance and develop personal learning plans. They could help us reduce energy usage by making better use of resources and improve care for the elderly by finding more time for meaningful human contact. In the area of transport, machine learning will power autonomous vehicles. Many industries could turn to algorithms to increase productivity. Financial services could become increasingly automated and law firms may use machine learning to carry out basic research. Routine tasks will be done faster, challenging business models that rely on charging hourly rates. Over the next 10 years machine learning technologies will increasingly be part of our lives, transforming the way we work and live.

Lib Dems vow to keep 'nuclear deterrent',"The Liberal Democrats would ""maintain a credible nuclear deterrent"" if they won power, leader Tim Farron says. ""Our nuclear deterrent keeps us at the top table in this post-Brexit world,"" he said. But Mr Farron also advocated replacing the current system of continuous-at-sea deterrence with more irregular patrolling patterns. And he accused Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of being ""weak and dangerous"" on defence matters. Earlier this week, Mr Corbyn - a long-standing opponent of nuclear weapons - said ""all aspects"" of defence would be reviewed if he won power in the snap election on 8 June. ""I have made clear there would be no first use of it and that any use of nuclear weapons would be a disaster for the world,"" he told Andrew Marr on BBC One. His party, however, issued a statement later the same day clarifying that Labour as a whole was in favour of renewing the existing Trident nuclear weapons system. MPs overwhelmingly voted earlier this year to build four new submarines to carry missiles armed with nuclear warheads. They are intended to replace the existing Vanguard fleet from the early 2030s at an estimated cost of Â£31bn. Election Live: Rolling text and video updates Labour 'day one' pledge to EU nationals Corbyn: Nuclear policy 'under discussion' Mr Farron was expected to make his comments in a speech to supporters in Portsmouth, but the Lib Dems said the visit had to be cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. The pre-released text of his speech said: ""If you say that you would never press the button, as Jeremy Corbyn seems to have suggested, that makes a mockery of having a deterrent or indeed sound defences."" He added that the Liberal Democrats are committed to Nato, the European Union and the United Nations. Each Vanguard submarine can carry up to eight Trident missiles ""We believe that our safety and security as a country is best achieved through co-operating with the UK's allies,"" he said. ""That is why we are committed to maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent, because there is nothing to gain from walking away from the table and turning our back on those who rely on our protection."" Switching from a continuous at-sea deterrent to irregular patrols ""would maintain the ability to surge to more frequent armed patrols, or drop down to a low-readiness posture if the security situation allows"", he argued. Mr Farron also said the party's long-term goal will ""always be a nuclear-free world"", and it would use the UK's position to lead international efforts towards multilateral disarmament. The Lib Dems have faced division on the issue in the past, with some activists calling for Trident to be axed, saying it is expensive and unnecessary. A commitment to replacing Trident was a Conservative manifesto pledge in the last general election in 2015. And shortly before becoming prime minister, Theresa May said it would be ""sheer madness"" to give up the UK's nuclear weapons because of the threat posed by other countries including Russia.

'Transfer funds key to keeping Benitez',"Rafael Benitez has won 34 of his 61 matches as Newcastle manager Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez must be given money to improve the team before their Premier League return next season, says club legend Alan Shearer. Benitez spent over Â£50m last summer after relegation, but Shearer says there is a risk of losing the Spaniard if he is not backed financially. ""I would think giving him transfer funds would be key to keeping hold of him,"" said the Magpies' record scorer. Newcastle secured promotion with a 4-1 home win over Preston on Monday. How Benitez fixed Newcastle Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, former England captain Shearer added: ""He's a huge figure at the club. He loves the place and the passion of fans - and it's hugely important Newcastle keep hold of him. ""I'm sure he will demand the team has to be improved and will demand a few quid to do that. ""You can't stand still. You can't be loyal and give all the players that have got the team promoted a chance. You've got to go out and buy new players. ""People realise the team needs improving to get to where they want to be and that's got to be the top half of the Premier League. ""Now it's about where Newcastle want to be - do they want to get up to the Premier League and be in the bottom three or four fighting against relegation, or do they want to have a go at it? I'm pretty sure I know what Rafa will want to do."" Former Newcastle winger Chris Waddle echoed Shearer's view and believes Benitez will be in demand. ""The fans love Rafa - obviously - but I think Rafa will have a lot of tasty offers on the table from around Europe,"" Waddled told BBC Radio 5 live. ""If he doesn't get the reassurances he needs to strengthen his team - and I mean strengthen it - he's probably going to be looking elsewhere. ""I know fans will not want to hear that but he'll not want to be in a relegation battle next year."" Match report: Newcastle 4-1 Preston North End Listen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast Listen: Newcastle can't be loyal to the players who won promotion - Shearer How Newcastle won promotion - relive the action as it happened Benitez was appointed by Newcastle in March 2016 but could not save them from relegation to the Championship. He had a break clause in his contract allowing him to leave if the Magpies went down, but instead the former Liverpool and Chelsea bossopted to sign a new three-year deal. One of the most expensive squads in Championship history was assembled last summer, mainly using funds generated from the sales of Moussa Sissoko, Georginio Wijnaldum, Andros Townsend and other high-profile departures. Monday's victory over North End secured an immediate return to the top flight with two games to spare and ex-Newcastle keeper Steve Harper hopes the Magpies hierarchy give Benitez Â£60m to strengthen. ""He generated a Â£30m profit last year and you'd like to think they might give him double that,"" Harper told BBC Radio 5 live. ""Matt Ritchie and Jonjo Shelvey have had excellent seasons but I think every single Newcastle fan would want to see another five or six definite starting line-up Premier League players arrive so, when they go back, they're set up to compete. Nobody will know that better than Rafa Benitez. He's united the fans again with his honesty and his integrity. ""He knows his stock is high. He's in a very strong position so he can ask the serious questions now and, hopefully, they do back him."" Against Preston, Christian Atsu put the Magpies 2-1 up at half-time after Jordan Hugill had cancelled out an Ayoze Perez opener. On a tense evening at St James' Park, Newcastle nerves were settled when Preston's Paul Gallagher was sent off for handling on the line and Ritchie scored the resulting penalty. Perez got his second from close range to send Newcastle up with Brighton. Newcastle spent Â£12m to sign winger Matt Ritchie from Bournemouth in July 2016 - he scored his 12th league goal of the season in Monday's promotion-clinching win over Preston Former Newcastle coach Steve Stone also believes the squad needs strengthening again at the end of the season. ""They still need an awful lot of new players before next season,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""Fans realise they're not going to win the Premier League next season and they will struggle to get into the top 10. They need to get a foothold in the Premier League first, otherwise they will become a yo-yo club. ""It's been a long time since Newcastle were battling at the top of the Premier League. They finished fifth under Alan Pardew the season I was there (2011-12), but they haven't been up there on a consistent basis since Bobby Robson left (in 2004). ""Now is the time to buy and build, and make sure club doesn't have to play in this division ever again."" Former Nottingham Forest and England midfielder Stone added: ""The fans absolutely adore Rafa Benitez and they have from the start. They chanted his name throughout the game. ""But he knows now that he needs money and it will be interesting to see if they give him the money he deserves. ""Everywhere Rafa goes, he gets a massive reception. Newcastle were lucky to get him - they needed him more than he needed Newcastle. ""Since getting here he has realised what it's all about and he's bought into it.""

Nine ways to organise your life in your lunchtime,"Busy tech entrepreneur and mum Colleen Wong likes any apps that can save her time With two children under the age of four and a tech start-up to run, Colleen Wong has her hands full. She is happy to use any technology that can help her manage her hectic lifestyle, including family activity planning app Hoop and food-sharing service Olio. ""I will embrace any tech that offers practical benefits and can save me time,"" says Ms Wong. A finalist in the Women Who Tech European Start-up Challenge, she runs her child tracker firm, TechSixtyFour, from her home in Teddington, Middlesex. She is typical of a new breed of hi-tech mums and dads around the world using lunchtime ""life hacks"" to juggle work and family commitments. So what useful apps that could help you take back control of your life? Fed up of washing and ironing? Try a laundry app such as FlyCleaners in New York, or Laundrapp, available in UK cities such as London, Glasgow and Harrogate. The FlyCleaners app is free to use and offers an overnight service for when you need clean clothes fast. Just pick a slot and hand your washing over to a FlyCleaners representative as little as 20 minutes later. Washing and pressing one shirt in Chelsea, Manhattan costs $2.99 (Â£2.34), and deliveries are free when you spend more than $30 (Â£23). With Laundrapp, booking the 48-hour service is also free, while prices depend on your location and the load. Getting five shirts washed and pressed in south London, for example, costs Â£11. Organising who does what around the house can be a chore in itself, but with US firm FamilyTech's apps Mothershp and Choremonster, you can set jobs for each member of the family from your office. The Choremonster app enables parents to give rewards to kids who help around the home FamilyTech co-founder Chris Bergman says: ""With Mothershp, parents set chores and rewards. Their child then logs into Choremonster, where they can earn rewards such as 'screen time', and unlock monsters, for completing those chores."" Both apps are free to use and are available worldwide in eight languages. Wherever you live, you can use your lunch hour to plan evening meals using a home cooking app such as BigOven. Features on the free app, which is available around the world, include a grocery list organiser and more than 350,000 recipes.

Once you've planned your meal, you could order the ingredients from independent retailers using a locally focused app such as Epicery. It launched a one-hour delivery service in Paris last year. Deliveries cost from â¬2.90 (Â£2.46) up to â¬6.90 (Â£5.89) if you order produce from three or more of its 250 members, which include local butchers, fishmongers and off-licences. French local food delivery app Epicery plans to expand throughout Europe ""Our aim is to expand into several other French and European cities soon,"" says Elsa Hermal at Epicery. Then if you have food left over, why not ""freecycle"" it, rather than throw it away, using a UK-based app like Olio? It enables families and local business owners to redistribute food and other household items that would otherwise go to waste. The free app is a hit with Ms Wong, 40. ""Food waste drives me mad, so I love Olio,"" she says. Free 360-degree virtual reality (VR) tours are the new way to plan your next holiday from your desk. All you need is your smartphone and the website of a VR specialist such as Ascape VR or YouVisit and you can escape into another world on your lunch break (with or without a VR headset). Travel site Ascape specialises in 360-degree videos of holiday destinations Valeriy Kondruk, chief executive of Ascape VR, says: ""Working in an office, you spend 90% of your time reading and writing. ""Taking a virtual trip is a great way to switch off and really get personal with a destination."" With online marketplace TaskRabbit you can tackle all those odd jobs you never seem to have enough time to do, from clearing the loft to fixing that leaky tap. Simply choose a ""tasker"" based on experience, reputation and hourly rate. Once the job is done, pay securely via the app, which is currently available in 23 cities across the US, as well as in London. Elsewhere, ServisHero is one of the most popular apps for Singapore residents in need of a handyman. Its users describe what needs doing, wait for the quotes to roll in, and then pick a ""hero"" to do the job. You can find fun family activities in minutes with free apps such as the UK's Hoop and Yuggler in the US. Hoop users can set filters to find nearby events that suit their children, and can share those they find interesting with their friends. You can plan family activities using apps like Hoop and Yuggler ""I use Hoop to do last-minute planning on where to take the kids,"" Ms Wong says. Yuggler, which is only currently available on iOS devices, offers similar features in US cities including San Francisco and Philadelphia. It is planning to expand into 22 more cities soon. Apps such as DocTap and iCliniq offer a way for busy professionals to get medical advice without taking time off. ICliniq users can set up a video consultation with one of its 2,000 or so doctors in countries including the US, India and Germany. And with London-based DocTap, you can pay Â£24 for 15-minute face-to-face GP appointments at clinics and pharmacies around the UK capital. DocTap user Jamie Ritchie says: ""It was pretty much impossible to fit an appointment with my local doctor around work. ""With DocTap, I got an appointment at lunchtime, and was back in the office within half an hour.""
