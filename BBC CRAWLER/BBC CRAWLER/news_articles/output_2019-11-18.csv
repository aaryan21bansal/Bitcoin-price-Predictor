Two jailed for murdering Jodie Chesney in park,"This video can not be played Detective Inspector Perry Benton explains how the Met Police pieced together evidence to catch Jodie's killers Two teenagers have been jailed for life for murdering a 17-year-old girl in an east London park. Jodie Chesney was stabbed in the back as she sat with friends in Harold Hill on 1 March. Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, and Arron Isaacs, 17, of Barking, were both convicted earlier this month after a trial at the Old Bailey. Ong-a-Kwie, of Romford, will serve a minimum of 26 years while Isaacs was detained for at least 18 years. Life sentence for Jodie's killers Stabbed in the back and left to die Watch Justice for Jodie documentary,external Explaining the sentences, Judge Wendy Joseph QC told the court she was ""satisfied"" Ong-a-Kwie had stabbed Jodie while Isaacs was a ""willing supporter"". ""When that knife was driven into Jodie, that intention was to kill,"" she said. She added that her death ""was part of a series of tit-for-tat attacks"" which had been ""increasing in ferocity"", and ""although the target was not Jodie... there was a degree of planning"". Svenson Ong-a-Kwie (l) and Arron Isaacs (r) were both found guilty of Jodie's murder During the trial, each of the defendants blamed each other for the attack but a jury took less than six hours to find them both guilty of murder. In an impact statement read before sentencing, Jodie's father Peter Chesney said the death of his daughter ""has destroyed my life"". The 39-year-old, who was not in court, described how a year ago he had started a new job as a salesman in the City ""and I was about to take over the world in a promising career. ""Now I sit here in the cabin in my garden writing this statement. I have left that job, the relationship with my wife has fallen apart and we are now getting divorced. I must sell my house, and above all, I have lost the most precious human being I will ever know,"" he said. This video can not be played Police body-worn video captured Svenson Ong-a-Kwie falling through a conservatory roof as officers tried to arrest him Following the stabbing, Jodie collapsed into the arms of her boyfriend Eddie Coyle who told the court he had been ""completely changed"" by the events of that night. ""I find it hard to sleep most of the time. I've been diagnosed with PTSD from this, and it keeps me up most nights so I don't sleep,"" he said. The court had heard drug dealer Ong-a-Kwie and his runner Isaacs had been looking to take revenge on rivals but had killed Jodie by mistake. She had been socialising with friends that evening when two figures emerged out of the dark and one plunged a knife in her back. The two defendants fled in another drug dealer's car but were arrested together days later as they fled from a house linked to Isaacs, the jury were told. The 17-year-old was stabbed once in the back while she was socialising with friends in Amy's Park Ong-a-Kwie had convictions for possessing and supplying drugs and had admitted being in breach of a six-week suspended sentence for handling stolen jewellery. Two other people - Manuel Petrovic, 20, of Romford, and a 16-year-old boy - were both cleared of murder and manslaughter. Met Police officer Det Insp Perry Benton described the investigation as ""one of the hardest I've ever dealt with"", adding that the defendants ""have shown no remorse from day one"". Jodie Chesney was an active Scout member who was described as ""one of our brightest and best"" by chief scout Bear Grylls Speaking following the sentencing, Jodie's uncle Terry Chesney said the family were ""happy"" with the jail terms and would now ""try"" to get on with their lives. ""Today was justice. We'll never get her back, but we've got justice,"" he said.

Tory donor calls for Russia report publication,"This video can not be played Conservative Party donor Alexander Temerko speaks to BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera A Conservative Party donor has called for the publication of a report on alleged Russian interference in UK democracy. Alexander Temerko said the paper by the Intelligence Security Committee (ISC) should be published ""for democracy reasons"". The report has formal security clearance, but it will not be released until after the 12 December election. Downing Street hasdenied claims it is suppressing the document. Former Russian official Mr Temerko has donated more than Â£1m to the Tory Party and its candidates in recent years. ""I think for democracy reasons, this report should be released, because if there is real Russian influence, people and country should know about that,"" he told BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera. 'Shameful' not to publish Russia report - Clinton The mystery of the Russia report No 10 denies suppressing Russia interference report The Sunday Times saidnine Russian business people who had donated money to the Conservatives,externalwere named in the report. Mr Temerko, a Ukrainian-born businessman who became a British citizen in 2011, said it was ""ridiculous"" to suggest he had worked with Russia. He added he had ""never"" been considered a ""friend"" of the Kremlin or of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""I'm against [the] Kremlin,"" he said. By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent Alexander Temerko is adamant he is not an agent of the Kremlin but a critic. And he wants people to know it. The failure to release the Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report has led the vacuum to be filled with speculation about what might be in it and for questions to be raised about how Russia might be trying to exercise influence on public life. Mr Temerko argues his own story - of fleeing Russia a decade and a half ago - shows he cannot be working on the Kremlin's behalf. But without seeing the details of the report, questions will remain about what it really says in terms of what other routes Moscow might have used.

Paul McCartney to headline Glastonbury 2020,"The star last played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage in 2004 One of the worst-kept secrets in pop has been confirmed: Sir Paul McCartney will headline Glastonbury in 2020. The former Beatle will top the bill on the Pyramid Stage on Saturday 27 June, a week after his 78th birthday. He last played the Somerset event in 2004, and organisers have long been keen to get him back for an encore. Next year will be Glastonbury's golden jubilee and co-organiser Emily Eavis said: ""There really was no-one that we wanted more for the 50th anniversary."" Earlier on Monday, the star teased the announcement on Twitter - posting a picture of PhilipGlass, EmmaStoneand ChuckBerry. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Emily Eavis subsequently confirmed the news, saying: ""Having Paul McCartney coming back to headline the Pyramid for the second time next year is an absolute dream come true."" In April, her father, festival founderMichael Eavis, admittedhe had the star in his sights, but asked a BBC reporter not to ""make a big thing of it"". In September,Sir Paul told BBC Radio 2the booking ""was starting to become [a] remote kind of possibility"". He told breakfast host Zoe Ball: ""My kids are saying, 'Dad, we've got to talk about Glastonbury', and I think I know what they mean. ""We played there quite a long time ago so maybe it is time to go back. I don't know. I'd have to put a few things in place."" The rock legend's last appearance on the Pyramid Stage came after a day of heavy rain that left fans soaked to the skin. But his arrival was greeted with an almighty cheer, and he responded with a joyous, two-and-a-half hour greatest hits set - opening with Wings classic Jet and racing through 22 Beatles songs, including Helter Skelter, Back In The USSR and Yesterday. ""Spare a thought for Michael Eavis. He could live to host a hundred more Glastos and he'd never top this,"" wrote the NME in its review. ""And pity us poor punters, oblivious to the fact we are sinking in mud and soaked to the skin, because every gig we go to from now will fall short of this."" The gig later won an NME Award for musical event of the year Incredibly, after playing more than 3,000 concerts, Glastonbury was the star's first ever festival set. He later recalled looking out over the the flags, banners and bedraggled fans and thinking it looked ""like the Battle of Agincourt"". He closed the show with The End, the final song on The Beatles' Abbey Road album. But it was the all-together-now chorus of Hey Jude that made a lasting impression, echoing around Worthy Farm until the early hours of Sunday morning. ""Paul won the day for me,"" said Michael Eavis after the concert. ""He hugged and kissed me afterwards but I should have kissed him."" Sir Paul later told Clash magazine: ""It was a good night for us. It was a blast, and the audience seemed to love it. It was like, 'Yeah man! People have come together!' Very uplifting.""

But speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival last month, Emily Eavis ruled the band out after negotiations apparently stalled over money.

Lib Dems and SNP lose ITV debate legal challenge,"This video can not be played Lib Dems ""disappointed"" by ITV debate verdict The Lib Dems and SNP have lost their legal challenge to be included in an ITV head-to-head debate ahead of the general election on 12 December. The channel is due to air a face-off between Tory leader Boris Johnson and Labour's Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday. The Lib Dems said they wanted their pro-Remain stance to be represented, while the SNP also wanted the issue of Scottish independence to be raised. But judges ruled there was ""no arguable breach of the Broadcasting Code"",external. LIVE: ITV debate to remain Johnson and Corbyn head-to-head TV debate 'excludes Remainers' views', court hears Who is taking part in the general election TV debates? In the High Court in London, Lord Justice Davis and Mr Justice Warby said the case was not suitable for judicial review as ITV was not carrying out a ""public function"" in law by holding the debate. However, the parties had the right to complain to Ofcom about the programme after it had been broadcast, they said. Lord Justice Davis said: ""The clear conclusion of both members of this court is that, viewed overall, these claims are not realistically arguable."" But Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran tweeted ""the fight must continue"", adding: ""It is outrageous that the Remain voice is missing from the ITV debate. ""It's simply wrong of broadcasters to present a binary choice and pre-empt the decision of the people in a general election."" This video can not be played Exclusion from debates 'a democratic outrage' The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, also condemned the decision, saying it ""discriminated against Scottish voters"" and ""treated them as second-class citizens"". He added: ""That is, quite simply, a democratic disgrace, and the fact that election law and broadcasting codes allow such gross unfairness is unacceptable."" And he called for Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn to commit to take part in an all-party debate on 1 December, rather than sending other senior figures from their respective parties. Analysis by Tom Symonds, BBC home affairs correspondent It took the two judges just a matter of 10 or 15 minutes to reach a decision about the claim that the Lib Dems and SNP should be allowed access to the head-to-head debate. The judges came back and said they would not agree to that and effectively refused to even hear the judicial review. Their legal argument was that ITV was not exercising a public function as it is a private broadcaster - albeit regulated - therefore could not be subject to judicial review. They also said if the two parties had a complaint about the programme, they had a way of complaining and that was to the regulator Ofcom - but that can only be done after the programme is broadcast However, the judges said an important part of their decision was the editorial judgment made by ITV was not irrational and perverse. They did not want as judges to get in the way of an editorial matter for a major broadcaster. So the application from the parties is rejected and the debate goes ahead. But the Lib Dems still have big problems with this court decision, and say they they are going to take a closer look before deciding what to do next. The BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between the Conservative and Labour leaders in Southampton on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. The Lib Dems have sent a legal letter to the BBC over its decision not to include Ms Swinson in the head-to-head. BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

KPMG ends sponsorship of Prince Andrew's scheme,"This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' KPMG has not renewed its sponsorship of the Duke of York's entrepreneurship initiative, Pitch@Palace. The accountancy firm is thought to have made the decision at the end of October. The controversy over the prince's ties to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is understood to have been one reason behind the decision. The revelation follows Prince Andrew's appearance on BBC Newsnight inwhat critics called a ""car-crash"" interview. In the interview, the Queen's third child said he still did not regret his friendship with US financier Epstein - who took his own life in August while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in the US. The BBC has contacted Buckingham Palace for comment regarding KPMG's decision. The accountancy and auditing firm - which is not the only company associated with Pitch@Palace - declined to comment. The scheme was founded by the prince in 2014,externaland involves entrepreneurs competing for the chance to pitch their business ideas to influential business figures. The project operates in 64 countries and claims to have created more than 6,300 jobs. Epstein's accusers 'failed by royalty' Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Meanwhile, University of Huddersfield students passed a motion on Monday evening to lobby the prince to resign as the university's chancellor. The university itself said Prince Andrew's ""enthusiasm for innovation and entrepreneurship"" was a ""natural fit"" with its work. The Outward Bound Trust, of which the prince is patron, said it would hold a special board meeting over the next few days for members to discuss ""the issues raised"" by the interview. Amid the backlash from the BBC's interview on Saturday, Prince Andrew is facing renewed calls to tell US authorities about his friendship with Epstein. The prince said he would testify under oath ""if push came to shove"" and his lawyers advised him to. Lawyer Gloria Allred - who has called on the Duke of York to make a statement - said an anonymous client had filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein's estate. The alleged victim said: ""I would also like to say I agree with Gloria that Prince Andrew, and any others that are close to Epstein, should come forward and give a statement under oath on what information they have."" Prince Andrew defended meeting Epstein after the financier was registered as a sex offender In his BBC interview, Prince Andrew also ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with an American woman, who says she was forced to have sex with him aged 17. Virginia Giuffre - one of Epstein's accusers, previously known as Virginia Roberts - claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times. Responding to the allegation, the prince said: ""I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."" He added Ms Giuffre's account of him ""profusely sweating"" and ""pouring with perspiration"" when they danced at the club on the night in 2001 when she says they first had sex was impossible, because he had a medical condition preventing him from perspiring. People close to Prince Andrew said he wanted to address the issues head-on and did so with ""honesty and humility"" in speaking to Newsnight. Jonathan Turley, law professor at George Washington University, said it was ""likely"" the prince would receive a legal summons if he went to the US and lawyers representing alleged victims managed to access him. ""There are a lot of these lawyers who would love to hand Prince Andrew a subpoena [an order to give evidence],"" he told the BBC. But Prof Turley added the duke would have diplomatic immunity if he was in the US as part of a royal - rather than personal - engagement. ""This interview [has] put him in a rather precarious position if he plans to visit the United States any time soon,"" he added. This video can not be played Prince Andrew: 'Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do' The prince has stood by his decision to speak out, but former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter described the interview as ""excruciating"". And BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the prince was ""very damaged"" by the interview, adding the attempt to clear his name had ""failed, badly"". A lawyer for several of Epstein's accusers described the interview as ""sad"" and ""depressing"". Spencer Kuvin, who represents several unnamed alleged victims,said ""royalty has failed them"". ""The mere fact that he was friends with a convicted sex offender and chose to continue his relationship with him - it just shows a lack of acknowledgement of the breadth of what this man [Epstein] did to these girls,"" Mr Kuvin said. The prince said he visited Epstein in 2010, after he was released from jail, to tell him their friendship was over. He said that was the last contact he ever had with him.

Where in England does care cost the most?,"The care system helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing, eating and medication. It is under pressure across the UK after past governments failed to reform or fund the council-run system properly. The pressure on social care during the coronavirus pandemic has led to renewed calls for government action. Onhis first day,externalas prime minister in 2019, Boris Johnson committed to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared"". But that plan has yet to be published - ministers say they will bring forward proposals in 2021. The system is devolved across the four nations, meaning governments need to develop solutions unique to their own region. Unlike the NHS, social care is means-tested. To receive help from your local authority, you must have a very high level of need and, in England and Northern Ireland, savings and assets of less than Â£23,250. In Wales, the threshold is Â£24,000 for non-residential care but Â£50,000 for residential care. Scotland operates a different system. Since 2010, the number of older people asking for council help has increased, but fewer now qualify for support in their own home or in care homes. The charity Age UK estimates there are 1.5 million people in England who need some help with day-to-day life, but do not receive it. Care home residents accounted for almost a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales up to January 2021, according to analysis by the PA news agency. Meanwhile, staff sickness and problems with personal protective equipment (PPE) supply increased pressure on the care system. The King's Fund says the pandemic has had a""devastating"" impact on the quality of care,external. Despite increasing demand, spending is still 3% lower than a decade ago. The money councils spend on social care comes from: A lump sum from central government that is used to pay for local public services (including social care) Funds raised by councils themselves, mainly from council tax Cuts to funding from central government led to a 17% fall in councils' spending on local public services between 2010 and 2019,according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies,external. Local authorities have generally tried to protect their spending on adult social care, and the government has put in extra short-term money in recent years. The Local Government Association has said councils are under intense financial pressure, particularly since the start of the pandemic. The fees that local authorities pay for care, both in a person's own home or care homes, vary hugely depending on where you live. But across the country, the companies and charities who provide those services complain that councils are not covering the real cost of care. The squeeze on council funding in England means that people who pay for themselves are often propping up the care system. In 2016, the competition regulatorestimated that in care homes,external, self-funders paid significantly more in fees than a local authority resident. Increasingly, care companies warn they would go out of business without private clients subsidising the system. Many of those self-funders will have ended up selling their family home to pay for their care. It is one of the reasons why many view the current system as unfair. The care systems across the UK are increasingly different in the way they operate, with England the least generous. For instance, in Wales, no-one who is eligible for care at home is expected to pay more than Â£100 a week towards it. The systems in Northern Ireland and Scotland are different for support at home and residential care. In Northern Ireland, no-one over the age of 75 pays for home care. Scotland provides free personal care for people who are assessed as needing support at home, whatever their age. In Scottish care homes, people get free care if they have savings or assets of less than Â£18,000. Those with savings and assets of between Â£18,000 and Â£28,750 have to fund part of their care on a sliding scale, while people with more than that have to fund their own care, apart from a Â£193.50 a week contribution towards personal care and Â£87.10 a week towards nursing care. These differences are reflected in the amount of money each nation spends per person on social care. There is no comparable data for Northern Ireland. The UK has an ageing population and the pressures on the care system will only increase. While living longer is considered a positive, many older people will develop health conditions which mean they need help with day-to-day life. For instance, the number of people with dementia in the UK is expected tomore than double to 1.6 million by 2040,external. The Alzheimer's Society has estimated that without local authority help, someone with dementia will typically have to spend Â£100,000 on the care they need. For a long timethey have called this a ""dementia tax"",external, as someone who develops the disease will have to cover their own costs until their assets are reduced to Â£23,250 - the threshold for qualifying for local authority help in England. But the growth in people needing care is fastest among working-age adults, rather than over-65s.  According to the Kings Fund,care for working-age adults is nearly twice as expensive as for older people,external. There is a knock-on effect for the health service if the care system is supporting fewer people, and only those with the highest needs. Someone struggling to cope on their own is more likely to have a fall or neglect themselves, meaning they end up in hospital emergency departments. Then, when they are ready to leave hospital, a lack of social care in the community can lead to them being stuck in a hospital bed for longer than required. This is why experts say the future of the NHS is tied to creating an effective social care system. Finding sufficient people willing to take on the challenging, yet rewarding, work of looking after people in their own home, or in care homes, is a continuing problem. Thelatest official data for England,externalshows there are 112,000 vacancies - over 7% of the social care workforce in England. Nearly a quarter of the 1.5 million people working in the sector are on zero-hours contracts (when employees are not guaranteed a full working week) and pay is often the minimum wage. Many argue that improving the pay and skills of the workforce is vital to encourage people to consider care work as a career. Increasingly, social care workers are carrying out tasks that would once have been done by trained nurses.

How Boris Johnson rose to power," by John Pienaar by John Pienaar I’d made my own preposterous suggestion on the phone to the then Conservative celebrity-MP for Henley in the autumn of 2002. After a few minutes of cajoling and gentle persuasion he relented and changed his mind. “OK, I’ll fight you,” said Johnson. “But you’ll have to promise not to break my nose.” I did, of course. Promise, I mean. Not break his nose. I had been recruited to take part in a televised bout of “celebrity boxing”, live on BBC Two. In the end, the British Boxing Board of Control had more sense than I and, for a fleeting moment, Johnson had at the time. The boxing authorities judged that a high-profile fight between two barely trained middle-aged amateurs might be “reckless and irresponsible”. The “fight” was cancelled. Johnson had pulled out by then, in any case. Not through any lack of “bottle”. Everything I have seen, heard or read about the UK’s new leader suggests no great fear of physical or, for that matter, political or social risk. He clearly likes the idea of himself as a bit of a battler, not one to retreat from a scrap. “Man or mouse?” he is fond of saying before some sudden boyish challenge to a friend or colleague - a game of “whiff-whaff” [ping-pong] on the table in his office, or a quick competitive sprint. In an interview with the Daily Mail recently, he gave his favourite quote as: “It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog.” Nor did I detect then, or since, any conventional instinct to protect his dignity. Just the opposite. We had invited Johnson precisely because he cared so little for that. But he did, I think, feel it might seem a little ridiculous, even for him, to risk his profile in such a way before a live audience of millions, even for charity. Incidentally, much later, as London Mayor, Johnson was said to have demonstrated his martial instincts byphysically battling in a meeting room with David Cameron, like two overgrown schoolboys, for possession of a Treasury note setting out the available funds for transport in London. Afterwards, as Andrew Gimson records in his biography of Johnson, both men claimed victory. We’ll never know the truth. It was, though, another glimpse into the deep rivalry underlying the outwardly friendly relationship between the pair. At an uncertain and unstable time for British politics, for the economy and for the country’s place in the world, Conservative Party members chose a leader who defies almost every norm. Any objective assessment of Johnson’s record, judgement and character throws up one perfectly legitimate doubt after another. Yet his ability to connect with people (though not everyone and not all the time), to make them feel good about themselves and about him, is simply unique in public life. Whether at a feel-good time of national optimism, or, as now, a time of bitter division and much pessimism, it has turned out to be a gift which helped carry him into Downing Street. Boris Johnson’s depth of character may be little trusted by his critics and by quite a few of his supporters too, but when Theresa May stepped down, he managed to make himself the leadership candidate most trusted by the deeply Eurosceptic Tory ""selectorate"". So why Boris Johnson? And who exactly is he? I’d made my own preposterous suggestion on the phone to the then Conservative celebrity-MP for Henley in the autumn of 2002. After a few minutes of cajoling and gentle persuasion he relented and changed his mind. “OK, I’ll fight you,” said Johnson. “But you’ll have to promise not to break my nose.” I did, of course.

He clearly likes the idea of himself as a bit of a battler, not one to retreat from a scrap. “Man or mouse?”, he is fond of saying before some sudden boyish challenge to a friend or colleague - a game of “whiff-whaff” [ping-pong] on the table in his office, or a quick competitive sprint. In an interview with the Daily Mail recently, he gave his favourite quote as: “It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog.” Nor did I detect then, or since, any conventional instinct to protect his dignity. Just the opposite. We had invited Johnson precisely because he cared so little for that. But he did, I think, feel it might seem a little ridiculous, even for him, to risk his profile in such a way before a live audience of millions, even for charity. Incidentally, much later, as London Mayor, Johnson was said to have demonstrated his martial instincts byphysically battling in a meeting room with David Cameron, like two overgrown schoolboys, for possession of a Treasury note setting out the available funds for transport in London. Afterwards, as Andrew Gimson records in his book, Boris, both men claimed victory. We’ll never know the truth. It was, though, another glimpse into the deep rivalry underlying the outwardly friendly relationship between the pair. At an uncertain and unstable time for British politics, for the economy and for the country’s place in the world, Conservative Party members chose a leader who defies almost every norm.  Any objective assessment of Johnson’s record, judgement and character throws up one perfectly legitimate doubt after another. Yet his ability to connect with people (though not everyone and not all the time), to make them feel good about themselves and about him, is simply unique in public life. Whether at a feel-good time of national optimism, or, as now, a time of bitter division and much pessimism, it has turned out to be a gift which has helped carry him into Downing Street. Boris Johnson ’s depth of character may be little trusted by his critics and by quite a few of his supporters too, but when Theresa May stepped down, he managed to make himself the leadership candidate most trusted by the deeply Eurosceptic Tory ""selectorate"". So why Boris Johnson? And who exactly is he? The first thing to note is that he is not actually Boris at all, despite the rare distinction in politics of being known universally by that single name. He was born Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson on 19 June 1964. He chose to be called Boris and his family, friends and eventually everyone else have amiably obliged him. For one so stereotypically English, his ancestry is surprisingly varied - a mixture of English Christians, Turkish Muslims and Eastern European Jews. His maternal great-grandfather was an Orthodox Lithuanian rabbi. His paternal great-grandfather was a Turkish political activist, Ali Kemal, who was apparently lynched after falling foul of the nationalists then in power. Boris, Sonia Purnell records in her biography, was the name of a Russian emigre friend of the family. Johnson was born in New York City, and spent his earliest days with father Stanley and mother Charlotte in a home opposite the famous Chelsea Hotel, hangout of many famous rock stars of the time. His father began a master’s degree in agricultural economics, and after what he has reportedly hinted to be an unsuccessful attempt to recruit him as a spy (undergoing “the most intensive training in clandestine techniques known to man”) he worked briefly for the World Bank in Washington DC, before he was sacked. Apparently, being perhaps something of a block off the old chip, he submitted a suggestion for a $100m loan to build three pyramids and a sphinx to help the Egyptian tourist effort. It was an April Fool joke. His employers were not amused.  Leader profiles: Jeremy Corbyn Jo Swinson Nicola Sturgeon Nigel Farage  Back in the UK, Stanley and Charlotte raised a family: a daughter, Rachel, who recently joined the Liberal Democrats before defecting to the then Independent Group as a candidate for the European Parliament (more successful as a journalist than as a politician); Leo who did well in finance, and Jo, who worked in Downing Street as a policy thinker under David Cameron, and became a respected minister under Cameron and Theresa May. The siblings were ferociously competitive. Stanley’s ambition was to raise a journalistic and political dynasty, and he did. Young Boris was at Eton, and the family living in Brussels, when his parents split. He doesn’t like to speak of that time, or its effect on him, but it was painful. Charlotte - a celebrated artist - subsequently suffered a serious mental breakdown and spent nine months as a patient in a psychiatric hospital. So Boris Johnson’s early life cannot be described as easy, or pain-free. His now famous amiable, bumbling persona - a close copy of his father’s - has sometimes been described as a defence mechanism, concealing a sharp brain and a fine but well-disguised instinct for personal advantage. At any rate, after a spell at Ashdown House boarding school, Johnson went to Eton with an academically prestigious King’s Scholarship. He became a contemporary of, among others, David Cameron - and a close friend to then Viscount Althorp (now Earl Spencer), brother to Princess Diana, and Darius Guppy who was later to be jailed for five years for fraud. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, King's Scholar at Eton Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, King's Scholar at Eton At Eton, AB Johnson became  “Boris” - rather posh, very English, somewhat eccentric and the deeply distinctive, deliberately dishevelled character we know now. He was also very clever - “brilliant” according to one teacher - and endowed with what has arguably become a strong sense of entitlement to both make up and play by his own rules. He was a formidable debater, and became adept at deflecting awkward questions with non-committal answers (as any journalist who has interviewed him can testify). The report from his housemaster makes interesting reading now. He wrote of Boris to his father: “I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception - one who should be free of the network of obligations which binds everyone else. Boris is pretty impressive when success can be achieved by pure intelligence, unaccompanied by hard work.” His character - clever, capable of achieving impressive results though always very much on his own terms - was forming. Future opponent Ken Livingstone wrote an attack on public schools while Johnson was a pupil. He wrote a reply in the school newspaper, recounted in Purnell’s biography, dismissing his future adversary’s arguments as “twaddle, utter bunkum, balderdash, tommyrot, piffle and fiddlesticks”. His distinctive vocabulary seemed to be forming too. Below: Boris Johnson during his 1986 term as Oxford Union president, with the Greek politician Melina Mercouri Below: Boris Johnson during his 1986 term as Oxford Union president, with the Greek politician Melina Mercouri He earned a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, with a roll-call of political and journalistic luminaries as contemporaries. Those at Oxford University at the time included David Cameron, William Hague, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt. Labour’s Miliband brothers, David and Ed, as well as Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper were there too. “What a sharp-elbowed thrusting and basically repellent lot we were,” was his own verdict, said, presumably, with amused irony. “Always bragging and shafting each other. And in a way we still are.” Johnson, like David Cameron and George Osborne,,famously joined the infamous Bullingdon Club of rich, rowdy and elitist undergraduates. 1985: At Viscount Althorp's 21st birthday party with his future wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen (left), and his sister Rachel 1985: At Viscount Althorp's 21st birthday party with his future wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen (left), and his sister Rachel Cameron has since played down this aspect of his Oxford career, with its trashing of dining rooms and debauchery. Boris Johnson, it is suggested, has never been much attached to hell-raising, though the Etonian network was undeniably useful in pursuit of his great ambition of becoming president of the Oxford Union - historically, at least, a stepping stone to the office of prime minister. Johnson met his first wife, Allegra Mostyn-Owen, at Oxford - another ambition. But he never attained the goal of a first-class degree in Classics, something friends say still rankles to this day.  He did, though, make connections which became more than useful in what was to be a journalistic and political career of dizzying ups and crashing, if temporary, setbacks. It has always proved hard to keep Boris Johnson down. In his run for the party leadership it was often said - by me among many others - that the only person capable of defeating Boris Johnson was Boris Johnson.

In his run for the party leadership it was often said - by me among many others - that the only person capable of defeating Boris Johnson was Boris Johnson. From the earliest days of his career, he nonetheless seemed determined to try. Boris Johnson the prime minister would, one imagines, hate being subject to the kind of reporting and analysis that Boris Johnson the fledgling journalist made his own particular trademark. As a trainee fresh out of Balliol College, he joined the Times newspaper under the editorship of the near legendary Charlie Wilson - a tough, Glaswegian out of the old school of Fleet Street broadsheet journalism. Johnson was found to have tried too hard to pep up a fairly innocuous story about the discovery of a palace of Edward II on the south bank of the Thames. His historical account was nonsensical, and an accompanying quote entirely made up. He wrote how the king would frolic at the palace with his sidekick Piers Gaveston. Only Gaveston had been executed years before the palace was built, and the made-up quote was attributed to an Oxford academic who was also his godfather, but nonetheless, not surprisingly, complained. Johnson was sacked. It might have been the end of his journalistic - and conceivably any other - career in any profession requiring trust. But it wasn’t. Daily Telegraph editor Max Hastings, who had met Johnson while he was hosting the great and the good at the Oxford Union, gave him a chance to redeem himself and he grabbed it with both hands. Soon, as the paper’s Europe correspondent in Brussels, Johnson made his name as a pioneer on what in 1989 became a new frontier of deeply Eurosceptic reporting. Much of the reporting at the time was done by correspondents who were arguably much more sympathetic to the culture of what was then called the European Economic Community. Johnson’s stories consistently made the front page, pleased readers who held the EEC’s “federalism” and interfering ways  in contempt - some of them, like Iain Duncan Smith, now prominent political supporters of the new regime set for Downing Street - and made his work popular to the point of becoming cult reading. His journalism artfully mixed fact with wild Eurosceptic fiction. There were tales about unlawfully curved bananas, wrongly sized condoms, and one about the European Commission headquarters Berlaymont building being about to be blown up with dynamite because it was found to contain asbestos. Often, the reports made you laugh out loud, which only added to their force. I remember running into him in Strasbourg, during a session of the European Parliament while I was a political reporter with the Independent. He was smirking at a name he’d invented for the leader of the Conservatives in the parliament, Sir Christopher Prout -  “Brussels-Prout”. He has a useful gift of somehow making you laugh even when his jokes are not especially good. But my former Independent colleagues, like other journos covering Europe, were not always so easily amused by their rival from the Telegraph. “He was fundamentally intellectually dishonest, in my view,” David Usborne told Andrew Gimson in an interview for his book. “He was serving his masters in a very skilful way but I never felt he believed... He was a highly intelligent man, much cleverer than I was, he could see all these nuances and subtleties, but he wasn’t conveying them in his writing. It was a cheap thrill - a stunt, and quite a dangerous stunt really.”  As you’d expect, Max Hastings, his then editor, took a slightly indulgent view of his talented protege. He is perhaps rather less tolerant in retrospect. “I don’t think we ever caught him out in anything he deserved to be sacked for, or to be brought home from Brussels,” he told me in an interview for the BBC’s Panorama. “Boris’s relationship with integrity and truth, and with the right moral standards has always been a bit uncertain to put it politely.” As we’ll see, not everyone has been inclined to “put it politely” when it comes to Johnson’s character and record. Max Hastings’ assessment of his former employee is striking. “All human relations are about who makes you feel good… more than any other politician in British life today he’s a genius. He is absolutely terrific at telling people what they want to hear and he does it with wit, with elegance, with style. “He’s got that quality that causes his believers to be prepared to overlook all the things people traditionally ask about. Is he truthful? Is he honest? Is he nice to his wife? None of that stuff matters.” But Hastings has argued for some time that Johnson is unfit for national office,writingof his “moral bankruptcy, rooted in a contempt for truth”. Some, including his biographer Sonia Purnell, have credited Boris Johnson’s Eurosceptic journalism in Brussels with creating the climate which nurtured anti-EEC feeling in the Tory Party and in doing so destroyed John Major’s administration. That, I think, is a bit of a stretch. Major’s government was exhausted after 18 years of Tory government, and battle-weary after the struggle which ended Margaret Thatcher’s premiership in 1990. The Conservatives were tottering in the face of Tony Blair and New Labour’s assault and, vulnerable to the country’s appetite for “change”, were kicked out in the truly crushing general election defeat of 1997. But as the Conservatives finally ran out of time, Boris Johnson was just getting started.

But as the Conservatives finally ran out of time, Boris Johnson was just getting started.  Johnson’s media career bore fruit, just as his efforts to cultivate his celebrity status blossomed, and his political efforts took root. He was a popular turn on the BBC’s Have I Got News For You, and he had quickly advanced to star columnist at the Telegraph, and editor of the Spectator soon afterwards. After an unsuccessful run at the impregnable Welsh Labour stronghold of Clwyd South in 1997, his high media profile helped him pluck the plum candidacy of Henley. He got into Parliament in 2001, succeeding Michael Heseltine, in his time a political super-heavyweight and aspirant premier himself, though obviously less successful in that ambition than Johnson. 2002: Presenting the BBC panel show Have I Got News For You 2002: Presenting the BBC panel show Have I Got News For You For a while, it all seemed to be going almost too well. And it was. Johnson - who was divorced in 1993 and later married the barrister Marina Wheeler - was given a shadow ministerial job by party leader Michael Howard. But he was sacked after lying about an affair with his Spectator colleague Petronella Wyatt. In an interview with the BBC’s Today programme this year, Howard suggested sacking Johnsonmight have been a mistake. But that moment of repentance came when Johnson was very much closer to the premiership he craved than Howard had ever been. At the time of his sacking, he was a mere junior arts spokesman. And it wasn’t Johnson’s only setback. Another had been, if anything, more humiliating. Marina Wheeler, Boris Johnson's second wife Marina Wheeler, Boris Johnson's second wife A leading article appeared in the Spectator in October 2004 after the awful murder of Ken Bigley while a hostage in Iraq. It described the “mawkish sentimentality” of the reaction. Bigley was a Liverpudlian, from a city still raw from the deaths of 96 fans in the Hillsborough football stadium tragedy of 1989. For Howard, a passionate fan of Liverpool Football Club, it was too much, and he ordered Johnson to go to the city to apologise. It became a grim media circus. Not the first to surround Boris Johnson. And not the last. He was constructing a reputation for gaffes and scrapes, but also having a way of somehow surviving them. That knack, as we have seen, has turned out to be very handy. The tabloid flurry over his relationship with Petronella Wyatt wasn’t the only one of its kind. Newspapers have other tales on file. Yet, as Max Hastings told me, moral disapproval never seems to have stuck, or, where it has, to have inflicted permanent political harm. Johnson himself often refused to answer interviewers’ questions about his private life during the Tory leadership campaign. They were not often asked. With Petronella Wyatt at the Spectator summer party, 2006 With Petronella Wyatt at the Spectator summer party, 2006 Go back to his past writings, however, and he has argued for a liberal approach to the private lives of public figures. In a piece for the Telegraph in January 1998, defending the then US President Bill Clinton, he posed the question: “Does anyone think a bunch of uniformly virtuous politicians would make the slightest difference? Of course they wouldn’t… the press wilfully muddles the issue, feeding on public prurience and jealousy.” Highs and lows have come and gone, including his two spells as Conservative Mayor of London. The then Conservative leader, his Eton and Oxford contemporary, David Cameron, was not at first keen on Johnson becoming candidate for City Hall. Would he be a liability? He was certainly a rival attraction. Lord Coe was preferred, but didn’t want the job. Some believe Cameron’s lack of enthusiasm helped convince Johnson to go for it. And the prospect of the Tory Party scoring a huge victory in the capital, against the odds, became attractive in Downing Street. Was his mayoralty a success? Depends who you ask. House building went up. Crime came down. “Boris Bikes” filled the streets. Critics say he inherited Ken Livingstone’s legacy, and that crime came down across the country. In the build-up and aftermath of the 2012 London Olympics, it is reasonable to argue Johnson’s role as a frontman outweighed his actual contribution to delivering the event itself. His leadership rival, Jeremy Hunt, played a bigger role in the practicalities. Lord Coe did too. But as a frontman Johnson had no equal. Obviously, he never intended to get stuck half way down a zip-wire near the Olympic site. For someone else, it might have been disastrous. For Johnson it was a comedic triumph. No wonder David Cameron - who always perceived Johnson’s unique potential - described him as a man capable of “defying gravity”. Young and old, left and right, the crowds cheered, and that raises the question: “Who is the real Boris Johnson?” Was it the leader of the metropolitan, multicultural, liberal and Labour-leaning capital? Or is it the darling of the Brexit-loving, deep dyed Conservative, and more socially conservative, party members who have elected him to be theirs and the country’s leader? His critics -  and some of his friends - believe the answer to that question is that Boris Johnson is whoever he needs to be to advance politically. Another, slightly pseudo-psychoanalytical take is that he truly believes everything that he says or writes, at the moment that he says or writes it. That is barely a more flattering view. Yet another view is that Johnson is at heart a “one-nation” Conservative, socially liberal and personally kind (a master at Eton says he never witnessed Johnson uttering an unkind word), and optimistic in a way that is infectious. MPs who were former colleagues at City Hall speak highly of his abilities.Kit Malthouse, who was deputy mayor for policing, said Johnson had succeeded in “tackling poverty, cutting crime - particularly knife crime, building the homes people need and delivering a cleaner, greener city”.James Cleverly, who also worked with Johnson as a London Assembly member, said: “I know he can run a successful executive operation because I was part of the team who did that in London for eight years.” Both initially announced their intention to stand for the Conservative leadership before dropping out and backing Johnson. Before he took office in July, there had been much talk of Johnson being a“chairman of the board”.The idea was that as prime minister he would surround himself with talented people - in much the same way he did as mayor - rather than trying to micromanage. The questions about Boris Johnson's political judgement have been stacked higher by memories of his lead role in the campaign to leave the European Union, which won against all expectations, and later by two years as foreign secretary, his tenure distinguished chiefly by a succession of gaffes and diplomatic banana skins. To be fair, he wrote his rude poem about the president of Turkey and a goat before he became foreign secretary. He had less excuse for obliquely comparing the EU to the ambitions to dominate the continent exemplified by Napoleon and Hitler. His mistake in describing Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - then already in custody in Iran - as teaching journalism in the country was more serious. He was simply wrong. The comments had “traumatic effects” for her, her husband later said, and were used to justify a second court case against her. A protester holds a picture of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, imprisoned in Iran A protester holds a picture of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, imprisoned in Iran Ken Clarke, who has filled virtually all the most senior jobs in Conservative cabinets, told me that as foreign secretary, Johnson ""was a disaster”. “The diplomats were driven up the wall. He didn’t read the brief. The only thing he worked at were the photo opportunities at foreign meetings… quite the most hopelessly irresponsible foreign secretary I’ve ever known from any party.”  For an alternative, vastly more friendly view, you might try Camilla Tominey in the Telegraph. Shehit backat all the “lazy caricatures”, and preferred to remember Johnson’s support as foreign secretary for girls’ education around the globe, as well as his backing for strong sanctions after the poison attack on the Russian defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, which resulted in the expulsion of 100 Russian diplomats by the UK and allies including the US. She also drew attention to his habit of delegating tasks to trusted subordinates. Now, Camilla Tominey was, of course, a colleague of Johnson’s on the Telegraph, where he wrote a regular and highly prized, highly paid column. Ken Clarke is a known critic of Brexit. My guess is you may already be predisposed to agree with one side or the other. Either way, Boris Johnson was chosen to serve as foreign secretary not for his diplomatic skills, but because Theresa May wanted prominent Brexiteers in the cabinet jobs most closely tasked with delivering it. That plan didn’t work out particularly well for her. Brexit ground to a standstill. May resigned, having failed wretchedly to achieve a mission which, in truth, seemed all but impossible from the moment of her disastrous “victory” in the 2017 general election, and Boris Johnson’s rise to replace her is now pencilled into political history. He’ll be hoping it makes easy reading in time to come. Again, we’ll see. The story of Johnson’s role in the Leave campaign has been told too often to need much retelling here. There were the two newspaper columns he wrote, one for leaving and one against. The friends (or former friends) like Roland Rudd, the financial PR man who now chairs the People’s Vote campaign, who told me bitterly how Johnson pledged his devotion to the Remain side shortly before announcing the opposite. Sir Craig Oliver, then director of communications in Downing Street under David Cameron, testifies to a poetic text message from Johnson predicting Brexit would be crushed “like the toad beneath the harrow”, sent moments before he came out for the Leave side. According to who’s telling the tale, it’s damning evidence that Johnson was never a true Brexiteer with some saying that he joined what he hoped would be the losing side (though still the one most useful to his leadership ambitions) or that he was genuinely torn by doubt until the last moment. Does the accusation of dishonesty stick? Detractors point to the dubious slogan plastered on the side of the Leave campaign bus suggesting Brexit would free £350m a week for the NHS, and also the alarming suggestion that millions of Turks were waiting to enter the UK and swamp the health service almost overnight. The charge sheet of false or inflated campaign claims, with which Johnson became associated, is a long one. Of course, Brexiteers are no less vocal in condemning the Remain side’s hair-raising economic prophecies - Project Fear. You will doubtless have your own view. If Boris Johnson feels any regret - and I have never heard anything to suggest that he does - he has kept it to himself. A friend and close associate told me he is proud of what he achieved, and considers that he “owns” Brexit. Another friend, his close adviser at City Hall, Guto Harri (a former BBC colleague) told me: “He has to focus very narrowly on the Conservative grassroots now. But he will know that he will only succeed as prime minister if he broadens his focus and his appeal once again way beyond that. It’s something he did pull off as mayor and I just hope he can do that again.” Johnson may or may not “own” Brexit. He certainly owns the responsibility to deliver it, or to deliver something that works. His leadership will be unlike anything we’ve seen. But the consequences will be no joke. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Jeremy Hunt was a member of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford - this has now been changed. The questions about his political judgement have been stacked higher by memories of his lead role in the campaign to leave the European Union, which won against all expectations, and later by two years as foreign secretary, his tenure distinguished chiefly by a succession of gaffes and diplomatic banana skins. To be fair, he wrote his rude poem about the president of Turkey and a goat before he became foreign secretary. He had less excuse for obliquely comparing the EU to the ambitions to dominate the continent exemplified by Napoleon and Hitler. His mistake in describing Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - then already in custody in Iran - as teaching journalism in the country was more serious. He was simply wrong. The comments had “traumatic effects” for her, her husband later said, and were used to justify a second court case against her. A protester holds a picture of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, imprisoned in Iran A protester holds a picture of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, imprisoned in Iran Westminster’s longest-serving MP, Ken Clarke, has filled all the most senior jobs in Conservative cabinets save that of prime minister. “[Boris Johnson] was a disaster,” he told me. “The diplomats were driven up the wall. He didn’t read the brief. The only thing he worked at were the photo opportunities at foreign meetings… quite the most hopelessly irresponsible foreign secretary I’ve ever known from any party.” For an alternative, vastly more friendly view, you might try Camilla Tominey’s in the Daily Telegraph. Shehit backat all the “lazy caricatures”, and preferred to remember Johnson’s support as foreign secretary for girls’ education around the globe, as well as his backing for strong sanctions after the poison attack on the Russian defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, which resulted in the expulsion of 100 Russian diplomats by the UK and allies including the US. She also drew attention to his habit of delegating tasks to trusted subordinates. Now, Camilla Tominey is, of course, a colleague of Johnson’s on the Telegraph where he writes a regular and highly prized, highly paid column. Ken Clarke is a known critic of Brexit. My guess is you may already be predisposed to agree with one side or the other. Either way, Boris Johnson was chosen to serve as foreign secretary not for his diplomatic skills, but because Theresa May wanted prominent Brexiteers in the cabinet jobs most closely tasked with delivering it. That plan didn’t work out particularly well for her. Brexit ground to a standstill. May resigned, having failed wretchedly to achieve a mission which, in truth, seemed all but impossible from the moment of her disastrous “victory” in the 2017 general election, and Boris Johnson’s rise to replace her is now pencilled into political history. He’ll be hoping it makes easy reading in time to come. Again, we’ll see. The story of Johnson’s role in the Leave campaign has been told too often to need much retelling here. There were the two newspaper columns he wrote, one for leaving and one against. The friends (or former friends) like Roland Rudd, the financial PR man who now chairs the People’s Vote campaign, who told me bitterly how Johnson pledged his devotion to the Remain side shortly before announcing the opposite. Sir Craig Oliver, then director of communications in Downing Street under David Cameron, testifies to a poetic text message from Johnson predicting Brexit would be crushed “like the toad beneath the harrow”, sent moments before he came out for the Leave side. According to who’s telling the tale, it’s damning evidence that Johnson was never a true Brexiteer with some saying that he joined what he hoped would be the losing side (though still the one most useful to his leadership ambitions) or that he was genuinely torn by doubt until the last moment. Does the accusation of dishonesty stick? Detractors point to the dubious slogan plastered on the side of the Leave campaign bus suggesting Brexit would free £350m a week for the NHS, and also the alarming suggestion that millions of Turks were waiting to enter the UK and swamp the health service almost overnight. The charge sheet of false or inflated campaign claims, with which Johnson became associated, is a long one. Of course, Brexiteers are no less vocal in condemning the Remain side’s hair-raising economic prophecies - Project Fear. You will doubtless have your own view. If Boris Johnson feels any regret - and I have never heard anything to suggest that he does - he has kept it to himself.

Man jailed after fatal 80mph road race,"Neil Brooks had denied causing death by dangerous driving A driver who caused the ""needless"" death of a woman in an 80mph crash has been jailed for eight years. Neil Brooks, 49, of Beaufort, Ebbw Vale, in Blaenau Gwent, raced his friend Jay Bayliss through residential streets in Brynmawr in July 2017. Mr Bayliss' girlfriend Sophie Brimble, 20, was a front seat passenger when he lost control to smash into a lamppost. Brooks had earlier been found guilty at Cardiff Crown Court of causing her death by dangerous driving. He was also found guilty of causing serious injury to Mr Bayliss by dangerous driving. Mr Bayliss was so severely injured he was not fit to be charged over Miss Brimble's death. Sophie Brimble was killed in the crash in July 2017 Brooks, driving a VW Bora, instigated the ""impromptu"" race late at night when he recognised Mr Bayliss' VW Polo. Prosecutor Matthew Cobbe said: ""It was one driver egging the other on. It was this race that led to the catastrophic collision which led to the death of Miss Brimble."" Mr Cobbe said the pair were driving ""aggressively"" at more than double the 30mph speed limit in the minutes before the fatal crash. He said: ""They pushed their vehicles hard through this residential area, both of them reaching speeds in excess of 80mph, their focus now on their race. ""Mr Bayliss lost control, his car began to rotate and it slid towards a metal lamp-post. The result was a catastrophe."" Ms Brimble, of Crickhowell, Powys, died at the scene on King Street, Brynmawr. Man guilty of killing woman in 80mph race crash Tributes to woman killed in crash Her mother, Ruth Jenkins, said in a victim impact statement, the family's life had ""changed forever"" on that day. ""Having the police officer tell us that Sophie had died left us in complete shock and for days, everything was a daze,"" she said. ""I was so angry with Bayliss for driving like an idiot. How could be so stupid and selfish. ""This should never have happened. It was all down to two drivers' stupidity and carelessness with no thoughts of consequences."" Sentencing Brooks, Judge Michael Fitton said: ""The loss of Sophie's life at the age of 20 was a needless tragedy that could so easily have been avoided. ""The hurt that has been caused is incalculable."" Brooks was also disqualified from driving for a total of nine years.

NHS to pay tax bills to get doctors back to work,"Doctors in England have been promised their tax bills will be covered by the NHS in an attempt to get them back doing overtime shifts. Doctors have been refusing to do extra work because they were being landed with bills after changes to how much can be accrued in pensions tax-free. Senior NHS figures and ministers have signed off on the plan amid concern about the impact on waiting times. Waiting times have hit theirworst levels on record. The data released last week showed delays in A&E and for routine operations were at their highest levels since targets were introduced more than a decade ago. Therow over the pension changesis considered to be just one factor in that. But NHS leaders have been pushing ministers to agree to a short-term fix with pressure growing ahead of winter. The proposal will mean doctors can take money out of their pension pots to pay the tax bills they get next year. The NHS will then top up their pension pots before retirement, meaning the cost of the measure to the health service will be spread out over time while doctors will not be out of pocket. The emergency measure will only apply for the 2019-20 tax year. The Treasury is still looking at how the pension changes have been implemented in an attempt to find a long-term solution ahead of the start of the next financial year in April. The amount people can put into pensions tax free has been reduced for all workers. In 2010-11 it was Â£255,000, but has now been cut to Â£40,000 a year - and drops still further for the highest earners. The changes tends to affect those earning more than Â£110,000, around a third of senior doctors and GPs. A number of short-term fixes have already been tried, including allowing staff to temporarily opt out of the scheme and get any pension payments that they would have got put into their pay packet instead. But these have had a limited impact on the stand-off, prompting NHS England to agree to the latest step. There are differences to how pensions work elsewhere in the UK, although tax-free allowances have been reduced in each nation. Currently only the NHS in England has taken this step.

Vietnam bills grieving families to return bodies,"Relatives and neighbours of one of the victims attend a Buddhist prayer ceremony in Vietnam Grieving families in Vietnam have been offered loans to cover the costs of repatriating their loved ones' bodies in the wake of the Essex lorry incident, the BBC has learnt. Some relatives told the BBC they have been approached by the Vietnamese authorities with consent forms. These gave them the option of taking a loan from the government, or covering the repatriation costs themselves. The BBC has contacted the Vietnamese embassy in the UK for comment. Who are the victims? What we know Authorities found the bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals inside a container in the town of Grays in Essex last month. Two lorry drivers have since been charged with manslaughter, and several other men have been arrested in connection with the case. Whilethe police identified all the victims ten days ago, the bodies have not yet been returned to Vietnam. Coroners in England and Wales must grant permission before a body can be moved abroad or to other parts of the UK. Consent forms seen by the BBC say: ""I, on behalf of the family, pledge to pay back all relevant expenses that the authorities have made in advance in order to repatriate them from the UK."" A section of the Vietnamese consent form shown to the BBC Victims' families have been offered a discounted price of 66 million dong (Â£2,200; $2,840) to repatriate a body or 44 million dong to bring back the ashes, the BBC has learnt. Families had already taken out loans of up to Â£40,000 to pay for smuggling their relatives to the UK. Why are Vietnamese people trying to reach the UK? Lorry death agony builds for Vietnamese families Pham Ngoc Tuan, brother of one of the victims. told the BBC's Nga Pham: ""We already had to borrow so much money, we had to mortgage what we had. I don't even know if we can borrow anymore."" ""We have been told the main issue now is money and even though we had to borrow a lot of money to send them away, we may borrow more to bring them home,"" said Tien Pham, cousin of two victims, in a Facebook live stream. In the wake of the deaths, the Vietnamese embassy in London pledged to ""closely co-ordinate with the relevant authorities of Vietnam and UK to support the families of the Vietnamese victims... to bring their loved ones home"". It also issued its ""heartfelt condolences"" to the families.

Jewish settlements no longer illegal - US,"Israel has established more than 100 Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem The US has shifted its position on Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, no longer viewing them as inconsistent with international law. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the status of the West Bank was for Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate. Israel welcomed the move - a reversal of the US stance under President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. Settlements are communities established by Israel on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. They have long been a source of dispute between Israel and the international community, and the Palestinians. ""After carefully studying all sides of the legal debate,"" Mr Pompeo told reporters, ""the United States has concluded that ""the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not, per se, inconsistent with international law"". ""Calling the establishment of civilian settlements inconsistent with international law hasn't worked. It hasn't advanced the cause of peace,"" he added. Can the Jewish settlement issue be resolved? This video can not be played Is Palestinian-Israel peace plan out of reach? Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the US decision was a risk to ""global stability, security, and peace"" and said it threatened to replace international law with ""the law of the jungle"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the policy shift ""rights a historical wrong"", and called on other countries to do the same. The issue of Jewish settlements is one of the most contentious between Israel and the Palestinians. About 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are widely considered illegal under international law, though Israel has always disputed this. The Palestinians have long called for the removal of all settlements, arguing that their presence on land they claim for a future independent Palestinian state makes it almost impossible to make such a state a reality. Mr Pompeo said the decision would create the political space for a more likely resolution of the conflict. But that resolution is now more likely to be on Israel's terms, since it is by far the stronger party. Dismissing the international legal prohibitions on Jewish settlements undermines the legal framework for the peace process, including the notion of Palestinian national rights and the principle of self-determination. It will almost certainly boost the movement to expand and annex the Jewish settlements. There has already been a sharp increase in settlement planning and construction since Mr Trump took office. Palestinians will be dismayed, although not surprised. Palestinian analysts I have spoken with say the growth of Jewish settlements has essentially killed the potential for a viable two-state solution. They speak in terms of a war of position, saying that staying on the land and simply continuing their lives is a kind of non-violent resistance. In 1978, the Jimmy Carter administration concluded that the establishment of civilian settlements was inconsistent with international law. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan disagreed with that conclusion, saying he did not believe the settlements were inherently illegal. Since then, the US adopted a position of describing the settlements as ""illegitimate"" - though not ""illegal"" - and sheltering Israel from condemnatory resolutions on the issue at the United Nations. This video can not be played Mike Pompeo: ""Calling the establishment of civilian settlements 'inconsistent with international law' hasn't worked"" However one of the last acts of the Obama administration, at the end of 2016, was to break with US practice by not vetoing a UN resolution that urged an end to illegal Israeli settlements. President Trump's administration has displayed a much more tolerant attitude towards settlement activity than Mr Obama's. Mr Pompeo said the Trump administration had studied all sides of the debate and agreed with Reagan. Can the Jewish settlement issue be resolved?

Here's a recap of the day's headlines: The latest episode of Electioncast is now available to watch on iPlayer. Adam Fleming and Laura Kuenssberg discuss the business-heavy day on the campaign trail. Joey D'Urso and Marianna Spring from BBC Trending talk about the latest developments in digital campaigning. And Jeremy Vine calls in from Belfast. Watch the latest episode here. Some pictures from today David Gauke and Amber Rudd out campaigning Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the CBI conference Jeremy Corbyn delivers his speech to the CBI conference Ian Blackford speaks after the High Court ruling that broadcasters cannot be forced to include parties in televised debates Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson speaks at the CBI conference The chair of Leicester East Labour Party, John Thomas, has said he is resigning from the Labour Party and has called Jeremy Corbyn ""a clown"". He says in the letter he has ""nothing in common with"" the Labour Party under its current leadership. Leicester East has selected a new candidate, Claudia Webbe, after Keith Vaz announced he would stand down in this election. Ms Webbe is currently a Councillor in the London Borough of Islington. Labour have been contacted for a response. Former journalist and Conservative peer, Baroness Wheatcroft, has said she is backing the Liberal Democrat candidate for the Cities of London and Westminster seat, Chuka Umunna. Baroness Wheatcroft told the London Evening Standard that she had previously always supported the Conservatives but could not do at this election. Earlier in the year, she spoke in the House of Lords, backing further referendum on EU membership and said the rich could be protected from Brexit by moving their money offshore. Mr Umunna resigned from the Labour Party at the beginning of the year to join a new Independent Group of MPs and then became a Liberal Democrat. Members of the House of Lords cannot vote in general elections. You can see the full list of candidates standing in the Cities of London and Westminster seat,here. Radio 4 PM Boris Johnson's relationship with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri was back in the spotlight today,after she accused him of ""ignoring and blocking"" her following the controversy. It is alleged that she received favourable treatment during Mr Johnson's time as mayor of London because of their friendship - claims they both deny. Asked whether he believes the pair had an affair, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says that is ""not my belief"". âJennifer herself has said today that there was
absolutely no issue around conflicts [of interest] and she won the business fair and square
when it came to being awarded the funding,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. âThe prime minister has said everything he needs to
say on this.â He adds that the issue is ""completely irrelevant to what people want to hear about"" during a general election campaign. Radio 4 PM One of the key moments of Boris Johnson's speech to the CBI earlier was when he announced thatplanned cuts to corporation tax would be put on hold. Asked why the decision was made, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says it is ""part of our focus on public services"". âI think Boris quite rightly wants to make sure the
investment is targeted towards the NHS,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. In his speech, Mr Johnson said the Â£6bn saved by the move would spent on the NHS and other services. However, the announcement does not mean any new money for the NHS, on top of the Â£20bn extra a year the Conservatives are promising to give it up to 2023. BBC News Channel Both Boris Johnson and Jo Swinson made pledges on business rates in their speeches at the CBI today, promising to reduce the tax burden on businesses. However, Chris Ireland, chief executive of international property
consultancy JLL, questions how significant the impact of these policies would be. On Mr Johnson's plans for a a review of business rates in England he says: ""Is that going to make a fundamental difference? Is that
going to be the saviour of the retail sector in isolation? I donât think so.â Mr Ireland is also sceptical about the Lib Dem leader's promise to scrap business rates altogether - replacing them with a levy paid by commercial landlords. He says this would simply pass the burden on to landowners. Radio 4 PM This morning Labour appeared to be backing away from its plan for net zero carbon emissions by 2030,which was approved at the party's conference. Instead, shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told the Today programme Labour was committed to ""a net zero economy well before 2050"". But shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald is now denying that Labour are abandoning the pledge. ""Weâve said consistently and we said it at conference
that weâll be working towards a path to net zero emissions by 2030 and that
remains the position,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. âIt hasnât moved one iota,"" he adds. However, he admits the target does ""present challenges and weâve got to make sure weâve got the skills and
infrastructure to do it"". Liberal Democrat President Sal Brinton describes the High Court ruling on ITV's election debate as ""incredibly disappointing"". Asked if the party will appeal against the decision, she says they will âhave to see the written
judgement"". However, she says the current system where broadcasters decide what they think is appropriate is ""not
transparent and it's not accountable"". ""There needs to be
legislation change,"" she adds. Liberal Democrat Layla Moran says it is ""outrageous"" a Remain voice is missing from the ITV debate. ""The court ruled against us. But the fight must continue,"" she says in a tweet. ""It's simply wrong of broadcasters to present a binary choice and preempt the decision of the people in a general election."" Reacting to the High Court decision, the SNP's Ian Blackford describes his party's exclusion from ITV's head-to-head election debate on Tuesday as ""a democratic disgrace"". ""The fact that election law and
broadcasting codes allow such gross unfairness is unacceptable,"" he adds. âThis election is a chance for
people in Scotland to vote to escape Brexit, to protect the NHS and to choose
their own future with independence â yet they will not hear that argument in
the debate tomorrow night,"" he says. âInstead, they will only hear
from the leaders of two parties who both want to pursue Brexit - taking
Scotland out of the EU against its will â who want to lock Scotland into the
union."" He argues that excluding the SNP leaves Scottish voters who voted in favour of independence and remaining in the EU ""completely ignored"". Mr Blackford repeats calls for decisions on TV debates to be made independently of politicians and broadcasters - and for Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn to commit to an all-party debate on 1 December. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent It
took the two judges just a matter of 10-to-15 minutes to reach a decision about
the claim from the Lib Dems and the SNP that they should be allowed access to ITV's head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. The
judges came back and said they would not agree to that â effectively they refused
to even hear the judicial review. They
said ITV was not exercising a public function - itâs a private broadcaster, albeit
regulated â and therefore could not be subject to a judicial review. But
they also said that if the two parties had a complaint about the programme,
they had a way of complaining to Ofcom, the regulator. Now
that can only be done after the programme is broadcast â but the judges said
that was a way the two parties could raise their objections. They
also said that the editorial judgement made by ITV was not irrational and
perverse and that they did not want, as judges, to get in the way of an editorial
matter for a major broadcaster. So the
debate goes ahead tomorrow. The full reasoning behind the judges' decision have yet to be given to the court - that will probably come tomorrow. The
Lib Dems, for one, are going to take a closer look before deciding what to do
next. BBC News Channel The SNP's Kirsty Blackman describes the judges' decision as ""hugely disappointing"". ""It is a bit ridiculous that a huge number of party values will not be represented at the debate tomorrow night,"" she says. Responding to the court's judgement on Twitter, the SNP says it is ""the third largest party in the UK, the governing party of Scotland, the main Remain voice in Scotland, the main voice advocating Scottish Independence"" and is ""likely to hold the balance of power in next Parliament"". ""Excluding [the] SNP from debates is ridiculous,"" the party adds. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent Two High Court judges, Lord Justice Davis and Mr
Justice Warby, said the case brought against ITV was not one in which the broadcaster could face a judicial
review because it was not exercising ""a public function"" in law when it set the format of the debate. They also said the Lib Dems
and SNP had the right to complain to broadcasting regulator Ofcom about the programme after it had
aired. ITV are set to hold a head-to-head election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday evening. However, lawyers for both the Lib Dems and SNP had argued that the full range of views on Brexit and Scottish independence would not be represented on the show. In court, the Lib Dem representative argued that Brexit was the ""dominant"" issue in the 12 December general election and that the ""voice of Remain has been excluded"" by ITV's decision not to include Ms Swinson. While SNP Lawyer Philip Coppel QC said: ""In the current, pluralistic political landscape it is simply not possible for a debate which only includes two parties to include 'all significant views'."" Two High Court judges have dismissed an attempt by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to force ITV to include their leaders in a TV debate to be broadcast tomorrow. And here's the CBI's take on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's speech. He promised huge investment, but also higher taxes for the richest and a programme of nationalisation of sectors like energy and water. Director Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said: ""It's time to see Labour open the door to real and lasting partnership with business, not stick with outdated ideologies that would close it in their face."" She said businesses shared ""many of the same ambitions"" as Labour on skills, climate change and ""making sure that the proceeds of growth are felt across the country"". ""The challenge is not what Labour want to achieve, it's how."" She welcomed ""greater flexibility"" on the apprenticeship levy  and ""a step up"" in vocational training - another key policy area championed by Mr Corbyn this morning, However, she said ""false instincts for mass nationalisations and forcing inclusive ownership schemes onto thriving businesses does little more than frighten off investors from backing the UK, with pensioners and savers having to foot the bill."" After it took centre stage for today's electioneering, the CBI has responded in turn to each of the leaders' speeches - and promises. Responding to Jo Swinson, director Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the Lib Dems recognised ""the broken business rates system needs fundamental reform"". However, she said the party's proposed solution - a commercial landowner levy - was ""mired in complexity"". ""It remains unclear how it would cut overall costs or provide a level playing field - much more detail will be needed,"" she added. Â© 2025 BBC.

Jewish settlements no longer illegal - USThe US says Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are not inconsistent with international law.Middle East,"Israel has established more than 100 Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem The US has shifted its position on Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, no longer viewing them as inconsistent with international law. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the status of the West Bank was for Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate. Israel welcomed the move - a reversal of the US stance under President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. Settlements are communities established by Israel on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. They have long been a source of dispute between Israel and the international community, and the Palestinians. ""After carefully studying all sides of the legal debate,"" Mr Pompeo told reporters, ""the United States has concluded that ""the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not, per se, inconsistent with international law"". ""Calling the establishment of civilian settlements inconsistent with international law hasn't worked. It hasn't advanced the cause of peace,"" he added. Can the Jewish settlement issue be resolved? This video can not be played Is Palestinian-Israel peace plan out of reach? Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the US decision was a risk to ""global stability, security, and peace"" and said it threatened to replace international law with ""the law of the jungle"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the policy shift ""rights a historical wrong"", and called on other countries to do the same. The issue of Jewish settlements is one of the most contentious between Israel and the Palestinians. About 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are widely considered illegal under international law, though Israel has always disputed this. The Palestinians have long called for the removal of all settlements, arguing that their presence on land they claim for a future independent Palestinian state makes it almost impossible to make such a state a reality. Mr Pompeo said the decision would create the political space for a more likely resolution of the conflict. But that resolution is now more likely to be on Israel's terms, since it is by far the stronger party. Dismissing the international legal prohibitions on Jewish settlements undermines the legal framework for the peace process, including the notion of Palestinian national rights and the principle of self-determination. It will almost certainly boost the movement to expand and annex the Jewish settlements. There has already been a sharp increase in settlement planning and construction since Mr Trump took office. Palestinians will be dismayed, although not surprised. Palestinian analysts I have spoken with say the growth of Jewish settlements has essentially killed the potential for a viable two-state solution. They speak in terms of a war of position, saying that staying on the land and simply continuing their lives is a kind of non-violent resistance. In 1978, the Jimmy Carter administration concluded that the establishment of civilian settlements was inconsistent with international law. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan disagreed with that conclusion, saying he did not believe the settlements were inherently illegal. Since then, the US adopted a position of describing the settlements as ""illegitimate"" - though not ""illegal"" - and sheltering Israel from condemnatory resolutions on the issue at the United Nations. This video can not be played Mike Pompeo: ""Calling the establishment of civilian settlements 'inconsistent with international law' hasn't worked"" However one of the last acts of the Obama administration, at the end of 2016, was to break with US practice by not vetoing a UN resolution that urged an end to illegal Israeli settlements. President Trump's administration has displayed a much more tolerant attitude towards settlement activity than Mr Obama's. Mr Pompeo said the Trump administration had studied all sides of the debate and agreed with Reagan. Can the Jewish settlement issue be resolved? LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Some pictures from today David Gauke and Amber Rudd out campaigning Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the CBI conference Jeremy Corbyn delivers his speech to the CBI conference Ian Blackford speaks after the High Court ruling that broadcasters cannot be forced to include parties in televised debates Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson speaks at the CBI conference The chair of Leicester East Labour Party, John Thomas, has said he is resigning from the Labour Party and has called Jeremy Corbyn ""a clown"". He says in the letter he has ""nothing in common with"" the Labour Party under its current leadership. Leicester East has selected a new candidate, Claudia Webbe, after Keith Vaz announced he would stand down in this election. Ms Webbe is currently a Councillor in the London Borough of Islington. Labour have been contacted for a response. Former journalist and Conservative peer, Baroness Wheatcroft, has said she is backing the Liberal Democrat candidate for the Cities of London and Westminster seat, Chuka Umunna. Baroness Wheatcroft told the London Evening Standard that she had previously always supported the Conservatives but could not do at this election. Earlier in the year, she spoke in the House of Lords, backing further referendum on EU membership and said the rich could be protected from Brexit by moving their money offshore. Mr Umunna resigned from the Labour Party at the beginning of the year to join a new Independent Group of MPs and then became a Liberal Democrat. Members of the House of Lords cannot vote in general elections. You can see the full list of candidates standing in the Cities of London and Westminster seat,here. Radio 4 PM Boris Johnson's relationship with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri was back in the spotlight today,after she accused him of ""ignoring and blocking"" her following the controversy. It is alleged that she received favourable treatment during Mr Johnson's time as mayor of London because of their friendship - claims they both deny. Asked whether he believes the pair had an affair, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says that is ""not my belief"". âJennifer herself has said today that there was
absolutely no issue around conflicts [of interest] and she won the business fair and square
when it came to being awarded the funding,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. âThe prime minister has said everything he needs to
say on this.â He adds that the issue is ""completely irrelevant to what people want to hear about"" during a general election campaign. Radio 4 PM One of the key moments of Boris Johnson's speech to the CBI earlier was when he announced thatplanned cuts to corporation tax would be put on hold. Asked why the decision was made, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says it is ""part of our focus on public services"". âI think Boris quite rightly wants to make sure the
investment is targeted towards the NHS,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. In his speech, Mr Johnson said the Â£6bn saved by the move would spent on the NHS and other services. However, the announcement does not mean any new money for the NHS, on top of the Â£20bn extra a year the Conservatives are promising to give it up to 2023. BBC News Channel Both Boris Johnson and Jo Swinson made pledges on business rates in their speeches at the CBI today, promising to reduce the tax burden on businesses. However, Chris Ireland, chief executive of international property
consultancy JLL, questions how significant the impact of these policies would be. On Mr Johnson's plans for a a review of business rates in England he says: ""Is that going to make a fundamental difference? Is that
going to be the saviour of the retail sector in isolation? I donât think so.â Mr Ireland is also sceptical about the Lib Dem leader's promise to scrap business rates altogether - replacing them with a levy paid by commercial landlords. He says this would simply pass the burden on to landowners. Radio 4 PM This morning Labour appeared to be backing away from its plan for net zero carbon emissions by 2030,which was approved at the party's conference. Instead, shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told the Today programme Labour was committed to ""a net zero economy well before 2050"". But shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald is now denying that Labour are abandoning the pledge. ""Weâve said consistently and we said it at conference
that weâll be working towards a path to net zero emissions by 2030 and that
remains the position,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. âIt hasnât moved one iota,"" he adds. However, he admits the target does ""present challenges and weâve got to make sure weâve got the skills and
infrastructure to do it"". Liberal Democrat President Sal Brinton describes the High Court ruling on ITV's election debate as ""incredibly disappointing"". Asked if the party will appeal against the decision, she says they will âhave to see the written
judgement"". However, she says the current system where broadcasters decide what they think is appropriate is ""not
transparent and it's not accountable"". ""There needs to be
legislation change,"" she adds. Liberal Democrat Layla Moran says it is ""outrageous"" a Remain voice is missing from the ITV debate. ""The court ruled against us. But the fight must continue,"" she says in a tweet. ""It's simply wrong of broadcasters to present a binary choice and preempt the decision of the people in a general election."" Reacting to the High Court decision, the SNP's Ian Blackford describes his party's exclusion from ITV's head-to-head election debate on Tuesday as ""a democratic disgrace"". ""The fact that election law and
broadcasting codes allow such gross unfairness is unacceptable,"" he adds. âThis election is a chance for
people in Scotland to vote to escape Brexit, to protect the NHS and to choose
their own future with independence â yet they will not hear that argument in
the debate tomorrow night,"" he says. âInstead, they will only hear
from the leaders of two parties who both want to pursue Brexit - taking
Scotland out of the EU against its will â who want to lock Scotland into the
union."" He argues that excluding the SNP leaves Scottish voters who voted in favour of independence and remaining in the EU ""completely ignored"". Mr Blackford repeats calls for decisions on TV debates to be made independently of politicians and broadcasters - and for Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn to commit to an all-party debate on 1 December. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent It
took the two judges just a matter of 10-to-15 minutes to reach a decision about
the claim from the Lib Dems and the SNP that they should be allowed access to ITV's head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. The
judges came back and said they would not agree to that â effectively they refused
to even hear the judicial review. They
said ITV was not exercising a public function - itâs a private broadcaster, albeit
regulated â and therefore could not be subject to a judicial review. But
they also said that if the two parties had a complaint about the programme,
they had a way of complaining to Ofcom, the regulator. Now
that can only be done after the programme is broadcast â but the judges said
that was a way the two parties could raise their objections. They
also said that the editorial judgement made by ITV was not irrational and
perverse and that they did not want, as judges, to get in the way of an editorial
matter for a major broadcaster. So the
debate goes ahead tomorrow. The full reasoning behind the judges' decision have yet to be given to the court - that will probably come tomorrow. The
Lib Dems, for one, are going to take a closer look before deciding what to do
next. BBC News Channel The SNP's Kirsty Blackman describes the judges' decision as ""hugely disappointing"". ""It is a bit ridiculous that a huge number of party values will not be represented at the debate tomorrow night,"" she says. Responding to the court's judgement on Twitter, the SNP says it is ""the third largest party in the UK, the governing party of Scotland, the main Remain voice in Scotland, the main voice advocating Scottish Independence"" and is ""likely to hold the balance of power in next Parliament"". ""Excluding [the] SNP from debates is ridiculous,"" the party adds. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent Two High Court judges, Lord Justice Davis and Mr
Justice Warby, said the case brought against ITV was not one in which the broadcaster could face a judicial
review because it was not exercising ""a public function"" in law when it set the format of the debate. They also said the Lib Dems
and SNP had the right to complain to broadcasting regulator Ofcom about the programme after it had
aired. ITV are set to hold a head-to-head election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday evening. However, lawyers for both the Lib Dems and SNP had argued that the full range of views on Brexit and Scottish independence would not be represented on the show. In court, the Lib Dem representative argued that Brexit was the ""dominant"" issue in the 12 December general election and that the ""voice of Remain has been excluded"" by ITV's decision not to include Ms Swinson. While SNP Lawyer Philip Coppel QC said: ""In the current, pluralistic political landscape it is simply not possible for a debate which only includes two parties to include 'all significant views'."" Two High Court judges have dismissed an attempt by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to force ITV to include their leaders in a TV debate to be broadcast tomorrow. And here's the CBI's take on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's speech. He promised huge investment, but also higher taxes for the richest and a programme of nationalisation of sectors like energy and water. Director Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said: ""It's time to see Labour open the door to real and lasting partnership with business, not stick with outdated ideologies that would close it in their face."" She said businesses shared ""many of the same ambitions"" as Labour on skills, climate change and ""making sure that the proceeds of growth are felt across the country"". ""The challenge is not what Labour want to achieve, it's how."" She welcomed ""greater flexibility"" on the apprenticeship levy  and ""a step up"" in vocational training - another key policy area championed by Mr Corbyn this morning, However, she said ""false instincts for mass nationalisations and forcing inclusive ownership schemes onto thriving businesses does little more than frighten off investors from backing the UK, with pensioners and savers having to foot the bill."" After it took centre stage for today's electioneering, the CBI has responded in turn to each of the leaders' speeches - and promises. Responding to Jo Swinson, director Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the Lib Dems recognised ""the broken business rates system needs fundamental reform"". However, she said the party's proposed solution - a commercial landowner levy - was ""mired in complexity"". ""It remains unclear how it would cut overall costs or provide a level playing field - much more detail will be needed,"" she added. Â© 2025 BBC.

Blind student 'violently' pulled from Oxford Union,"This video can not be played Footage of security appearing to grapple with Mr Azamati was filmed in the chamber A blind student who was ""violently"" removed from a prestigious debating society has been cleared of any wrongdoing. Ebenezer Azamati was ""accosted"" by a security guard when he tried to return to a seat he had earlier reserved before the debate on 17 October. He said he was ""very pleased"" that claims of ""false violent disorder"" were retracted by the Oxford Union. The union has been asked for comment. The postgraduate student from Ghana said his treatment made him feel ""unwelcome in the union, Oxford and even the country"". The Oxford Union, which is independent from the university, has a tradition of hosting debates and speakers stretching back to 1823. Mr Azamati, who is visually impaired, was ""forcibly and violently prevented from re-entering the union to resume his seat"" before a debate, according to the university's Africa Society. It said he arrived to the union in Frewin Court early to reserve his seat in the chamber before the debate and then returned to his college. The student was then confronted by a security guard when he tried to return to his seat so Mr Azamati sat in another seat offered by another member before staff attempted to remove him. The Oxford Union intentionally resembles the House of Commons The society said: ""Even if he had re-entered when the debate had started, such poor treatment through violent means remains unjustifiable."" Nwamaka Ogbonna, president of the Oxford University Africa Society, said a security guard had told Mr Azamati he could not enter the chamber because ""the union was full"" despite the student having apparently reserved a seat. Ms Ogbonna said: ""The argument that he had to leave because there were not any seats is invalid. People are allowed to stand. ""I think everyone is quite perplexed."" Video footage shared online showed an argument between security and Mr Azamati in the chamber before staff appeared to manhandle him. Mr Azamati was attending the debate in which the motion ""This house has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government"" was discussed by members and politicians from various parties. The St John's College student, who studies International Relations, said he was ""treated as not being human enough to deserve justice and fair treatment"". After the charges against Mr Azamati were successfully appealed on Saturday, thepresident of the Oxford Union, Brendan McGrath, apologised to the Africa Society,external""for the distress and any reputational damage"" to the student. Helen Mountfield QC, who represents Mr Azamati, said there were ongoing talks with the union over what steps it can take to address the ""failings"" exposed by the case. The university tweeted its support for Mr Azamati, and said it shared ""the widespread outrage regarding the unacceptable treatment"" of the student. Allow Twitter content?

Epstein's accusers 'failed by royalty' - lawyer,"This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' The Duke of York should apologise for his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, a lawyer for the convicted sex offender's accusers has said. Spencer Kuvin, who represents several unnamed alleged victims, said ""royalty has failed them"". He called Prince Andrew's interview with BBC Newsnight on Saturday ""sad"" and ""depressing"". The prince has stood by his decision to take part, despite critics describing it as a ""car crash"". Amid the backlash, Prince Andrew is now facing renewed calls to tell US authorities about his friendship with US financier Epstein - who, at the age of 66, took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in the US. The duke has been facing questions over his ties to Epstein for several years. On Monday, Mr Kuvin told theToday programme: ""It was depressing that he [Prince Andrew] really did not acknowledge the breadth of his friendship with this despicable man and apologise. ""The mere fact that he was friends with a convicted sex offender and chose to continue his relationship with him - it just shows a lack of acknowledgement of the breadth of what this man [Epstein] did to these girls."" Prince Andrew said this meeting with Epstein in 2010 was to end their relationship In the interview with Newsnight, Prince Andrew - the Queen's third child - said he never suspected Epstein's criminal behaviour during visits to his three homes. But Mr Kuvin said he did ""not think there was any way"" the prince could have avoided seeing what was going on, ""with young girls being shuttled in and out of those homes"". Mr Kuvin said the focus of Epstein's accusers had now turned to potential co-conspirators. It has led to questions about the role Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, may have played in procuring underage girls for the financier. Ms Maxwell denies any wrongdoing. Lawyer Lisa Bloom - who represents five other Epstein accusers - joined the calls for Prince Andrew to be interviewed by US authorities following his BBC interview. She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""I think he's made things worse for himself in this interview and I think it's more likely the authorities are going to want to speak to him now - and they should want to."" Lawyer Lisa Bloom has also questioned why Prince Andrew did not apologise about his friendship with Epstein Gloria Allred - another lawyer, also representing one of Epstein's accusers - told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""Now he's been in the court of public opinion, he should testify to the FBI."" She said she did not know how the prince ""could have not known that there were underage girls"" present during his visits to Epstein's homes in New York, Palm Beach and the Virgin Islands. Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Meanwhile, Labour's shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, said Prince Andrew should do whatever he can to help Epstein's victims. He said: ""By saying what he knows of the time that he spent with his former friend, can only be the right thing to do."" In the Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew said he will testify under oath ""if push came to shove"" and his lawyers advised him to. It comes as the prince continues to face heavy criticism for the interview, which many royal commentators branded a PR disaster. University of Huddersfield students will discuss a motion to put pressure on the duke to resign as chancellor later. In response, the university said Prince Andrew's ""enthusiasm for innovation and entrepreneurship is a natural fit"" with its work. The duke was pictured with his accuser in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 In his BBC interview, Prince Andrew ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre, known at the time as Virginia Roberts. The first occasion, she said, took place when she was aged 17. People close to Prince Andrew said he wanted to address the issues head-on and did so with ""honesty and humility"" in speaking to Newsnight. In a lengthy interview, which UK viewers can watch in full onBBC iPlayeror onYouTube,externalelsewhere in the world, the prince said that: On the date Virginia Giuffre says he had sex with her - 10 March, 2001, he had taken his daughter to Pizza Express in Woking for a party before spending the night at home He dismissed claims he was sweating profusely because he had a ""peculiar medical condition"" meaning he cannot sweat, caused by an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War He had commissioned investigations into whether a photograph of him with Ms Giuffre had been faked, but they were inconclusive Speaking out about his relationship with the financier had become almost ""a mental health issue"" for him He would testify under oath about his relationship with Ms Giuffre if ""push came to shove"", and his lawyers advised him to He was unaware of an arrest warrant against Epstein when he invited the financier to Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday party at Windsor Castle He did not regret his friendship with Epstein because of ""the opportunities I was given to learn"" from him about trade and business Prince Andrew: 'No indication' about Epstein.

Pawnbroker warns probe could spark loan shark rush,"The head of Britain's biggest pawnbroker has said regulation on cash loans risks pushing some people to loan sharks ahead of Christmas. It comes after H&T revealed that the City watchdog was reviewing the short term cash loans it offered and could ask it to pay compensation. Boss John Nichols said the firm would work with regulators but that its cash-strapped customers would be affected. It has stopped offering short term cash loans while the review is carried out. Mr Nichols said he hoped these cash loans, which are separate to pawnbroking and typically amounted to about Â£500, would be available again from January. He admitted that the timing was a concern for the business, with pre-Christmas a busy time for giving short-term loans, and had come ""a bit out of the blue"" from the regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). ""The unintended consequence is that people could go to unregulated lenders,"" he said. Where can you go if you need money in a hurry? Regulation of short-term, high-interest cash loans has had a significant impact on the credit industry in recent years - particularly among big payday lenders, some of which have collapsed. Regulators have introduced stricter rules on ensuring that loans should only be given to those who can afford to repay. The company is working with the FCA to review its affordability checks for loans over the last six years, which Mr Nichols suggested had previously been given a clean bill of health. They relate to cash loans, sold from H&T stores, which typically required repayment within six to 12 months. Such loans would have relatively high interest, as they were available to people who might struggle to be accepted for a loan from the bank. Over the past six years the company said total customer interest payments were Â£24m. The review will consider whether any compensation should be paid. Many were taken by surprise when A&B abruptly ceased trading in September It said: ""Should any redress be payable, H&T anticipates being able to fund this from its existing financial resources."" Although the company said this area of its business only accounted for 4% of revenues, its shares fell by 25% in early trading before recovering later in the morning. The pawnbroking arm of the business, one of the biggest in the UK, is unaffected. This will be a relief to some customers who were shifted over from rival Albemarle & Bond (A&B) when the latter collapsed in early September. Many were taken by surprise when A&B abruptly ceased trading, blaming ""significant"" financial losses. Some even feared goods such as jewellery and goldwould never be returned. ButH&T agreed to buy Â£8m worth of loanslinked to customers' belongings - known as ""pledge books"" - from Speedloan Finance, which had traded under the name Albemarle & Bond.

"Chiropractors should have first aid training, says coroner","Mr Lawler had celebrated his 80th birthday just three days before he died First aid training should be mandatory for chiropractors, a coroner said at the end of the case of a man whose neck broke during chiropractic treatment. John Lawler, 80, died in hospital a day after becoming unresponsive at Chiropractic 1st in York in 2017. Jonathan Heath, assistant coroner for North Yorkshire, found Mr Lawler suffered a fractured neck and spinal cord injury while undergoing treatment. He said he would recommend changes to the General Chiropractic Council (GCC). It emerged during the six-day hearing that Mr Lawler had a condition in his cervical spine meaning it was far more rigid than a healthy spine. Over time the ligaments along the cervical spine had become bone-like resulting in limited movement in his neck. Medical experts said the condition was abnormal but not uncommon in older people. It can be visible on imaging, such as a CT scan, but the inquest heard that imaging is no longer common before chiropractic treatment. Mr Lawler had sought treatment after complaining of aches in his legs in 2017. He visited Chiropractic 1st with his wife at the end of July and booked three sessions for the first week of August with Mrs Arleen Scholten. The chiropractor, Arleen Scholten, has been practicing for 16 years During treatment on 11 August 2017 Mr Lawler suddenly moaned and said he could not feel his arms and became unresponsive. The chiropractor manoeuvred him onto a chair and gave mouth-to-mouth until the ambulance service arrived. The inquest has heard that had Mr Lawler been immobilized immediately after the fracture he would have survived. Delivering a narrative conclusion, Mr Heath said Mr Lawler had died from the fracture to his neck and resulting spinal cord injury, while undergoing chiropractic treatment, which led to respiratory depression. He said he would be writing to the GCC with two recommendations. He would request it carries out a review of the requirements for pre-treatment imaging, and secondly, to consider first aid training being made mandatory for chiropractors. Speaking after the hearing, the Lawler family said it hoped the publicity surrounding the case ""will highlight the dangers"" of chiropractic practice, especially for the elderly and those with ""already compromised spines"". ""We would again urge the regulator to take immediate measures to ensure the profession is properly controlled,"" they said. A representative for Mrs Scholten said she wished to express her ""deepest sympathies"" to Mr Lawler's family. ""This was an extremely rare and unusual incident, which has been thoroughly investigated by the Coroner during the course of the inquest,"" he continued.

Protesters arrested as they run from HK campus,"This video can not be played These protesters attempting to leave PolyU met with tear gas Several protesters have been arrested while trying to run from a Hong Kong university campus surrounded by police. Around 100 people tried to leave the Polytechnic University, but were met with tear gas and rubber bullets. In the past week, the campus has turned into a battleground as long-running anti-government protests become more violent. A small number managed to successfully leave the campus using rope ladders before being picked up by motorcycles. Hong Kong's Hospital Authority says 116 people have been injured and taken to hospital. The violence is some of the worst seen during months of unrest in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. The protests started over a controversial extradition bill, and have now evolved into broader anti-government demonstrations. China has warned that ""no-one should underestimate [its] will to safeguard its sovereignty and Hong Kong's stability"", and its ambassador to the UK said the central government would not sit back and watch if the situation became ""uncontrollable"". Timeline of unrest How is Hong Kong run? Protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong is a part of China, and the protests are, in part, about the fear that the special freedoms the territory enjoys as a former British colony are being eroded. Earlier, Hong Kong's High Court ruled that a ban on protesters wearing face masks was unconstitutional. The colonial-era emergency law was invoked in October, but protesters largely defied it. Hong Kong's government saidthe weekend's events had ""reduced the chance"" of district elections being held on Sunday,externalas planned, public broadcaster RTHK reports. Postponing or cancelling the vote could further inflame the protests. The UK has urged an ""end to the violence and for all sides to engage in meaningful political dialogue"" ahead of the elections. Police are still besieging the university where several hundred protesters are thought to be trapped. Officers have ordered those inside to drop their weapons and surrender. A protester inside the university told the BBC supplies, including first aid equipment, were running low. Meanwhile, a fire broke out on campus and loud explosions were heard, according to the South China Morning Post. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

PolyU has been occupied by protesters for several days. On Sunday night, police warned protesters they had until 22:00 (14:00 GMT) to leave the campus, saying they could use live ammunition if the attacks continued. On Sunday, the university said it had been""severely and extensively vandalised"",external. A number of protesters left inside in the university have identified themselves as current students in media interviews but it is unclear exactly how many of them are, in fact, university students. By Grace Tsoi, BBCNews, Hong Kong Worried parents whose children were trapped inside the Polytechnic University were among the 200 protesters who joined a peaceful rally on Monday night in eastern Tsim Sha Tsui, a tourist area which is only 300 metres away from the besieged campus. Ms Ng - who only wanted to be identified by her last name - found out on Sunday night her son was among those trapped inside. ""He's frightened because he has not faced any emergency situation on his own. She has been on the streets near the university since then. The teary-eyed mother is proud of her 18-year-old son despite the circumstances. ""My son didn't cry. He's strong and likes to help others,"" she said. ""I told my son that you did nothing wrong and you are an outstanding kid. I wouldn't blame you."" She told him to stay inside the campus and wait for her to pick him up. Ms Ng said the government should bear the responsibility for the chaos in Hong Kong. ""Our government is more and more reckless. It ignores the very lowly demands from the citizens!"" she said. ""I wasn't born in Hong Kong but I love Hong Kong so much! Hong Kong is a wonderful place but it has turned into such a state. It breaks my heart!"" Campuses remained relatively free of violence during the Hong Kong protests but, last week,the Chinese University of Hong Kong became a battleground. Police say protesters threw petrol bombs on a major road near the university in an effort to stop traffic. Officers attempted to reclaim the road, leading to major clashes. A protester arrested while trying to leave the campus The university then cancelled all classes for the rest of the term. Days later, protesters at PolyU also tried to block access to a key tunnel near the university. Protests have also been held at other locations in Hong Kong. Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, it has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest movement against alleged police brutality, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.

HK protesters use rope ladders to flee siege,"This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Up to 200 anti-government protesters remain barricaded inside a Hong Kong university, surrounded by police, as the standoff continues for a third day. Those who are still inside Polytechnic University (PolyU) are said to be running low on supplies. Protesters have been inside the campus since last week, initially stopping police from entering by lighting fires and throwing petrol bombs. Adults who leave face arrest, and some are too scared to come out. Hundreds of protesters tried to run from the campus on Monday, but many were hit with tear gas and rubber bullets and arrested. Police have revealed that on Monday alone, at the campus, they used: 1,458 tear gas canisters 1,391 rubber bullets 325 bean bag rounds 265 sponge bullets A small group of protesters managed to leave using rope ladders before being picked up and driven away by motorcyclists. Those arrested could be charged with rioting, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Protesters lower themselves down a rope from a bridge to a highway to escape the Polytechnic University campus On Sunday night, police warned protesters they had until 22:00 (14:00 GMT) to leave the campus. Police later moved in, surrounding the campus, leading to protesters throwing petrol bombs and firing stones from catapults. The violence at PolyU is one of the biggest flare-ups Hong Kong has seen since protests broke out in June. Tuesday saw the UN human rights office urge the Hong Kong authorities to de-escalate the situation at PolyU and address the humanitarian situation of those inside which it said was ""clearly deteriorating"". This video can not be played These protesters attempting to leave PolyU met tear gas volleys It added that some demonstrators' use of violence, including against the police, ""cannot be condoned"". The mostly young protesters have five key demands, including an investigation into police brutality and universal suffrage. But underpinning it all is the fear Hong Kong's unique identity is threatened by China. Tensions now could be further inflamed after China condemned a decision by Hong Kong's high court to overturn a ban on facemasks. An estimated 100 to 200 protesters still remain in PolyU, authorities have said. One protester called Jeff told the BBC that he was hiding in a building on the campus. ""I have been trapped inside Polytechnic University for two days and food and water is running out,"" he said. ""Most people tried to get out of this hell-like place, most of them tried to escape but ended in failure, being arrested or wounded or something."" ""I didn't expect this incident to get so desperate in here. The campus is so desperate and I am not well prepared. I would call it a disaster."" He said his parents were concerned for his safety and he had told them he would make it out. Timeline of unrest How is Hong Kong run? Protests explained in 100 and 500 words One tourist from mainland China is too scared to leave. He told BBC News Chinese that he was curious about what was going on at the university and had arrived on Sunday at the invitation of a friend who studies there. After a visit to the library and a meal, he learnt that police had cordoned off the whole area. ""I am not a rioter,"" the tourist, who wishes to stay anonymous said. ""I don't want to get caught and I just need to go back to China."" A handful of protesters have been trickling out of the university, some suffering from hypothermia and leg injuries, according to news site SCMP. One protester said he had decided to come out because of ""hunger and cold"", adding that many inside were ""hurt without enough medical supplies"". Another 16-year-old protester told Reuters new agency she had chosen to ""surrender"". ""We have been trying to escape since yesterday morning. But then we couldn't find a way out [and] were afraid of being charged,"" she said. ""This is the only way... I was quite desperate."" In the early hours of Tuesday morning, more than 200 students below the age of 18 left, accompanied by education officials including high school principals. Those under the age of 18 had their identities recorded and were let go. Adults were arrested. A nun leading a protester out of PolyU Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam called on all protesters to surrender, saying no violence would happen if they came ""out in a peaceful manner"". However, she said police would have to take ""necessary action"" if that changed. Separately on Tuesday, Hong Kong's new police chief took office. Chris Tang said the force was not able to end the protests alone,external, saying the unrest would only end if society condemned the violence. A number of people have supported protesters behind the scenes, donating supplies to them or picking them up from protests and driving them home to avoid arrest. Pody Lui, BBC News Chinese, at PolyU We got into the university in the early hours of the morning. Police have cordoned off the area, making it almost impossible for new journalists to get in. Those trapped inside were desperate to get out. The mood darkened as the day continued. More and more protesters gave up and left the campus willingly to face police arrest. They will be charged with rioting, meaning they could be jailed for up to a decade. Those determined to stay were getting restless. They were not as friendly to journalists as before. They were scared and couldn't afford trusting a wrong person, fearing anyone could be an undercover police officer. I overheard a Polytechnic University student talking to her father on the phone. ""I don't want to get caught. I will lose everything if I do,"" she cried. Her tired friend next to her said, ""I just want to go home."" Hong Kong had previously banned protesters from wearing facemasks - but this was deemed ""unconstitutional"" by the city's high court on Monday. China has condemned the high court's decision. It says it has the sole authority to rule on constitutional matters in the region. Courts in Hong Kong have ruled on constitutional issues in the past. In 2017, the Court of Appeal found the Hong Kong government's decision to deny a partner visa to the wife of a female British expat was unconstitutional, despite the fact Hong Kong does not recognise same-sex marriage. It is unclear what action, if any, China might take next. This is a large part of what the ongoing protests in Hong Kong are about. Many in Hong Kong fear that its freedoms - including judicial independence - are slowly being eroded by Beijing. Campuses had remained relatively free of violence during the Hong Kong protests - despite the movement being led mainly by students and young people. But afterthe death of a 22-year-old student, that changed. Last week,the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) became a battleground. Police say protesters threw petrol bombs on a major road near the university in an effort to stop traffic. Officers attempted to reclaim the road, leading to major clashes. Police revealed on Tuesday that some 3,900 petrol bombs were found at CUHK, adding that the university had 100 litres of sulphuric and nitric acids missing. A protester arrested while trying to leave the campus The university then cancelled all classes for the rest of the term. Days later, protesters at PolyU also tried to block access to a key tunnel near the university. Protests have also been held at other locations in Hong Kong. Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"".

Protesters arrested as they run from HK campusSome manage to escape on motorcycles after using rope ladders to get out of the Polytechnic University.China,"This video can not be played These protesters attempting to leave PolyU met with tear gas Several protesters have been arrested while trying to run from a Hong Kong university campus surrounded by police. Around 100 people tried to leave the Polytechnic University, but were met with tear gas and rubber bullets. In the past week, the campus has turned into a battleground as long-running anti-government protests become more violent. A small number managed to successfully leave the campus using rope ladders before being picked up by motorcycles. Hong Kong's Hospital Authority says 116 people have been injured and taken to hospital. The violence is some of the worst seen during months of unrest in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. The protests started over a controversial extradition bill, and have now evolved into broader anti-government demonstrations. China has warned that ""no-one should underestimate [its] will to safeguard its sovereignty and Hong Kong's stability"", and its ambassador to the UK said the central government would not sit back and watch if the situation became ""uncontrollable"". Timeline of unrest How is Hong Kong run? Protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong is a part of China, and the protests are, in part, about the fear that the special freedoms the territory enjoys as a former British colony are being eroded. Earlier, Hong Kong's High Court ruled that a ban on protesters wearing face masks was unconstitutional. The colonial-era emergency law was invoked in October, but protesters largely defied it. Hong Kong's government saidthe weekend's events had ""reduced the chance"" of district elections being held on Sunday,externalas planned, public broadcaster RTHK reports. Postponing or cancelling the vote could further inflame the protests. The UK has urged an ""end to the violence and for all sides to engage in meaningful political dialogue"" ahead of the elections. Police are still besieging the university where several hundred protesters are thought to be trapped. Officers have ordered those inside to drop their weapons and surrender. A protester inside the university told the BBC supplies, including first aid equipment, were running low. Meanwhile, a fire broke out on campus and loud explosions were heard, according to the South China Morning Post. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

PolyU has been occupied by protesters for several days. On Sunday night, police warned protesters they had until 22:00 (14:00 GMT) to leave the campus, saying they could use live ammunition if the attacks continued. On Sunday, the university said it had been""severely and extensively vandalised"",external. A number of protesters left inside in the university have identified themselves as current students in media interviews but it is unclear exactly how many of them are, in fact, university students. By Grace Tsoi, BBCNews, Hong Kong Worried parents whose children were trapped inside the Polytechnic University were among the 200 protesters who joined a peaceful rally on Monday night in eastern Tsim Sha Tsui, a tourist area which is only 300 metres away from the besieged campus. Ms Ng - who only wanted to be identified by her last name - found out on Sunday night her son was among those trapped inside. ""He's frightened because he has not faced any emergency situation on his own. She has been on the streets near the university since then. The teary-eyed mother is proud of her 18-year-old son despite the circumstances. ""My son didn't cry. He's strong and likes to help others,"" she said. ""I told my son that you did nothing wrong and you are an outstanding kid. I wouldn't blame you."" She told him to stay inside the campus and wait for her to pick him up. Ms Ng said the government should bear the responsibility for the chaos in Hong Kong. ""Our government is more and more reckless. It ignores the very lowly demands from the citizens!"" she said. ""I wasn't born in Hong Kong but I love Hong Kong so much! Hong Kong is a wonderful place but it has turned into such a state. It breaks my heart!"" Campuses remained relatively free of violence during the Hong Kong protests but, last week,the Chinese University of Hong Kong became a battleground. Police say protesters threw petrol bombs on a major road near the university in an effort to stop traffic. Officers attempted to reclaim the road, leading to major clashes. A protester arrested while trying to leave the campus The university then cancelled all classes for the rest of the term. Days later, protesters at PolyU also tried to block access to a key tunnel near the university. Protests have also been held at other locations in Hong Kong. Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, it has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest movement against alleged police brutality, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.

Ford unveils all-electric car - the Mustang,"Ford has unveiled its all-electric Mustang Mach-E at a glitzy event in Los Angeles that included an appearance by actor Idris Elba. The top-range version of the car can travel up to 370 miles on a full charge and recharge 57 miles (92km) of range in 10 minutes on a high-power charge. There are buttons in place of conventional door handles and storage space under the front bonnet. The fastest model can accelerate from 0-60mph in under five seconds. In comparison, the Tesla Model X 100D can do 0-60mph in 4.4 seconds. Like the Tesla, the Mustang Mach-E has a 15.5in (40cm) touch screen beside the steering wheel. Prices range from Â£44,000 to Â£58,000 ($44,000 to $60,000 in the US). Storage space under the bonnet Amanda Stretton, motoring editor at the price comparison website confused.com said ""a lot of hopes"" were riding on the vehicle. ""The interesting thing is that they've decided to use the Mustang name with this car, because of course it's the name synonymous with American muscle cars, with big V8s... and yet they are taking the performance aspect of that name and putting it into this electric car,"" she told BBC News. ""I really hope this is a game-changer."" Earlier this year, Ford announcedplans to close six manufacturing plants in Europe by the end of 2020. Stuart Rowley, president of Ford of Europe, said at the time the company's future was ""rooted in electrification"". Analyst Natalie Sauber, from Arcadis, said infrastructure was still a deterrent for consumers considering buying an electric vehicle. Ford says owners will be able to recharge the car for a 57 mile (92km) journey in 10 minutes ""Norway is the country with the highest uptake of electric vehicles, followed by other Scandinavian countries,"" she told the BBC's WorkLife programme. ""The UK is coming in at the lower end, similar to Germany and the US."" According to analyst Jato, 91% of global car sales in 2019 have been vehicles with an internal combustion engine. Would Mustang Sally have driven an electric vehicle? If there's one brand which symbolises the American ""pony car"", it's the Mustang. The term was invented for it. The original was affordable, sporty and - with a hefty engine under the bonnet - decidedly rorty. The electric Mustang Mach-E certainly won't be loud, but maybe it can make a pretty vocal statement nonetheless. The Mustang Mach-E has a large touchscreen display to adjust its various settings Ford is far from being a leader in the race to produce electric cars, but it's putting its foot down in an effort to catch up. It has even done a deal with Volkswagen to use some of the German giant's heavily funded know-how on future models. The new Mach-E will be leading Ford's electric charge. With a range of at least 260 miles, and plenty of power, the new car will be going up against models from Tesla, Jaguar, Audi and Mercedes. The car can be plugged into a normal domestic socket or connected to a special Wallbox for faster charging Sally may have driven a full-fat petrol V8, but Ford is hoping her eco-conscious granddaughter can be won over by silent elegance - coupled with a decent turn of speed.

Breaking|Breaking newsLib Dems and SNP lose ITV debate legal challengeThe parties took the channel to court after their leaders were left out its head-to-head debate.Election 2019,"This video can not be played Lib Dems ""disappointed"" by ITV debate verdict The Lib Dems and SNP have lost their legal challenge to be included in an ITV head-to-head debate ahead of the general election on 12 December. The channel is due to air a face-off between Tory leader Boris Johnson and Labour's Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday. The Lib Dems said they wanted their pro-Remain stance to be represented, while the SNP also wanted the issue of Scottish independence to be raised. But judges ruled there was ""no arguable breach of the Broadcasting Code"",external. LIVE: ITV debate to remain Johnson and Corbyn head-to-head TV debate 'excludes Remainers' views', court hears Who is taking part in the general election TV debates? In the High Court in London, Lord Justice Davis and Mr Justice Warby said the case was not suitable for judicial review as ITV was not carrying out a ""public function"" in law by holding the debate. However, the parties had the right to complain to Ofcom about the programme after it had been broadcast, they said. Lord Justice Davis said: ""The clear conclusion of both members of this court is that, viewed overall, these claims are not realistically arguable."" But Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran tweeted ""the fight must continue"", adding: ""It is outrageous that the Remain voice is missing from the ITV debate. ""It's simply wrong of broadcasters to present a binary choice and pre-empt the decision of the people in a general election."" This video can not be played Exclusion from debates 'a democratic outrage' The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, also condemned the decision, saying it ""discriminated against Scottish voters"" and ""treated them as second-class citizens"". He added: ""That is, quite simply, a democratic disgrace, and the fact that election law and broadcasting codes allow such gross unfairness is unacceptable."" And he called for Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn to commit to take part in an all-party debate on 1 December, rather than sending other senior figures from their respective parties. Analysis by Tom Symonds, BBC home affairs correspondent It took the two judges just a matter of 10 or 15 minutes to reach a decision about the claim that the Lib Dems and SNP should be allowed access to the head-to-head debate. The judges came back and said they would not agree to that and effectively refused to even hear the judicial review. Their legal argument was that ITV was not exercising a public function as it is a private broadcaster - albeit regulated - therefore could not be subject to judicial review. They also said if the two parties had a complaint about the programme, they had a way of complaining and that was to the regulator Ofcom - but that can only be done after the programme is broadcast However, the judges said an important part of their decision was the editorial judgment made by ITV was not irrational and perverse. They did not want as judges to get in the way of an editorial matter for a major broadcaster. So the application from the parties is rejected and the debate goes ahead. But the Lib Dems still have big problems with this court decision, and say they they are going to take a closer look before deciding what to do next. The BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between the Conservative and Labour leaders in Southampton on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. The Lib Dems have sent a legal letter to the BBC over its decision not to include Ms Swinson in the head-to-head. BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

Arcuri: Boris Johnson should 'man up and call me',"This video can not be played Jennifer Arcuri tells Victoria Derbyshire she is ""upset"" Boris Johnson did not ""man up and call me"" A US businesswoman at the centre of a misconduct controversy involving Boris Johnson says he should ""man up"" and call her. Jennifer Arcuri claims she texted the prime minister last week, accusing him of ""ignoring and blocking"" her. She allegedly received favourable treatment during Mr Johnson's time as mayor of London due to their friendship - claims he denies. The prime minster has previously said he acted ""with full propriety"". Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Monday, Ms Arcuri said she called Mr Johnson last week, before he hung up and refused further calls from her. She said: ""I am very upset that he could not man up and pick up the phone and call me."" Reading from her mobile phone, she claims to have texted Mr Johnson after the phone call, asking: ""Is this the price of loyalty, to be hung up on, ignored and blocked? ""Why would I remain silent if you can't even speak to me, and I've been nothing but loyal to you?"" Arcuri says PM 'cast me aside like some gremlin' Lorraine Kelly shows her tough side to Arcuri Asked whether Mr Johnson called her when he was busy as London mayor, Ms Arcuri replied ""absolutely"". She said: ""This was why it was so hard for me to date, because every guy would tell you they'd call and never follow up. ""Not Boris Johnson. Every time he told me he would call, he called me. I was convinced this was a man of his word, because I couldn't believe the fervent, linear focus which he had on me. ""And I assure you, it was not just a sexual intention. ""He actually was very intrigued by my energy, my ability to get things done. He loved my events and he saw the way I could work a room, the way I met everybody."" She refused to say whether she dated the prime minister but accused him of ""feeding her to the wolves"" in his handling of the allegations surrounding the pair. Ms Arcuri added: ""He didn't have to ignore me. It could have been a 30-second phone call, just to let me know that he's acknowledging the fact that he, while he gets to be prime minister, gets to feed me to the wolves - and I find that really disturbing."" In an earlierinterview with ITV's Good Morning Britain, she refused to say whether she had an affair with Mr Johnson. Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about? Grant awarded to Arcuri company 'appropriate' The entrepreneur revealed she also called the prime minister back in August. Ms Arcuri says he answered the phone before it was passed to someone speaking English in a Chinese accent, in an apparent attempt to ""mock"" her. She denied that he should have declared their friendship as an ""interest"" when he was London mayor. Ms Arcuri said there was ""no interest"" to declare, adding: ""He didn't do me any favours."" When pressed again on this, she said: ""If declaring me as an interest would have saved me this entire embarrassment and humiliation... then yes, I wish he had."" She added it would have been the ""transparent and open"" thing to do. When asked if he should have declared their friendship, Mr Johnson previously told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that everything was done ""with full propriety"" and said there was ""no interest to declare"". Her BBC interview comes aftershe accused Boris Johnson of casting her aside as if she was a ""gremlin"". In an interview broadcast by ITV on Sunday, she said she had kept his ""secrets"" and could not understand why he had ""blocked and ignored"" her requests for help to handle the media interest surrounding the allegations. Addressing the prime minister, she said: ""I'm terribly heartbroken by the way that you have cast me aside like I am some gremlin."" In response to the programme, the Conservative Party said that any claims of impropriety in office by Mr Johnson were ""untrue and unfounded"". The statement added: ""Given that City Hall has made an unfounded complaint to the Independent Office for Police Conduct we will not be making detailed comments until that process is finished."" Boris Johnson and Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 Mr Johnson's friendship with the entrepreneur first came under scrutiny when the Sunday Times reported in September that Ms Arcuri's business received Â£126,000 in public money along with privileged access to three foreign trade trips led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor, between 2008 and 2016. The Greater London Authority (GLA) - whose job it is to oversee the conduct of the mayor - launched a probe into the alleged conflict of interest following the paper's report. That investigation was paused after the authority referred the claims to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The watchdog will now decide whether or not to investigate the prime minister for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office - before the GLA decides whether to continue its own probe. Last month, a government review ruled thata Â£100,000 government grant given to Ms Arcuri's business was ""appropriate"".

Rare Charlotte Bronte book finally coming home,"The book by Charlotte Bronte slipped through the museum's fingers eight years ago A book written by Charlotte Bronte at the age of 14 will return home after being bought by the Bronte Society at auction in Paris. The miniature work, called The Young Men's Magazine, will go to the Parsonage Museum in the Brontes' old home in Haworth, West Yorkshire. It was bought for â¬600,000 (Â£512,970) after a fundraising campaign by the Bronte Society, which runs the museum. The museum lost out on the book when it last went under the hammer in 2011. The total price including buyer's premium was â¬780,000 (Â£666,790). The work is one of six ""little books"" written by Charlotte, the eldest of the three sisters, in 1830. Five are known to survive, and the Bronte Parsonage Museum already holds the other four. The works were created for Charlotte's toy soldiers and document an imaginary world created by the family called Glass Town. Charlotte is best known for her 1847 classic novel Jane Eyre. Charlotte Bronte captured by the artist George Richmond Kitty Wright, executive director of The Bronte Society, said: ""We were determined to do everything we could to bring back this extraordinary 'little book' to the Bronte Parsonage Museum and now can't quite believe that it will in fact be coming home to where it was written 189 years ago. ""We have been truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from people from all over the world backing our campaign and can't wait to have it in place with the others and on public view to the world."" The museum's principal curator Ann Dinsdale added that bringing the ""unique manuscript"" back to Haworth was an ""absolute highlight"" of her 30-year career at the venue. ""Charlotte wrote this miniscule magazine for the toy soldiers she and her siblings played with and as we walk through the same rooms they did, it seems immensely fitting that it is coming home and we would like to say an enormous thank you to everyone who made it possible."" Part of the Young Men's Magazine describes a murderer driven to madness after being haunted by his victims, and how ""an immense fire"" burning in his head causes his bed curtains to set alight. Experts at the museum say this section of the story is ""a clear precursor"" of a famous scene between Bertha and Edward Rochester in Jane Eyre, which Charlotte would publish 17 years later. The society said more than 1,000 people had pledged money to help buy the book. Several celebrities, including Dame Judi Dench, Dame Jacqueline Wilson and Tracy Chevalier, backed the society's efforts to raise money. Dame Judi Dench led a campaign to raise funds for the book to be secured for the Bronte Parsonage Museum York-born Dame Judi, who is president of the Bronte Society, said earlier this year: ""I have long been fascinated by the little books created by the Brontes when they were children. ""These tiny manuscripts are like a magical doorway into the imaginary worlds they inhabited, and also hint at their ambition to become published authors."" The existence of the book that went up for sale - measuring 35mm x 61mm and consisting of 20 pages - came to light in 2011 when it was auctioned at Sotheby's. The Bronte society was outbid bya discredited investment scheme that is no longer operational. The scheme was run by GÃ©rard LhÃ©ritier and his company Aristophil, who set up the Musee des Lettres et Manuscrits in Paris. LhÃ©ritier saw the potential financial rewards in rare works such as the Bronte book, so bought and filled his museum with them. His company was accused of selling shares in a Ponzi-style pyramid scheme, built on false advertising and illusionary market values. About 18,000 people in France are believed to have been defrauded in what went on to become one of the biggest ever arts market scams, having invested nearly â¬1bn. The company behind it was shut down by regulators in 2014. According to The Art Newspaper,the French government is seeking to recover hundreds of public archives,externalthat should never have been sold and a criminal investigation is ongoing.

Sussex Police said search and forensic teams had finished their work at the recreation ground but searches would continue at Ms Stevenson's home in nearby Stansfield Road. A spokesperson for the force urged anyone who saw Ms Stevenson in the days before her death to come forward.

'Special measures' option for under-fire NHS board,"The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Children share a campus in the south of Glasgow Scotland's health secretary has refused to rule out government intervention at an under-fire health board. Jeane Freeman is facing calls to put NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) into special measures following the deaths of two children in 2017. Both were treated in a ward in a Glasgow hospital which waslater closed because of problems with the water supply, according to newspaper reports. Ms Freeman said she would make a statement to parliament this week. Both children were patients at the Royal Hospital for Children at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus in Glasgow. A three-year-old boy who was being treated for a rare genetic disease died on 9 August 2017. Milly Main, 10, died three weeks later while recovering from leukaemia treatment. Police investigate three-year-old's hospital death NHS board special measures call over child's death 'I was let down and lied to over Milly's death' Last week Milly's mother told BBC Scotland that she was ""100%"" convinced her death was linked to water contamination issues. It emerged on Sunday that police have investigated the death of the young boy and a report had been passed to the procurator fiscal. NHSGGC said they had fully investigated and shared their findings with the boy's family but the child's mother later described the board's media statement as ""highly inaccurate"". Separately, the board has insisted it was impossible to determine the source of Milly's infection because there was no requirement to test the water supply at the time. Ms Freeman toldBBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotlandthat she only learned of the young boy's death at the weekend. She described both deaths as ""absolutely tragic"" but claimed the difference between the two was that the boy's parents were fully informed by the board about what had happened and the causes of his death. Health secretary Jeane Freeman will make a statement in the Scottish Parliament this week The health secretary said the child's mother wrote to her at the weekend and said she had acted on the information in a bid to get answers. Asked about putting the health board into special measures, Ms Freeman said she would make a statement to the Scottish Parliament later this week. The powers were last used on NHS Tayside in 2018 and mean the Scottish government takes a more direct role in management. Ms Freeman said it was not appropriate to elaborate but, pressed on whether it was an option, she replied: ""It's always an option. It's something that we've done before in other cases, so of course it's an option to look at how we escalate any board. ""By escalation, that means that the government takes a more interventionist role."" The health secretary also said she had a ""great deal of concern"" over the way the cases were handled. Anas Sarwar, the MSP who went public with details of Milly's case after being contacted by a whistleblower, has written to the Holyrood's health and sport committee to call for NHSGGC board chiefs to be forced to answer questions about water contamination. Mr Sarwar said: ""Health board chiefs have tried to cover this up, and they need to urgently appear before MSPs, answer questions about the scale of the crisis, tell the truth, apologise to the whistleblower and staff for attacking them, and apologise to patients, parents and the public."" Ms Freeman is due to appear before the committee on Tuesday. MSP Anas Sarwar has described the health board as ""not fit for purpose"" In response to reports about the boy's death and the police investigation, NHSGCC spokesman said: ""We have already provided information to this family but are sorry that they have further questions. ""We fully investigated this child's death at the time and also asked for two independent experts to investigate the case, the outcome of which has been communicated to the family. ""We are absolutely committed to providing patients and families with information and ensuring they get answers to the questions they have. In this case the full findings were shared with the family."" But on Sunday Labour's health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said she had been in contact with the child's mother. Ms Lennon said: ""She believes the statement issued by NHSGGC in response to media reports about her son is highly inaccurate. ""She disputes the accuracy of their investigations and reports and is in receipt of documentation that confirms bacteria was present in the showerhead within her son's hospital bathroom."" The MSP said that when the mother last met with NHSGGC she walked out of the meeting and advised them she would be taking legal action. Milly Main contracted an infection while recovering from a stem cell transplant in Glasgow Awhistleblower had earlier revealed that a doctor-led review,externalhad identified 26 infections at RHC during 2017 which were potentially linked to contaminated water. The Â£842m Queen Elizabeth University Hospital ""super hospital"" has faced a number of problems since it opened in 2015. Two cancer wards at the adjoining children's hospitalwere closed last year amid concern about infections and investigation of water supplyissues, with patients decanted to the adult hospital. In January it emerged that two patients at the QEUH had died aftercontracting a fungal infection linked to pigeon droppings.

Woman who inherited fatal disease sues NHS,"A woman who was not informed that her father had a fatal, inherited brain disorder has told the High Court that she would have had an abortion if she'd known at the time of her pregnancy. She is suing three NHS trusts saying they owed a duty of care to tell her about her dad's Huntington's disease. Any child of someone with the condition has a 50% chance of inheriting it. Doctors suspected the diagnosis after her father killed her mother and was detained under the Mental Health Act. The father tested positive for Huntington's Disease, which is caused by a faulty gene and leads to the progressive loss of brain cells, affecting movement, mood and thinking skills.  It can also cause aggressive behaviour. He told doctors he did not want his daughter told about his diagnosis, fearing she might kill herself or have an abortion if she found out. The claimant is known as ABC in order to protect the identity of her own daughter, who is now nine. ABC only found out about that her father had Huntington's Disease, a progressive, incurable condition, four months after giving birth. The case is being heard in the Royal Courts of Justice in central London At the High Court she said she'd been told about her father's condition by accident. ""I was utterly traumatised by the way I was told"", she said. ""I had no family support and was left to Google the condition."" ABC eventually had a test and found that she also carries the faulty gene.  Her daughter, who's not been tested, has a 50:50 chance of inheriting it from her. The symptoms of Huntington's Disease usually appear between the ages of 30 and 50. ABC, who's now in her 40s, told the court:  ""I'm now the prime age to get unwell.  The future is absolutely terrifying."" She told the High Court that had she known during her pregnancy that she has the gene for Huntington's she would definitely have had an abortion. She is suing St George's and two other NHS Trusts involved in the family's care, for Â£345,000 in damages. St George's NHS trust operates hospitals and clinics in south-west London In written submissions Philip Havers QC on behalf of the trusts, said the question for the court was whether there was ""a duty to disclose to her confidential information about her father against his express wishes"" which he said was ""plainly not the case"". The court heard that after ABC had found out about her father's disorder, her sister also became pregnant. Philip Havers QC for the trusts said ABC had asked doctors not to tell her sister that their father had tested positive for Huntington's. Mr Havers said it was ""a bit rich"" for ABC to be bringing this claim for damages. He said she could have told her sister in time for her to have a termination, but that was what she was complaining about for herself. ABC said at the time, she'd been ""utterly terrified"" about the impact on her sister adding that the situation should have been managed by health professionals. About 8,500 people in the UK have Huntington's disease and a further 25,000 will develop it when they are older It is a rare inherited disorder that damages certain nerve cells in the brain Huntington's generally affects people in their prime - in their 30s and 40s - and patients die about 10 to 20 years after symptoms start Some patientsdescribe itas having Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and motor neurone disease rolled into one This video can not be played Two other sisters talk of dilemma over Huntington's disease test This case was first argued at the High Court in 2015 when a judge ruled that a full hearing should not go ahead. The judgement said there was ""no reasonably arguable duty of care"" owed to ABC. But in 2017, the Court of Appeal reversed that decision and said the case should go to trial. She is now suing St George's Healthcare NHS Trust in south-west London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust and Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust for damages. If ABC wins the case, it would trigger a major shift in the rules governing patient confidentiality, and raise questions over the potential duty of care owed to family members following genetic testing. A spokesperson for St George's Healthcare NHS Trust said: ""This case raises complex and sensitive issues in respect of the competing interests between the duty of care and the duty of confidentiality. ""It will be for the court to adjudicate on those issues during the trial."" The case continues.

Lib Dems and SNP in court over election TV debate,"Lib Dem chairman Sal Brinton said their exclusion was ""shameful"" and SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said he hoped ""sense prevails"" The views of voters who want to remain in the EU will be excluded if the Lib Dems and SNP are not part of ITV's election debate, a court has heard. Lawyers for both parties told London's High Court that their views on Brexit would not be represented on the show. The head-to-head between Conservative leader Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is on Tuesday. ITV lawyers told the court the debate would be cancelled if the ruling - due after 16:00 GMT - went against them. An interview with Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, due to follow the head-to-head, would also be pulled, they said. Meanwhile, the Lib Dems have sent a legal letter to the BBC over its decision not to include Ms Swinson in a debate on 6 December. SNP to take legal action over ITV election debate Lib Dems launch legal action over ITV debate Johnson and Corbyn to face off in live BBC debate When are the general election TV debates? In court, lawyers for the Liberal Democrats argued that Brexit was the ""dominant"" issue in the 12 December general election and that the ""voice of Remain has been excluded"" by ITV's decision not to include Ms Swinson. Guy Vassall-Adams QC said the decision not to include the party was unlawful because it ""breaches the duty of impartiality and the requirement to give due weight to a wide range of significant views"". ""The dominant issue of this election campaign is Brexit, which is on any view a matter of major political controversy and current public policy,"" he told the court. ""In the first national TV debate of the campaign it is essential that a wide, balanced range of views on Brexit is represented."" He said this had ""serious consequences for the fairness of the democratic process"". The Liberal Democrats want leader Jo Swinson to be included in the debate Mr Vassall-Adams also argued there was evidence that TV debates ""are very influential with voters"", saying the programme ""will attract millions of viewers"". Lawyers for the SNP - which lodged a separate legal challenge last week - said the party represented views, including on Brexit and Scottish independence, that would not be represented in a debate between Labour and the Conservatives. Philip Coppel QC said: ""Prior to 2010 it may have been the case that a debate between the Labour and the Conservative leaders would cover the full range of significant views in a general election. ""That was, arguably, a time when those parties encompassed the spectrum of mainstream political opinion. ""That is no longer the case. In the current, pluralistic political landscape it is simply not possible for a debate which only includes two parties to include 'all significant views'."" ITV lawyers argued there was no basis for alleging any unlawful conduct on the part of the broadcaster. CONFUSED?:Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote When ITV announced its plans, the channel said it would hold a live interview-based programme alongside the leaders' head-to-head to allow other parties to comment, as well as another multi-party debate ahead of the 12 December poll. The Liberal Democrats have also criticised the BBC's plan for a live head-to-head between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn on Friday, 6 December, because Ms Swinson is not taking part. The party's lawyers have sent a letter to the BBC's director general Tony Hall, saying the exclusion of Ms Swinson is ""clearly unlawful"". ""It also means that viewers will be denied the opportunity to hear the fresh and distinct perspective that the Liberal Democrats bring on the dominant issue of this election, namely Brexit,"" the letter said. The BBC declined to comment on the letter. The broadcaster will hostthe live head-to-head debate between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbynin Southampton on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. And BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

Huge wildfire 'doubled Scotland's emissions',"The wildlife in the Flow Country burnt for six days in May A massive wildfire on peatland in the far north in May doubled Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions for the six days it burnt, a study has estimated. About 22 sq miles (5,700 hectares) of blanket bog in the Flow Country, which stretches across Caithness and Sutherland, was affected. The WWF Scotland study claimed 700,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent was released into the atmosphere as a result. That is similar to the amount released across the rest of Scotland. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, contribute to climate warming and are released by many activities such as energy supply, industrial processes, transport, heating and agriculture. The fire caused damage of thousands of acres The peatbog is a natural carbon store A satellite image of the Caithness fire on 16 May Peat bogs are an important natural store for carbon. The Flow Country, home to the largest continuous peatbog in Europe, is estimated to hold almost 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). The study, commissioned by environmental campaign group WWF, called for more government investment to protect and improve peat bogs. Head of policy Gina Hanrahan said: ""This analysis puts into stark figures the importance of our peatlands and the huge cost to climate and nature when something goes wrong."" The Flow Country peatbog is formed from layers of dead vegetation such a sphagnum moss The Flow Country peatbog is formed from layers of dead vegetation such a sphagnum moss. Because of the waterlogged conditions, the plants do not decompose which traps carbon in the peat soil. Experts say the quality of peatlands can play a significant role in minimising emissions in the event of a wildfire. Emma Goodyer, from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), said: ""Healthy peatlands are more resilient to fire. A great deal of peatland restoration work is being undertaken across the UK already with at least 150 projects carried out in Scotland. ""However, we need to increase the scale of funding available for peatland restoration if we are to urgently respond to the climate crisis and to increase the resilience of our peatlands."" RSPB staff helping to tackle flare-ups of the wildfire A Scottish government spokesman said restoring peatland had an important part to play in delivering climate change ambitions. He said the government was committed to delivering the peatland restoration targets set out in the Climate Change Plan. ""We are currently updating our Climate Change Plan which will set out detailed actions to deliver on our climate change ambitions,"" the spokesman said. The fire stretched from the outskirts of Melvich on the north coast to the village of Forsinard, about 15 miles further south. A long-term project is being carried out in the Flow Country to estimate the ecological impact of the fire. Measurements gathered before the fire give researchers a unique data set for understanding the way vegetation and water quality has changed.

PM shelves business tax cut to help fund NHS,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson laid out his plans as he addressed the CBI conference Planned cuts to corporation tax next April are to be put on hold, Boris Johnson has said, with the money being spent on the NHS and other services. The rate paid by firms on their profits was due to fall from 19% to 17%. But the PM told business leaders it may cost the Treasury Â£6bn and this was better spent on ""national priorities"", including the health service. Labour said business ""handouts"" had done real damage and the Tories would ""revert to type"" after the election. The announcement does not mean any new money for the NHS, on top of the Â£20bn extra a year the Conservatives are promising to give it up to 2023. The BBC understands the cash will be used, in part, to fund existing pledges on GP training. With just over three weeks to go before the 12 December election, the leaders of the three largest parties in England have been parading their business credentials at the CBI conference.

Jeremy Corbyn said business had ""so much to gain"" from a Labour victory in terms of investment while Jo Swinson said the Liberal Democrats were the ""natural party of business"" because they wanted to cancel Brexit. Addressing the audience of top executives and entrepreneurs, Mr Johnson said they had ""created the wealth that actually pays for the NHS"". This video can not be played Sajid Javid: Tax cut reversal not a mistake Stressing his party's ""emphatic belief in fiscal prudence"", he said he had decided against going ahead with a further cut in corporation tax, a step first proposed by Chancellor George Osborne in 2016 to boost business in the wake of the Brexit referendum. Mr Johnson said the UK already had the lowest rate of corporation tax of ""any major economy"" and further cuts would be ""postponed"". ""Before you storm the stage, let me remind you that this saves Â£6bn that we can put into the priorities of the British people including the NHS,"" he told the audience. Corporation tax is an important revenue-raiser,making up approximately 9% of the UK government's total tax take,external. The amount raised by the tax has risen by two-thirds in the past decade, as the rate has fallen from 28% to 19% and economic conditions have improved. But many economists said the latest cut would be potentially counter-productive in terms of tax yields, with astudy based on HMRC data,externallast year suggesting it could mean Â£6bn a year in lost government revenues. In response, CBI director Carolyn Fairbairn said the move could ""work for the country if it is backed by further efforts to the costs of doing business and promote growth"". Blink and you might have missed it, but the PM has just announced the single biggest tax-raising measure of the campaign so far. The overnight headlines about Boris Johnson's CBI speech were about a Â£1bn cut to business taxes. It pays to read the small print. All together, this leaves an extra Â£5bn a year for the Conservative manifesto to deploy in extra spending or, as seems likely, some crowd-pleasing pre-election personal tax cuts. I'm told the corporation tax move was Chancellor Sajid Javid's idea, and was discussed during plans for his aborted Budget earlier this month. The PM also confirmed Mr Javid would remain in post if he wins the election next month. Cancelling the cut still leaves the UK with the lowest corporation tax rate in the G20, although not as low as Switzerland or Singapore. Given the government's argument has long been that cuts to corporation tax raise revenue, it is interesting to see the PM now say that cancelling cuts will also raise revenue. It is meant to show clear blue water between the Conservatives and Labour on fiscal credibility. In the event, there was barely a squeak out of the CBI audience about a significant multi-billion pound tax change. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Monday's freeze marked a ""temporary pause in the Tories' race to the bottom"" on business taxes. Allow Twitter content?

Labour's plan has been to raise corporation tax to 26% - the 2011 level - which it says will generate billions to be spent on its priorities, including health and education. Turning to Brexit, the Conservative leader told the conference that while big business did not want the UK to leave the EU, his withdrawal deal would provide the certainty ""that you want now and have wanted for some time"". CONFUSED?:Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote If elected with a Commons majority, Mr Johnson is hoping to get the agreement on the terms of the UK's exit into law by 31 January, and begin talks with Brussels on a permanent trading relationship. He also announced a review of business rates in England, with the aim of reducing the overall burden of the tax, as well as a cut in National Insurance contributions for employers, which already benefit from a reduction known as the employment allowance. In his address, Mr Corbyn said business had nothing to fear from a Labour government, arguing that while the richest would pay more, there would also be ""more investment than you have ever dreamt of"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I understand your concern over some of our plans"" He said he would ""make no apologies"" for the party's plan to take rail, mail, water and broadband delivery into public ownership, saying it was ""not an attack"" on the free market and would bring the UK in line with the continent. Business rates: My bill went from Â£560 to Â£7,760 Why does Labour want to give away free broadband? ""It is sometimes claimed I am anti-business,"" he said. ""This is nonsense. It is not nonsense to be against poverty pay. It is not nonsense to say the largest corporations should pay their taxes, just as small companies do. ""It is not anti-business to want prosperity in every part of the country."" This video can not be played Jo Swinson: ""Liberal Democrats would scrap business rates"" The Labour leader also set out plans to train about 320,000 apprentices in jobs such as construction, manufacturing and design within the renewable energy, transport and forestry sectors. Ms Fairbairn said the business community shared Labour's desire to increased investment but warned the opposition's ""massive instincts towards state intervention and ownership"" put that at risk. In her first address to the CBI as leader of her party, Ms Swinson said no-one claiming to want to ""get Brexit sorted"" was on the side of business, due to the negative impact she said it would have on investment and access to labour. ""With Boris Johnson in the pocket of Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn stuck in the 1970s, we are the only one standing up for you,"" she said. She said her party would go further than the others and replace ""crippling"" business rates with a levy paid by commercial landlords based on land value, which she suggested would help ""rescue the High Street"". Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who is not attending the CBI event, said politicians' focus should be on helping small business and promoting what he claimed were the advantages of a no-deal Brexit.

Protests in 100 and 500 words,"Clashes between police and protesters have grown increasingly violent Anti-government protests have rocked Hong Kong for months and the situation shows no sign of dying down. Here's all the background you need to know in 100 or 500 words - you can read each individually or in turn. Hong Kong's protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Critics feared this could undermine judicial independence and endanger dissidents. Until 1997, Hong Kong was ruled by Britain as a colony but then returned to China. Under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, it has some autonomy, and its people more rights. The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continue and now demand full democracy and an inquiry into police actions. Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs. The extradition bill which triggered the first protest was introduced in April. It would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China under certain circumstances. Opponents said this risked exposing Hongkongers to unfair trials and violent treatment. They also argued the bill would give China greater influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and journalists. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. After weeks of protests, leader Carrie Lam eventually said the bill would be suspended indefinitely. Protesters feared the bill could be revived, so demonstrations continued, calling for it to be withdrawn completely. By then clashes between police and protesters had become more frequent and violent. In September,the bill was finally withdrawn, but protesters said this was ""too little, too late"". On 1 October, while China was celebrating 70 years of Communist Party rule,Hong Kong experienced one of its most ""violent and chaotic days"". An 18-year-old was shot in the chest with a live bullet as protesters fought officers with poles, petrol bombs and other projectiles. The government thenbanned protesters wearing face masks, and in early Novembera pro-Beijing lawmaker was stabbedin the street by a man pretending to be a supporter. One week later,a policeman shot one protesterat close range when activists were trying to set up a road block. Later that day another man was set on fire by anti-government protesters. In November, a standoff between police and students barricaded on the campus of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University becameanother defining moment. Later that month, the territory held local council elections that were seen as a barometer of public opinion. The vote saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. Some protesters have adopted the motto: ""Five demands, not one less!"" These are: For the protests not to be characterised as a ""riot"" Amnesty for arrested protesters An independent inquiry into alleged police brutality Implementation of complete universal suffrage The fifth demand, the withdrawal of the bill, has already been met. Protests supporting the Hong Kong movement have spread across the globe, with rallies taking place in the UK, France, US, Canada and Australia. In many cases, people supporting the demonstrators were confronted by pro-Beijing rallies. Chinese president Xi Jinping has warned against separatism, saying any attempt to divide China would end in ""bodies smashed and bones ground to powder"". Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997. It has its own judiciary and a separate legal system from mainland China. Those rights include freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

Fiery stand-off at university,"This video can not be played Police tear gas met with petrol bombs A stand-off at a Hong Kong university campus has led to fiery clashes overnight, as hundreds of protesters tried to repel a police advance. Large fires broke out at entrances to the Polytechnic University (PolyU), where protesters hurled petrol bombs and shot arrows from behind barricades. Officers earlier warned they could use live ammunition if protesters did not stop attacking them using such weapons. Months of anti-government protests have caused turmoil in the city. The latest violence is some of the worst the semi-autonomous Chinese territory has seen since the movement began. The police have become targets for radical demonstrators, who accuse them of excessive force. Demonstrators have been occupying the PolyU for days. Fresh clashes erupted on Sunday, with tear gas and water cannon being met with petrol bombs, bricks and other improvised weapons. A police media liaison officer was wounded in the leg with an arrow on Sunday. The protests explained in 100 and 500 words The context to Hong Kong protests Timeline of Hong Kong unrest How is Hong Kong run? The protesters occupying the university had been told to leave immediately on Sunday evening but hundreds remained inside. Sporadic battles continued throughout the night, with police making a push to re-take the campus at about 05:30 local time (21:30 GMT). They were met with petrol bombs, which started blazes around the campus. Later, some protesters tried to leave the campus but were met with tear gas and retreated. This video can not be played Protesters around Hong Kong Polytechnic University have armed themselves with an array of weapons ""I hereby warn rioters not to use petrol bombs, arrows, cars or any deadly weapons to attack police officers,"" police spokesman Louis Lau said in a statement broadcast via Facebook late on Sunday. ""If they continue such dangerous actions, we would have no choice but to use the minimum force necessary, including live rounds, to fire back."" Earlier in the stand-off, police fired a live round in response to what they said was a car hurtling towards officers near the university. By the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Polytechnic University, at 04:00 Hong Kong time It's only the most radical left now - or the bravest, depending on your point of view. About a hundred of them are hunkered down at a junction outside the main entrance. On the other side of the road: an armoured police vehicle, and a water cannon truck. Every 10 minutes or so, these two sides play a game of cat and mouse. The police fire tear gas and the water cannon advances, squirting noxious blue liquid. The protesters, crouching behind umbrellas, respond with petrol bombs and rocks fired from improvised catapults. The police vehicles retreat. The net result is zero. It's a stalemate. There are several hundred more protesters milling around the campus. Medics treat those who have been hit by tear gas or the blue liquid in the water cannon, which stings on contact with the skin. Others man barricades at the many entrances to this sprawling campus which is now completely surrounded. When the police announced a 22:00 deadline for the protesters to surrender or face the possibility of lethal force a significant number changed out of their black outfits, ditched their masks, and disappeared into the night. Some were arrested but others escaped. Those who remain seem determined to fight to the end, no matter the risk. ""If I die, remember me,"" one young man said to me. ""Do you believe that could happen?"" I asked. He gave a nervous shrug. The protests in Hong Kong, which began in June, were triggered by a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China but have since expanded into wider demands for greater democracy and for investigations into the actions of police. The government recently confirmedthe city had entered its first recession for a decade. In recent days, Hong Kong's university campuses have been the scenes of pitched battles between police and demonstrators. A police truck on a bridge above the Cross Harbour tunnel, which links Kowloon and Hong Kong island, was set on fire on Sunday and it was forced to retreat by large crowds of protesters hiding behind umbrellas and hurling petrol bombs. Fires raged around the campus on Monday morning Protesters have been holding a bridge above the Cross Harbour tunnel In a statement the university hadurged those occupying the campus to leave.,external ""Universities are venues for advancing knowledge and nurturing talents. Universities are not battlegrounds for political disputes and should not be drawn into violent confrontations,"" it said. Protesters armed with bows and arrows have been seen on the PolyU campus The officer was struck in the leg close to the Hong Kong Polytechnic University On Saturday, in a move that sparked controversy, Chinese soldiers in shorts and T-shirts took to the streets to help clean up debris and remove barricades. It was the first time since the protests erupted that Chinese soldiers, who very rarely leave their barracks in Hong Kong, had taken to the streets. This video can not be played In a rare move, Chinese soldiers left their barracks on Saturday to help clean up Hong Kong's streets Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this bill would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the police, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.

PM shelves business tax cut to help fund NHSBoris Johnson says plans to cut corporation tax to 17% next year are to be put on hold.Election 2019Comments,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson laid out his plans as he addressed the CBI conference Planned cuts to corporation tax next April are to be put on hold, Boris Johnson has said, with the money being spent on the NHS and other services. The rate paid by firms on their profits was due to fall from 19% to 17%. But the PM told business leaders it may cost the Treasury Â£6bn and this was better spent on ""national priorities"", including the health service. Labour said business ""handouts"" had done real damage and the Tories would ""revert to type"" after the election. The announcement does not mean any new money for the NHS, on top of the Â£20bn extra a year the Conservatives are promising to give it up to 2023. The BBC understands the cash will be used, in part, to fund existing pledges on GP training. With just over three weeks to go before the 12 December election, the leaders of the three largest parties in England have been parading their business credentials at the CBI conference. Live: Latest as party leaders address CBI Lib Dems and SNP lose ITV debate legal challenge Does cutting corporation tax always raise more money? Jeremy Corbyn said business had ""so much to gain"" from a Labour victory in terms of investment while Jo Swinson said the Liberal Democrats were the ""natural party of business"" because they wanted to cancel Brexit. Addressing the audience of top executives and entrepreneurs, Mr Johnson said they had ""created the wealth that actually pays for the NHS"". This video can not be played Sajid Javid: Tax cut reversal not a mistake Stressing his party's ""emphatic belief in fiscal prudence"", he said he had decided against going ahead with a further cut in corporation tax, a step first proposed by Chancellor George Osborne in 2016 to boost business in the wake of the Brexit referendum. Mr Johnson said the UK already had the lowest rate of corporation tax of ""any major economy"" and further cuts would be ""postponed"". ""Before you storm the stage, let me remind you that this saves Â£6bn that we can put into the priorities of the British people including the NHS,"" he told the audience. Corporation tax is an important revenue-raiser,making up approximately 9% of the UK government's total tax take,external. The amount raised by the tax has risen by two-thirds in the past decade, as the rate has fallen from 28% to 19% and economic conditions have improved. But many economists said the latest cut would be potentially counter-productive in terms of tax yields, with astudy based on HMRC data,externallast year suggesting it could mean Â£6bn a year in lost government revenues. In response, CBI director Carolyn Fairbairn said the move could ""work for the country if it is backed by further efforts to the costs of doing business and promote growth"". Blink and you might have missed it, but the PM has just announced the single biggest tax-raising measure of the campaign so far. The overnight headlines about Boris Johnson's CBI speech were about a Â£1bn cut to business taxes. It pays to read the small print. All together, this leaves an extra Â£5bn a year for the Conservative manifesto to deploy in extra spending or, as seems likely, some crowd-pleasing pre-election personal tax cuts. I'm told the corporation tax move was Chancellor Sajid Javid's idea, and was discussed during plans for his aborted Budget earlier this month. The PM also confirmed Mr Javid would remain in post if he wins the election next month. Cancelling the cut still leaves the UK with the lowest corporation tax rate in the G20, although not as low as Switzerland or Singapore. Given the government's argument has long been that cuts to corporation tax raise revenue, it is interesting to see the PM now say that cancelling cuts will also raise revenue. It is meant to show clear blue water between the Conservatives and Labour on fiscal credibility. In the event, there was barely a squeak out of the CBI audience about a significant multi-billion pound tax change. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Monday's freeze marked a ""temporary pause in the Tories' race to the bottom"" on business taxes. Allow Twitter content?

Labour's plan has been to raise corporation tax to 26% - the 2011 level - which it says will generate billions to be spent on its priorities, including health and education. Turning to Brexit, the Conservative leader told the conference that while big business did not want the UK to leave the EU, his withdrawal deal would provide the certainty ""that you want now and have wanted for some time"".

He also announced a review of business rates in England, with the aim of reducing the overall burden of the tax, as well as a cut in National Insurance contributions for employers, which already benefit from a reduction known as the employment allowance. In his address, Mr Corbyn said business had nothing to fear from a Labour government, arguing that while the richest would pay more, there would also be ""more investment than you have ever dreamt of"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I understand your concern over some of our plans"" He said he would ""make no apologies"" for the party's plan to take rail, mail, water and broadband delivery into public ownership, saying it was ""not an attack"" on the free market and would bring the UK in line with the continent. Business rates: My bill went from Â£560 to Â£7,760 Why does Labour want to give away free broadband? ""It is sometimes claimed I am anti-business,"" he said. ""This is nonsense. It is not nonsense to be against poverty pay. It is not nonsense to say the largest corporations should pay their taxes, just as small companies do. ""It is not anti-business to want prosperity in every part of the country.""

Ms Fairbairn said the business community shared Labour's desire to increased investment but warned the opposition's ""massive instincts towards state intervention and ownership"" put that at risk. In her first address to the CBI as leader of her party, Ms Swinson said no-one claiming to want to ""get Brexit sorted"" was on the side of business, due to the negative impact she said it would have on investment and access to labour. ""With Boris Johnson in the pocket of Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn stuck in the 1970s, we are the only one standing up for you,"" she said. She said her party would go further than the others and replace ""crippling"" business rates with a levy paid by commercial landlords based on land value, which she suggested would help ""rescue the High Street"". Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who is not attending the CBI event, said politicians' focus should be on helping small business and promoting what he claimed were the advantages of a no-deal Brexit.

"Protesters arrested as they run from HK campusAfter a fiery overnight stand-off, some protesters try to leave but police react with tear gas.China","This video can not be played These protesters attempting to leave PolyU met with tear gas Several protesters have been arrested while trying to run from a Hong Kong university campus surrounded by police. Around 100 people tried to leave the Polytechnic University, but were met with tear gas and rubber bullets. In the past week, the campus has turned into a battleground as long-running anti-government protests become more violent. A small number managed to successfully leave the campus using rope ladders before being picked up by motorcycles. Hong Kong's Hospital Authority says 116 people have been injured and taken to hospital. The violence is some of the worst seen during months of unrest in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. The protests started over a controversial extradition bill, and have now evolved into broader anti-government demonstrations. China has warned that ""no-one should underestimate [its] will to safeguard its sovereignty and Hong Kong's stability"", and its ambassador to the UK said the central government would not sit back and watch if the situation became ""uncontrollable"". Timeline of unrest How is Hong Kong run? Protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong is a part of China, and the protests are, in part, about the fear that the special freedoms the territory enjoys as a former British colony are being eroded. Earlier, Hong Kong's High Court ruled that a ban on protesters wearing face masks was unconstitutional. The colonial-era emergency law was invoked in October, but protesters largely defied it. Hong Kong's government saidthe weekend's events had ""reduced the chance"" of district elections being held on Sunday,externalas planned, public broadcaster RTHK reports. Postponing or cancelling the vote could further inflame the protests. The UK has urged an ""end to the violence and for all sides to engage in meaningful political dialogue"" ahead of the elections. Police are still besieging the university where several hundred protesters are thought to be trapped. Officers have ordered those inside to drop their weapons and surrender. A protester inside the university told the BBC supplies, including first aid equipment, were running low. Meanwhile, a fire broke out on campus and loud explosions were heard, according to the South China Morning Post. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

PolyU has been occupied by protesters for several days. On Sunday night, police warned protesters they had until 22:00 (14:00 GMT) to leave the campus, saying they could use live ammunition if the attacks continued. On Sunday, the university said it had been""severely and extensively vandalised"",external. A number of protesters left inside in the university have identified themselves as current students in media interviews but it is unclear exactly how many of them are, in fact, university students. By Grace Tsoi, BBCNews, Hong Kong Worried parents whose children were trapped inside the Polytechnic University were among the 200 protesters who joined a peaceful rally on Monday night in eastern Tsim Sha Tsui, a tourist area which is only 300 metres away from the besieged campus. Ms Ng - who only wanted to be identified by her last name - found out on Sunday night her son was among those trapped inside. ""He's frightened because he has not faced any emergency situation on his own. She has been on the streets near the university since then. The teary-eyed mother is proud of her 18-year-old son despite the circumstances. ""My son didn't cry. He's strong and likes to help others,"" she said. ""I told my son that you did nothing wrong and you are an outstanding kid. I wouldn't blame you."" She told him to stay inside the campus and wait for her to pick him up. Ms Ng said the government should bear the responsibility for the chaos in Hong Kong. ""Our government is more and more reckless. It ignores the very lowly demands from the citizens!"" she said. ""I wasn't born in Hong Kong but I love Hong Kong so much! Hong Kong is a wonderful place but it has turned into such a state. It breaks my heart!"" Campuses remained relatively free of violence during the Hong Kong protests but, last week,the Chinese University of Hong Kong became a battleground. Police say protesters threw petrol bombs on a major road near the university in an effort to stop traffic. Officers attempted to reclaim the road, leading to major clashes. A protester arrested while trying to leave the campus The university then cancelled all classes for the rest of the term. Days later, protesters at PolyU also tried to block access to a key tunnel near the university. Protests have also been held at other locations in Hong Kong. Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, it has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest movement against alleged police brutality, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.

War crimes court considers probe into UK army,"This video can not be played British Special Forces have been accused of covering up the killings of four young Afghans in 2012 The International Criminal Court could open its first investigation into the British military following a BBC programme about alleged war crimes. Panorama found evidence the state had covered upkillings of civilians by UK troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The ICC said it took the findings very seriously. The MoD has said the allegations are unsubstantiated. The MoD said it had co-operated fully with the ICC and saw no justification for further interventions by the court. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the allegations against the MoD are ""untrue"". A formal investigation by the ICC, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, would be the first time it has taken action against any UK nationals for war crimes. The ICC's Office of Prosecutor said it would ""independently assess"" the findings of Panorama,  which could be ""highly relevant"" to their decision whether to open a landmark investigation into the UK. The court has previously concluded there is credible evidence that British troops committed war crimes in Iraq. Most of those cases involve allegations of the mistreatment of detainees. The best known is that of Baha Mousa, a hotel worker in Basra who died after being tortured and beaten by British troops in 2003. It led to a public inquiry and the only conviction of a British soldier for war crimes in Iraq. However, Panorama, working with the Sunday Times, has uncovered new information about alleged killings in British custody. Detectives from the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which investigated alleged war crimes committed by British troops during the occupation of Iraq, say they found evidence of widespread abuse occurring at a British army base in Basra three months before Mousa was killed. Camp Stephen, Iraq, where alleged abuse took place It happened at Camp Stephen, run by the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland. IHAT investigated the deaths of two men, who died within a week of each other, in May 2003. The MoD accepts both were innocent civilians. IHAT gathered statements from British soldiers and army staff that described how the two men were tortured before being found dead with bags tied over their heads. This summer, British military prosecutors decided no-one would be prosecuted in connection with the two deaths. When he was shown Panorama's evidence, former Director of Public Prosecutions Lord Macdonald said he thought it was ""staggering"" that no soldier had been charged. ""I think the conclusion begins to become rather obvious, that prior to their deaths, it's overwhelmingly likely that these men were physically abused."" On Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC ""all of the allegations, that had evidence, have been looked at"". A No 10 spokesman said that the service police had already carried out ""an extensive investigation"" about the conduct of forces in Iraq and Afghanistan - and the independent Service Prosecuting Authority had decided not to prosecute any of the cases. The MoD said military operations are conducted in accordance with the law and there had been an extensive investigation of allegations. ""Investigations and decisions to prosecute are rightly independent from the MoD and have involved external oversight and legal advice,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""After careful consideration of referred cases, the independent Service Prosecuting Authority decided not to prosecute."" ""The BBC's claims have been passed to the Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority who remain open to considering allegations.""

Bronte museum to finally bring rare book home,"The book by Charlotte Bronte slipped through the museum's fingers eight years ago A book written by Charlotte Bronte at the age of 14 will return home after being bought by the Bronte Society at auction in Paris. The miniature work, called The Young Men's Magazine, will go to the Parsonage Museum in the Brontes' old home in Haworth, West Yorkshire. It was bought for â¬600,000 (Â£512,970) after a fundraising campaign by the Bronte Society, which runs the museum. The museum lost out on the book when it last went under the hammer in 2011. The total price including buyer's premium was â¬780,000 (Â£666,790). The work is one of six ""little books"" written by Charlotte, the eldest of the three sisters, in 1830. Five are known to survive, and the Bronte Parsonage Museum already holds the other four. The works were created for Charlotte's toy soldiers and document an imaginary world created by the family called Glass Town. Charlotte is best known for her 1847 classic novel Jane Eyre. Charlotte Bronte captured by the artist George Richmond Kitty Wright, executive director of The Bronte Society, said: ""We were determined to do everything we could to bring back this extraordinary 'little book' to the Bronte Parsonage Museum and now can't quite believe that it will in fact be coming home to where it was written 189 years ago. ""We have been truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from people from all over the world backing our campaign and can't wait to have it in place with the others and on public view to the world."" The museum's principal curator Ann Dinsdale added that bringing the ""unique manuscript"" back to Haworth was an ""absolute highlight"" of her 30-year career at the venue. ""Charlotte wrote this miniscule magazine for the toy soldiers she and her siblings played with and as we walk through the same rooms they did, it seems immensely fitting that it is coming home and we would like to say an enormous thank you to everyone who made it possible."" Part of the Young Men's Magazine describes a murderer driven to madness after being haunted by his victims, and how ""an immense fire"" burning in his head causes his bed curtains to set alight. Experts at the museum say this section of the story is ""a clear precursor"" of a famous scene between Bertha and Edward Rochester in Jane Eyre, which Charlotte would publish 17 years later. The society said more than 1,000 people had pledged money to help buy the book. Several celebrities, including Dame Judi Dench, Dame Jacqueline Wilson and Tracy Chevalier, backed the society's efforts to raise money. Dame Judi Dench led a campaign to raise funds for the book to be secured for the Bronte Parsonage Museum York-born Dame Judi, who is president of the Bronte Society, said earlier this year: ""I have long been fascinated by the little books created by the Brontes when they were children. ""These tiny manuscripts are like a magical doorway into the imaginary worlds they inhabited, and also hint at their ambition to become published authors."" The existence of the book that went up for sale - measuring 35mm x 61mm and consisting of 20 pages - came to light in 2011 when it was auctioned at Sotheby's. The Bronte society was outbid bya discredited investment scheme that is no longer operational. The scheme was run by GÃ©rard LhÃ©ritier and his company Aristophil, who set up the Musee des Lettres et Manuscrits in Paris. LhÃ©ritier saw the potential financial rewards in rare works such as the Bronte book, so bought and filled his museum with them. His company was accused of selling shares in a Ponzi-style pyramid scheme, built on false advertising and illusionary market values. About 18,000 people in France are believed to have been defrauded in what went on to become one of the biggest ever arts market scams, having invested nearly â¬1bn. The company behind it was shut down by regulators in 2014.

Rugby star's 'appalling' bushfire link draws anger,"Folau was sacked by Rugby Australia earlier this year for his comments on gay people Rugby player Israel Folau has drawn anger for linking Australia's bushfire crisis to the nation's same-sex marriage and abortion laws. Folau, who was sacked by Australia in May for making anti-gay remarks on social media, described the fires as a ""little taste of God's judgement"". Six people have died since last month in blazes raging in eastern Australia. Prime Minister Scott Morrison condemned Folau's remarks as ""appallingly insensitive"". ""He is a free citizen, he can say whatever he likes but that doesn't mean he can't have regard to the grievance [and] offence this would have caused to the people whose homes have burnt down,"" Mr Morrison told reporters on Monday. Heatwave is forecast to spark new Australia fires Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? How you fight extreme wildfires Folau, who is Christian, gave a sermon in his Sydney church on Sunday in which he said Australia's decision to pass abortion and same-sex marriage laws had gone against ""God's word"", adding the nation needed to ""repent"". ""Look how rapid, these bushfires, these droughts, all these things have come, in a short period of time. You think it's a coincidence or not?,"" he said. His comments sparked outrage from many Australians online, who noted the widespread devastation of the fires. This video can not be played Warren Smith's home was destroyed in recent bushfires in Australia He was also criticised by high-profile local figures who had previously supported him. ""Israel, button up,"" said broadcaster Alan Jones on his radio show on Monday. ""These comments don't help."" Rugby star sacked for anti-gay post Folau 'entitled to day in court' Rugby Australia (RA) sacked the former Wallabies player in May after he said on social media that ""hell awaits"" gay people. The 30-year-old fullback has been widely condemned for those comments and others targeting transgender people, but he has also received vocal support from Christian groups. Folau is suing RA over his dismissal, claiming his contract was unlawfully terminated due to his religious beliefs. Rugby Australia has stood by its decision to sack Folau, saying he breached a players' code of conduct. He was previously one of the nation's highest-paid athletes.

The prince has stood by his decision to take part, despite critics describing it as a ""car crash"". Amid the backlash, Prince Andrew is now facing renewed calls to tell US authorities about his friendship with US financier Epstein - who, at the age of 66, took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in the US. The duke has been facing questions over his ties to Epstein for several years. On Monday, Mr Kuvin told theToday programme: ""It was depressing that he [Prince Andrew] really did not acknowledge the breadth of his friendship with this despicable man and apologise. ""The mere fact that he was friends with a convicted sex offender and chose to continue his relationship with him - it just shows a lack of acknowledgement of the breadth of what this man [Epstein] did to these girls."" Prince Andrew said this meeting with Epstein in 2010 was to end their relationship In the interview with Newsnight, Prince Andrew - the Queen's third child - said he never suspected Epstein's criminal behaviour during visits to his three homes. But Mr Kuvin said he did ""not think there was any way"" the prince could have avoided seeing what was going on, ""with young girls being shuttled in and out of those homes"". Mr Kuvin said the focus of Epstein's accusers had now turned to potential co-conspirators. It has led to questions about the role Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, may have played in procuring underage girls for the financier. Ms Maxwell denies any wrongdoing. Lawyer Lisa Bloom - who represents five other Epstein accusers - joined the calls for Prince Andrew to be interviewed by US authorities following his BBC interview. She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""I think he's made things worse for himself in this interview and I think it's more likely the authorities are going to want to speak to him now - and they should want to."" Lawyer Lisa Bloom has also questioned why Prince Andrew did not apologise about his friendship with Epstein Gloria Allred - another lawyer, also representing one of Epstein's accusers - told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""Now he's been in the court of public opinion, he should testify to the FBI."" She said she did not know how the prince ""could have not known that there were underage girls"" present during his visits to Epstein's homes in New York, Palm Beach and the Virgin Islands. Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Meanwhile, Labour's shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, said Prince Andrew should do whatever he can to help Epstein's victims. He said: ""By saying what he knows of the time that he spent with his former friend, can only be the right thing to do."" In the Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew said he will testify under oath ""if push came to shove"" and his lawyers advised him to. It comes as the prince continues to face heavy criticism for the interview, which many royal commentators branded a PR disaster. University of Huddersfield students will discuss a motion to put pressure on the duke to resign as chancellor later. In response, the university said Prince Andrew's ""enthusiasm for innovation and entrepreneurship is a natural fit"" with its work. The duke was pictured with his accuser in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 In his BBC interview, Prince Andrew ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre, known at the time as Virginia Roberts. The first occasion, she said, took place when she was aged 17.

He says in the letter he has ""nothing in common with"" the Labour Party under its current leadership. Leicester East has selected a new candidate, Claudia Webbe, after Keith Vaz announced he would stand down in this election. Ms Webbe is currently a Councillor in the London Borough of Islington. Labour have been contacted for a response. Former journalist and Conservative peer, Baroness Wheatcroft, has said she is backing the Liberal Democrat candidate for the Cities of London and Westminster seat, Chuka Umunna. Baroness Wheatcroft told the London Evening Standard that she had previously always supported the Conservatives but could not do at this election. Earlier in the year, she spoke in the House of Lords, backing further referendum on EU membership and said the rich could be protected from Brexit by moving their money offshore. Mr Umunna resigned from the Labour Party at the beginning of the year to join a new Independent Group of MPs and then became a Liberal Democrat. Members of the House of Lords cannot vote in general elections. You can see the full list of candidates standing in the Cities of London and Westminster seat,here. Radio 4 PM Boris Johnson's relationship with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri was back in the spotlight today,after she accused him of ""ignoring and blocking"" her following the controversy. It is alleged that she received favourable treatment during Mr Johnson's time as mayor of London because of their friendship - claims they both deny. Asked whether he believes the pair had an affair, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says that is ""not my belief"". âJennifer herself has said today that there was
absolutely no issue around conflicts [of interest] and she won the business fair and square
when it came to being awarded the funding,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. âThe prime minister has said everything he needs to
say on this.â He adds that the issue is ""completely irrelevant to what people want to hear about"" during a general election campaign. Radio 4 PM One of the key moments of Boris Johnson's speech to the CBI earlier was when he announced thatplanned cuts to corporation tax would be put on hold. Asked why the decision was made, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says it is ""part of our focus on public services"". âI think Boris quite rightly wants to make sure the
investment is targeted towards the NHS,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. In his speech, Mr Johnson said the Â£6bn saved by the move would spent on the NHS and other services. However, the announcement does not mean any new money for the NHS, on top of the Â£20bn extra a year the Conservatives are promising to give it up to 2023. BBC News Channel Both Boris Johnson and Jo Swinson made pledges on business rates in their speeches at the CBI today, promising to reduce the tax burden on businesses. However, Chris Ireland, chief executive of international property
consultancy JLL, questions how significant the impact of these policies would be. On Mr Johnson's plans for a a review of business rates in England he says: ""Is that going to make a fundamental difference? Is that
going to be the saviour of the retail sector in isolation? I donât think so.â Mr Ireland is also sceptical about the Lib Dem leader's promise to scrap business rates altogether - replacing them with a levy paid by commercial landlords. He says this would simply pass the burden on to landowners. Radio 4 PM This morning Labour appeared to be backing away from its plan for net zero carbon emissions by 2030,which was approved at the party's conference. Instead, shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told the Today programme Labour was committed to ""a net zero economy well before 2050"". But shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald is now denying that Labour are abandoning the pledge. ""Weâve said consistently and we said it at conference
that weâll be working towards a path to net zero emissions by 2030 and that
remains the position,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. âIt hasnât moved one iota,"" he adds. However, he admits the target does ""present challenges and weâve got to make sure weâve got the skills and
infrastructure to do it"". Liberal Democrat President Sal Brinton describes the High Court ruling on ITV's election debate as ""incredibly disappointing"". Asked if the party will appeal against the decision, she says they will âhave to see the written
judgement"". However, she says the current system where broadcasters decide what they think is appropriate is ""not
transparent and it's not accountable"". ""There needs to be
legislation change,"" she adds. Liberal Democrat Layla Moran says it is ""outrageous"" a Remain voice is missing from the ITV debate. ""The court ruled against us. But the fight must continue,"" she says in a tweet. ""It's simply wrong of broadcasters to present a binary choice and preempt the decision of the people in a general election."" Reacting to the High Court decision, the SNP's Ian Blackford describes his party's exclusion from ITV's head-to-head election debate on Tuesday as ""a democratic disgrace"". ""The fact that election law and
broadcasting codes allow such gross unfairness is unacceptable,"" he adds. âThis election is a chance for
people in Scotland to vote to escape Brexit, to protect the NHS and to choose
their own future with independence â yet they will not hear that argument in
the debate tomorrow night,"" he says. âInstead, they will only hear
from the leaders of two parties who both want to pursue Brexit - taking
Scotland out of the EU against its will â who want to lock Scotland into the
union."" He argues that excluding the SNP leaves Scottish voters who voted in favour of independence and remaining in the EU ""completely ignored"". Mr Blackford repeats calls for decisions on TV debates to be made independently of politicians and broadcasters - and for Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn to commit to an all-party debate on 1 December. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent It
took the two judges just a matter of 10-to-15 minutes to reach a decision about
the claim from the Lib Dems and the SNP that they should be allowed access to ITV's head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. The
judges came back and said they would not agree to that â effectively they refused
to even hear the judicial review. They
said ITV was not exercising a public function - itâs a private broadcaster, albeit
regulated â and therefore could not be subject to a judicial review. But
they also said that if the two parties had a complaint about the programme,
they had a way of complaining to Ofcom, the regulator. Now
that can only be done after the programme is broadcast â but the judges said
that was a way the two parties could raise their objections. They
also said that the editorial judgement made by ITV was not irrational and
perverse and that they did not want, as judges, to get in the way of an editorial
matter for a major broadcaster. So the
debate goes ahead tomorrow. The full reasoning behind the judges' decision have yet to be given to the court - that will probably come tomorrow. The
Lib Dems, for one, are going to take a closer look before deciding what to do
next. BBC News Channel The SNP's Kirsty Blackman describes the judges' decision as ""hugely disappointing"". ""It is a bit ridiculous that a huge number of party values will not be represented at the debate tomorrow night,"" she says. Responding to the court's judgement on Twitter, the SNP says it is ""the third largest party in the UK, the governing party of Scotland, the main Remain voice in Scotland, the main voice advocating Scottish Independence"" and is ""likely to hold the balance of power in next Parliament"". ""Excluding [the] SNP from debates is ridiculous,"" the party adds. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent Two High Court judges, Lord Justice Davis and Mr
Justice Warby, said the case brought against ITV was not one in which the broadcaster could face a judicial
review because it was not exercising ""a public function"" in law when it set the format of the debate. They also said the Lib Dems
and SNP had the right to complain to broadcasting regulator Ofcom about the programme after it had
aired. ITV are set to hold a head-to-head election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday evening. However, lawyers for both the Lib Dems and SNP had argued that the full range of views on Brexit and Scottish independence would not be represented on the show. In court, the Lib Dem representative argued that Brexit was the ""dominant"" issue in the 12 December general election and that the ""voice of Remain has been excluded"" by ITV's decision not to include Ms Swinson. While SNP Lawyer Philip Coppel QC said: ""In the current, pluralistic political landscape it is simply not possible for a debate which only includes two parties to include 'all significant views'."" Two High Court judges have dismissed an attempt by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to force ITV to include their leaders in a TV debate to be broadcast tomorrow. And here's the CBI's take on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's speech. He promised huge investment, but also higher taxes for the richest and a programme of nationalisation of sectors like energy and water. Director Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said: ""It's time to see Labour open the door to real and lasting partnership with business, not stick with outdated ideologies that would close it in their face."" She said businesses shared ""many of the same ambitions"" as Labour on skills, climate change and ""making sure that the proceeds of growth are felt across the country"". ""The challenge is not what Labour want to achieve, it's how."" She welcomed ""greater flexibility"" on the apprenticeship levy  and ""a step up"" in vocational training - another key policy area championed by Mr Corbyn this morning, However, she said ""false instincts for mass nationalisations and forcing inclusive ownership schemes onto thriving businesses does little more than frighten off investors from backing the UK, with pensioners and savers having to foot the bill."" After it took centre stage for today's electioneering, the CBI has responded in turn to each of the leaders' speeches - and promises. Responding to Jo Swinson, director Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the Lib Dems recognised ""the broken business rates system needs fundamental reform"". However, she said the party's proposed solution - a commercial landowner levy - was ""mired in complexity"". ""It remains unclear how it would cut overall costs or provide a level playing field - much more detail will be needed,"" she added. Â© 2025 BBC.

Woman who inherited fatal disease sues NHSA woman is suing the NHS for not revealing her father's Huntington's disease before she had a child.,"A woman who was not informed that her father had a fatal, inherited brain disorder has told the High Court that she would have had an abortion if she'd known at the time of her pregnancy. She is suing three NHS trusts saying they owed a duty of care to tell her about her dad's Huntington's disease. Any child of someone with the condition has a 50% chance of inheriting it. Doctors suspected the diagnosis after her father killed her mother and was detained under the Mental Health Act. The father tested positive for Huntington's Disease, which is caused by a faulty gene and leads to the progressive loss of brain cells, affecting movement, mood and thinking skills.  It can also cause aggressive behaviour. He told doctors he did not want his daughter told about his diagnosis, fearing she might kill herself or have an abortion if she found out. The claimant is known as ABC in order to protect the identity of her own daughter, who is now nine. ABC only found out about that her father had Huntington's Disease, a progressive, incurable condition, four months after giving birth. The case is being heard in the Royal Courts of Justice in central London At the High Court she said she'd been told about her father's condition by accident. ""I was utterly traumatised by the way I was told"", she said. ""I had no family support and was left to Google the condition."" ABC eventually had a test and found that she also carries the faulty gene.  Her daughter, who's not been tested, has a 50:50 chance of inheriting it from her. The symptoms of Huntington's Disease usually appear between the ages of 30 and 50. ABC, who's now in her 40s, told the court:  ""I'm now the prime age to get unwell.  The future is absolutely terrifying."" She told the High Court that had she known during her pregnancy that she has the gene for Huntington's she would definitely have had an abortion. She is suing St George's and two other NHS Trusts involved in the family's care, for Â£345,000 in damages. St George's NHS trust operates hospitals and clinics in south-west London In written submissions Philip Havers QC on behalf of the trusts, said the question for the court was whether there was ""a duty to disclose to her confidential information about her father against his express wishes"" which he said was ""plainly not the case"". The court heard that after ABC had found out about her father's disorder, her sister also became pregnant. Philip Havers QC for the trusts said ABC had asked doctors not to tell her sister that their father had tested positive for Huntington's. Mr Havers said it was ""a bit rich"" for ABC to be bringing this claim for damages. He said she could have told her sister in time for her to have a termination, but that was what she was complaining about for herself. ABC said at the time, she'd been ""utterly terrified"" about the impact on her sister adding that the situation should have been managed by health professionals. About 8,500 people in the UK have Huntington's disease and a further 25,000 will develop it when they are older It is a rare inherited disorder that damages certain nerve cells in the brain Huntington's generally affects people in their prime - in their 30s and 40s - and patients die about 10 to 20 years after symptoms start Some patientsdescribe itas having Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and motor neurone disease rolled into one This video can not be played Two other sisters talk of dilemma over Huntington's disease test This case was first argued at the High Court in 2015 when a judge ruled that a full hearing should not go ahead. The judgement said there was ""no reasonably arguable duty of care"" owed to ABC. But in 2017, the Court of Appeal reversed that decision and said the case should go to trial. She is now suing St George's Healthcare NHS Trust in south-west London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust and Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust for damages. If ABC wins the case, it would trigger a major shift in the rules governing patient confidentiality, and raise questions over the potential duty of care owed to family members following genetic testing. A spokesperson for St George's Healthcare NHS Trust said: ""This case raises complex and sensitive issues in respect of the competing interests between the duty of care and the duty of confidentiality. ""It will be for the court to adjudicate on those issues during the trial."" The case continues.

'Do not ditch valued and recognised GCSEs',"GCSE performance across Wales improved this year, with 62.8% of pupils getting A*-C grades GCSEs should not be ditched as part of major reforms to the school curriculum in Wales, the exams watchdog has urged. Qualifications Wales is launching a consultation on the future of GCSEs and other qualifications taken by 16-year-olds. It said there would need to be changes to fit the reforms but the GCSE brand was ""valued and widely recognised"". The Future Generations Commissioner wantsGCSEs to be scrappedand a move to other forms of assessment. Qualifications are being looked at because of changes to the curriculum which will see a move from narrow subject areas to six areas of learning and experience. Q&A: Draft school curriculum for Wales Businesses urge more vocational focus GCSE exams: Should paper and pens be a thing of the past? The changes will be introduced in primary schools and Year 7, the first year of secondary school, in September 2022. The year 7 pupils will be the first to take qualifications under the new system, reaching 16 in 2026. The new curriculum for Wales will based be around six areas of learning Qualifications Wales says it believes there is still a strong case for having qualifications at 16 but they should evolve to meet the needs of young people, the economy and society. It is asking for views on its proposal to keep GCSEs as a central part of the qualifications offered to 16-year-olds. ""The GCSE name is well-established and offers a considerable degree of flexibility,"" it said. ""We believe that keeping the GCSE name enables us to make all the necessary changes to the design of qualifications, while also reaping the benefits of retaining a name that is valued and widely recognised,"" it added. The regulator believes developing an entirely new qualification could detract attention and resources from the new curriculum. But a discussion paper published last month by Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe said GCSEs were ""no longer fit for purpose"", and there was ""a strong rationale for their replacement with narrative based assessment that tells employers exactly what learners are all about"". The consultation also raises questions about the future of the Skills Challenge Certificate (SCC) which is the core element of the Welsh Baccalaureate. The regulator believes that the SCC provides a good basis for a new skills-based qualification, but leaves open the question of whether or how it would fit into the Welsh Baccalaureate Other proposals include streamlining the 1,600 qualifications currently available to 16-year-olds.

PM shelves business tax cut to help fund NHSBoris Johnson says plans to cut corporation tax to 17% next year are to be put on hold.,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson laid out his plans as he addressed the CBI conference Planned cuts to corporation tax next April are to be put on hold, Boris Johnson has said, with the money being spent on the NHS and other services. The rate paid by firms on their profits was due to fall from 19% to 17%. But the PM told business leaders it may cost the Treasury Â£6bn and this was better spent on ""national priorities"", including the health service. Labour said business ""handouts"" had done real damage and the Tories would ""revert to type"" after the election. The announcement does not mean any new money for the NHS, on top of the Â£20bn extra a year the Conservatives are promising to give it up to 2023. The BBC understands the cash will be used, in part, to fund existing pledges on GP training. With just over three weeks to go before the 12 December election, the leaders of the three largest parties in England have been parading their business credentials at the CBI conference. Live: Latest as party leaders address CBI Lib Dems and SNP lose ITV debate legal challenge Does cutting corporation tax always raise more money? Jeremy Corbyn said business had ""so much to gain"" from a Labour victory in terms of investment while Jo Swinson said the Liberal Democrats were the ""natural party of business"" because they wanted to cancel Brexit. Addressing the audience of top executives and entrepreneurs, Mr Johnson said they had ""created the wealth that actually pays for the NHS"". This video can not be played Sajid Javid: Tax cut reversal not a mistake Stressing his party's ""emphatic belief in fiscal prudence"", he said he had decided against going ahead with a further cut in corporation tax, a step first proposed by Chancellor George Osborne in 2016 to boost business in the wake of the Brexit referendum. Mr Johnson said the UK already had the lowest rate of corporation tax of ""any major economy"" and further cuts would be ""postponed"". ""Before you storm the stage, let me remind you that this saves Â£6bn that we can put into the priorities of the British people including the NHS,"" he told the audience. Corporation tax is an important revenue-raiser,making up approximately 9% of the UK government's total tax take,external. The amount raised by the tax has risen by two-thirds in the past decade, as the rate has fallen from 28% to 19% and economic conditions have improved. But many economists said the latest cut would be potentially counter-productive in terms of tax yields, with astudy based on HMRC data,externallast year suggesting it could mean Â£6bn a year in lost government revenues. In response, CBI director Carolyn Fairbairn said the move could ""work for the country if it is backed by further efforts to the costs of doing business and promote growth"". Blink and you might have missed it, but the PM has just announced the single biggest tax-raising measure of the campaign so far. The overnight headlines about Boris Johnson's CBI speech were about a Â£1bn cut to business taxes. It pays to read the small print. All together, this leaves an extra Â£5bn a year for the Conservative manifesto to deploy in extra spending or, as seems likely, some crowd-pleasing pre-election personal tax cuts. I'm told the corporation tax move was Chancellor Sajid Javid's idea, and was discussed during plans for his aborted Budget earlier this month. The PM also confirmed Mr Javid would remain in post if he wins the election next month. Cancelling the cut still leaves the UK with the lowest corporation tax rate in the G20, although not as low as Switzerland or Singapore. Given the government's argument has long been that cuts to corporation tax raise revenue, it is interesting to see the PM now say that cancelling cuts will also raise revenue. It is meant to show clear blue water between the Conservatives and Labour on fiscal credibility. In the event, there was barely a squeak out of the CBI audience about a significant multi-billion pound tax change. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Monday's freeze marked a ""temporary pause in the Tories' race to the bottom"" on business taxes. Allow Twitter content?

Huge wildfire 'doubled Scotland's emissions'The massive fire in the Flow Country in May doubled Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions while it burnt.,"The wildlife in the Flow Country burnt for six days in May A massive wildfire on peatland in the far north in May doubled Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions for the six days it burnt, a study has estimated. About 22 sq miles (5,700 hectares) of blanket bog in the Flow Country, which stretches across Caithness and Sutherland, was affected. The WWF Scotland study claimed 700,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent was released into the atmosphere as a result. That is similar to the amount released across the rest of Scotland. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, contribute to climate warming and are released by many activities such as energy supply, industrial processes, transport, heating and agriculture. The fire caused damage of thousands of acres The peatbog is a natural carbon store A satellite image of the Caithness fire on 16 May Peat bogs are an important natural store for carbon. The Flow Country, home to the largest continuous peatbog in Europe, is estimated to hold almost 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). The study, commissioned by environmental campaign group WWF, called for more government investment to protect and improve peat bogs. Head of policy Gina Hanrahan said: ""This analysis puts into stark figures the importance of our peatlands and the huge cost to climate and nature when something goes wrong."" The Flow Country peatbog is formed from layers of dead vegetation such a sphagnum moss The Flow Country peatbog is formed from layers of dead vegetation such a sphagnum moss. Because of the waterlogged conditions, the plants do not decompose which traps carbon in the peat soil. Experts say the quality of peatlands can play a significant role in minimising emissions in the event of a wildfire. Emma Goodyer, from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), said: ""Healthy peatlands are more resilient to fire. A great deal of peatland restoration work is being undertaken across the UK already with at least 150 projects carried out in Scotland. ""However, we need to increase the scale of funding available for peatland restoration if we are to urgently respond to the climate crisis and to increase the resilience of our peatlands."" RSPB staff helping to tackle flare-ups of the wildfire A Scottish government spokesman said restoring peatland had an important part to play in delivering climate change ambitions. He said the government was committed to delivering the peatland restoration targets set out in the Climate Change Plan. ""We are currently updating our Climate Change Plan which will set out detailed actions to deliver on our climate change ambitions,"" the spokesman said. The fire stretched from the outskirts of Melvich on the north coast to the village of Forsinard, about 15 miles further south. A long-term project is being carried out in the Flow Country to estimate the ecological impact of the fire. Measurements gathered before the fire give researchers a unique data set for understanding the way vegetation and water quality has changed.

"'Do not ditch valued and recognised GCSEs'The exams should be kept, says a watchdog, as the school curriculum in Wales heads for major reforms.WalesComments","GCSE performance across Wales improved this year, with 62.8% of pupils getting A*-C grades GCSEs should not be ditched as part of major reforms to the school curriculum in Wales, the exams watchdog has urged. Qualifications Wales is launching a consultation on the future of GCSEs and other qualifications taken by 16-year-olds. It said there would need to be changes to fit the reforms but the GCSE brand was ""valued and widely recognised"". The Future Generations Commissioner wantsGCSEs to be scrappedand a move to other forms of assessment. Qualifications are being looked at because of changes to the curriculum which will see a move from narrow subject areas to six areas of learning and experience. Q&A: Draft school curriculum for Wales Businesses urge more vocational focus GCSE exams: Should paper and pens be a thing of the past? The changes will be introduced in primary schools and Year 7, the first year of secondary school, in September 2022. The year 7 pupils will be the first to take qualifications under the new system, reaching 16 in 2026. The new curriculum for Wales will based be around six areas of learning Qualifications Wales says it believes there is still a strong case for having qualifications at 16 but they should evolve to meet the needs of young people, the economy and society. It is asking for views on its proposal to keep GCSEs as a central part of the qualifications offered to 16-year-olds. ""The GCSE name is well-established and offers a considerable degree of flexibility,"" it said. ""We believe that keeping the GCSE name enables us to make all the necessary changes to the design of qualifications, while also reaping the benefits of retaining a name that is valued and widely recognised,"" it added. The regulator believes developing an entirely new qualification could detract attention and resources from the new curriculum. But a discussion paper published last month by Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe said GCSEs were ""no longer fit for purpose"", and there was ""a strong rationale for their replacement with narrative based assessment that tells employers exactly what learners are all about"". The consultation also raises questions about the future of the Skills Challenge Certificate (SCC) which is the core element of the Welsh Baccalaureate. The regulator believes that the SCC provides a good basis for a new skills-based qualification, but leaves open the question of whether or how it would fit into the Welsh Baccalaureate Other proposals include streamlining the 1,600 qualifications currently available to 16-year-olds. GCSEs deemed 'not fit for purpose' Welsh history needed to teach 'our national story' Increase in school pupils getting top GCSE grades Q&A: Wales' new curriculum 'Focus more on practical courses', employers urge New curriculum 'gamble' for Wales Qualifications Wales Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Your Questions Answered: The election in Scotland,"With polling day fewer than four weeks away, our readers have been sending in questions on the election in Scotland. Here, we answer a selection about the politics north of the border. The SNP have had a lot to celebrate in recent elections There's nothing to stop theScottish National Partystanding for election elsewhere in the UK. But they never have. Their defining goal isindependence for Scotland, which they would want to be decided through a referendum in Scotland. When Nicola Sturgeon was asked in an interview whether the SNP would run a candidate in England, she joked that she was ""tempted"". The 2016 interview in theBig Issue reported the first minister as saying,external: ""There are a lot [of people] in England - a lot who contact me - who feel completely disenfranchised that there is nobody speaking up for them. Our London branch is booming at the moment."" The tongue-in-cheek comment prompted afurther article in the Guardian,external, where a party spokesperson confirmed the SNP remained ""firmly focused on working for Scotland"" and had ""no plans"" to field candidates anywhere else in the UK. The smallest constituency in the UK isIslington Northat 7.35 sq km (2.84 sq miles) - that seat has been held byLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn since 1983. Scotland's smallest is Glasgow North at 16.86 sq km (6.51 sq miles). The largest constituency in the UK is in Scotland. It's theRoss, Skye and Lochaber constituency- measuring approximately 12,000 sq km (4633.23 sq miles). A farmer on Harris, which is part of the Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles) constituency In population terms, the smallest constituency in the UK is in Scotland -26,830 people live in the Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles) constituency,external. By population,the UK's largest constituency is West Ham, in Greater London, where 188,275 people live,external. Scotland's largest constituency isLinlithgow and East Falkirk, which is home to 119,251 people,external. That's the number of people who live in each constituency - which is different to the number of people who are able to vote in each constituency. The average electorate in English constituencies is 72,200, but in Scotland it is 67,200. In Northern Ireland it's 68,300 and in Wales it is 56,000,according to the Office for National Statistics,external. In 2017, the parliamentary constituency with thesmallest-sized electorate in 2017 was Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles), at 21,200 and the largest electorate at 109,900 was the Isle of Wight,external. These unusual electoral sizes are explained by these being island constituencies - both areprotected constituencies,external. Along withOrkney and Shetland,these constituencies are defined solely by geography, and not the size of electorate. The existing UK parliamentary boundaries are based on electorate figures nearly 20 years old. The goal then was for most constituencies to be based around about 70,000 electors. Since then, natural population variations have resulted in the number of electors in each constituency changing. A polling place is the building within which polling stations are set up The Electoral Commission defines a polling place as a building within which polling stations will be set up. The polling station is the specific location within that polling place in which the voting takes place. This distinction applies across the UK. However, it seems that in Scotland the terms are used in line with their definitions, while in England polling station is used for everything. A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission in Scotland said: ""It's just a cultural thing that we tend to refer to them differently across the two countries"". In short, no. Independence for Scotland is the SNP's main priority. Scotland voted ""No"" to independence in 2014 but theSNP's manifesto for the 2016 Holyrood electionstated that another vote should be held if there was a ""material change of circumstance"", such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will. The SNP won that election. The following month in the Brexit vote theUK as a whole voted to leaveby 52% to 48% butScotland voted by 62% to 38% in favour of Remain. Nicola Sturgeon later announced she wanted to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence to protect Scottish interests in the wake of Brexit. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon addressed independence supporters at an indyref2 rally in Glasgow's George Square earlier this month Ms Sturgeon has saidshe wants to hold indyref2 in 2020. The Conservative and Liberal Democrat policy is tooppose a second referendum altogether, and Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour wouldoppose one being held before the next Holyrood election, which is due to take place in May 2021. So at the moment there is no clear path for the SNP to hold another referendum in the way they want to next year. More Your Questions Answered: Is my postal vote safe? General election 2019: Will this be a Brexit election? Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU A really simple guide to the general election More news explainers Campaigners want another referendum on Scottish independence The right to self-determination is an important principle in international law. It was enshrined inthe UN's founding document,external. The Oxford English Dictionary defines self-determination as: ""The action of a people in deciding its own form of government; free determination of statehood, postulated as a right."" The SNP position isScotland's future should be in Scotland's hands. For the 2014 vote, David Cameron and Alex Salmond, the then-leaders of the UK and Scottish governments, signed theEdinburgh Agreement,externalto give Holyrood the power to call the referendum. Both governments agreed that everyone entitled to vote in Scottish Parliamentary and local government elections in Scotland should be able to vote in the referendum, including EU citizens. It added that it was for the Scottish Parliament to decide whether to extend the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds, which it did. In theory, who would be allowed to vote in a further referendum on Scottish independence would be open to negotiations between the UK and Scottish governments. The Scottish government's position remains that it would be a decision to be taken by the people of Scotland as it was in 2014. Nicola Sturgeon is the SNP's leader and sits as a member of the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood. She is also Scotland's first minister - the leader of the Scottish government. She is not an MP and has no intention of becoming one and is therefore not up for election on 12 December. Scotland's First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon sits in the Scottish Parliament The leader of the Westminster parliamentary group of MPs for the SNP isIan Blackford. He will be contesting the Ross, Skye and Lochaber constituency. However, Ms Sturgeon's predecessor, Alex Salmond, did sit in the House of Commons while he was SNP leader.

Woman who inherited fatal disease sues NHSA woman is suing the NHS for not revealing her father's Huntington's disease before she had a child.Health,"A woman who was not informed that her father had a fatal, inherited brain disorder has told the High Court that she would have had an abortion if she'd known at the time of her pregnancy. She is suing three NHS trusts saying they owed a duty of care to tell her about her dad's Huntington's disease. Any child of someone with the condition has a 50% chance of inheriting it. Doctors suspected the diagnosis after her father killed her mother and was detained under the Mental Health Act. The father tested positive for Huntington's Disease, which is caused by a faulty gene and leads to the progressive loss of brain cells, affecting movement, mood and thinking skills.  It can also cause aggressive behaviour. He told doctors he did not want his daughter told about his diagnosis, fearing she might kill herself or have an abortion if she found out. The claimant is known as ABC in order to protect the identity of her own daughter, who is now nine. ABC only found out about that her father had Huntington's Disease, a progressive, incurable condition, four months after giving birth. The case is being heard in the Royal Courts of Justice in central London At the High Court she said she'd been told about her father's condition by accident. ""I was utterly traumatised by the way I was told"", she said. ""I had no family support and was left to Google the condition."" ABC eventually had a test and found that she also carries the faulty gene.  Her daughter, who's not been tested, has a 50:50 chance of inheriting it from her. The symptoms of Huntington's Disease usually appear between the ages of 30 and 50. ABC, who's now in her 40s, told the court:  ""I'm now the prime age to get unwell.  The future is absolutely terrifying."" She told the High Court that had she known during her pregnancy that she has the gene for Huntington's she would definitely have had an abortion. She is suing St George's and two other NHS Trusts involved in the family's care, for Â£345,000 in damages. St George's NHS trust operates hospitals and clinics in south-west London In written submissions Philip Havers QC on behalf of the trusts, said the question for the court was whether there was ""a duty to disclose to her confidential information about her father against his express wishes"" which he said was ""plainly not the case"". The court heard that after ABC had found out about her father's disorder, her sister also became pregnant. Philip Havers QC for the trusts said ABC had asked doctors not to tell her sister that their father had tested positive for Huntington's. Mr Havers said it was ""a bit rich"" for ABC to be bringing this claim for damages. He said she could have told her sister in time for her to have a termination, but that was what she was complaining about for herself. ABC said at the time, she'd been ""utterly terrified"" about the impact on her sister adding that the situation should have been managed by health professionals. About 8,500 people in the UK have Huntington's disease and a further 25,000 will develop it when they are older It is a rare inherited disorder that damages certain nerve cells in the brain Huntington's generally affects people in their prime - in their 30s and 40s - and patients die about 10 to 20 years after symptoms start Some patientsdescribe itas having Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and motor neurone disease rolled into one This video can not be played Two other sisters talk of dilemma over Huntington's disease test This case was first argued at the High Court in 2015 when a judge ruled that a full hearing should not go ahead. The judgement said there was ""no reasonably arguable duty of care"" owed to ABC. But in 2017, the Court of Appeal reversed that decision and said the case should go to trial. She is now suing St George's Healthcare NHS Trust in south-west London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust and Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust for damages. If ABC wins the case, it would trigger a major shift in the rules governing patient confidentiality, and raise questions over the potential duty of care owed to family members following genetic testing. A spokesperson for St George's Healthcare NHS Trust said: ""This case raises complex and sensitive issues in respect of the competing interests between the duty of care and the duty of confidentiality. ""It will be for the court to adjudicate on those issues during the trial."" The case continues.

Good grades and a desk 'key for university hopes',"Parents can help by creating a space for homework to be done Having a desk to work at, good grades and high expectations from parents, as well as being happy at school, are key factors in encouraging children to go on to university, a study suggests. Researchers in Croatia found these influences were more important than class size, school, average grades at the school or the wealth of an area. And they say this suggests schemes to raise aspirations should be targeted at an individual rather than school level. Thestudy,externalcovered over 1,000 pupils. Researchers from the Institute for Social Research, in Zagreb, asked 1,050 pupils aged 13, 14 and 15 at 23 schools in the city: whether they would like to continue to higher education about their parents' aspirations for them what level of academic support they received from each of their parents whether they had their own room, computer and desk whether they enjoyed school The researchers also gathered data on the pupils' academic grades, as well as on the size of each school and its classes, the average grade for each school and property prices in the local area. 'Too few' poor white university students Fees not university deterrent, says Hinds They found none of the school-level factors had any influence on the pupils' desire to continue to higher education. But several factors related to parents and home life did. Gender was also found to play a part, with the girls more likely than the boys to want to progress to university study. High academic grades, however, were the strongest predictor of the pupils' desire to continue to higher education. Enjoying school was also an important factor. The report says: ""The major finding arising from the present study is that none of the school level variables used in our analysis contributes to the explanation of pupils' aspirations for higher education. ""In other words, pupils who have similar individual characteristics but attend different schools will likely hold similar aspirations for higher education. ""An important finding arising from the present study is that parents can influence their child's aspirations by expressing their expectations regarding the child's educational path and by providing the basic conditions for completing homework and learning (ie a desk to work on). ""From an equal-opportunity standpoint, it is encouraging that parental employment and educational status did not predict pupils' aspirations."" But the researchers acknowledge the vast majority of parents in the research sample were employed and lived in Zagreb, which is the country's capital city and a university centre. ""It should be stressed that it is possible that different predictors would behave differently for pupils living in rural areas and smaller cities without higher education institutions, where lower socioeconomic status represents a greater obstacle for pursuing educational goals,"" they say.

Missing Leah Croucher's brother diesTheir father confirms the death of Haydon Croucher in an emotional post on Facebook.,"A Â£5,000 reward has been offered for information about Ms Croucher's disappearance The brother of missing woman Leah Croucher has died, their father has said. Ms Croucher, 20, was last seen in Milton Keynes on 15 February. In a Facebook post, her father John said he had spoken to his son Haydon on Thursday to reassure him, almost nine months after Leah's disappearance. He said the 24-year-old died hours later, after police arrived at his house to tell him his son was ""fighting for life."" Ms Croucher was last seen by her parents at their home in Quantock Crescent on the evening of 14 February. She told her family she was meeting a friend but police said the meeting did not happen. CCTV showed her walking about half a mile from her home at about 08:15 the next day. Leah's father John Croucher confirmed Haydon's death in a Facebook post Haydon had appeared in court earlier this year accused of making threats to a man he described as Leah's ex-boyfriend. He accepted a voluntary restraining order and the prosecution was dropped. Mr Croucher said he had arranged to meet up with his son on Friday so they could spend the day that marked nine months since Leah's disappearance together. He said his son was a ""kind, generous, funny, witty and loving person"". He added: ""Be at peace Haydon. If Leah is up there with you look after each other as always, until we get there.

Radio 4 PM Boris Johnson's relationship with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri was back in the spotlight today,after she accused him of ""ignoring and blocking"" her following the controversy. It is alleged that she received favourable treatment during Mr Johnson's time as mayor of London because of their friendship - claims they both deny. Asked whether he believes the pair had an affair, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says that is ""not my belief"". âJennifer herself has said today that there was
absolutely no issue around conflicts [of interest] and she won the business fair and square
when it came to being awarded the funding,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. âThe prime minister has said everything he needs to
say on this.â He adds that the issue is ""completely irrelevant to what people want to hear about"" during a general election campaign. Radio 4 PM One of the key moments of Boris Johnson's speech to the CBI earlier was when he announced thatplanned cuts to corporation tax would be put on hold. Asked why the decision was made, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says it is ""part of our focus on public services"". âI think Boris quite rightly wants to make sure the
investment is targeted towards the NHS,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. In his speech, Mr Johnson said the Â£6bn saved by the move would spent on the NHS and other services. However, the announcement does not mean any new money for the NHS, on top of the Â£20bn extra a year the Conservatives are promising to give it up to 2023. BBC News Channel Both Boris Johnson and Jo Swinson made pledges on business rates in their speeches at the CBI today, promising to reduce the tax burden on businesses. However, Chris Ireland, chief executive of international property
consultancy JLL, questions how significant the impact of these policies would be. On Mr Johnson's plans for a a review of business rates in England he says: ""Is that going to make a fundamental difference? Is that
going to be the saviour of the retail sector in isolation? I donât think so.â Mr Ireland is also sceptical about the Lib Dem leader's promise to scrap business rates altogether - replacing them with a levy paid by commercial landlords. He says this would simply pass the burden on to landowners. Radio 4 PM This morning Labour appeared to be backing away from its plan for net zero carbon emissions by 2030,which was approved at the party's conference. Instead, shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told the Today programme Labour was committed to ""a net zero economy well before 2050"". But shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald is now denying that Labour are abandoning the pledge. ""Weâve said consistently and we said it at conference

remains the position,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. âIt hasnât moved one iota,"" he adds. However, he admits the target does ""present challenges and weâve got to make sure weâve got the skills and
infrastructure to do it"". Liberal Democrat President Sal Brinton describes the High Court ruling on ITV's election debate as ""incredibly disappointing"". Asked if the party will appeal against the decision, she says they will âhave to see the written
judgement"". However, she says the current system where broadcasters decide what they think is appropriate is ""not
transparent and it's not accountable"". ""There needs to be
legislation change,"" she adds. Liberal Democrat Layla Moran says it is ""outrageous"" a Remain voice is missing from the ITV debate. ""The court ruled against us. But the fight must continue,"" she says in a tweet. ""It's simply wrong of broadcasters to present a binary choice and preempt the decision of the people in a general election."" Reacting to the High Court decision, the SNP's Ian Blackford describes his party's exclusion from ITV's head-to-head election debate on Tuesday as ""a democratic disgrace"". ""The fact that election law and
broadcasting codes allow such gross unfairness is unacceptable,"" he adds. âThis election is a chance for
people in Scotland to vote to escape Brexit, to protect the NHS and to choose
their own future with independence â yet they will not hear that argument in
the debate tomorrow night,"" he says. âInstead, they will only hear
from the leaders of two parties who both want to pursue Brexit - taking
Scotland out of the EU against its will â who want to lock Scotland into the
union."" He argues that excluding the SNP leaves Scottish voters who voted in favour of independence and remaining in the EU ""completely ignored"". Mr Blackford repeats calls for decisions on TV debates to be made independently of politicians and broadcasters - and for Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn to commit to an all-party debate on 1 December.

took the two judges just a matter of 10-to-15 minutes to reach a decision about
the claim from the Lib Dems and the SNP that they should be allowed access to ITV's head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. The
judges came back and said they would not agree to that â effectively they refused
to even hear the judicial review. They
said ITV was not exercising a public function - itâs a private broadcaster, albeit
regulated â and therefore could not be subject to a judicial review. But
they also said that if the two parties had a complaint about the programme,
they had a way of complaining to Ofcom, the regulator. Now
that can only be done after the programme is broadcast â but the judges said
that was a way the two parties could raise their objections. They
also said that the editorial judgement made by ITV was not irrational and
perverse and that they did not want, as judges, to get in the way of an editorial
matter for a major broadcaster. So the
debate goes ahead tomorrow. The full reasoning behind the judges' decision have yet to be given to the court - that will probably come tomorrow. The
Lib Dems, for one, are going to take a closer look before deciding what to do
next. BBC News Channel The SNP's Kirsty Blackman describes the judges' decision as ""hugely disappointing"". ""It is a bit ridiculous that a huge number of party values will not be represented at the debate tomorrow night,"" she says. Responding to the court's judgement on Twitter, the SNP says it is ""the third largest party in the UK, the governing party of Scotland, the main Remain voice in Scotland, the main voice advocating Scottish Independence"" and is ""likely to hold the balance of power in next Parliament"". ""Excluding [the] SNP from debates is ridiculous,"" the party adds. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent Two High Court judges, Lord Justice Davis and Mr
Justice Warby, said the case brought against ITV was not one in which the broadcaster could face a judicial
review because it was not exercising ""a public function"" in law when it set the format of the debate. They also said the Lib Dems
and SNP had the right to complain to broadcasting regulator Ofcom about the programme after it had
aired. ITV are set to hold a head-to-head election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday evening. However, lawyers for both the Lib Dems and SNP had argued that the full range of views on Brexit and Scottish independence would not be represented on the show. In court, the Lib Dem representative argued that Brexit was the ""dominant"" issue in the 12 December general election and that the ""voice of Remain has been excluded"" by ITV's decision not to include Ms Swinson. While SNP Lawyer Philip Coppel QC said: ""In the current, pluralistic political landscape it is simply not possible for a debate which only includes two parties to include 'all significant views'."" Two High Court judges have dismissed an attempt by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to force ITV to include their leaders in a TV debate to be broadcast tomorrow. And here's the CBI's take on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's speech. He promised huge investment, but also higher taxes for the richest and a programme of nationalisation of sectors like energy and water. Director Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said: ""It's time to see Labour open the door to real and lasting partnership with business, not stick with outdated ideologies that would close it in their face."" She said businesses shared ""many of the same ambitions"" as Labour on skills, climate change and ""making sure that the proceeds of growth are felt across the country"". ""The challenge is not what Labour want to achieve, it's how."" She welcomed ""greater flexibility"" on the apprenticeship levy  and ""a step up"" in vocational training - another key policy area championed by Mr Corbyn this morning, However, she said ""false instincts for mass nationalisations and forcing inclusive ownership schemes onto thriving businesses does little more than frighten off investors from backing the UK, with pensioners and savers having to foot the bill."" After it took centre stage for today's electioneering, the CBI has responded in turn to each of the leaders' speeches - and promises. Responding to Jo Swinson, director Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the Lib Dems recognised ""the broken business rates system needs fundamental reform"". However, she said the party's proposed solution - a commercial landowner levy - was ""mired in complexity"". ""It remains unclear how it would cut overall costs or provide a level playing field - much more detail will be needed,"" she added. Â© 2025 BBC.

Some pictures from today David Gauke and Amber Rudd out campaigning Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the CBI conference Jeremy Corbyn delivers his speech to the CBI conference Ian Blackford speaks after the High Court ruling that broadcasters cannot be forced to include parties in televised debates Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson speaks at the CBI conference The chair of Leicester East Labour Party, John Thomas, has said he is resigning from the Labour Party and has called Jeremy Corbyn ""a clown"". He says in the letter he has ""nothing in common with"" the Labour Party under its current leadership. Leicester East has selected a new candidate, Claudia Webbe, after Keith Vaz announced he would stand down in this election. Ms Webbe is currently a Councillor in the London Borough of Islington. Labour have been contacted for a response. Former journalist and Conservative peer, Baroness Wheatcroft, has said she is backing the Liberal Democrat candidate for the Cities of London and Westminster seat, Chuka Umunna. Baroness Wheatcroft told the London Evening Standard that she had previously always supported the Conservatives but could not do at this election. Earlier in the year, she spoke in the House of Lords, backing further referendum on EU membership and said the rich could be protected from Brexit by moving their money offshore. Mr Umunna resigned from the Labour Party at the beginning of the year to join a new Independent Group of MPs and then became a Liberal Democrat. Members of the House of Lords cannot vote in general elections. You can see the full list of candidates standing in the Cities of London and Westminster seat,here. Radio 4 PM Boris Johnson's relationship with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri was back in the spotlight today,after she accused him of ""ignoring and blocking"" her following the controversy. It is alleged that she received favourable treatment during Mr Johnson's time as mayor of London because of their friendship - claims they both deny. Asked whether he believes the pair had an affair, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says that is ""not my belief"". âJennifer herself has said today that there was
absolutely no issue around conflicts [of interest] and she won the business fair and square
when it came to being awarded the funding,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. âThe prime minister has said everything he needs to
say on this.â He adds that the issue is ""completely irrelevant to what people want to hear about"" during a general election campaign. Radio 4 PM One of the key moments of Boris Johnson's speech to the CBI earlier was when he announced thatplanned cuts to corporation tax would be put on hold. Asked why the decision was made, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says it is ""part of our focus on public services"". âI think Boris quite rightly wants to make sure the
investment is targeted towards the NHS,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. In his speech, Mr Johnson said the Â£6bn saved by the move would spent on the NHS and other services. However, the announcement does not mean any new money for the NHS, on top of the Â£20bn extra a year the Conservatives are promising to give it up to 2023. BBC News Channel Both Boris Johnson and Jo Swinson made pledges on business rates in their speeches at the CBI today, promising to reduce the tax burden on businesses. However, Chris Ireland, chief executive of international property
consultancy JLL, questions how significant the impact of these policies would be. On Mr Johnson's plans for a a review of business rates in England he says: ""Is that going to make a fundamental difference? Is that
going to be the saviour of the retail sector in isolation? I donât think so.â Mr Ireland is also sceptical about the Lib Dem leader's promise to scrap business rates altogether - replacing them with a levy paid by commercial landlords. He says this would simply pass the burden on to landowners. Radio 4 PM This morning Labour appeared to be backing away from its plan for net zero carbon emissions by 2030,which was approved at the party's conference. Instead, shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told the Today programme Labour was committed to ""a net zero economy well before 2050"". But shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald is now denying that Labour are abandoning the pledge. ""Weâve said consistently and we said it at conference
that weâll be working towards a path to net zero emissions by 2030 and that
remains the position,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. âIt hasnât moved one iota,"" he adds. However, he admits the target does ""present challenges and weâve got to make sure weâve got the skills and

Prince Andrew stands by 'car-crash' interview,"This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' The Duke of York stands by his decision to take part in an interview about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, sources have told the BBC. People close to Prince Andrew said he wanted to address the issues head-on and did so with ""honesty and humility"". It came after the prince's interview with BBC Newsnight on Saturday was described as a ""car crash"". In the interview, the prince denied having sex with a then 17-year-old girl - Virginia Giuffre. Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter described the interview as ""excruciating"". The BBC's royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the prince was ""very damaged"" by the interview and the opportunity to clear his name had ""failed, badly"". This video can not be played Mr Arbiter says ""questions will be asked"" in the palace about the decision Newsnight's Emily Maitlis said she understood the Queen herself had given her approval for the interview to go ahead. Writingin The Times newspaper,external, she said it seemed the Queen was ""on board"" for the interview, after Prince Andrew had sought approval from ""higher up"". For several months the Duke of York had been facing questions over his ties to Epstein - an American financier who, at the age of 66, took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. Prince Andrew ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre known at the time as Virginia Roberts. The first occasion, she said, took place when she was aged 17. A lawyer for some ofEpstein's alleged victimsurged the prince to talk under oath to the US authorities. Asked about the prince's decision to be interviewed by BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis, Mr Arbiter said he thought many questions would be asked in Buckingham Palace. He said: ""They will be wondering: Was this the right decision? Was the right decision made? Who made the decision to put him on? Did he make it himself or did he seek advice within the Palace? Prince Andrew 'categorically' denies sex claims Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew 'appalled' by Epstein abuse claims ""My guess is that he bulldozed his way in and decided he was going to do it himself without any advice. ""Any sensible-thinking person in the PR business would have thrown their hands up in horror at the very suggestion that he puts himself up in front of a television camera to explain away his actions and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein."" He added that the interview was ""not so much a car crash but an articulated lorry crash"". Mr Arbiter said he believed the interview would have an impact on the Duke of York's relationships with various charities. Ahead of Saturday's interview, Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Fergusonwrote of her support,externalfor him on social media. She said: ""I am deeply supportive and proud of this giant of a principled man, [who] dares to put his shoulder to the wind and stands firm with his sense of honour and truth."" But other royal experts also questioned the prince's decision to speak so publicly about his relationship with Epstein. Royal biographer Angela Levin said she was gripped by the interview but felt it was ""ill-judged"" to offer insights into his life with Epstein. ""Unfortunately it was a sign of his arrogance,"" she said. ""He has always been arrogant. ""The Queen's motto is don't complain don't explain. I think in her heart she will be extremely embarrassed. ""I know for a fact Prince Andrew does not listen to his advisers. ""A very senior member of the press team left suddenly two weeks ago and the implication is he would not have approved of what Prince Andrew did."" Prince Andrew said this meeting with Epstein in 2010 was to end their relationship Another royal biographer, Catharine Mayer, spent time with Prince Andrew in 2004 in China on a trade mission and said the interview was ""terrible because it erased the victims of Epstein"". ""It was as bad as I expected,"" she said. ""Probably worse. ""He did not mention those women once."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond said the interview reminded her of onePrincess Diana gave to Panorama in 1995where she ""spilled her soul"". Mrs Bond added that Princes Andrew's lack of remorse in his interview was a ""glaring hole"". Gloria Allred, who is representing some of the young women who say they were victims of Epstein, said ""there is so much truth that is yet to be revealed"". She added: ""I would say to Prince Andrew: the charges made by [Virginia Giuffre] against you are very, very serious charges. ""I think the right and honourable thing to do would be for you to say unequivocally 'I will voluntarily speak to the FBI, I know it is the right thing to do, I have nothing to hide'."" In the lengthy interview, which UK viewers can watch in full onBBC iPlayeror onYouTube,externalelsewhere in the world, the duke said that: On the date Virginia Giuffre says he had sex with her - 10 March, 2001, he had taken his daughter to Pizza Express in Woking for a party before spending the night at home He dismissed claims he was sweating profusely because he had a ""peculiar medical condition"" meaning he cannot sweat, caused by an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War He had commissioned investigations into whether a photograph of him with Ms Giuffre had been faked, but they were inconclusive Speaking out about his relationship with the financier had become almost ""a mental health issue"" for him He would testify under oath about his relationship with Ms Giuffre if ""push came to shove"", and his lawyers advised him to He was unaware of an arrest warrant against Epstein when he invited the financier to Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday party at Windsor Castle He did not regret his friendship with Epstein because of ""the opportunities I was given to learn"" from him about trade and business The duke was pictured with his accuser in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 ""Car crash"" and ""disaster"" are some of the kinder words that spring to mind about Prince Andrew's misbegotten foray into the long-form interview. The reaction of the press and commentators is withering. Social media is burning with mockery, ridicule and a fair amount of anger. To a fair number of people doubtful about the worth of the monarchy, Prince Andrew has emerged as an avatar of all that is wrong with the institution. There is a reason the Royals don't do 'no-holds-barred' interviews. Unsurprisingly, given that they live in Palaces and have servants, they are somewhat out of touch. Which is why Prince Andrew spoke of ""a straightforward shooting weekend"" and appeared to smirk at the idea of going for a pizza in Woking. Neglecting to even mention the victims of his friend Jeffrey Epstein compounded the impression of a man who entirely fails to grasp the spirit of the times. Defending his friendship with a convicted child sex offender on the grounds that he had met lots of interesting people because of him suggested a degree of self-absorption that would not survive exposure to the outside world. Who in his staff thought this interview would be a good idea and what does Prince Andrew do next? He is very damaged. The interview was an opportunity to clear his name and rescue his reputation.  It has failed, badly. Prince Andrew: 'No indication' about Epstein.

"Party leaders make election pitches to businessBoris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson will set out their positions on Brexit, tax and training.Election 2019Comments","This video can not be played Boris Johnson laid out his plans as he addressed the CBI conference Planned cuts to corporation tax next April are to be put on hold, Boris Johnson has said, with the money being spent on the NHS and other services. The rate paid by firms on their profits was due to fall from 19% to 17%. But the PM told business leaders it may cost the Treasury Â£6bn and this was better spent on ""national priorities"", including the health service. Labour said business ""handouts"" had done real damage and the Tories would ""revert to type"" after the election. The announcement does not mean any new money for the NHS, on top of the Â£20bn extra a year the Conservatives are promising to give it up to 2023. The BBC understands the cash will be used, in part, to fund existing pledges on GP training. With just over three weeks to go before the 12 December election, the leaders of the three largest parties in England have been parading their business credentials at the CBI conference. Live: Latest as party leaders address CBI Lib Dems and SNP lose ITV debate legal challenge Does cutting corporation tax always raise more money? Jeremy Corbyn said business had ""so much to gain"" from a Labour victory in terms of investment while Jo Swinson said the Liberal Democrats were the ""natural party of business"" because they wanted to cancel Brexit. Addressing the audience of top executives and entrepreneurs, Mr Johnson said they had ""created the wealth that actually pays for the NHS"". This video can not be played Sajid Javid: Tax cut reversal not a mistake Stressing his party's ""emphatic belief in fiscal prudence"", he said he had decided against going ahead with a further cut in corporation tax, a step first proposed by Chancellor George Osborne in 2016 to boost business in the wake of the Brexit referendum. Mr Johnson said the UK already had the lowest rate of corporation tax of ""any major economy"" and further cuts would be ""postponed"". ""Before you storm the stage, let me remind you that this saves Â£6bn that we can put into the priorities of the British people including the NHS,"" he told the audience. Corporation tax is an important revenue-raiser,making up approximately 9% of the UK government's total tax take,external. The amount raised by the tax has risen by two-thirds in the past decade, as the rate has fallen from 28% to 19% and economic conditions have improved. But many economists said the latest cut would be potentially counter-productive in terms of tax yields, with astudy based on HMRC data,externallast year suggesting it could mean Â£6bn a year in lost government revenues. In response, CBI director Carolyn Fairbairn said the move could ""work for the country if it is backed by further efforts to the costs of doing business and promote growth"". Blink and you might have missed it, but the PM has just announced the single biggest tax-raising measure of the campaign so far. The overnight headlines about Boris Johnson's CBI speech were about a Â£1bn cut to business taxes. It pays to read the small print. All together, this leaves an extra Â£5bn a year for the Conservative manifesto to deploy in extra spending or, as seems likely, some crowd-pleasing pre-election personal tax cuts. I'm told the corporation tax move was Chancellor Sajid Javid's idea, and was discussed during plans for his aborted Budget earlier this month. The PM also confirmed Mr Javid would remain in post if he wins the election next month. Cancelling the cut still leaves the UK with the lowest corporation tax rate in the G20, although not as low as Switzerland or Singapore. Given the government's argument has long been that cuts to corporation tax raise revenue, it is interesting to see the PM now say that cancelling cuts will also raise revenue. It is meant to show clear blue water between the Conservatives and Labour on fiscal credibility. In the event, there was barely a squeak out of the CBI audience about a significant multi-billion pound tax change. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Monday's freeze marked a ""temporary pause in the Tories' race to the bottom"" on business taxes. Allow Twitter content?

Labour's plan has been to raise corporation tax to 26% - the 2011 level - which it says will generate billions to be spent on its priorities, including health and education. Turning to Brexit, the Conservative leader told the conference that while big business did not want the UK to leave the EU, his withdrawal deal would provide the certainty ""that you want now and have wanted for some time"". CONFUSED?:Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote If elected with a Commons majority, Mr Johnson is hoping to get the agreement on the terms of the UK's exit into law by 31 January, and begin talks with Brussels on a permanent trading relationship. He also announced a review of business rates in England, with the aim of reducing the overall burden of the tax, as well as a cut in National Insurance contributions for employers, which already benefit from a reduction known as the employment allowance. In his address, Mr Corbyn said business had nothing to fear from a Labour government, arguing that while the richest would pay more, there would also be ""more investment than you have ever dreamt of"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I understand your concern over some of our plans"" He said he would ""make no apologies"" for the party's plan to take rail, mail, water and broadband delivery into public ownership, saying it was ""not an attack"" on the free market and would bring the UK in line with the continent. Business rates: My bill went from Â£560 to Â£7,760 Why does Labour want to give away free broadband? ""It is sometimes claimed I am anti-business,"" he said. ""This is nonsense. It is not nonsense to be against poverty pay. It is not nonsense to say the largest corporations should pay their taxes, just as small companies do. ""It is not anti-business to want prosperity in every part of the country."" This video can not be played Jo Swinson: ""Liberal Democrats would scrap business rates"" The Labour leader also set out plans to train about 320,000 apprentices in jobs such as construction, manufacturing and design within the renewable energy, transport and forestry sectors. Ms Fairbairn said the business community shared Labour's desire to increased investment but warned the opposition's ""massive instincts towards state intervention and ownership"" put that at risk. In her first address to the CBI as leader of her party, Ms Swinson said no-one claiming to want to ""get Brexit sorted"" was on the side of business, due to the negative impact she said it would have on investment and access to labour. ""With Boris Johnson in the pocket of Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn stuck in the 1970s, we are the only one standing up for you,"" she said. She said her party would go further than the others and replace ""crippling"" business rates with a levy paid by commercial landlords based on land value, which she suggested would help ""rescue the High Street"". Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who is not attending the CBI event, said politicians' focus should be on helping small business and promoting what he claimed were the advantages of a no-deal Brexit.

Rugby star's 'appalling' bushfire link draws angerIsrael Folau used a sermon to link Australia's bushfire crisis to same-sex marriage and abortion laws.Australia,"Folau was sacked by Rugby Australia earlier this year for his comments on gay people Rugby player Israel Folau has drawn anger for linking Australia's bushfire crisis to the nation's same-sex marriage and abortion laws. Folau, who was sacked by Australia in May for making anti-gay remarks on social media, described the fires as a ""little taste of God's judgement"". Six people have died since last month in blazes raging in eastern Australia. Prime Minister Scott Morrison condemned Folau's remarks as ""appallingly insensitive"". ""He is a free citizen, he can say whatever he likes but that doesn't mean he can't have regard to the grievance [and] offence this would have caused to the people whose homes have burnt down,"" Mr Morrison told reporters on Monday. Heatwave is forecast to spark new Australia fires Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? How you fight extreme wildfires Folau, who is Christian, gave a sermon in his Sydney church on Sunday in which he said Australia's decision to pass abortion and same-sex marriage laws had gone against ""God's word"", adding the nation needed to ""repent"". ""Look how rapid, these bushfires, these droughts, all these things have come, in a short period of time. You think it's a coincidence or not?,"" he said. His comments sparked outrage from many Australians online, who noted the widespread devastation of the fires. This video can not be played Warren Smith's home was destroyed in recent bushfires in Australia He was also criticised by high-profile local figures who had previously supported him. ""Israel, button up,"" said broadcaster Alan Jones on his radio show on Monday. ""These comments don't help."" Rugby star sacked for anti-gay post Folau 'entitled to day in court' Rugby Australia (RA) sacked the former Wallabies player in May after he said on social media that ""hell awaits"" gay people. The 30-year-old fullback has been widely condemned for those comments and others targeting transgender people, but he has also received vocal support from Christian groups. Folau is suing RA over his dismissal, claiming his contract was unlawfully terminated due to his religious beliefs. Rugby Australia has stood by its decision to sack Folau, saying he breached a players' code of conduct. He was previously one of the nation's highest-paid athletes.

Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words,"Clashes between police and protesters have grown increasingly violent Anti-government protests have rocked Hong Kong for months and the situation shows no sign of dying down. Here's all the background you need to know in 100 or 500 words - you can read each individually or in turn. Hong Kong's protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Critics feared this could undermine judicial independence and endanger dissidents. Until 1997, Hong Kong was ruled by Britain as a colony but then returned to China. Under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, it has some autonomy, and its people more rights. The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continue and now demand full democracy and an inquiry into police actions. Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs. The extradition bill which triggered the first protest was introduced in April. It would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China under certain circumstances. Opponents said this risked exposing Hongkongers to unfair trials and violent treatment. They also argued the bill would give China greater influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and journalists. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. After weeks of protests, leader Carrie Lam eventually said the bill would be suspended indefinitely. Protesters feared the bill could be revived, so demonstrations continued, calling for it to be withdrawn completely. By then clashes between police and protesters had become more frequent and violent. In September,the bill was finally withdrawn, but protesters said this was ""too little, too late"". On 1 October, while China was celebrating 70 years of Communist Party rule,Hong Kong experienced one of its most ""violent and chaotic days"". An 18-year-old was shot in the chest with a live bullet as protesters fought officers with poles, petrol bombs and other projectiles. The government thenbanned protesters wearing face masks, and in early Novembera pro-Beijing lawmaker was stabbedin the street by a man pretending to be a supporter. One week later,a policeman shot one protesterat close range when activists were trying to set up a road block. Later that day another man was set on fire by anti-government protesters. In November, a standoff between police and students barricaded on the campus of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University becameanother defining moment. Later that month, the territory held local council elections that were seen as a barometer of public opinion. The vote saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. Some protesters have adopted the motto: ""Five demands, not one less!"" These are: For the protests not to be characterised as a ""riot"" Amnesty for arrested protesters An independent inquiry into alleged police brutality Implementation of complete universal suffrage The fifth demand, the withdrawal of the bill, has already been met. Protests supporting the Hong Kong movement have spread across the globe, with rallies taking place in the UK, France, US, Canada and Australia. In many cases, people supporting the demonstrators were confronted by pro-Beijing rallies. Chinese president Xi Jinping has warned against separatism, saying any attempt to divide China would end in ""bodies smashed and bones ground to powder"". Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997. It has its own judiciary and a separate legal system from mainland China. Those rights include freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

Joey D'Urso and Marianna Spring from BBC Trending talk about the latest developments in digital campaigning. And Jeremy Vine calls in from Belfast. Watch the latest episode here. Some pictures from today David Gauke and Amber Rudd out campaigning Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the CBI conference Jeremy Corbyn delivers his speech to the CBI conference Ian Blackford speaks after the High Court ruling that broadcasters cannot be forced to include parties in televised debates Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson speaks at the CBI conference The chair of Leicester East Labour Party, John Thomas, has said he is resigning from the Labour Party and has called Jeremy Corbyn ""a clown"". He says in the letter he has ""nothing in common with"" the Labour Party under its current leadership. Leicester East has selected a new candidate, Claudia Webbe, after Keith Vaz announced he would stand down in this election. Ms Webbe is currently a Councillor in the London Borough of Islington. Labour have been contacted for a response. Former journalist and Conservative peer, Baroness Wheatcroft, has said she is backing the Liberal Democrat candidate for the Cities of London and Westminster seat, Chuka Umunna. Baroness Wheatcroft told the London Evening Standard that she had previously always supported the Conservatives but could not do at this election. Earlier in the year, she spoke in the House of Lords, backing further referendum on EU membership and said the rich could be protected from Brexit by moving their money offshore. Mr Umunna resigned from the Labour Party at the beginning of the year to join a new Independent Group of MPs and then became a Liberal Democrat. Members of the House of Lords cannot vote in general elections. You can see the full list of candidates standing in the Cities of London and Westminster seat,here. Radio 4 PM Boris Johnson's relationship with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri was back in the spotlight today,after she accused him of ""ignoring and blocking"" her following the controversy. It is alleged that she received favourable treatment during Mr Johnson's time as mayor of London because of their friendship - claims they both deny. Asked whether he believes the pair had an affair, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says that is ""not my belief"". âJennifer herself has said today that there was
absolutely no issue around conflicts [of interest] and she won the business fair and square
when it came to being awarded the funding,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. âThe prime minister has said everything he needs to
say on this.â He adds that the issue is ""completely irrelevant to what people want to hear about"" during a general election campaign. Radio 4 PM One of the key moments of Boris Johnson's speech to the CBI earlier was when he announced thatplanned cuts to corporation tax would be put on hold. Asked why the decision was made, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says it is ""part of our focus on public services"". âI think Boris quite rightly wants to make sure the
investment is targeted towards the NHS,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. In his speech, Mr Johnson said the Â£6bn saved by the move would spent on the NHS and other services. However, the announcement does not mean any new money for the NHS, on top of the Â£20bn extra a year the Conservatives are promising to give it up to 2023. BBC News Channel Both Boris Johnson and Jo Swinson made pledges on business rates in their speeches at the CBI today, promising to reduce the tax burden on businesses. However, Chris Ireland, chief executive of international property
consultancy JLL, questions how significant the impact of these policies would be. On Mr Johnson's plans for a a review of business rates in England he says: ""Is that going to make a fundamental difference? Is that
going to be the saviour of the retail sector in isolation? I donât think so.â Mr Ireland is also sceptical about the Lib Dem leader's promise to scrap business rates altogether - replacing them with a levy paid by commercial landlords. He says this would simply pass the burden on to landowners. Radio 4 PM This morning Labour appeared to be backing away from its plan for net zero carbon emissions by 2030,which was approved at the party's conference. Instead, shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told the Today programme Labour was committed to ""a net zero economy well before 2050"". But shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald is now denying that Labour are abandoning the pledge. ""Weâve said consistently and we said it at conference
that weâll be working towards a path to net zero emissions by 2030 and that
remains the position,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. âIt hasnât moved one iota,"" he adds. However, he admits the target does ""present challenges and weâve got to make sure weâve got the skills and
infrastructure to do it"". Liberal Democrat President Sal Brinton describes the High Court ruling on ITV's election debate as ""incredibly disappointing"". Asked if the party will appeal against the decision, she says they will âhave to see the written
judgement"". However, she says the current system where broadcasters decide what they think is appropriate is ""not
transparent and it's not accountable"". ""There needs to be
legislation change,"" she adds. Liberal Democrat Layla Moran says it is ""outrageous"" a Remain voice is missing from the ITV debate. ""The court ruled against us. But the fight must continue,"" she says in a tweet. ""It's simply wrong of broadcasters to present a binary choice and preempt the decision of the people in a general election."" Reacting to the High Court decision, the SNP's Ian Blackford describes his party's exclusion from ITV's head-to-head election debate on Tuesday as ""a democratic disgrace"". ""The fact that election law and
broadcasting codes allow such gross unfairness is unacceptable,"" he adds. âThis election is a chance for
people in Scotland to vote to escape Brexit, to protect the NHS and to choose
their own future with independence â yet they will not hear that argument in
the debate tomorrow night,"" he says. âInstead, they will only hear
from the leaders of two parties who both want to pursue Brexit - taking
Scotland out of the EU against its will â who want to lock Scotland into the
union."" He argues that excluding the SNP leaves Scottish voters who voted in favour of independence and remaining in the EU ""completely ignored"". Mr Blackford repeats calls for decisions on TV debates to be made independently of politicians and broadcasters - and for Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn to commit to an all-party debate on 1 December. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent It
took the two judges just a matter of 10-to-15 minutes to reach a decision about
the claim from the Lib Dems and the SNP that they should be allowed access to ITV's head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. The
judges came back and said they would not agree to that â effectively they refused
to even hear the judicial review. They
said ITV was not exercising a public function - itâs a private broadcaster, albeit
regulated â and therefore could not be subject to a judicial review. But
they also said that if the two parties had a complaint about the programme,
they had a way of complaining to Ofcom, the regulator. Now
that can only be done after the programme is broadcast â but the judges said
that was a way the two parties could raise their objections. They
also said that the editorial judgement made by ITV was not irrational and
perverse and that they did not want, as judges, to get in the way of an editorial
matter for a major broadcaster. So the
debate goes ahead tomorrow. The full reasoning behind the judges' decision have yet to be given to the court - that will probably come tomorrow. The
Lib Dems, for one, are going to take a closer look before deciding what to do
next. BBC News Channel The SNP's Kirsty Blackman describes the judges' decision as ""hugely disappointing"". ""It is a bit ridiculous that a huge number of party values will not be represented at the debate tomorrow night,"" she says. Responding to the court's judgement on Twitter, the SNP says it is ""the third largest party in the UK, the governing party of Scotland, the main Remain voice in Scotland, the main voice advocating Scottish Independence"" and is ""likely to hold the balance of power in next Parliament"". ""Excluding [the] SNP from debates is ridiculous,"" the party adds. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent Two High Court judges, Lord Justice Davis and Mr
Justice Warby, said the case brought against ITV was not one in which the broadcaster could face a judicial
review because it was not exercising ""a public function"" in law when it set the format of the debate. They also said the Lib Dems
and SNP had the right to complain to broadcasting regulator Ofcom about the programme after it had
aired. ITV are set to hold a head-to-head election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday evening. However, lawyers for both the Lib Dems and SNP had argued that the full range of views on Brexit and Scottish independence would not be represented on the show. In court, the Lib Dem representative argued that Brexit was the ""dominant"" issue in the 12 December general election and that the ""voice of Remain has been excluded"" by ITV's decision not to include Ms Swinson. While SNP Lawyer Philip Coppel QC said: ""In the current, pluralistic political landscape it is simply not possible for a debate which only includes two parties to include 'all significant views'."" Two High Court judges have dismissed an attempt by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to force ITV to include their leaders in a TV debate to be broadcast tomorrow. And here's the CBI's take on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's speech. He promised huge investment, but also higher taxes for the richest and a programme of nationalisation of sectors like energy and water. Director Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said: ""It's time to see Labour open the door to real and lasting partnership with business, not stick with outdated ideologies that would close it in their face."" She said businesses shared ""many of the same ambitions"" as Labour on skills, climate change and ""making sure that the proceeds of growth are felt across the country"". ""The challenge is not what Labour want to achieve, it's how."" She welcomed ""greater flexibility"" on the apprenticeship levy  and ""a step up"" in vocational training - another key policy area championed by Mr Corbyn this morning, However, she said ""false instincts for mass nationalisations and forcing inclusive ownership schemes onto thriving businesses does little more than frighten off investors from backing the UK, with pensioners and savers having to foot the bill."" After it took centre stage for today's electioneering, the CBI has responded in turn to each of the leaders' speeches - and promises. Responding to Jo Swinson, director Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the Lib Dems recognised ""the broken business rates system needs fundamental reform"". However, she said the party's proposed solution - a commercial landowner levy - was ""mired in complexity"". ""It remains unclear how it would cut overall costs or provide a level playing field - much more detail will be needed,"" she added. Â© 2025 BBC.

Lib Dems and SNP in court over election TV debateThe Lib Dems and SNP say it is unfair to be excluded from Tuesday's ITV general election leaders debate.Election 2019,"Lib Dem chairman Sal Brinton said their exclusion was ""shameful"" and SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said he hoped ""sense prevails"" The views of voters who want to remain in the EU will be excluded if the Lib Dems and SNP are not part of ITV's election debate, a court has heard. Lawyers for both parties told London's High Court that their views on Brexit would not be represented on the show. The head-to-head between Conservative leader Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is on Tuesday. ITV lawyers told the court the debate would be cancelled if the ruling - due after 16:00 GMT - went against them. An interview with Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, due to follow the head-to-head, would also be pulled, they said. Meanwhile, the Lib Dems have sent a legal letter to the BBC over its decision not to include Ms Swinson in a debate on 6 December. SNP to take legal action over ITV election debate Lib Dems launch legal action over ITV debate Johnson and Corbyn to face off in live BBC debate When are the general election TV debates? In court, lawyers for the Liberal Democrats argued that Brexit was the ""dominant"" issue in the 12 December general election and that the ""voice of Remain has been excluded"" by ITV's decision not to include Ms Swinson. Guy Vassall-Adams QC said the decision not to include the party was unlawful because it ""breaches the duty of impartiality and the requirement to give due weight to a wide range of significant views"". ""The dominant issue of this election campaign is Brexit, which is on any view a matter of major political controversy and current public policy,"" he told the court. ""In the first national TV debate of the campaign it is essential that a wide, balanced range of views on Brexit is represented."" He said this had ""serious consequences for the fairness of the democratic process"". The Liberal Democrats want leader Jo Swinson to be included in the debate Mr Vassall-Adams also argued there was evidence that TV debates ""are very influential with voters"", saying the programme ""will attract millions of viewers"". Lawyers for the SNP - which lodged a separate legal challenge last week - said the party represented views, including on Brexit and Scottish independence, that would not be represented in a debate between Labour and the Conservatives. Philip Coppel QC said: ""Prior to 2010 it may have been the case that a debate between the Labour and the Conservative leaders would cover the full range of significant views in a general election. ""That was, arguably, a time when those parties encompassed the spectrum of mainstream political opinion. ""That is no longer the case. In the current, pluralistic political landscape it is simply not possible for a debate which only includes two parties to include 'all significant views'."" ITV lawyers argued there was no basis for alleging any unlawful conduct on the part of the broadcaster.

The Liberal Democrats have also criticised the BBC's plan for a live head-to-head between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn on Friday, 6 December, because Ms Swinson is not taking part. The party's lawyers have sent a letter to the BBC's director general Tony Hall, saying the exclusion of Ms Swinson is ""clearly unlawful"". ""It also means that viewers will be denied the opportunity to hear the fresh and distinct perspective that the Liberal Democrats bring on the dominant issue of this election, namely Brexit,"" the letter said. The BBC declined to comment on the letter. The broadcaster will hostthe live head-to-head debate between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbynin Southampton on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. And BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

Labour dismiss anti-Semitism referral,"Maria Carroll said she had not seen the relevant social media posts and would have ""immediately condemned them"" The Labour Party has said it will not investigate a Welsh general election candidate's alleged role in a Facebook group with links to anti-Semitic comments. Maria Carroll was referred to the party by Welsh Labour following reports in theMail on Sunday,external. UK Labour has said Ms Carroll had not been accused of making anti-Semitic comments. She said she had not seen the relevant social media posts. Corbyn plan to speed up anti-Semitism expulsions A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Labour shadow minister denies anti-Semitic lyric Ms Carroll, the Welsh Labour candidate for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, added that she would have ""immediately condemned them"" had she seen the comments. The Facebook group, whose contents are only available to group members, was reportedly set-up in order to advise Labour members subject to internal party disciplinary investigation on how to defend themselves. Ms Carroll said: ""I joined that group when left wing members were being suspended from the Labour Party en masse to prevent them from voting in the 2016 Labour leadership election, for incidents as small as retweeting [former Green Party leader] Caroline Lucas. ""When the group took an anti-Semitic conspiratorial direction I left it."" Labour's former Peterborough Council candidate, Alan Bull, was reportedly a member of the closed Facebook group. He withdrew as a candidate afteracknowledging it was a ""bad mistake"" to share an article on Facebookin 2015 which suggested the Holocaust was a hoax. Ms Carroll said she did not see the ""horrific social media posts"" by Alan Bull as ""these posts were not made in the group"" she was in. She added: ""I've been an outspoken critic of anti-Semitism in our party, including calling out anti-Semitic abuse towards [former Labour MP] Luciana Berger and anti-Semitism denialism within our party. ""I've been blocked by anti-Semitic accounts as a result."" Welsh Labour became aware of the accusations against Maria Carroll after being approached by the Mail on Sunday on Friday night. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the party in Wales acted ""immediately"" over the concerns In a statement on Sunday, Welsh Labour leader and first minister, Mark Drakeford said: ""I am of course concerned of reports on the actions taken by Maria Carroll. ""Welsh Labour acted immediately and referred these matters to the Governance and Legal Unit of the UK Labour Party for investigation. ""I have consistently made it clear that anti-Semitism has no place in our party or in Wales,"" he added. UK Labour has since told BBC Wales it will not be investigating Ms Carroll as she did not make anti-Semitic comments herself. A source said the party centrally had not received any complaints about Ms Carroll. But in a statement on Sunday evening, Fiona Sharpe from Labour Against Antisemitism, attacked the party's stance. ""We call on senior figures within Welsh Labour, including First Minister Mark Drakeford, to demand that a full investigation be carried out immediately and urge Ms Carroll to step down ahead of the general election,"" she said.

"Prince Andrew stands by 'car-crash' interviewPeople close to him say he addressed his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ""head-on"".UK","This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' The Duke of York stands by his decision to take part in an interview about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, sources have told the BBC. People close to Prince Andrew said he wanted to address the issues head-on and did so with ""honesty and humility"". It came after the prince's interview with BBC Newsnight on Saturday was described as a ""car crash"". In the interview, the prince denied having sex with a then 17-year-old girl - Virginia Giuffre. Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter described the interview as ""excruciating"". The BBC's royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the prince was ""very damaged"" by the interview and the opportunity to clear his name had ""failed, badly"". This video can not be played Mr Arbiter says ""questions will be asked"" in the palace about the decision Newsnight's Emily Maitlis said she understood the Queen herself had given her approval for the interview to go ahead. Writingin The Times newspaper,external, she said it seemed the Queen was ""on board"" for the interview, after Prince Andrew had sought approval from ""higher up"". For several months the Duke of York had been facing questions over his ties to Epstein - an American financier who, at the age of 66, took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. Prince Andrew ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre known at the time as Virginia Roberts. The first occasion, she said, took place when she was aged 17. A lawyer for some ofEpstein's alleged victimsurged the prince to talk under oath to the US authorities. Asked about the prince's decision to be interviewed by BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis, Mr Arbiter said he thought many questions would be asked in Buckingham Palace. He said: ""They will be wondering: Was this the right decision? Was the right decision made? Who made the decision to put him on? Did he make it himself or did he seek advice within the Palace? Prince Andrew 'categorically' denies sex claims Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew 'appalled' by Epstein abuse claims ""My guess is that he bulldozed his way in and decided he was going to do it himself without any advice. ""Any sensible-thinking person in the PR business would have thrown their hands up in horror at the very suggestion that he puts himself up in front of a television camera to explain away his actions and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein."" He added that the interview was ""not so much a car crash but an articulated lorry crash"". Mr Arbiter said he believed the interview would have an impact on the Duke of York's relationships with various charities. Ahead of Saturday's interview, Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Fergusonwrote of her support,externalfor him on social media. She said: ""I am deeply supportive and proud of this giant of a principled man, [who] dares to put his shoulder to the wind and stands firm with his sense of honour and truth."" But other royal experts also questioned the prince's decision to speak so publicly about his relationship with Epstein. Royal biographer Angela Levin said she was gripped by the interview but felt it was ""ill-judged"" to offer insights into his life with Epstein. ""Unfortunately it was a sign of his arrogance,"" she said. ""He has always been arrogant. ""The Queen's motto is don't complain don't explain. I think in her heart she will be extremely embarrassed. ""I know for a fact Prince Andrew does not listen to his advisers. ""A very senior member of the press team left suddenly two weeks ago and the implication is he would not have approved of what Prince Andrew did."" Prince Andrew said this meeting with Epstein in 2010 was to end their relationship Another royal biographer, Catharine Mayer, spent time with Prince Andrew in 2004 in China on a trade mission and said the interview was ""terrible because it erased the victims of Epstein"". ""It was as bad as I expected,"" she said. ""Probably worse. ""He did not mention those women once."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond said the interview reminded her of onePrincess Diana gave to Panorama in 1995where she ""spilled her soul"". Mrs Bond added that Princes Andrew's lack of remorse in his interview was a ""glaring hole"". Gloria Allred, who is representing some of the young women who say they were victims of Epstein, said ""there is so much truth that is yet to be revealed"". She added: ""I would say to Prince Andrew: the charges made by [Virginia Giuffre] against you are very, very serious charges. ""I think the right and honourable thing to do would be for you to say unequivocally 'I will voluntarily speak to the FBI, I know it is the right thing to do, I have nothing to hide'."" In the lengthy interview, which UK viewers can watch in full onBBC iPlayeror onYouTube,externalelsewhere in the world, the duke said that: On the date Virginia Giuffre says he had sex with her - 10 March, 2001, he had taken his daughter to Pizza Express in Woking for a party before spending the night at home He dismissed claims he was sweating profusely because he had a ""peculiar medical condition"" meaning he cannot sweat, caused by an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War He had commissioned investigations into whether a photograph of him with Ms Giuffre had been faked, but they were inconclusive Speaking out about his relationship with the financier had become almost ""a mental health issue"" for him He would testify under oath about his relationship with Ms Giuffre if ""push came to shove"", and his lawyers advised him to He was unaware of an arrest warrant against Epstein when he invited the financier to Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday party at Windsor Castle He did not regret his friendship with Epstein because of ""the opportunities I was given to learn"" from him about trade and business The duke was pictured with his accuser in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 ""Car crash"" and ""disaster"" are some of the kinder words that spring to mind about Prince Andrew's misbegotten foray into the long-form interview. The reaction of the press and commentators is withering. Social media is burning with mockery, ridicule and a fair amount of anger. To a fair number of people doubtful about the worth of the monarchy, Prince Andrew has emerged as an avatar of all that is wrong with the institution. There is a reason the Royals don't do 'no-holds-barred' interviews. Unsurprisingly, given that they live in Palaces and have servants, they are somewhat out of touch. Which is why Prince Andrew spoke of ""a straightforward shooting weekend"" and appeared to smirk at the idea of going for a pizza in Woking. Neglecting to even mention the victims of his friend Jeffrey Epstein compounded the impression of a man who entirely fails to grasp the spirit of the times. Defending his friendship with a convicted child sex offender on the grounds that he had met lots of interesting people because of him suggested a degree of self-absorption that would not survive exposure to the outside world. Who in his staff thought this interview would be a good idea and what does Prince Andrew do next? He is very damaged. The interview was an opportunity to clear his name and rescue his reputation.

Hong Kong police in fiery stand-off at university,"This video can not be played Police tear gas met with petrol bombs A stand-off at a Hong Kong university campus has led to fiery clashes overnight, as hundreds of protesters tried to repel a police advance. Large fires broke out at entrances to the Polytechnic University (PolyU), where protesters hurled petrol bombs and shot arrows from behind barricades. Officers earlier warned they could use live ammunition if protesters did not stop attacking them using such weapons. Months of anti-government protests have caused turmoil in the city. The latest violence is some of the worst the semi-autonomous Chinese territory has seen since the movement began. The police have become targets for radical demonstrators, who accuse them of excessive force. Demonstrators have been occupying the PolyU for days. Fresh clashes erupted on Sunday, with tear gas and water cannon being met with petrol bombs, bricks and other improvised weapons. A police media liaison officer was wounded in the leg with an arrow on Sunday. The protests explained in 100 and 500 words The context to Hong Kong protests Timeline of Hong Kong unrest How is Hong Kong run? The protesters occupying the university had been told to leave immediately on Sunday evening but hundreds remained inside. Sporadic battles continued throughout the night, with police making a push to re-take the campus at about 05:30 local time (21:30 GMT). They were met with petrol bombs, which started blazes around the campus. Later, some protesters tried to leave the campus but were met with tear gas and retreated. This video can not be played Protesters around Hong Kong Polytechnic University have armed themselves with an array of weapons ""I hereby warn rioters not to use petrol bombs, arrows, cars or any deadly weapons to attack police officers,"" police spokesman Louis Lau said in a statement broadcast via Facebook late on Sunday. ""If they continue such dangerous actions, we would have no choice but to use the minimum force necessary, including live rounds, to fire back."" Earlier in the stand-off, police fired a live round in response to what they said was a car hurtling towards officers near the university. By the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Polytechnic University, at 04:00 Hong Kong time It's only the most radical left now - or the bravest, depending on your point of view. About a hundred of them are hunkered down at a junction outside the main entrance. On the other side of the road: an armoured police vehicle, and a water cannon truck. Every 10 minutes or so, these two sides play a game of cat and mouse. The police fire tear gas and the water cannon advances, squirting noxious blue liquid. The protesters, crouching behind umbrellas, respond with petrol bombs and rocks fired from improvised catapults. The police vehicles retreat. The net result is zero. It's a stalemate. There are several hundred more protesters milling around the campus. Medics treat those who have been hit by tear gas or the blue liquid in the water cannon, which stings on contact with the skin. Others man barricades at the many entrances to this sprawling campus which is now completely surrounded. When the police announced a 22:00 deadline for the protesters to surrender or face the possibility of lethal force a significant number changed out of their black outfits, ditched their masks, and disappeared into the night. Some were arrested but others escaped. Those who remain seem determined to fight to the end, no matter the risk. ""If I die, remember me,"" one young man said to me. ""Do you believe that could happen?"" I asked. He gave a nervous shrug. The protests in Hong Kong, which began in June, were triggered by a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China but have since expanded into wider demands for greater democracy and for investigations into the actions of police. The government recently confirmedthe city had entered its first recession for a decade. In recent days, Hong Kong's university campuses have been the scenes of pitched battles between police and demonstrators. A police truck on a bridge above the Cross Harbour tunnel, which links Kowloon and Hong Kong island, was set on fire on Sunday and it was forced to retreat by large crowds of protesters hiding behind umbrellas and hurling petrol bombs. Fires raged around the campus on Monday morning Protesters have been holding a bridge above the Cross Harbour tunnel In a statement the university hadurged those occupying the campus to leave.,external ""Universities are venues for advancing knowledge and nurturing talents. Universities are not battlegrounds for political disputes and should not be drawn into violent confrontations,"" it said. Protesters armed with bows and arrows have been seen on the PolyU campus The officer was struck in the leg close to the Hong Kong Polytechnic University On Saturday, in a move that sparked controversy, Chinese soldiers in shorts and T-shirts took to the streets to help clean up debris and remove barricades. It was the first time since the protests erupted that Chinese soldiers, who very rarely leave their barracks in Hong Kong, had taken to the streets. This video can not be played In a rare move, Chinese soldiers left their barracks on Saturday to help clean up Hong Kong's streets Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"".

Police surround HK campus after night of violence,"This video can not be played These protesters attempting to leave PolyU met with tear gas Several protesters have been arrested while trying to run from a Hong Kong university campus surrounded by police. Around 100 people tried to leave the Polytechnic University, but were met with tear gas and rubber bullets. In the past week, the campus has turned into a battleground as long-running anti-government protests become more violent. A small number managed to successfully leave the campus using rope ladders before being picked up by motorcycles. Hong Kong's Hospital Authority says 116 people have been injured and taken to hospital. The violence is some of the worst seen during months of unrest in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. The protests started over a controversial extradition bill, and have now evolved into broader anti-government demonstrations. China has warned that ""no-one should underestimate [its] will to safeguard its sovereignty and Hong Kong's stability"", and its ambassador to the UK said the central government would not sit back and watch if the situation became ""uncontrollable"". Timeline of unrest How is Hong Kong run? Protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong is a part of China, and the protests are, in part, about the fear that the special freedoms the territory enjoys as a former British colony are being eroded. Earlier, Hong Kong's High Court ruled that a ban on protesters wearing face masks was unconstitutional. The colonial-era emergency law was invoked in October, but protesters largely defied it. Hong Kong's government saidthe weekend's events had ""reduced the chance"" of district elections being held on Sunday,externalas planned, public broadcaster RTHK reports. Postponing or cancelling the vote could further inflame the protests. The UK has urged an ""end to the violence and for all sides to engage in meaningful political dialogue"" ahead of the elections. Police are still besieging the university where several hundred protesters are thought to be trapped. Officers have ordered those inside to drop their weapons and surrender. A protester inside the university told the BBC supplies, including first aid equipment, were running low. Meanwhile, a fire broke out on campus and loud explosions were heard, according to the South China Morning Post. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

PolyU has been occupied by protesters for several days. On Sunday night, police warned protesters they had until 22:00 (14:00 GMT) to leave the campus, saying they could use live ammunition if the attacks continued. On Sunday, the university said it had been""severely and extensively vandalised"",external. A number of protesters left inside in the university have identified themselves as current students in media interviews but it is unclear exactly how many of them are, in fact, university students. By Grace Tsoi, BBCNews, Hong Kong Worried parents whose children were trapped inside the Polytechnic University were among the 200 protesters who joined a peaceful rally on Monday night in eastern Tsim Sha Tsui, a tourist area which is only 300 metres away from the besieged campus. Ms Ng - who only wanted to be identified by her last name - found out on Sunday night her son was among those trapped inside. ""He's frightened because he has not faced any emergency situation on his own. She has been on the streets near the university since then. The teary-eyed mother is proud of her 18-year-old son despite the circumstances. ""My son didn't cry. He's strong and likes to help others,"" she said. ""I told my son that you did nothing wrong and you are an outstanding kid. I wouldn't blame you."" She told him to stay inside the campus and wait for her to pick him up. Ms Ng said the government should bear the responsibility for the chaos in Hong Kong. ""Our government is more and more reckless. It ignores the very lowly demands from the citizens!"" she said. ""I wasn't born in Hong Kong but I love Hong Kong so much! Hong Kong is a wonderful place but it has turned into such a state. It breaks my heart!"" Campuses remained relatively free of violence during the Hong Kong protests but, last week,the Chinese University of Hong Kong became a battleground. Police say protesters threw petrol bombs on a major road near the university in an effort to stop traffic. Officers attempted to reclaim the road, leading to major clashes. A protester arrested while trying to leave the campus The university then cancelled all classes for the rest of the term. Days later, protesters at PolyU also tried to block access to a key tunnel near the university. Protests have also been held at other locations in Hong Kong. Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, it has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China.

The protests explained in 100 and 500 words,"Clashes between police and protesters have grown increasingly violent Anti-government protests have rocked Hong Kong for months and the situation shows no sign of dying down. Here's all the background you need to know in 100 or 500 words - you can read each individually or in turn. Hong Kong's protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Critics feared this could undermine judicial independence and endanger dissidents. Until 1997, Hong Kong was ruled by Britain as a colony but then returned to China. Under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, it has some autonomy, and its people more rights. The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continue and now demand full democracy and an inquiry into police actions. Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs. The extradition bill which triggered the first protest was introduced in April. It would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China under certain circumstances. Opponents said this risked exposing Hongkongers to unfair trials and violent treatment. They also argued the bill would give China greater influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and journalists. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. After weeks of protests, leader Carrie Lam eventually said the bill would be suspended indefinitely. Protesters feared the bill could be revived, so demonstrations continued, calling for it to be withdrawn completely. By then clashes between police and protesters had become more frequent and violent. In September,the bill was finally withdrawn, but protesters said this was ""too little, too late"". On 1 October, while China was celebrating 70 years of Communist Party rule,Hong Kong experienced one of its most ""violent and chaotic days"". An 18-year-old was shot in the chest with a live bullet as protesters fought officers with poles, petrol bombs and other projectiles. The government thenbanned protesters wearing face masks, and in early Novembera pro-Beijing lawmaker was stabbedin the street by a man pretending to be a supporter. One week later,a policeman shot one protesterat close range when activists were trying to set up a road block. Later that day another man was set on fire by anti-government protesters. In November, a standoff between police and students barricaded on the campus of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University becameanother defining moment. Later that month, the territory held local council elections that were seen as a barometer of public opinion. The vote saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. Some protesters have adopted the motto: ""Five demands, not one less!"" These are: For the protests not to be characterised as a ""riot"" Amnesty for arrested protesters An independent inquiry into alleged police brutality Implementation of complete universal suffrage The fifth demand, the withdrawal of the bill, has already been met. Protests supporting the Hong Kong movement have spread across the globe, with rallies taking place in the UK, France, US, Canada and Australia. In many cases, people supporting the demonstrators were confronted by pro-Beijing rallies. Chinese president Xi Jinping has warned against separatism, saying any attempt to divide China would end in ""bodies smashed and bones ground to powder"". Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997. It has its own judiciary and a separate legal system from mainland China. Those rights include freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

'I was tear gassed getting my lunch',"The protests have raged for months - but now expat workers are looking to leave the financial hub ""I've been tear gassed a few times, but never when I was outside my office - popping out to get my lunch,"" says one trader at HSBC. He is describing the moment this week when Hong Kong's protests came to the central financial district , one of the world's biggest commercial hubs. He says it was a watershed moment, that's made him and many of his peers question their future in the city. Speaking to the BBC under condition of anonymity, directors at some of the biggest international banks and law firms said they are seeing their business in Hong Kong shrink as the protests continue to escalate. Financial services make up a fifth of Hong Kong's economy and people come from all over the world to live and work here. Its large expatriate community is attracted by the low taxes, well-paid jobs, stability and high standards of living. Hong Kong pushed to 'brink of total collapse' Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words 'Appalling' attack on HK envoy in UK angers China However, the lure of prosperity and stability in the East Asian hub has been undermined substantially since Hong Kong has been racked by five months of anti-government protests, backing increased democracy and opposing the actions of the police. This video can not be played In a rare move, Chinese soldiers left their barracks on Saturday to help clean up Hong Kong's streets This last week where violence has intensified has made many firms reconsider the safety of their staff in the city. One hedge fund manager has even been given a panic button app in case of an emergency and plans are in place with his work to evacuate him and his family to another major city ""if we were in danger they have a team of people who would get us out"". A banker at HSBC says only half of their staff came in to the office on Friday as people are encouraged to work remotely if they can't get in safely. Staff are kept closely informed about the situation on the ground according to a BNP Paribas employee ""We get regular emails early in the morning and through the day from the business continuity management team - telling us whether it's safe to go into offices - and whether we should go home early."" Anecdotally, the political pressure from the Chinese government on banks and law firms is also growing - and it's putting pressure on staff. Some partners in law firms are being asked to pin their colours to the mast and state whether they support the protesters or the Chinese government before winning business from Chinese firms. Police have faced off with protesters alarmed at growing influence from Beijing Firms are under pressure to keep a lid on their staff speaking in public about their views. One lawyer explains ""I've been on calls where people are asked to verbally communicate restraint and caution when sharing their views. Given the amount of people we employ here, it's a minor miracle nothing has happened"". In the workplace, people are making informal rules not to discuss the subject within their teams because emotions are running so high. ""Clearly it's the only topic of conversation in the office, but opinions are so split,"" one banker says. ""In my team of nine, three are Chinese and two are Hong Kong Chinese and the rest are expats - it's a bit like Brexit - we all have violently different views."" A video on social media of a man who claims to work at Citigroup being arrested by police has been widely shared in the banking community. ""This has scared people here - it makes you feel we could all get caught up in this"" A spokesperson for the US-headquartered banking group said: ""We are investigating this incident and while investigations continue it would be inappropriate to comment further"". The issue of democracy in Hong Kong is fraught One of the biggest concerns for financial firms is the impact all of this is having on the economy as its reputation for stability unravels. A source at one of the world's biggest international banks says it expects its Hong Kong revenue to be down by 25% in the last quarter of their financial year as a result of the violence. Many banks are now reviewing their investment plans in Hong Kong over the next few years ""If we're still talking about this in six months time, people will start giving up on Hong Kong"" They are concerned that people who are planning major deals will now turn to banks and law firms in Singapore because, in the words of one, ""it has a more predictable medium-term outlook"". Hong Kong has long been a financial services hub in Asia So far most of the business impact has been on small companies - restaurants for example.  There is concern amongst bankers, borne out in recent economic statistics, that this could spread more widely. ""The classic company we deal with would be lending money to a Chinese shipping company that does its financial transactions through HK. They rely on a healthy business environment in Hong Kong. Now we worry they will go bankrupt"". Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong in first recession for a decade What's happening in Hong Kong?

Hong Kong in first recession for a decade,"Anti-government protests in Hong Kong started five months ago Hong Kong has confirmed it has entered its first recession for a decade as it continues to be gripped by protests. Its economy shrank 3.2% in the July-to-September period compared with the prior quarter, figures showed, confirming earlier preliminary data. It means the economy has contracted for two quarters in a row, which is the usual definition of a recession. Tourists are staying away and shops are suffering amid battles between anti-government protesters and police. ""Domestic demand worsened significantly in the third quarter, as the local social incidents took a heavy toll on consumption-related activities and subdued economic prospects weighed on consumption and investment sentiment,"" the government said in a statement. It now expects the economy to shrink 1.3% for the full year. ""Ending violence and restoring calm are pivotal to the recovery of the economy. The government will continue to closely monitor the situation and introduce measures as necessary to support enterprises and safeguard,"" the government added. Man dies after being hit during HK protests Hong Kong protests hit Burberry and Cathay Pacific The Hong Kong protests explained Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this bill would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the police, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing. Protests have taken place every weekend over the past few months, causing widespread disruption and a number of deaths. On Thursday, a 70-year-old cleaner died after he was hit in the head during a protest in the Hong Kong border town of Sheung Shui. Video purported to be of the incident shows two groups throwing bricks at each other before the man falls to the ground after being struck on the head. Burberry says it has seen a ""double digit"" percentage decline in sales in Hong Kong Dramatic scenes such as these have kept tourists away. In August, arrivals to the city - a popular travel destination and transit hub - hit their worst level since the SARS crisis of 2003. Some hotels have slashed prices as they struggle to fill their rooms. On Thursday, two companies with major operations in Hong Kong revealed the financial impact of the protests. Luxury fashion house Burberry said its sales in Hong Kong had fallen by more than 10% and would ""remain under pressure"". Airline Cathay Pacific cut its profit guidance and said the civil unrest had ""been exceptionally challenging, severely impacting demand and operations of the business"". This week has seen a marked escalation in violence with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities and lunchtime protests in the financial heart of Hong Kong. It is the first time in weeks that protests have taken place during weekdays.

Alex Chow had been in hospital since he fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation a week ago. Later on Monday, violence escalated further when a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet and a pro-government supporter was set on fire by protesters. In London, Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng was hurt after being jostled by anti-government protesters, the Chinese embassy said. Ms Cheng is seen as having played a key role in promoting the unpopular extradition bill that triggered the protests. China strongly condemned the incident and called for a thorough investigation.
