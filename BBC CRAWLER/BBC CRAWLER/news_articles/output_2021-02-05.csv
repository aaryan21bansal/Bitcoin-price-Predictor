Johnson and Macron discuss Covid-19 collaboration,"Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron have discussed co-operation in the global fight against Covid-19 in their first conversation since a vaccine row. No 10 said the two leaders agreed that collaboration between governments was vital in defeating coronavirus. They also discussed cross-channel relations amid continuing tensions over the UK's post-Brexit arrangements. The EU withdrew its threat last week to restrict vaccine exports to Northern Ireland after an outcry in the UK. But the dispute, prompted by concerns on the continent over the slow rollout of vaccinations, intensified calls for the post-Brexit rules governing trade between Britain and Northern Ireland to be reviewed. Unionists in Northern Ireland have urged Mr Johnson to scrap the Northern Ireland protocol, part of the 2020 Brexit Withdrawal Agreement which effectively leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market and customs territory and which critics say has created a damaging border down the Irish Sea. EU 'made a mistake' over Covid vaccines, Gove says What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? EU shellfish import ban indefinite, industry told The French president was criticised last week for questioning the effectiveness of the Astra-Zeneca/Oxford vaccine among over-65s and suggesting exports of vaccines produced on the continent should be controlled amid shortages there and the slow pace of rollout compared with the UK. In a statement, Downing Street said the two men had discussed a wide range of subjects over the phone, including the Cop-26 climate summit taking place in the UK later this year, Russia and Iran. On vaccines, No 10 said Mr Johnson emphasised the ""important role world leaders will play in ensuring that vaccines are rolled out effectively so that we can defeat the pandemic"". ""The leaders agreed that a successful global vaccination programme will require a collaborative effort between governments,"" it added. Downing Street said Mr Johnson had expressed his desire to deepen Anglo-French co-operation now that the UK was fully outside the EU and to take advantage of the ""huge opportunities"" for joint working. Mr Macron has said he continues to believe the UK's departure from the EU is an ""error"", telling journalists last week that ""it has made things much more difficult in many ways"".

Climate crisis deaths 'will be worse than Covid',"Mark Carney headed the Bank of England for nearly seven years, up to March 2020 The world is heading for mortality rates equivalent to the Covid crisis every year by mid-century unless action is taken, according to Mark Carney. The former central banker said the investment needed to avert millions of deaths was double current rates. But with governments ploughing billions into keeping economies afloat, a question mark hangs over whether the recovery will be green enough. The answer lies in smarter investment, Mr Carney said. Mr Carney, who was the Bank of England governor up until last year, and the head of the Bank of Canada before that, is now the United Nations envoy for climate action and finance. Can coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery? Biden's climate agenda: An end to fossil fuels? What is Mark Carney's Bank of England legacy? He told the BBC that while there were parallels between the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change, damage to the environment and ecosystems has the potential to cause many more deaths. ""One of the biggest issues is you cannot self-isolate from climate,"" he said. ""That is not an option. We cannot retreat in and wait out climate change, it will just get worse,"" he told Talking Business Asia: The Climate Change Challenge. ""When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event. So it is an issue that needs to be addressed now."" But governments pouring trillions of dollars into stimulus plans to rescue their ailing economies are mainly addressing job losses and the economic damage inflicted from lockdowns. Very little of that cash is heading towards reducing carbon emissions, although emissions have fallen in the past year because people aren't travelling as much. Mr Carney, who is tasked with persuading policymakers, chief executives, bankers and investors to focus on the environment, said: ""The scale of investment in energy, sustainable energy and sustainable infrastructure needs to double. ""Every year, for the course of the next three decades, $3.5 trillion (Â£2.5tn) a year, for 30 years. It is an enormous investment opportunity."" He said the answer lies in a global pot of $170tn of private capital which, he says, ""is looking for disclosure"". Banks, investment funds and individuals increasingly want to know how their money will be used. It is not just about disclosing the carbon position of companies, he says, but ""where it's going to go tomorrow in order to make these kinds of investment and lending decisions"". That pot is bigger than the total economic output of the world for a year, he said. ""The issue is about putting that money to work."" China is part of the solution to lowering carbon emissions Mr Carney said that as the US returns to the world stage in the battle against climate change, there's renewed momentum to the issue, especially as last year China, the world's largest polluter,aimed to become carbon neutral by 2060. Although China continues to build coal-fired power plants, and draws about 70% of its power from fossil fuel, the country is a crucial part of the solution. ""There clearly are issues in terms of coal in China, and the sooner China moves on that, the better for them and for the world. ""But China also produces 60% of the global solar photovoltaic panels. It is also the largest producer of electric vehicles. So China has many sides to this."" The US has the ""largest and most sophisticated financial sector"" along with the ""engineering and technological expertise"" to get to net zero emissions, he said. Biden signs orders on 'existential' climate crisis 'Exceptionally hot' 2020 concludes warmest decade Part of his role at the UN is to tap into this financial sector. It is the ""power of money"" that will ultimately play the biggest role in combating climate change, he said. ""We're getting the system in a position where, whether it's a bank, or somebody who's investing a small amount of savings in the market, or your pension, they can choose [how it is invested]. ""They have the information and they can choose to be part of the solution, transitioning to net zero, or be part of the problem.""

Secret network messages can be evidence - judges,"An attempt to stop prosecutors using messages from hundreds of phones that were part of the Encrochat secret communications network in court has been rejected by the Appeal Court. Judges ruled the messages, obtained by French police by hacking the phones, were not gained by ""interception"". Under British law, evidence from interception cannot be used in court. The National Crime Agency believes Encrochat was mainly used by criminals, often to trade drugs and guns. The judgement will have major implications for cases against suspected organised criminals around the country. Due to legal restrictions, it is the first time the BBC can report the detail of arguments surrounding Encrochat,which was penetrated by police last summer resulting in more than 1,000 arrests. The NCA, which obtained the evidence from France, said it was the biggest breakthrough ever in the fight against organised crime. Hundreds arrested as crime chat network cracked Haulier ran Europe-wide drug ring from living room Drugs boss captured as police crack coded messages Senior officers described it ""as akin to cracking the enigma code"". The messages, sent by suspects who did not know they were being monitored, detail alleged drug dealing and murder plots, and include images and videos. Many of the cases based on ""Encro"" evidence are now going to court, and if this judgement had ruled the messages couldn't be used, some trials may have been abandoned. Under long-standing British law, designed to protect intelligence techniques from scrutiny and make criminal trials manageable, intercepted evidence can't be used in court. In 2016, Parliament passed theInvestigatory Powers Act,externalin amassive overhaulof surveillance law.The act introduced a ""double lock""that requires interception warrants to be authorised by a secretary of state and approved by a judge. In a 2015 factsheet on the bill before it became law,,externalthe Home Office defined interception as ""making available the content of a communication to someone other than the sender or intended recipient during the course of its transmission. In practice that means listening to a phone call or reading an email"". But the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, Lord Justice Edis, and Mrs Justice Whipple dismissed an appeal by lawyers for Encrochat defendants. The key legal argument centred on a piece of ""malware"" placed by French experts on Encrochat phones worldwide. It sent copies of every message to a police server. France has refused to say how, what it called ""the implant"", worked, creating legal uncertainty in British courts. Encrochat was a private messaging service that promised its users secure and secretive communications. As well as the Encrochat messaging app, the company developed a modified version of the Android operating system and sold altered smartphones known as ""carbon units"" to run its software. Switched on by pressing just the power button, the phones would load a ""dummy"" Android homescreen. But activated another way they would boot into Encrochat mode. Getting hold of an Encrochat phone was not cheap, and the subscription charges were more than Â£200 a month. Messages sent between handsetswere end-to-end encrypted: scrambled as they travelled across the internet, making them practically impossible to decode if intercepted. But in June 2020, the company warned its users that an attack had comprised its handsets and advised them to ""physically dispose of your device immediately"". If the implant had collected the messages as they were being transmitted, this would amount to interception of the communications. The defence lawyers claimed the implant was taking messages from the phones' memory, milliseconds before being sent to their wifi or mobile data transmitters and therefore the data was ""in transmission"". But the judges decided the data was in fact being stored temporarily on the devices as it was processed, before being transmitted. They said this was evident because during the actual transmission the message were encrypted, and therefore couldn't have been read, as they were by the police. The data collected also included crucial username information from the phone's storage memory, which is not sent as part of the transmission. In Friday's judgement they compared the process with that of sending a letter: ""The process involves the letter being written, put in an envelope, a stamp being attached and then the letter being placed in the post box. ""Only the last act involves the letter being transmitted by a system, but all the acts are essential to that transmission."" This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Symonds is shown how a customised Android phone with EncroChat installed works Families of those arrested during the fall-out from the Encrochat penetration have been arguing online that the NCA broke the law by accessing and reading messages ""in real time"", as they were being sent. They say British law enforcement agencies effectively allowed a foreign power, France, to hack the phones of 9,000 UK Encrochat users. Police claimed that in general, using an Encrochat phone, which cost thousands of pounds to own and operate, demonstrated a likely involvement in criminal activity. But suspects' supporters say innocent family members were caught up in a race to make use of the Encro messages, because police feared they would be criticised if they were not seen to take action. However the decision of the Appeal Court was that the evidence was collected lawfully.

Romania baptism death sparks calls for change,"Calls for reform could lead to a split in Romania's Orthodox Church The death of a six-week-old baby hours after a baptism ceremony in Romania has prompted an Orthodox archbishop to say such rituals will be analysed to avoid further tragedy. The baby had a cardiac arrest after he was immersed three times in holy water. He had a violent death and liquid was found in his lungs, an autopsy found. Some 60,000 people have signed a petition calling for change. Archbishop Calinic is the most senior member of the clergy to back reform. He told Romanian website Adevarul that he believed in the future the practice of immersing a baby would be reviewed and ""the most appropriate decision taken to respect [Church] ordinances and carefully avoid unwanted accidents"". A manslaughter inquiry has been opened by prosecutors into the priest who carried out the baptism in the north-eastern city of Suceava. By Stephen McGrath, Romania If the baby's death leads to reform in the way baptism rituals are carried out then it would cause a rift within Romania's Orthodox Church. Because while some Church figures have suggested an inclination toward change, others have been clear about wanting to keep this archaic ritual of immersing the baby's head into water. Eminence Calinic, the Archbishop of Arges, is the most prominent voice so far who appears open to change. ""In other icons, Jesus stands in the water up to his neck, and with his head bowed he receives baptism by pouring water over the top of his head,"" he was quoted as saying. The Archbishop of Tomis, however, took a more belligerent stance. ""We will never change the ritual. The canons of this religion have been in place for over 1,000 years,"" he said. ""That is why we won't change. We are not intimidated."" Romania's powerful Orthodox Church is not known for reform, but this baptism tragedy may lead to change. Archbishop Calinic himself recently conducted the high-profile baptism of the daughter of the former prince Nicholas of Romania and said in his interview that while immersion in holy water was appropriate for adults, other ways were available. When he was a priest years ago in Transylvania, he said he would dip a baby's feet into holy water and sprinkle its head. The petition calling for reform had attracted 60,000 signatures by Friday. The man behind it, Vladimir Dumitru, said baptisms had to be regulated to prevent unnecessary risks and the petition was aimed at being moderate and constructive. The Orthodox Church in Romania is widely respected, but it has already come under scrutiny for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. In March last year, as Romanians were about to go into lockdown, priests in the northern city of Cluj gave communion using one shared spoon among a large group of worshippers.

Thanks for joining us. The live page writers today were Alice Evans, Cherry Wilson and Alex Therrien. The editors were Vanessa Barford and Owen Amos. We'll soon be bringing our live page to a close for the day, but before we do, here is a recap of the main coronavirus stories today: Spain has become the latest country to limit the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to under-55s. ""The public health commission, at a meeting on Friday and following scientific evidence, has approved setting as 55 the maximum age for people to get the AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19,"" the health ministry said in a statement. Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, and Poland only recommend it for people under 65, and Italy and Belgium for those under 55, because of what they say is a lack of data on its effectiveness in older people. The UK has no age limit.A recent studysaid one shot of the vaccine was 76% effective overall and reduced transmission ""substantially"". And the UK regulator has said ""the data we have show that the vaccine produces a strong immune response in the over-65s, and that it is safe"". Read more on theOxford jab and older people here. A 103-year-old woman - who has already lived through one pandemic - has received her first dose of the Covid vaccine. Hilda Richards from Wrexham - a baby during the Spanish Flu pandemic that began in 1918 - also served as a nurse during World War Two. She initially went to her care home for two weeks, but stayed when the first wave hit. This video can not be played Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones wanted to encourage more people to get the Covid vaccine Facebook has apologised for rejecting a businessman's advert designed to encourage black and Asian people to have the Covid-19 vaccine. Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, whose Black Farmer business produces sausages and other meat products, wanted to raise awareness about the importance of being vaccinated. He decided to use a boosted post, which is the simplest way to advertise on Facebook, and requires approval by the social network before it can run. He posted his vaccination picture on The Black Farmer Facebook business page with the caption: ""Just had my first vaccine everyone! The organisation is amazing. This is the #NHS at its best!"" But when he tried to promote the post on Facebook, it was rejected because it said the content was ""shocking"". Facebook said it had made a mistake and the advert has since been approved.

Here, senior sister Tracy Mellor from the Royal Stoke University Hospital talks about the pressure on her ward. As we have been reporting, the EU has made a slower start to its vaccination programme than other places, including the UK and the US. The EU has given around 3.5 jabs per 100 people, compared to around 17 per 100 in the UK and 11 per 100 in the US. But which of the EU's 27 countries has gone quickest? With restrictions similar to those in place in late summer last year, a return to normal schooling by September should be ""quite achievable"" Fully relaxing coronavirus restrictions by September, when the new school year begins, would see ""significant further disease"", even with a fast vaccine rollout and high uptake of jabs, scientists advising the UK government have warned. In an undated document published by Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on Friday, the experts said a combination of factors, such as more transmissible coronavirus variants, vaccine hesitancy and jabs not working so well in some people could still lead to people getting ill with Covid-19. However, with restrictions similar to those in place in late summer last year, a return to normal schooling by then should be ""quite achievable"", they said. There were 370 new cases recorded in the seven days to 1 February in Corby Corby in Northamptonshire has the highest coronavirus rate among local authorities in England, according to government figures. There were 370 new cases recorded in the seven days to 1 February - the equivalent of 512.3 cases per 100,000 people. This is up from 473.6 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 25 January. Sandwell in the West Midlands has the second highest rate, down from 655.2 to 483.8, with 1,589 new cases. Walsall, also in the West Midlands, is in third place - down from 535.9 to 471.5, with 1,346 new cases. Torridge in North Devon had the lowest rate with 26.4 cases, down from 52.7, with 18 new cases. Of the 315 local areas in England, 15 (5%) saw a rise in case rates and 300 (95%) had a fall. The list has been calculated by the PA news agency based on Public Health England data published on 5 February on the government's coronavirus dashboard. The health authorities in South Africa announced on 18 December that a new variant of Covid 19 had been identified. The strain - called B.1.351 - carries one of the same mutations as the variant first seen in Kent, which makes it easier to spread. On 23 December, thegovernment announcedthat it had detected two cases of the South African strain in the UK (in London and north-west England).

The Czech Republic may consider following Hungary by using vaccines not yet approved in the EU, its prime minister said during a trip to Budapest. Hungary has given emergency approval to Chinese and Russian vaccines, despite them not being approved at EU level. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about those vaccines, and that his country may consider approving them as ""time is of the essence"". Hungary plans to begin using the Chinese and Russian vaccines this month.

His daughter, Lucy Teixeira, said she learned to share her father with the world after he found fame by raising almost Â£33m for NHS charities ahead of his 100th birthday. She said he had a long life and peaceful death, adding: ""I'm really grateful - he had a good innings."" ""He leaves us with a really strong powerful message - tomorrow is a good day,"" Lucy told ITV News. ""Those words represent his whole life to me."" Read more on this storyhere.

Worth up to Â£50,000 per application, the loans offer a lifeline to companies on the edge. But financial crime experts fear many billions may have been lost to fraud and mistakes. The BBC's Angus Crawford was given exclusive access to a unit tracking down the fraudsters who took advantage of the scheme. As we reported earlier, the number of daily cases in the UK has fallen sharply from the peak at the start of the year. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 is also now falling - although the total remains high. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine gives people good protection against the new coronavirus variant which is now dominant in the UK, its developers say. They found similar efficacy against theB117 ""Kent"" variant,externalto the original virus, based on swabs from volunteers. It is still unclear how well the jab works againstother variants with more worrying mutations. But the Oxford team says it can easilyupdate its vaccineand deploy a new version in the autumn if needed. Vaccine developers say it is a relatively straightforward process to tweak the current recipe to target any new variants, which occur often in viruses and are not unexpected. Scientists behind the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines also say early research suggests their vaccines appear to protect against the dominant new variant in the UK. Reality Check Talking about the coronavirus lockdown, the Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady said on the BBCâs Today programme:âEven Sage said shutting down hospitality for instance, was not proven to have any significant effect on the transmission of the virusâ. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises the government, has said on a number of occasions that the hospitality sector carries a risk of spreading the virus. These include:  We went back to Sir Graham Brady who pointed us to a line in a Sage document from mid-September. âOverall, the evidence base on which to judge the effectiveness and harms associated with different interventions is weak and so there is considerable uncertainty around the estimates presented here,â the report says. The report notes that this is because âpackages of interventionsâ are often taken together so singling out the impact of one of them is difficult. Itâs worth noting though that the same Sage document includes the âclosure of all bars, restaurants and cafesâ in a list of interventions â to tackle infections â 'that should be considered for immediate introduction'. The US unemployment rate fell from 6.7% to 6.3% in January, new figures show, but only 49,000 jobs were added. The unemployment rate reached 14.7% in April last year, but has fallen steadily since then. As this chart shows, the pandemic led to a dramatic interruption of what had been years of falling unemployment under Presidents Obama and Trump. The leaders of France and Germany have defended the EU's vaccine policy, after a slow start to their programme (see chart below). The EU has a collective approach to buying vaccines, and French President Emmanuel Macron told a news conference: ""I fully support the European approach. What would people say if countries like France and Germany were competing with each other on vaccines?"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe needed to increase pharmaceutical production, but insisted: ""The basic decision to order together as the European Union was and is right."" Macron also seemed to admit the EU had been caught off-guard by the swiftness of vaccine development. ""Nobody could have known that we were going to have safe vaccines so quickly,"" he said. Itâs been a difficult few months with a surge in infections, tens of thousands of deaths and a damaging lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But there are now plenty of reasons to be, at least cautiously, hopeful that we are on the road to recovery. So what are they? Weâre past the peak- Infection levels have been falling since early January and, in recent weeks, that has translated into fewer people being admitted to hospital. Vaccination programme going well- The UK has vaccinated more than 10 million people - more per head of population than almost anywhere in the world. Vaccination should slow the spread- As well as protecting the individual who has been vaccinated from developing Covid, there are growing signs the immunisation programme will also slow the spread of the virus between people. Infection offers long-lasting protection- Another factor that will help reduce the burden of Covid is that so many people have now been exposed to the virus, and the latest research suggests they should have lasting protection. The mutations can be beaten- There has been a lot of concern about how the virus is mutating â with new varients being found in the UK and South Africa. But this does not mean the vaccinations are ineffective. Read more on thishere. There are no current plans to bring in vaccine passports for people who have had both jabs, the health secretary has said. Speaking to journalists, Matt Hancock reiterated that going on holiday is currently ""illegal"" during this latest lockdown. He added: ""Of course, we're constantly working with other countries and we keep these sorts of things under review, but for now there are still 31,670 people in hospital with Covid. ""It's imperative, that even with the good news on the vaccine and even with cases starting to fall, it's imperative that everybody follows the rules and stays at home unless you absolutely have to leave."" Mr Hancock said while there is positive news around the pandemic out there, the country still has ""very serious problems"" that it needs to get through.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Parish council Zoom host 'surprised' by reaction,"This video can not be played Jackie Weaver tells Anita Rani what happened in 'that' viral parish council meeting A woman at the centre of a social media storm after a virtual parish council meeting spiralled into chaos has been left surprised by her fame. Jackie Weaver has had ""nothing but positive support"" after remaining calm on the Zoom call which had insults, laughter and members being kicked out. She said she had only been called in to host and ""support"" councillors at Handforth Parish Council in Cheshire. Ms Weaver told the BBC the meetings were ""often less exciting"". A cut down version of the planning and environment meeting on 10 December emerged on Twitter on Thursday and soon became a ""must see"", piquing the interest of millions by Friday morning. During the heated meeting, Ms Weaver kept her cool amid some members being abusive and muttering under their breath as others tried to speak, hysterical laughter and participants answering phone calls. She has since been trending on Twitter along with the council itself, and fans of the video include Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy who asked: ""Who needs Netflix?"" ""Of that meeting, I'm not absolutely sure who was in charge,"" Ms Weaver toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. This video can not be played A cut down version of the planning and environment meeting soon became a ""must see"" During the meeting, when chairman Brian Tolver labelled himself as the ""clerk"", Ms Weaver said: ""The chairman simply declared himself clerk and notified everybody of the case. ""There is no way of stopping him from calling himself clerk. Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on."" Then Mr Tolver, who refused to recognise the legitimacy of the meeting, was removed from the meeting and placed in a virtual waiting room after saying: ""You have no authority here Jackie Weaver."" Councillor Aled Brewerton waded in as vice-chairman saying he should take charge of the meeting and shouted: ""Read the standing orders - read them and understand them!"" He was also sent to the waiting room. Aled Brewerton soon found himself the second most senior person to be kicked out of the meeting All Ms Weaver, chief officer of the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, was meant to be doing was giving ""support"" to parish councillors to hold meetings. She said she had received ""nothing but positive support"" since the clip went viral and ""99.9% of council meetings are just not like that, they are often less exciting than we might hope they are"". ""I'm passionate about the fact that local government is the mechanism by which people can engage with their communities,"" she said. 'I made Handforth Parish Council go viral' Woman in Twitter name mix-up over GameStop stock Half-kidding farmer's goat Zooms success 'insane' Ms Weaver said while parts of the meeting were funny in principle, it was a ""bit harsh"" to make fun of someone who had ""lost it"". She said the meeting also showed an element of ""bullying and bad behaviour"" in local councils. ""A lot of us are working very hard - and that includes central government - to try to do something about that,"" she said. Mr Tolver said he did not regret how he had acted in the meeting. He said Ms Weaver was just present as a member of the public and ""had no status to speak other than when invited"". ""If you look at the first meeting you will see I have reason to be angry,"" he said. Former Chancellor George Osborne tweeted that Handforth Parish Council had not been ""quite so lively"" when he was a Tatton MP, which covered that area. Allow Twitter content?

Coronavirus: Evening updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening.UKScotland doubles daily vaccine numbers in a weekDeputy First Minister John Swinney said the vaccine programme was on track after daily figures reached a new record.Scotland,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. All adults in the UK aged 50 and over should have been offered a coronavirus vaccine by May,Downing Street has confirmed. Previously ministers had said it was their ""ambition"" to vaccinate the first nine priority groups by the spring. The UK had given a first jab to almost 11 million people as of Thursday and is aiming to reach 15 million vaccinations by 15 February. Levels of coronavirus are showing clear signs of coming down throughout most of the UK, more evidence suggests. After at least a month of lockdown,figures from the Office for National Statistics suggestpositive tests are falling in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The UK's reproduction, or R, number is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1 - anything below one means the epidemic is shrinking. Police handed out Â£34,000 in fines after breaking up a student partyattended by more than 150 ""incredibly selfish"" revellers. Some partygoers fled through fire exits and set off alarms when officers were called to the Ranmoor Student Village in Sheffield.

House price rises 'could be running out of steamâThe Halifax says prices fell last month and are likely to come under pressure in the months ahead.,"The recent uplift in UK house prices ""could be running out of steam"", the Halifax has said after it found that property values dropped last month. The lender's latest survey showed prices fell 0.3% in January, the biggest monthly fall since April 2020. However, prices still climbed 5.4% over the past year, leaving the average property worth Â£13,000 more than in January 2020. Across the UK, average property values stood at Â£251,968 in January. ""How far and how deep any slowdown proves to be is a challenge to predict given the prevailing uncertainty created by the pandemic,"" said Halifax managing director Russell Galley. ""With swathes of the economy still shuttered, and joblessness continuing to edge higher, on the surface this points to slower market activity and downward price pressures in the near-term."" The stamp duty holiday in England introduced last Julyis due to end on 31 March, which has raised concerns that sales could reach a cliff edge. ""The slowdown we are now seeing in house price growth reflects the looming end to (the stamp duty holiday),"" said Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital. ""Looking to the future, when assuming the temporary stamp duty reduction ends, we're likely to see a slowdown in house price rises."" Low-deposit mortgages return after Covid slump Soaring house prices of 2020 'unlikely to persist' She said that challenging economic conditions make potential home buyers less willing and able to buy. Andrew Montlake, managing director at mortgage broker Coreco, said: ""The UK property market went supersonic after the introduction of the stamp duty holiday last summer and, with the deadline fast approaching, it has inevitably slowed down, ""In hard economic terms, and with the stamp duty holiday over in all but name, the property market is facing a huge amount of uncertainty."" Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country, said lockdown had played its part in keeping prices as high as they are because it reduced supply. ""The Budget is only around the corner now and, while it remains to be seen whether the chancellor will extend the stamp duty tax break, he has a big deficit and many other levers to pull that could affect the market in much more significant ways,"" she said. Mr Montlake said that the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a massive rethink among homeowners and prospective homebuyers. ""The rules of the game have changed. Properties that were perfect a year ago are often no longer what people want as work and life priorities have been turned upside down."" Lucy Pendleton, of estate agent James Pendleton, said it was sellers, not buyers, who were a little quieter at the moment. ""A lot of people with children have decided against listing their property for sale while they're home-schooling and their home looks like a bomb has hit it."" But she said there were still plenty of first-time buyers looking and ""we always see a rush of activity after spring has sprung when people's gardens start to look better"".

Myanmar teachers join growing anti-coup protestsA civil disobedience movement is gaining momentum with teachers and students demonstrating.Asia,"This video can not be played ""We wish them to fall"": Teachers in the city of Yangon have joined protests against Monday's military coup A civil disobedience movement in Myanmar is gaining momentum, with teachers and students protesting against Monday's military coup. Demonstrators at a university in the biggest city, Yangon, chanted support for jailed leader Aung San Suu Kyi and wore red ribbons, her party's colour. Ms Suu Kyi and other leaders have been held since the coup on Monday. Earlier, the military detained another senior leader from her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. Ms Suu Kyi, who has not been seen in public since Monday, is under house arrest, according to her lawyer. He said he was seeking her unconditional release and that of the president, who was also detained, but he had been unable to meet them. Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, has remained mostly calm in the aftermath of the coup, which has plunged the South East Asian country into uncertainty. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Myanmar country profile On Friday afternoon, hundreds of teachers and students gathered outside Dagon University in Yangon, where they displayed the three-finger salute - a sign that has been adopted by protesters in the region to show their opposition to authoritarian rule. They chanted their support for Ms Suu Kyi and carried red flags. ""We will not let our generation suffer under this kind of military dictatorship,"" Min Sithu, a student, told the AFP news agency. Where else have we seen the three-finger salute? By Nyein Chan, BBC Burmese, Yangon The first reaction to the coup was shock and horror. But now people have had time to digest what is happening and are finding different ways to fight back. As the regime takes more steps to tighten its control, an increasing number of people are joining the leaderless civil disobedience campaign demanding a return of the democratically elected government. The military has blocked the most popular social media platform, Facebook, but most people are still able to access it using virtual private networks - VPNs - and that's where lots of the protests are taking place. People here know very well the violent crackdowns the military is capable of, so that's why for now there are no widespread street protests. But there are other ways people can make their voices heard. The lecturers who took part in Friday's campus protests said they were doing it for the next generation. I have an 18-month-old child. I grew up under military rule and the economic sanctions that came as a result of it. I prayed that my son would grow up in a very different Burma.  Now I am not so sure what his future will be like. University teachers have joined the protests elsewhere in the country, like here in Kachin state... ...or here in Sittwe, Rakhine state There have been a number of demonstrations in different parts of Myanmar - the first large-scale street protests seen in the country since the coup. Residents in some cities, including Yangon, have conducted nightly protests from their homes, banging pots and pans and singing revolutionary songs. There have also been daytime flash mobs. About 70 MPs are said to have held an insurgent parliament, to replicate the parliamentary session that was supposed to take place this week. Win Htein (left) is a senior leader in the National League for Democracy led by Aung San Suu Kyi (right) In a pre-dawn phone call with BBC Burmese, Win Htein, a 79-year-old patron of the NLD and strong supporter of Ms Suu Kyi, said he was being taken to the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, by members of the police and the military. He said he was being detained under sedition laws - which carry a maximum punishment of life imprisonment -  although he was not told the exact charge. ""They don't like what I've been talking about. They are afraid of what I'm saying,"" he said. What evidence is there of election fraud in Myanmar? Growing up under Myanmar's military rule How Facebook became Myanmar's 'digital tea shop' How the military disrupted Myanmar's internet There was a small protest in front of a university in Mandalay, the country's second city, on Thursday Many have also gone online to protest against the coup, but the military has now extended its temporary ban on Facebook to cover Twitter and Instagram too. Twitter declined to comment when asked by the BBC if it had seen a spike in new users or tweets from Myanmar. Myanmar coup: 'Our world turned upside down' Fitness coach films video as Myanmar coup unfolds The military overthrew Ms Suu Kyi's government after it claimed a November election won by the NLD was fraudulent, though the country's election commission said there was no evidence to back up these allegations. The move has been met with global outrage. On Thursday,US President Joe Biden called on the military to ""relinquish power"",externaland release detained officials and activists. The US had already threatened severe sanctions on Myanmar. However, the military is seemingly undeterred, continuing down its path of consolidating power and appointing new ministers, says the BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. The UN Security Council also called on the military authorities in Myanmar to release Ms Suu Kyi and other detained leaders - but stopped short of condemning the coup. In doing so, it has brought China and Russia behind a call for her release, in what our correspondent has described as a rare show of international unity. Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, leading to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh. It triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community after she refused to condemn the crackdown or describe it as ethnic cleansing. She has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the November 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.

Energy prices to rise for millions of households,"Energy prices will rise for millions of people across the UK in April, at a time when finances are squeezed. Regulator Ofgem said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs. The typical gas and electricity customer is likely to see their bill go up by Â£96 to Â£1,138 a year. Charities say the timing is a ""double whammy"", coming at a time when the government's Covid-related support schemes are due to be wound down. Ofgem said rising wholesale costs were behind the increase, adding that the existence of the price cap meant households saved Â£100 a year, and they could also switch to a better deal. Automatic switching plan for fairer energy tariffs Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of the regulator, said:â¯ ""Energy bill increases are never welcome, especially as many households are struggling with the impact of the pandemic. We have carefully scrutinised these changes to ensure that customers only pay a fair price for their energy. ""As the UK still faces challenges around Covid-19, during this exceptional time I expect suppliers to set their prices competitively, treat all customers fairly and ensure that any household in financial distress is given access to the support they need."" He said a rise in spring, when less energy was used, was better than waiting until the autumn. Peter Earl, head of energy at price comparison website Comparethemarket.com, said: ""Raising energy costs for millions of households by an average of Â£96 is an extraordinary move in the current environment. ""It calls into question the whole point of a price cap which was designed to protect the most vulnerable households."" The price cap, set twice a year by the regulator, affects 11 million households in England, Wales and Scotland who have never switched suppliers or whose discounted deals have expired. Northern Ireland sets its own cap. That accounts for about half of all UK households. The remainder are on so-called fixed deals, which will not be affected. The cap for prepayment meter customers will go up by Â£87â¯ to Â£1,156, affecting another four million customers. The caps set the prices that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, but that does not mean there is a limit to how much people can pay. The more gas and electricity you use, the higher the bill. Lyn Clark says she has put on extra layers Lockdown life means Lyn Clark, like so many others, has been spending a lot more time at home. Her energy bills have been rising as a result. ""I'm trying not to switch on heaters in the rooms that are not being used,"" she said. While prices are capped on default tariffs, the amount people pay in total is likely to have risen during more time at home. Mrs Clark said she had been doing her best to keep the costs down. ""I find myself putting on extra layers,"" she said. ""I also go for a walk each lunchtime to make sure I'm warmer."" In October, Ofgem lowered the price cap by Â£84, but it has now more than reversed that with the rise scheduled for April. The extra allowance for suppliers to raise prices is the result of greater costs on the wholesale markets. It also includes an allowance to charge an extra Â£23 a year to cover bills that have not been paid. Ofgem said a further delay in recouping these costs would only create greater costs next winter. Charities point out that raising prices for everyone on these tariffs is likely to increase the number of people unable to pay. Citizens Advice said its research in December indicated that 2.1 million households were behind on their energy bills, a rise of 600,000 compared with before the pandemic. It was concerned that the planned removing of assistance for recipients of universal credit, as well as other government financial support schemes being wound down, meant there were serious worries over debt. Alistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""This increase will be a heavy blow to a lot of households. For many people on universal credit it will come at the same time as the Â£20 a week increase to the benefit is set to end. ""With a tough jobs market and essential bills rising, now is not the time for the government to cut this vital lifeline"". Adam Scorer, of National Energy Action, which has also warned of financial pressures on households, said: ""People on the lowest incomes and in the worst housing are always hit hardest. ""Heating a poorly insulated home costs around Â£50 a month more than a decent home. If bills rise by Â£96, millions of households have two stark choices; stay cold or fall further into debt."" He argued that prepayment meter customers should not have been included in the cap as they found it difficult to switch. Even if households do switch, the cost of so-called fixed-rate deals has also been rising. The cheapest on the market rose by more than Â£50 in the last three months of the year to Â£851. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, a trade body for energy suppliers, said the price cap was set to be fair to customers and suppliers. ""Today's rise reflects that the cost of buying energy - by far the biggest part of the bill - has risen significantly over the last few months,"" she said. ""It also includes a greater allowance for debt given the difficulties many customers are facing in paying bills at present.""

""The public health commission, at a meeting on Friday and following scientific evidence, has approved setting as 55 the maximum age for people to get the AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19,"" the health ministry said in a statement. Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, and Poland only recommend it for people under 65, and Italy and Belgium for those under 55, because of what they say is a lack of data on its effectiveness in older people. The UK has no age limit.A recent studysaid one shot of the vaccine was 76% effective overall and reduced transmission ""substantially"".

Here, senior sister Tracy Mellor from the Royal Stoke University Hospital talks about the pressure on her ward. As we have been reporting, the EU has made a slower start to its vaccination programme than other places, including the UK and the US. The EU has given around 3.5 jabs per 100 people, compared to around 17 per 100 in the UK and 11 per 100 in the US. But which of the EU's 27 countries has gone quickest? With restrictions similar to those in place in late summer last year, a return to normal schooling by September should be ""quite achievable"" Fully relaxing coronavirus restrictions by September, when the new school year begins, would see ""significant further disease"", even with a fast vaccine rollout and high uptake of jabs, scientists advising the UK government have warned. In an undated document published by Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on Friday, the experts said a combination of factors, such as more transmissible coronavirus variants, vaccine hesitancy and jabs not working so well in some people could still lead to people getting ill with Covid-19. However, with restrictions similar to those in place in late summer last year, a return to normal schooling by then should be ""quite achievable"", they said. There were 370 new cases recorded in the seven days to 1 February in Corby Corby in Northamptonshire has the highest coronavirus rate among local authorities in England, according to government figures. There were 370 new cases recorded in the seven days to 1 February - the equivalent of 512.3 cases per 100,000 people. This is up from 473.6 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 25 January. Sandwell in the West Midlands has the second highest rate, down from 655.2 to 483.8, with 1,589 new cases. Walsall, also in the West Midlands, is in third place - down from 535.9 to 471.5, with 1,346 new cases. Torridge in North Devon had the lowest rate with 26.4 cases, down from 52.7, with 18 new cases. Of the 315 local areas in England, 15 (5%) saw a rise in case rates and 300 (95%) had a fall. The list has been calculated by the PA news agency based on Public Health England data published on 5 February on the government's coronavirus dashboard. The health authorities in South Africa announced on 18 December that a new variant of Covid 19 had been identified. The strain - called B.1.351 - carries one of the same mutations as the variant first seen in Kent, which makes it easier to spread. On 23 December, thegovernment announcedthat it had detected two cases of the South African strain in the UK (in London and north-west England). So, what did the government do to tackle it and what did its scientific advisers say?Read more here. The Czech Republic may consider following Hungary by using vaccines not yet approved in the EU, its prime minister said during a trip to Budapest. Hungary has given emergency approval to Chinese and Russian vaccines, despite them not being approved at EU level. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about those vaccines, and that his country may consider approving them as ""time is of the essence"". Hungary plans to begin using the Chinese and Russian vaccines this month.

His daughter, Lucy Teixeira, said she learned to share her father with the world after he found fame by raising almost Â£33m for NHS charities ahead of his 100th birthday. She said he had a long life and peaceful death, adding: ""I'm really grateful - he had a good innings."" ""He leaves us with a really strong powerful message - tomorrow is a good day,"" Lucy told ITV News. ""Those words represent his whole life to me."" Read more on this storyhere. This video can not be played Bounce back loans: Hunting down the Covid loan fraudsters More than Â£40bn has been lent to struggling firms though the governmentâs bounce back loan scheme. Worth up to Â£50,000 per application, the loans offer a lifeline to companies on the edge. But financial crime experts fear many billions may have been lost to fraud and mistakes. The BBC's Angus Crawford was given exclusive access to a unit tracking down the fraudsters who took advantage of the scheme. As we reported earlier, the number of daily cases in the UK has fallen sharply from the peak at the start of the year. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 is also now falling - although the total remains high. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine gives people good protection against the new coronavirus variant which is now dominant in the UK, its developers say. They found similar efficacy against theB117 ""Kent"" variant,externalto the original virus, based on swabs from volunteers. It is still unclear how well the jab works againstother variants with more worrying mutations. But the Oxford team says it can easilyupdate its vaccineand deploy a new version in the autumn if needed. Vaccine developers say it is a relatively straightforward process to tweak the current recipe to target any new variants, which occur often in viruses and are not unexpected. Scientists behind the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines also say early research suggests their vaccines appear to protect against the dominant new variant in the UK. Reality Check Talking about the coronavirus lockdown, the Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady said on the BBCâs Today programme:âEven Sage said shutting down hospitality for instance, was not proven to have any significant effect on the transmission of the virusâ. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises the government, has said on a number of occasions that the hospitality sector carries a risk of spreading the virus. These include:  We went back to Sir Graham Brady who pointed us to a line in a Sage document from mid-September. âOverall, the evidence base on which to judge the effectiveness and harms associated with different interventions is weak and so there is considerable uncertainty around the estimates presented here,â the report says. The report notes that this is because âpackages of interventionsâ are often taken together so singling out the impact of one of them is difficult. Itâs worth noting though that the same Sage document includes the âclosure of all bars, restaurants and cafesâ in a list of interventions â to tackle infections â 'that should be considered for immediate introduction'. The US unemployment rate fell from 6.7% to 6.3% in January, new figures show, but only 49,000 jobs were added. The unemployment rate reached 14.7% in April last year, but has fallen steadily since then. As this chart shows, the pandemic led to a dramatic interruption of what had been years of falling unemployment under Presidents Obama and Trump. The leaders of France and Germany have defended the EU's vaccine policy, after a slow start to their programme (see chart below). The EU has a collective approach to buying vaccines, and French President Emmanuel Macron told a news conference: ""I fully support the European approach. What would people say if countries like France and Germany were competing with each other on vaccines?"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe needed to increase pharmaceutical production, but insisted: ""The basic decision to order together as the European Union was and is right."" Macron also seemed to admit the EU had been caught off-guard by the swiftness of vaccine development. ""Nobody could have known that we were going to have safe vaccines so quickly,"" he said. Itâs been a difficult few months with a surge in infections, tens of thousands of deaths and a damaging lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But there are now plenty of reasons to be, at least cautiously, hopeful that we are on the road to recovery. So what are they? Weâre past the peak- Infection levels have been falling since early January and, in recent weeks, that has translated into fewer people being admitted to hospital. Vaccination programme going well- The UK has vaccinated more than 10 million people - more per head of population than almost anywhere in the world. Vaccination should slow the spread- As well as protecting the individual who has been vaccinated from developing Covid, there are growing signs the immunisation programme will also slow the spread of the virus between people. Infection offers long-lasting protection- Another factor that will help reduce the burden of Covid is that so many people have now been exposed to the virus, and the latest research suggests they should have lasting protection. The mutations can be beaten- There has been a lot of concern about how the virus is mutating â with new varients being found in the UK and South Africa. But this does not mean the vaccinations are ineffective. Read more on thishere. There are no current plans to bring in vaccine passports for people who have had both jabs, the health secretary has said. Speaking to journalists, Matt Hancock reiterated that going on holiday is currently ""illegal"" during this latest lockdown. He added: ""Of course, we're constantly working with other countries and we keep these sorts of things under review, but for now there are still 31,670 people in hospital with Covid. ""It's imperative, that even with the good news on the vaccine and even with cases starting to fall, it's imperative that everybody follows the rules and stays at home unless you absolutely have to leave."" Mr Hancock said while there is positive news around the pandemic out there, the country still has ""very serious problems"" that it needs to get through.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Mourners line streets for funeral of stabbed boy,"Mourners threw roses as the cortege made its way through Emmer Green Hundreds of people have turned out for the funeral of a 13-year-old boy who was stabbed to death. Oliver Stephens, known as Olly, died from his injuries on 3 January after being stabbed in Emmer Green in Reading. Mourners threw roses as the funeral cortege made its way through Emmer Greenpast Olly's old schoolsand St Barnabas Church. A service has taken place at Reading Crematorium. Speaking during the service Stuart Stephens, Olly's father, said it ""was the stuff of nightmares"" when ""a knock on the door shattered our lives"". Olly Stephens was stabbed to death in Emmer Green in Reading on 3 January ""No-one should have to receive news like this or deal with a situation as horrific,"" he said. ""But we are blessed, the time we shared with Oliver is our most precious gift."" He added: ""Oliver touched so many lives without either us or himself knowing it, we now know."" Afundraising appeal for the teenager, who was autistic, has raised just over Â£21,000. The money will go towards Olly's family, and partly towards knife crime charities, the appeal said. This video can not be played The funeral cortege passed Olly's old schools and St Barnabas Church In a statement, Highdown School, where Olly was a pupil, said the ""shock and disbelief continues to be felt"", and added many staff and students had received counselling arranged by the school. ""We know that many will need to continue to access these services in the weeks and months come,"" it added. Speaking to the BBC Matt Rodda, MP for Reading East, described the day ""as very, very moving"". He said: ""This has been the most awful tragedy both for Olly's family and to the wider community here. ""People have been genuinely deeply shocked by this awful incident."" Nikki Mitchell, BBC South home affairs correspondent Mourners wore red, Olly's favourite colour, to pay their respects Many of the hundreds of people who came out of their homes to pay their respects to Olly Stephens were children; his friends and his neighbours. Most wore red and were holding single red roses. Red was Olly's favourite colour. The funeral cortege left his family's home just before 11:00, first passing his school, then driving along the local streets, and through Caversham Park Village. Olly's coffin was colourfully decorated. A floral rainbow, a cuddly toy and a packet of sweets could be seen through the back window of the hearse as it passed. As the cortege approached Reading crematorium people threw single red roses onto the bonnet and clapped in his memory. There were tears and hugs. Officers were called just before 16:00 GMT on 3 January to reports of a stabbing at the fields on the boundary of Emmer Green and Caversham Heights. Three teenagers have been charged with murder and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. They all remain in youth detention custody and are due to face trial in June.

The list has been calculated by the PA news agency based on Public Health England data published on 5 February on the government's coronavirus dashboard. The health authorities in South Africa announced on 18 December that a new variant of Covid 19 had been identified. The strain - called B.1.351 - carries one of the same mutations as the variant first seen in Kent, which makes it easier to spread. On 23 December, thegovernment announcedthat it had detected two cases of the South African strain in the UK (in London and north-west England). So, what did the government do to tackle it and what did its scientific advisers say?Read more here. The Czech Republic may consider following Hungary by using vaccines not yet approved in the EU, its prime minister said during a trip to Budapest. Hungary has given emergency approval to Chinese and Russian vaccines, despite them not being approved at EU level. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about those vaccines, and that his country may consider approving them as ""time is of the essence"". Hungary plans to begin using the Chinese and Russian vaccines this month. Andrej Babis with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Friday Captain Sir Tom Moore's daughter has said his family is planning a ""quiet"" send-off to celebrate his life. Capt Sir Tomdied with Covid-19 on Tuesday- two days after being admitted to hospital with breathing problems. His daughter, Lucy Teixeira, said she learned to share her father with the world after he found fame by raising almost Â£33m for NHS charities ahead of his 100th birthday. She said he had a long life and peaceful death, adding: ""I'm really grateful - he had a good innings."" ""He leaves us with a really strong powerful message - tomorrow is a good day,"" Lucy told ITV News. ""Those words represent his whole life to me."" Read more on this storyhere.

Worth up to Â£50,000 per application, the loans offer a lifeline to companies on the edge. But financial crime experts fear many billions may have been lost to fraud and mistakes. The BBC's Angus Crawford was given exclusive access to a unit tracking down the fraudsters who took advantage of the scheme. As we reported earlier, the number of daily cases in the UK has fallen sharply from the peak at the start of the year. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 is also now falling - although the total remains high. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine gives people good protection against the new coronavirus variant which is now dominant in the UK, its developers say. They found similar efficacy against theB117 ""Kent"" variant,externalto the original virus, based on swabs from volunteers. It is still unclear how well the jab works againstother variants with more worrying mutations. But the Oxford team says it can easilyupdate its vaccineand deploy a new version in the autumn if needed. Vaccine developers say it is a relatively straightforward process to tweak the current recipe to target any new variants, which occur often in viruses and are not unexpected. Scientists behind the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines also say early research suggests their vaccines appear to protect against the dominant new variant in the UK. Reality Check Talking about the coronavirus lockdown, the Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady said on the BBCâs Today programme:âEven Sage said shutting down hospitality for instance, was not proven to have any significant effect on the transmission of the virusâ. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises the government, has said on a number of occasions that the hospitality sector carries a risk of spreading the virus. These include:  We went back to Sir Graham Brady who pointed us to a line in a Sage document from mid-September. âOverall, the evidence base on which to judge the effectiveness and harms associated with different interventions is weak and so there is considerable uncertainty around the estimates presented here,â the report says. The report notes that this is because âpackages of interventionsâ are often taken together so singling out the impact of one of them is difficult. Itâs worth noting though that the same Sage document includes the âclosure of all bars, restaurants and cafesâ in a list of interventions â to tackle infections â 'that should be considered for immediate introduction'. The US unemployment rate fell from 6.7% to 6.3% in January, new figures show, but only 49,000 jobs were added. The unemployment rate reached 14.7% in April last year, but has fallen steadily since then. As this chart shows, the pandemic led to a dramatic interruption of what had been years of falling unemployment under Presidents Obama and Trump. The leaders of France and Germany have defended the EU's vaccine policy, after a slow start to their programme (see chart below). The EU has a collective approach to buying vaccines, and French President Emmanuel Macron told a news conference: ""I fully support the European approach. What would people say if countries like France and Germany were competing with each other on vaccines?"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe needed to increase pharmaceutical production, but insisted: ""The basic decision to order together as the European Union was and is right."" Macron also seemed to admit the EU had been caught off-guard by the swiftness of vaccine development. ""Nobody could have known that we were going to have safe vaccines so quickly,"" he said. Itâs been a difficult few months with a surge in infections, tens of thousands of deaths and a damaging lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But there are now plenty of reasons to be, at least cautiously, hopeful that we are on the road to recovery. So what are they? Weâre past the peak- Infection levels have been falling since early January and, in recent weeks, that has translated into fewer people being admitted to hospital. Vaccination programme going well- The UK has vaccinated more than 10 million people - more per head of population than almost anywhere in the world. Vaccination should slow the spread- As well as protecting the individual who has been vaccinated from developing Covid, there are growing signs the immunisation programme will also slow the spread of the virus between people. Infection offers long-lasting protection- Another factor that will help reduce the burden of Covid is that so many people have now been exposed to the virus, and the latest research suggests they should have lasting protection. The mutations can be beaten- There has been a lot of concern about how the virus is mutating â with new varients being found in the UK and South Africa. But this does not mean the vaccinations are ineffective. Read more on thishere. There are no current plans to bring in vaccine passports for people who have had both jabs, the health secretary has said. Speaking to journalists, Matt Hancock reiterated that going on holiday is currently ""illegal"" during this latest lockdown. He added: ""Of course, we're constantly working with other countries and we keep these sorts of things under review, but for now there are still 31,670 people in hospital with Covid. ""It's imperative, that even with the good news on the vaccine and even with cases starting to fall, it's imperative that everybody follows the rules and stays at home unless you absolutely have to leave."" Mr Hancock said while there is positive news around the pandemic out there, the country still has ""very serious problems"" that it needs to get through.  Â© 2025 BBC.

House price rises 'could be running out of steamâ,"The recent uplift in UK house prices ""could be running out of steam"", the Halifax has said after it found that property values dropped last month. The lender's latest survey showed prices fell 0.3% in January, the biggest monthly fall since April 2020. However, prices still climbed 5.4% over the past year, leaving the average property worth Â£13,000 more than in January 2020. Across the UK, average property values stood at Â£251,968 in January. ""How far and how deep any slowdown proves to be is a challenge to predict given the prevailing uncertainty created by the pandemic,"" said Halifax managing director Russell Galley. ""With swathes of the economy still shuttered, and joblessness continuing to edge higher, on the surface this points to slower market activity and downward price pressures in the near-term."" The stamp duty holiday in England introduced last Julyis due to end on 31 March, which has raised concerns that sales could reach a cliff edge. ""The slowdown we are now seeing in house price growth reflects the looming end to (the stamp duty holiday),"" said Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital. ""Looking to the future, when assuming the temporary stamp duty reduction ends, we're likely to see a slowdown in house price rises."" Low-deposit mortgages return after Covid slump Soaring house prices of 2020 'unlikely to persist' She said that challenging economic conditions make potential home buyers less willing and able to buy. Andrew Montlake, managing director at mortgage broker Coreco, said: ""The UK property market went supersonic after the introduction of the stamp duty holiday last summer and, with the deadline fast approaching, it has inevitably slowed down, ""In hard economic terms, and with the stamp duty holiday over in all but name, the property market is facing a huge amount of uncertainty."" Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country, said lockdown had played its part in keeping prices as high as they are because it reduced supply. ""The Budget is only around the corner now and, while it remains to be seen whether the chancellor will extend the stamp duty tax break, he has a big deficit and many other levers to pull that could affect the market in much more significant ways,"" she said. Mr Montlake said that the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a massive rethink among homeowners and prospective homebuyers. ""The rules of the game have changed. Properties that were perfect a year ago are often no longer what people want as work and life priorities have been turned upside down."" Lucy Pendleton, of estate agent James Pendleton, said it was sellers, not buyers, who were a little quieter at the moment. ""A lot of people with children have decided against listing their property for sale while they're home-schooling and their home looks like a bomb has hit it."" But she said there were still plenty of first-time buyers looking and ""we always see a rush of activity after spring has sprung when people's gardens start to look better"".

Myanmar teachers join growing anti-coup protests,"This video can not be played ""We wish them to fall"": Teachers in the city of Yangon have joined protests against Monday's military coup A civil disobedience movement in Myanmar is gaining momentum, with teachers and students protesting against Monday's military coup. Demonstrators at a university in the biggest city, Yangon, chanted support for jailed leader Aung San Suu Kyi and wore red ribbons, her party's colour. Ms Suu Kyi and other leaders have been held since the coup on Monday. Earlier, the military detained another senior leader from her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. Ms Suu Kyi, who has not been seen in public since Monday, is under house arrest, according to her lawyer. He said he was seeking her unconditional release and that of the president, who was also detained, but he had been unable to meet them. Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, has remained mostly calm in the aftermath of the coup, which has plunged the South East Asian country into uncertainty. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Myanmar country profile On Friday afternoon, hundreds of teachers and students gathered outside Dagon University in Yangon, where they displayed the three-finger salute - a sign that has been adopted by protesters in the region to show their opposition to authoritarian rule. They chanted their support for Ms Suu Kyi and carried red flags. ""We will not let our generation suffer under this kind of military dictatorship,"" Min Sithu, a student, told the AFP news agency. Where else have we seen the three-finger salute? By Nyein Chan, BBC Burmese, Yangon The first reaction to the coup was shock and horror. But now people have had time to digest what is happening and are finding different ways to fight back. As the regime takes more steps to tighten its control, an increasing number of people are joining the leaderless civil disobedience campaign demanding a return of the democratically elected government. The military has blocked the most popular social media platform, Facebook, but most people are still able to access it using virtual private networks - VPNs - and that's where lots of the protests are taking place. People here know very well the violent crackdowns the military is capable of, so that's why for now there are no widespread street protests. But there are other ways people can make their voices heard. The lecturers who took part in Friday's campus protests said they were doing it for the next generation. I have an 18-month-old child. I grew up under military rule and the economic sanctions that came as a result of it. I prayed that my son would grow up in a very different Burma.  Now I am not so sure what his future will be like. University teachers have joined the protests elsewhere in the country, like here in Kachin state... ...or here in Sittwe, Rakhine state There have been a number of demonstrations in different parts of Myanmar - the first large-scale street protests seen in the country since the coup. Residents in some cities, including Yangon, have conducted nightly protests from their homes, banging pots and pans and singing revolutionary songs. There have also been daytime flash mobs. About 70 MPs are said to have held an insurgent parliament, to replicate the parliamentary session that was supposed to take place this week. Win Htein (left) is a senior leader in the National League for Democracy led by Aung San Suu Kyi (right) In a pre-dawn phone call with BBC Burmese, Win Htein, a 79-year-old patron of the NLD and strong supporter of Ms Suu Kyi, said he was being taken to the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, by members of the police and the military. He said he was being detained under sedition laws - which carry a maximum punishment of life imprisonment -  although he was not told the exact charge. ""They don't like what I've been talking about. They are afraid of what I'm saying,"" he said. What evidence is there of election fraud in Myanmar? Growing up under Myanmar's military rule How Facebook became Myanmar's 'digital tea shop' How the military disrupted Myanmar's internet There was a small protest in front of a university in Mandalay, the country's second city, on Thursday Many have also gone online to protest against the coup, but the military has now extended its temporary ban on Facebook to cover Twitter and Instagram too. Twitter declined to comment when asked by the BBC if it had seen a spike in new users or tweets from Myanmar. Myanmar coup: 'Our world turned upside down' Fitness coach films video as Myanmar coup unfolds The military overthrew Ms Suu Kyi's government after it claimed a November election won by the NLD was fraudulent, though the country's election commission said there was no evidence to back up these allegations. The move has been met with global outrage. On Thursday,US President Joe Biden called on the military to ""relinquish power"",externaland release detained officials and activists. The US had already threatened severe sanctions on Myanmar. However, the military is seemingly undeterred, continuing down its path of consolidating power and appointing new ministers, says the BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. The UN Security Council also called on the military authorities in Myanmar to release Ms Suu Kyi and other detained leaders - but stopped short of condemning the coup. In doing so, it has brought China and Russia behind a call for her release, in what our correspondent has described as a rare show of international unity. Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, leading to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh. It triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community after she refused to condemn the crackdown or describe it as ethnic cleansing. She has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the November 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.

"Forget Frankfurt and Paris, says Barclays boss","This video can not be played Jes Staley: 'London needs to focus on New York and Singapore' The UK financial services industry should focus on competing with the US and Asia rather than the EU. That's the view of the boss of Barclays for the City after Brexit. Jes Staley told the BBC that although jobs that would have been created here have been moved to the EU, Brexit gives one of the UK's most important sectors the chance to define its own agenda. ""I think Brexit is more than likely on the positive side than on the negative side,"" he said. ""What the UK needs and London needs, is to make sure that the City is one of the best places, whether [it is in terms of] regulation or law or language, or talent. ""I think what London needs to be focused on is not Frankfurt or Paris, [it] needs to be focused on New York and Singapore."" However, he said he was not a fan of widespread deregulation to achieve that - no regulatory bonfire for him. ""I wouldn't burn one piece of regulation."" In fact, he said the UK's robust regulation was a major strength, not weakness, and referred to the recent clampdown onfirms offering buy now, pay later schemesas reassuring. ""You see what's happening right now with buy now, pay later, you know, the FCA is going to come in and start to increase the regulation of that marketplace. That's the right thing to do. ""And, in a funny way we've gotten pretty good at working inside the regulatory framework that is here. It protects the financial industry in London as we learn how to deal with this regulation, and it makes the bank safer."" He does admit that money and jobs have moved from the UK as a result of Brexit, but says the impact has been modest. ""Yes, there are some jobs that are going to Europe, that otherwise would have been in the UK, but it's in the hundreds. Barclays employs some 50,000 people in the United Kingdom, roughly 20,000 outside of the UK and 10,000 in the US. ""Some amount of capital has moved but London is still obviously the main centre for Barclays."" His message is that the UK should do everything it can to foster trust and good relations with the EU, but not at the cost of the UK becoming uncompetitive with the bigger fish in the global capital pool. Mr Staley says financial centres like Singapore are London's competition It's not everyone's favourite industry, but the financial services sector employs 1.1 million people, with two-thirds of them outside London. It is nearly 100 times more economically important than fishing and pays a whopping 11% of all taxes. It was also almost totally ignored in the Brexit negotiations - access to EU markets enjoyed for decades ended in January. About Â£1 trillion in capital and assets and up to 10,000 jobs left the UK industry as firms set up EU subsidiaries. Big numbers, but in global financial terms, erosion rather than exodus. Catherine McGuinness, head of policy at the City of London Corporation, said that while financial services didn't get much air time in Brexit negotiations, they were better placed because they started preparing years ago. ""We have been disappointed in the lack of focus on the financial professional services sector - this is a critical part of our economy, a critical part in itself for the jobs and tax that it generates. ""But the minute the referendum result was announced, the institutions started planning how they would be able to serve their customers in whatever circumstances developed"" She also agreed with Mr Staley that there is no need or desire for widespread deregulation to create what some have styled a Singapore-on-Thames. ""One reason why people want to come and do business here is because they trust the regulation. We're not hearing any great demand for a bonfire of regulation but we do need to look at how can we keep influencing and working with global standards to meet global challenges."" One of those global challenges is surely climate change and Mr Staley is convinced London can become a major global hub for green finance. He says these ideas are currently where the understanding of the impact of the internet was nearly 30 years ago. ""Climate today is like technology was in 1995. If you think about itâ¦ all the Amazons, the Googles, didn't really exist in 1995 and now it dominates 40% of the economy, I think it's a fair argument that dealing with climate and dealing with the environment is in the same position now."" Confident and controversial words for the boss of a bank that counts climate change activists as regular attendees at its annual shareholder meeting thanks to its involvement in financing fossil fuel projects. But that's the curious thing about money. You would think it's hard to create new products out of it, but it happens. The ability to raise money in dollars on EU markets was the key new thing that propelled London to worldwide significance in the post-war period. Creating new products out of pools of sub-prime mortgages almost destroyed the world's financial system. Harnessing the international demand for financing climate-based projects could be the next big - and hopefully good - thing. It's harder to reinvent a fish or a sheep. Unlike fishing and farming, which got a lot of political attention, and whose businesses are really struggling to adjust, UK financial firms like Barclays seem confident they can adapt to a post-Brexit future. As Mr Staley says, ""you can't tax good ideas"". The UK government thought the powerful financial sector could look after itself. On this evidence, it seems they might have been right. Rishi Sunak will certainly hope so. No Chancellor of the Exchequer in living memory has needed the tax revenue more. How will London change after Brexit?

Lockdowns 'will waste 87 million pints of beer',"Up to 87 million pints of beer will be thrown away as a result of pub closures during Covid lockdowns around the UK, an industry body has calculated. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) called the waste - equivalent to Â£331m in sales - ""heartbreaking"". Chief executive Emma McClarkin urged the government to give publicans more help in the Budget, including extending the VAT cut for the hospitality sector. The Treasury said keeping businesses going was its ""priority"". Barrelled beer not sold by its best-before date has to be returned to breweries and disposed of. For pasteurised beers - including most lagers - this is usually about three to four months after delivery to pubs. For real ales and other unpasteurised beer, the timescale is normally around six to nine weeks. Will the UK's pubs stay shut until May? UK pub numbers rise for the first time in a decade 'Up to 50m pints' going to waste in empty pubs Can you still go to the pub? The BBPA has worked out, from industry feedback, that 70 million pints of beer were thrown away during the first lockdown. With publicans more alert to the risk of wastage - and amid ongoing restrictions imposed on large parts of the UK - they bought less stock after reopening. This meant that, when further lockdowns occurred around the UK last autumn, seven million pints were wasted, with another 10 million expected to go the same way during the current one, the BBPA found. 20Olympic swimming pools 33 millionstandard-sized electric kettles 495,000baths (to the usual level required for a bather) Sources: New South Wales Irrigators' Council, bestkettles.co.uk, Bathbarn.co.uk Before the pandemic, the number of pubs in the UKhad started rising slightly,,externalfollowing many years of decline. But the difficulties since then mean many of the 39,000 premises operating at that point have closed or are ""struggling"", Ms McClarkin told the BBC. ""Pubs and breweries are effectively having to pour their businesses down the drain,"" she said. The licensed trade was ""in limbo"", with ""no idea or clarity from government on when we can reopen again"", she added. Garry Tallent and partner Sandy Masson have incurred big losses during the pandemic Garry Tallent, landlord of the Red Lion in Chobham, Surrey, did up his pub at a cost of around Â£330,000 last year and estimates he has lost Â£20,000 in stock during lockdowns, Â£6,000 of that in beer. ""The government has got to give some real fiscal stimulation to get us through this,"" he said. ""We're all fighters in this trade but we've been through a year of grief through no fault of our own."" Mr Tennant employs 16 staff, whose pension contributions he has continued to pay. His total losses since the pandemic could total Â£130,000 by the time pubs reopen, he said. Ms McClarkin asked Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep thecurrent 5% VAT rate,externalfor the hospitality industry - down from the usual 20% - in place after pubs reopen, arguing that venues closed during lockdowns have not been able to benefit from it yet. Thebusiness rates holiday,external- due to finish at the end of this financial year - should also be extended in the Budget, on 3 March, she added. A Treasury statement said the hospitality sector was receiving ""significant support"", including one-off grants worth up to Â£9,000, monthly grants of up to Â£3,000, and a Â£1,000 grant that was provided to pubs not serving food at the time during tiered restrictions when so-called ""wet pubs"" were forced to close. ''We've also extended the furlough scheme until the end of April, provided 100% relief on business rates, and have cut VAT for hospitality businesses,"" they added. ""At the upcoming Budget we'll outline the next stages of our plan for jobs to support businesses and families across the UK. That has been our priority throughout the past year and it will be the priority for the year to come.""

Some pupils set to return after half-term in Wales,"All schools and colleges in Wales were told to move to online learning at the start of this term Children aged three to seven will return to school after the February half-term, the Welsh Government is expected to confirm on Friday. Most pupils have been learning from home after a surge in Covid cases led to a Welsh lockdown. The decision would mean the foundation phase of primary schools returning from 22 February. But the head of one teaching union said they would not support the move without assurances about teacher safety. Education Minister Kirsty Williams is expected to make the announcement at a lunchtime press conference on Friday. It follows a fall in the number of infections, and negotiations with teaching trade unions, who have called for teachers to be in the priority list for vaccinations. The Welsh Government had been under pressure to set out plans for a return to face-to-face teaching after weeks of lockdown. School return 'unlikely' for all in February Schools return plan 'needs more local Covid work' 'Grave consequences' in closing Wales' schools It comes as other parts of the UK consider when children can return to face-to-face teaching. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said 8 March was the earliest date schools in England could reopen and that""depends on lots of things going right"". In Northern Irelandpupils will not return to school until 8 Marchat the earliest whileScotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 Februaryas schools start a phased reopening. The Covid case rate in Wales is currently the lowest of the UK nations. It now stands at 126 per 100,000 people over seven days - a fall from about 700 before Christmas. Earlier, teachers' union NASUWT said a joint group of unions had given the Welsh Government a list of ""mitigations"" they wanted to see put in place. They include strict social distancing, medical grade masks for teachers in the foundation phase and a ""further consideration of a flexible and phased return"". Neil Butler, its national officer in Wales, said on Friday the union would not support the return to school unless a number of those mitigations were taken on board. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""We've got no indication of what's going to be changed in the operational guidance which fits into those mitigations that we want to see. ""If the operational guidance has taken nothing on board in terms of the joint union mitigation list then we're not going to be able to support this return on the 22nd."" Ucac general secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young said there needed to be ""local flexibility to stagger the return of foundation phase children"". ""We'll also need clear guidelines about social distancing, the use of face-coverings, sufficient ventilation, and which staff are exempt from return and can continue to work from home. ""Above all, school staff need to hear that they figure in the government's priority list for vaccination, particularly those in the foundation phase where it is almost impossible to ensure social distancing."" Young children are expected to return to school after half-term All schools and colleges in Wales were toldto move to online learning before the start of this term in an effort to ""suppress the virus"", Ms Williams said at the start of January. Some schools had been due to openin the new year butunions called for the return to be delayedamid concerns about a variant of coronavirus blamed for a rise in cases before Christmas. Schools and colleges have remained open for children of critical workers and vulnerable pupils, as well as for children who needed to complete essential exams or assessments. Victoria Rosser said she had ""mixed emotions"" about the changes Victoria Rosser, a mother of four from Cwmbran, is on the shielding list and is yet to receive her first dose of the Covid vaccine. She said she wants to be able to make the decision over whether it is safe for her children to return to the classroom. ""I have mixed emotions towards the decision being announced today,"" she said. ""I do not feel it's safe for parents and guardians, who've been placed on the shielding list like me, to send their children until phase one of the priority list are post-three weeks of receiving their vaccine. ""Parents are being crippled with having to balance their children's education, work and running a home. This is not home schooling, it's trying to accommodate three jobs at the same time, which is impossible in the long-term."" Meanwhile, Chris Lawrence, who lives in Cardiff and has three children, said it was ""really important"" children get back to school as soon as possible. He said: ""From my perspective what we've been doing in terms of shutting schools, we were always told it would be the last resort, but at the moment it's been adopted as the thing that we do. If your kids are at home then pretty much all parents have to be at home as well."" Samantha Pearce from Blaenau Gwent, who's daughter Hazel is 10, said she didn't want to see year groups rushed back. But she added: ""The prolonged closure of the schools is having a huge detrimental effect. Schools for us here in Blaenau Gwent have been already been closed for two months now - and children are bored an unengaged with the work."" Rachel Antoniazzi, who is deputy head at Thornhill Primary School in Cardiff, said getting children back into school would be a ""relief"" for parents and teachers, but there were also some concerns for staff. She said: ""I do really honestly believe that the type of learning that foundation phase children are expected to do doesn't work very well from home. It puts a lot of pressure on parents, it's not conducive to the way foundation phase learners are expected to learn."" Ms Antoniazzi's school has been operating as a hub for children of key workers during the lockdown, and will continue to do so for the children in the upper years of the school, alongside reopening for the youngest pupils. ""In an ideal world we would love to welcome the whole school back but we have to be really careful,"" she said. ""I think the biggest fear, and the government have to be really clear on this, is that it's a necessity to reopen schools, but it doesn't mean we're back to normal. ""It's better than being at home but I do want parents to get the message that doesn't mean you can go to playdates."" Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman SiÃ¢n Gwenllian called for school staff and other key workers to be moved to the top of the list in each vaccination priority group. ""Parents, learners and staff need reassurance that the school environment is safe, and there are certainly things that can be done to give them confidence, such as more extensive use of ventilation, school workers moved to the top of their vaccine priority group, and schools must be given all options to enable adequate social distancing in classrooms. ""With a year of hindsight, it pains me to think how much more face-to-face education our children and young people could have had, if Welsh Government had used all the tools in their gift earlier."" Suzy Davies of the Welsh Conservatives questioned the staggered approach Education spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives Suzy Davies welcomed the return but questioned the staggered approach. She added: ""It's been a tough period for children, parents and teachers, and it makes sense for primaries to go back to catch up with each other; these youngest pupils have lost most in terms of learning and vital early-years socialisation. ""We need a can-do, will-do approach from ministers as teachers on the front line want to return to the classroom so long as it's safe to do so. ""They must now put plans in place for those critical secondary years, and to get in the maximum amount of learning to prepare our older learners for college and university with an even more dynamic, innovative, flexible and ultimately safe approach to secondary schools."" The first minister said the youngest pupils would be back in school if virus rates carried on falling. A week later, the indicators are going in the right direction, suggesting three to seven-year-olds will be back in classes on or soon after 22 February. But this process feels different to the return after the summer or after the first lockdown. The virus variants have added another layer of anxiety, and the approach is even more cautious. Older primary pupils may have to learn from home for a while longer, and a return for secondary and college pupils, apart from those doing practical qualifications, still seems to be some way off. BITESIZE CYMRU WALES:Educational programmes in English and Welsh LOCKDOWN LEARNING:How can BBC Bitesize help you learn from home? The first easing of the strictest lockdown rules was last Saturday, when people were able to meet one other person from another household to exercise outside. But people in Wales have been warned they are unlikely to see a ""radical and significant"" easing of the restrictions this month. The health minister said there would need to ""continued"" reductions before the rules can be eased. Vaughan Gething added any ""available headroom"" would be used to help children go back to school. The next Welsh lockdown review is scheduled for 19 February.

Chaotic parish council meeting goes viral,"This video can not be played Jackie Weaver tells Anita Rani what happened in 'that' viral parish council meeting A woman at the centre of a social media storm after a virtual parish council meeting spiralled into chaos has been left surprised by her fame. Jackie Weaver has had ""nothing but positive support"" after remaining calm on the Zoom call which had insults, laughter and members being kicked out. She said she had only been called in to host and ""support"" councillors at Handforth Parish Council in Cheshire. Ms Weaver told the BBC the meetings were ""often less exciting"". A cut down version of the planning and environment meeting on 10 December emerged on Twitter on Thursday and soon became a ""must see"", piquing the interest of millions by Friday morning. During the heated meeting, Ms Weaver kept her cool amid some members being abusive and muttering under their breath as others tried to speak, hysterical laughter and participants answering phone calls. She has since been trending on Twitter along with the council itself, and fans of the video include Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy who asked: ""Who needs Netflix?"" ""Of that meeting, I'm not absolutely sure who was in charge,"" Ms Weaver toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.

'Who cares!' Trump quits Screen Actors Guild,"Donald Trump, pictured in 2006, hosted reality TV show The Apprentice before his presidency Donald Trump has quit America's Screen Actors Guild after it launched a disciplinary hearing into him, citing the US Capitol attack. ""Who cares!"" the former US president wrote in a letter,,externaladding that the union had ""done nothing for me"". ""Thank you,"" was the Guild's brief response. Mr Trump has appeared in a number of films, including Home Alone 2 and Zoolander. He also hosted the US version of The Apprentice TV show. Last month, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) said its disciplinary committee would meet to decide what action should be taken regarding Mr Trump's role in the Capitol riot in Washington DC on 6 January. Five people died and dozens were injured during the pro-Trump siege. Canada broadcaster defends cutting Trump from film How will history remember Trump? ""Donald Trump attacked the values that this union holds most sacred - democracy, truth, respect for our fellow Americans of all races and faiths, and the sanctity of the free press,""said SAG-AFTRA President Gabrielle Carteris.,external ""There's a straight line from his wanton disregard for the truth to the attacks on journalists perpetrated by his followers,"" she said. SAG-AFTRA represents about 160,000 actors, journalists and other media professionals in the US. Mr Trump, a Guild member for more than 30 years, was expected to be expelled at a forthcoming disciplinary meeting. This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol The union shared his resignation letter, which was addressed to its president, a former star of Beverly Hills, 90210, on its website. ""I write to you today regarding the so-called Disciplinary Committee hearing aimed at revoking my union membership. Who cares!"" Mr Trump wrote. ""While I'm not familiar with your work, I'm very proud of my work on movies such as Home Alone 2, Zoolander and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps; and television shows including The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air, Saturday Night Live, and of course, one of the most successful shows in television history, The Apprentice - to name just a few!"" Mr Trump added that he had ""greatly helped"" the cable news business, which he described as a ""dying platform with not much time left"" before he took to politics. He then branded the disciplinary action a ""blatant attempt at free media attention to distract from your dismal record"". On 13 January, Mr Trump became the first president in US history to be impeached twice, after the US House of Representatives accused him of encouraging violence with false claims of election fraud.

Brexit: 71 pages of paperwork for 1 lorry of fish,"""It's slow, it's outdated, it's challenging in a number of ways we never expected,"" says Charlie Samways. His grandfather founded Dorset-based fish merchant Samways 60 years ago, selling fish from a wooden barrow. Today, with Charlie as sales director, the firm promises to get its fish and seafood ""from port to plate"" in 24 hours. But extensive paperwork, rising costs and border delays following the end of the Brexit transition period have put that pledge under threat. Samways buys seafood from 150 local fishermen who operate in Lyme Bay. Its most popular products are Dover sole, lemon sole, cuttlefish and plaice - about 90% of which is exported to France, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy on its fleet of lorries. This Monday, Mr Samways is overseeing the shipment of several tonnes of these fish, as well as scallops and seabass, to the EU on one truck. Before the end of the Brexit transition period, the process was simple, he says. Each shipment needed a delivery note, made up of just one or two forms and invoices. But the UK is now outside the EU - and its customs union and single market - so exporters face a very different set of requirements. Charlie Samways, the firm's sales director, handles cuttlefish heading out on a shipment To begin with, British exporters need an ID number (called an EORI number). They must also make sure the fishermen they work with have a licence to sell sea fish and register their own premises as an ""approved establishment"" to do business with the EU. The firm had taken these steps ahead of time and felt ""ready to go on day one"" when the new trade rules came in, Mr Samways says. But the day-to-day reality is different. Two employees out of eight in the Samways office now focus on Brexit-related administration. Chris Sheath and Katie Smith start filling out the new necessary forms for the lorry at 08:00. For each shipment, they must fill out and submit a catch certificate, which proves that the fish was caught legally. That involves manually entering on a government website 149 different lines of data that was not previously required, such as the name of the vessel that caught the fish and the type of species being exported. The certificate for this shipment is27 pageslong. They also have to get an export health certificate for each consignment to prove that the fish meet EU health standards. Information on the products, such as species and the weight of the fish, is uploaded and sent to an approved vet, who has to inspect the goods on-site later. Mr Samways is considering recruiting a new employee to tackle the extra forms, which take until 13:00 to complete. That would cost the firm Â£30,000-Â£40,000 per year. ""We are a family business and you get used to the fact that you do long hours. But Brexit means we have to put an unholy amount of pressure onto every member of the team."" Throughout the morning, Chris and Katie are also talking to a customs agent that Samways has hired. The customs agent handles the new paperwork requirements on the import side, and produces a ""statement of value"", which istwo pages. Samways pays them roughly Â£200 per shipment to do this, which will work out to about Â£51,000 this year. They input similar information on the fish and upload the catch certificate to an EU system (Traces NT). They also notify French authorities that animal products will soon be arriving at a border control post, which must be done at least one working day in advance. At 14:00, a vet from Sherbourne arrives to inspect the fish. They sign, stamp and number each page of an export health certificate, which for this truck is20 pageslong, after checking the products. Once the vet has watched the truck being loaded and sealed, there are a few final hurdles before the driver can set off. The agent must upload all of the signed-off documents to a UK government system to obtain a customs barcode, which takes about an hour to arrive and is printed out. It is bundled together as part of an ""export pack"" for the shipment, which includes the catch certificates, export health certificates (in English and French), the statement of value and22 invoicesto show at the checkpoint. For this one truck it totals71 pages. At this point, the driver gets ready to go - provided they have a Kent Access Permit, which confirms they have the correct documents for EU import controls before they enter Kent. Each one lasts 24 hours and they need a new one each time they travel to the EU via the Port of Dover. Due to the pandemic, they also need proof of a negative Covid test taken in the last 72 hours. The driver sets off from the depot in Bridport at 17:00 on his way to Dover. Seven or eight 44-tonne Samways' trucks make the same journey each week. At the ferry port, the driver must show the customs barcode that was printed off. No barcode and they may face a fine and severe delays. After the 22:00 ferry crossing through to Dunkirk in France, the driver heads to the border control post. French customs officials there inspect the fish and all of the paperwork. Samways has faced major hold-ups at the French border, with lorries stuck for six or seven hours at a time while forms are examined. The firm's transport manager has had to take urgent phone calls in the middle of the night with updates. A small mistake, or an omission, on one form can also mean a consignment is held. But Mr Samways says their customs agent gets little feedback as to what, if anything, is wrong with the papers. Once any problems are resolved, the French authorities update EU systems with the outcome of the inspection. The fish are approved for release, the driver continues to their destination. Samways' plaice, scallops and sea bass will reach European dinner plates on Wednesday evening - 24 hours longer than was typical before the end of the Brexit transition period. This video can not be played Samways boss: ""The paperwork is excessive... we can't go on like this"" Mr Samways says he initially felt ""extremely prepared"" for Brexit, but was surprised by the ""excessive"" amount of paperwork required. The government says that it is aware of a ""small number of issues"" since 1 Januaryand that the recent announcement of a Â£23m fundfor fishing firms should help those ""experiencing export delays"". But Mr Samways dismisses the suggestion that these are just teething problems. He has concerns that delays and extra costs could mean UK fishermen will take their catch directly to ports on the Continent, cutting out exporters like him. ""That's something we cannot afford.""

Thanks for joining us. The live page writers today were Alice Evans, Cherry Wilson and Alex Therrien. The editors were Vanessa Barford and Owen Amos. We'll soon be bringing our live page to a close for the day, but before we do, here is a recap of the main coronavirus stories today: Spain has become the latest country to limit the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to under-55s. ""The public health commission, at a meeting on Friday and following scientific evidence, has approved setting as 55 the maximum age for people to get the AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19,"" the health ministry said in a statement. Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, and Poland only recommend it for people under 65, and Italy and Belgium for those under 55, because of what they say is a lack of data on its effectiveness in older people. The UK has no age limit.A recent studysaid one shot of the vaccine was 76% effective overall and reduced transmission ""substantially"". And the UK regulator has said ""the data we have show that the vaccine produces a strong immune response in the over-65s, and that it is safe"". Read more on theOxford jab and older people here. A 103-year-old woman - who has already lived through one pandemic - has received her first dose of the Covid vaccine. Hilda Richards from Wrexham - a baby during the Spanish Flu pandemic that began in 1918 - also served as a nurse during World War Two. She initially went to her care home for two weeks, but stayed when the first wave hit. This video can not be played Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones wanted to encourage more people to get the Covid vaccine Facebook has apologised for rejecting a businessman's advert designed to encourage black and Asian people to have the Covid-19 vaccine. Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, whose Black Farmer business produces sausages and other meat products, wanted to raise awareness about the importance of being vaccinated. He decided to use a boosted post, which is the simplest way to advertise on Facebook, and requires approval by the social network before it can run. He posted his vaccination picture on The Black Farmer Facebook business page with the caption: ""Just had my first vaccine everyone! The organisation is amazing. This is the #NHS at its best!"" But when he tried to promote the post on Facebook, it was rejected because it said the content was ""shocking"". Facebook said it had made a mistake and the advert has since been approved.

Here, senior sister Tracy Mellor from the Royal Stoke University Hospital talks about the pressure on her ward. As we have been reporting, the EU has made a slower start to its vaccination programme than other places, including the UK and the US. The EU has given around 3.5 jabs per 100 people, compared to around 17 per 100 in the UK and 11 per 100 in the US. But which of the EU's 27 countries has gone quickest? With restrictions similar to those in place in late summer last year, a return to normal schooling by September should be ""quite achievable"" Fully relaxing coronavirus restrictions by September, when the new school year begins, would see ""significant further disease"", even with a fast vaccine rollout and high uptake of jabs, scientists advising the UK government have warned. In an undated document published by Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on Friday, the experts said a combination of factors, such as more transmissible coronavirus variants, vaccine hesitancy and jabs not working so well in some people could still lead to people getting ill with Covid-19. However, with restrictions similar to those in place in late summer last year, a return to normal schooling by then should be ""quite achievable"", they said. There were 370 new cases recorded in the seven days to 1 February in Corby Corby in Northamptonshire has the highest coronavirus rate among local authorities in England, according to government figures. There were 370 new cases recorded in the seven days to 1 February - the equivalent of 512.3 cases per 100,000 people. This is up from 473.6 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 25 January. Sandwell in the West Midlands has the second highest rate, down from 655.2 to 483.8, with 1,589 new cases. Walsall, also in the West Midlands, is in third place - down from 535.9 to 471.5, with 1,346 new cases. Torridge in North Devon had the lowest rate with 26.4 cases, down from 52.7, with 18 new cases. Of the 315 local areas in England, 15 (5%) saw a rise in case rates and 300 (95%) had a fall. The list has been calculated by the PA news agency based on Public Health England data published on 5 February on the government's coronavirus dashboard. The health authorities in South Africa announced on 18 December that a new variant of Covid 19 had been identified. The strain - called B.1.351 - carries one of the same mutations as the variant first seen in Kent, which makes it easier to spread. On 23 December, thegovernment announcedthat it had detected two cases of the South African strain in the UK (in London and north-west England). So, what did the government do to tackle it and what did its scientific advisers say?Read more here. The Czech Republic may consider following Hungary by using vaccines not yet approved in the EU, its prime minister said during a trip to Budapest. Hungary has given emergency approval to Chinese and Russian vaccines, despite them not being approved at EU level. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about those vaccines, and that his country may consider approving them as ""time is of the essence"". Hungary plans to begin using the Chinese and Russian vaccines this month. Andrej Babis with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Friday Captain Sir Tom Moore's daughter has said his family is planning a ""quiet"" send-off to celebrate his life. Capt Sir Tomdied with Covid-19 on Tuesday- two days after being admitted to hospital with breathing problems. His daughter, Lucy Teixeira, said she learned to share her father with the world after he found fame by raising almost Â£33m for NHS charities ahead of his 100th birthday. She said he had a long life and peaceful death, adding: ""I'm really grateful - he had a good innings."" ""He leaves us with a really strong powerful message - tomorrow is a good day,"" Lucy told ITV News. ""Those words represent his whole life to me."" Read more on this storyhere. This video can not be played Bounce back loans: Hunting down the Covid loan fraudsters More than Â£40bn has been lent to struggling firms though the governmentâs bounce back loan scheme. Worth up to Â£50,000 per application, the loans offer a lifeline to companies on the edge. But financial crime experts fear many billions may have been lost to fraud and mistakes. The BBC's Angus Crawford was given exclusive access to a unit tracking down the fraudsters who took advantage of the scheme. As we reported earlier, the number of daily cases in the UK has fallen sharply from the peak at the start of the year. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 is also now falling - although the total remains high. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine gives people good protection against the new coronavirus variant which is now dominant in the UK, its developers say. They found similar efficacy against theB117 ""Kent"" variant,externalto the original virus, based on swabs from volunteers. It is still unclear how well the jab works againstother variants with more worrying mutations. But the Oxford team says it can easilyupdate its vaccineand deploy a new version in the autumn if needed. Vaccine developers say it is a relatively straightforward process to tweak the current recipe to target any new variants, which occur often in viruses and are not unexpected. Scientists behind the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines also say early research suggests their vaccines appear to protect against the dominant new variant in the UK. Reality Check Talking about the coronavirus lockdown, the Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady said on the BBCâs Today programme:âEven Sage said shutting down hospitality for instance, was not proven to have any significant effect on the transmission of the virusâ. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises the government, has said on a number of occasions that the hospitality sector carries a risk of spreading the virus. These include:  We went back to Sir Graham Brady who pointed us to a line in a Sage document from mid-September. âOverall, the evidence base on which to judge the effectiveness and harms associated with different interventions is weak and so there is considerable uncertainty around the estimates presented here,â the report says. The report notes that this is because âpackages of interventionsâ are often taken together so singling out the impact of one of them is difficult. Itâs worth noting though that the same Sage document includes the âclosure of all bars, restaurants and cafesâ in a list of interventions â to tackle infections â 'that should be considered for immediate introduction'. The US unemployment rate fell from 6.7% to 6.3% in January, new figures show, but only 49,000 jobs were added. The unemployment rate reached 14.7% in April last year, but has fallen steadily since then. As this chart shows, the pandemic led to a dramatic interruption of what had been years of falling unemployment under Presidents Obama and Trump. The leaders of France and Germany have defended the EU's vaccine policy, after a slow start to their programme (see chart below). The EU has a collective approach to buying vaccines, and French President Emmanuel Macron told a news conference: ""I fully support the European approach. What would people say if countries like France and Germany were competing with each other on vaccines?"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe needed to increase pharmaceutical production, but insisted: ""The basic decision to order together as the European Union was and is right."" Macron also seemed to admit the EU had been caught off-guard by the swiftness of vaccine development. ""Nobody could have known that we were going to have safe vaccines so quickly,"" he said. Itâs been a difficult few months with a surge in infections, tens of thousands of deaths and a damaging lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But there are now plenty of reasons to be, at least cautiously, hopeful that we are on the road to recovery. So what are they? Weâre past the peak- Infection levels have been falling since early January and, in recent weeks, that has translated into fewer people being admitted to hospital. Vaccination programme going well- The UK has vaccinated more than 10 million people - more per head of population than almost anywhere in the world. Vaccination should slow the spread- As well as protecting the individual who has been vaccinated from developing Covid, there are growing signs the immunisation programme will also slow the spread of the virus between people. Infection offers long-lasting protection- Another factor that will help reduce the burden of Covid is that so many people have now been exposed to the virus, and the latest research suggests they should have lasting protection. The mutations can be beaten- There has been a lot of concern about how the virus is mutating â with new varients being found in the UK and South Africa. But this does not mean the vaccinations are ineffective. Read more on thishere. There are no current plans to bring in vaccine passports for people who have had both jabs, the health secretary has said. Speaking to journalists, Matt Hancock reiterated that going on holiday is currently ""illegal"" during this latest lockdown. He added: ""Of course, we're constantly working with other countries and we keep these sorts of things under review, but for now there are still 31,670 people in hospital with Covid. ""It's imperative, that even with the good news on the vaccine and even with cases starting to fall, it's imperative that everybody follows the rules and stays at home unless you absolutely have to leave."" Mr Hancock said while there is positive news around the pandemic out there, the country still has ""very serious problems"" that it needs to get through.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lockdowns 'will waste 87 million pints of beer'That's enough liquid to fill 20 Olympic swimming pools - or many, many thousands of baths.UK Politics","Up to 87 million pints of beer will be thrown away as a result of pub closures during Covid lockdowns around the UK, an industry body has calculated. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) called the waste - equivalent to Â£331m in sales - ""heartbreaking"". Chief executive Emma McClarkin urged the government to give publicans more help in the Budget, including extending the VAT cut for the hospitality sector. The Treasury said keeping businesses going was its ""priority"". Barrelled beer not sold by its best-before date has to be returned to breweries and disposed of. For pasteurised beers - including most lagers - this is usually about three to four months after delivery to pubs. For real ales and other unpasteurised beer, the timescale is normally around six to nine weeks. Will the UK's pubs stay shut until May? UK pub numbers rise for the first time in a decade 'Up to 50m pints' going to waste in empty pubs Can you still go to the pub? The BBPA has worked out, from industry feedback, that 70 million pints of beer were thrown away during the first lockdown. With publicans more alert to the risk of wastage - and amid ongoing restrictions imposed on large parts of the UK - they bought less stock after reopening. This meant that, when further lockdowns occurred around the UK last autumn, seven million pints were wasted, with another 10 million expected to go the same way during the current one, the BBPA found. 20Olympic swimming pools 33 millionstandard-sized electric kettles 495,000baths (to the usual level required for a bather) Sources: New South Wales Irrigators' Council, bestkettles.co.uk, Bathbarn.co.uk Before the pandemic, the number of pubs in the UKhad started rising slightly,,externalfollowing many years of decline. But the difficulties since then mean many of the 39,000 premises operating at that point have closed or are ""struggling"", Ms McClarkin told the BBC. ""Pubs and breweries are effectively having to pour their businesses down the drain,"" she said. The licensed trade was ""in limbo"", with ""no idea or clarity from government on when we can reopen again"", she added. Garry Tallent and partner Sandy Masson have incurred big losses during the pandemic Garry Tallent, landlord of the Red Lion in Chobham, Surrey, did up his pub at a cost of around Â£330,000 last year and estimates he has lost Â£20,000 in stock during lockdowns, Â£6,000 of that in beer. ""The government has got to give some real fiscal stimulation to get us through this,"" he said. ""We're all fighters in this trade but we've been through a year of grief through no fault of our own."" Mr Tennant employs 16 staff, whose pension contributions he has continued to pay. His total losses since the pandemic could total Â£130,000 by the time pubs reopen, he said. Ms McClarkin asked Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep thecurrent 5% VAT rate,externalfor the hospitality industry - down from the usual 20% - in place after pubs reopen, arguing that venues closed during lockdowns have not been able to benefit from it yet. Thebusiness rates holiday,external- due to finish at the end of this financial year - should also be extended in the Budget, on 3 March, she added. A Treasury statement said the hospitality sector was receiving ""significant support"", including one-off grants worth up to Â£9,000, monthly grants of up to Â£3,000, and a Â£1,000 grant that was provided to pubs not serving food at the time during tiered restrictions when so-called ""wet pubs"" were forced to close. ''We've also extended the furlough scheme until the end of April, provided 100% relief on business rates, and have cut VAT for hospitality businesses,"" they added. ""At the upcoming Budget we'll outline the next stages of our plan for jobs to support businesses and families across the UK. That has been our priority throughout the past year and it will be the priority for the year to come.""

Myanmar army tightens grip with high profile arrest,"This video can not be played ""We wish them to fall"": Teachers in the city of Yangon have joined protests against Monday's military coup A civil disobedience movement in Myanmar is gaining momentum, with teachers and students protesting against Monday's military coup. Demonstrators at a university in the biggest city, Yangon, chanted support for jailed leader Aung San Suu Kyi and wore red ribbons, her party's colour. Ms Suu Kyi and other leaders have been held since the coup on Monday. Earlier, the military detained another senior leader from her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. Ms Suu Kyi, who has not been seen in public since Monday, is under house arrest, according to her lawyer. He said he was seeking her unconditional release and that of the president, who was also detained, but he had been unable to meet them. Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, has remained mostly calm in the aftermath of the coup, which has plunged the South East Asian country into uncertainty. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Myanmar country profile On Friday afternoon, hundreds of teachers and students gathered outside Dagon University in Yangon, where they displayed the three-finger salute - a sign that has been adopted by protesters in the region to show their opposition to authoritarian rule. They chanted their support for Ms Suu Kyi and carried red flags. ""We will not let our generation suffer under this kind of military dictatorship,"" Min Sithu, a student, told the AFP news agency. Where else have we seen the three-finger salute? By Nyein Chan, BBC Burmese, Yangon The first reaction to the coup was shock and horror. But now people have had time to digest what is happening and are finding different ways to fight back. As the regime takes more steps to tighten its control, an increasing number of people are joining the leaderless civil disobedience campaign demanding a return of the democratically elected government. The military has blocked the most popular social media platform, Facebook, but most people are still able to access it using virtual private networks - VPNs - and that's where lots of the protests are taking place. People here know very well the violent crackdowns the military is capable of, so that's why for now there are no widespread street protests. But there are other ways people can make their voices heard. The lecturers who took part in Friday's campus protests said they were doing it for the next generation. I have an 18-month-old child. I grew up under military rule and the economic sanctions that came as a result of it. I prayed that my son would grow up in a very different Burma.  Now I am not so sure what his future will be like. University teachers have joined the protests elsewhere in the country, like here in Kachin state... ...or here in Sittwe, Rakhine state There have been a number of demonstrations in different parts of Myanmar - the first large-scale street protests seen in the country since the coup. Residents in some cities, including Yangon, have conducted nightly protests from their homes, banging pots and pans and singing revolutionary songs. There have also been daytime flash mobs. About 70 MPs are said to have held an insurgent parliament, to replicate the parliamentary session that was supposed to take place this week. Win Htein (left) is a senior leader in the National League for Democracy led by Aung San Suu Kyi (right) In a pre-dawn phone call with BBC Burmese, Win Htein, a 79-year-old patron of the NLD and strong supporter of Ms Suu Kyi, said he was being taken to the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, by members of the police and the military. He said he was being detained under sedition laws - which carry a maximum punishment of life imprisonment -  although he was not told the exact charge. ""They don't like what I've been talking about. They are afraid of what I'm saying,"" he said. What evidence is there of election fraud in Myanmar? Growing up under Myanmar's military rule How Facebook became Myanmar's 'digital tea shop' How the military disrupted Myanmar's internet There was a small protest in front of a university in Mandalay, the country's second city, on Thursday Many have also gone online to protest against the coup, but the military has now extended its temporary ban on Facebook to cover Twitter and Instagram too. Twitter declined to comment when asked by the BBC if it had seen a spike in new users or tweets from Myanmar. Myanmar coup: 'Our world turned upside down' Fitness coach films video as Myanmar coup unfolds The military overthrew Ms Suu Kyi's government after it claimed a November election won by the NLD was fraudulent, though the country's election commission said there was no evidence to back up these allegations. The move has been met with global outrage. On Thursday,US President Joe Biden called on the military to ""relinquish power"",externaland release detained officials and activists. The US had already threatened severe sanctions on Myanmar. However, the military is seemingly undeterred, continuing down its path of consolidating power and appointing new ministers, says the BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. The UN Security Council also called on the military authorities in Myanmar to release Ms Suu Kyi and other detained leaders - but stopped short of condemning the coup. In doing so, it has brought China and Russia behind a call for her release, in what our correspondent has described as a rare show of international unity. Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, leading to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh. It triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community after she refused to condemn the crackdown or describe it as ethnic cleansing. She has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the November 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.

Thanks for joining us. The live page writers today were Alice Evans, Cherry Wilson and Alex Therrien. The editors were Vanessa Barford and Owen Amos. We'll soon be bringing our live page to a close for the day, but before we do, here is a recap of the main coronavirus stories today: Spain has become the latest country to limit the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to under-55s. ""The public health commission, at a meeting on Friday and following scientific evidence, has approved setting as 55 the maximum age for people to get the AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19,"" the health ministry said in a statement. Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, and Poland only recommend it for people under 65, and Italy and Belgium for those under 55, because of what they say is a lack of data on its effectiveness in older people. The UK has no age limit.A recent studysaid one shot of the vaccine was 76% effective overall and reduced transmission ""substantially"". And the UK regulator has said ""the data we have show that the vaccine produces a strong immune response in the over-65s, and that it is safe"". Read more on theOxford jab and older people here. A 103-year-old woman - who has already lived through one pandemic - has received her first dose of the Covid vaccine. Hilda Richards from Wrexham - a baby during the Spanish Flu pandemic that began in 1918 - also served as a nurse during World War Two. She initially went to her care home for two weeks, but stayed when the first wave hit. This video can not be played Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones wanted to encourage more people to get the Covid vaccine Facebook has apologised for rejecting a businessman's advert designed to encourage black and Asian people to have the Covid-19 vaccine. Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, whose Black Farmer business produces sausages and other meat products, wanted to raise awareness about the importance of being vaccinated. He decided to use a boosted post, which is the simplest way to advertise on Facebook, and requires approval by the social network before it can run. He posted his vaccination picture on The Black Farmer Facebook business page with the caption: ""Just had my first vaccine everyone! The organisation is amazing. This is the #NHS at its best!"" But when he tried to promote the post on Facebook, it was rejected because it said the content was ""shocking"". Facebook said it had made a mistake and the advert has since been approved.

Here, senior sister Tracy Mellor from the Royal Stoke University Hospital talks about the pressure on her ward. As we have been reporting, the EU has made a slower start to its vaccination programme than other places, including the UK and the US. The EU has given around 3.5 jabs per 100 people, compared to around 17 per 100 in the UK and 11 per 100 in the US. But which of the EU's 27 countries has gone quickest? With restrictions similar to those in place in late summer last year, a return to normal schooling by September should be ""quite achievable"" Fully relaxing coronavirus restrictions by September, when the new school year begins, would see ""significant further disease"", even with a fast vaccine rollout and high uptake of jabs, scientists advising the UK government have warned. In an undated document published by Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on Friday, the experts said a combination of factors, such as more transmissible coronavirus variants, vaccine hesitancy and jabs not working so well in some people could still lead to people getting ill with Covid-19. However, with restrictions similar to those in place in late summer last year, a return to normal schooling by then should be ""quite achievable"", they said. There were 370 new cases recorded in the seven days to 1 February in Corby Corby in Northamptonshire has the highest coronavirus rate among local authorities in England, according to government figures. There were 370 new cases recorded in the seven days to 1 February - the equivalent of 512.3 cases per 100,000 people. This is up from 473.6 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 25 January. Sandwell in the West Midlands has the second highest rate, down from 655.2 to 483.8, with 1,589 new cases. Walsall, also in the West Midlands, is in third place - down from 535.9 to 471.5, with 1,346 new cases. Torridge in North Devon had the lowest rate with 26.4 cases, down from 52.7, with 18 new cases. Of the 315 local areas in England, 15 (5%) saw a rise in case rates and 300 (95%) had a fall. The list has been calculated by the PA news agency based on Public Health England data published on 5 February on the government's coronavirus dashboard. The health authorities in South Africa announced on 18 December that a new variant of Covid 19 had been identified. The strain - called B.1.351 - carries one of the same mutations as the variant first seen in Kent, which makes it easier to spread. On 23 December, thegovernment announcedthat it had detected two cases of the South African strain in the UK (in London and north-west England). So, what did the government do to tackle it and what did its scientific advisers say?Read more here. The Czech Republic may consider following Hungary by using vaccines not yet approved in the EU, its prime minister said during a trip to Budapest. Hungary has given emergency approval to Chinese and Russian vaccines, despite them not being approved at EU level. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about those vaccines, and that his country may consider approving them as ""time is of the essence"". Hungary plans to begin using the Chinese and Russian vaccines this month. Andrej Babis with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Friday Captain Sir Tom Moore's daughter has said his family is planning a ""quiet"" send-off to celebrate his life. Capt Sir Tomdied with Covid-19 on Tuesday- two days after being admitted to hospital with breathing problems. His daughter, Lucy Teixeira, said she learned to share her father with the world after he found fame by raising almost Â£33m for NHS charities ahead of his 100th birthday. She said he had a long life and peaceful death, adding: ""I'm really grateful - he had a good innings."" ""He leaves us with a really strong powerful message - tomorrow is a good day,"" Lucy told ITV News. ""Those words represent his whole life to me."" Read more on this storyhere. This video can not be played Bounce back loans: Hunting down the Covid loan fraudsters More than Â£40bn has been lent to struggling firms though the governmentâs bounce back loan scheme. Worth up to Â£50,000 per application, the loans offer a lifeline to companies on the edge. But financial crime experts fear many billions may have been lost to fraud and mistakes. The BBC's Angus Crawford was given exclusive access to a unit tracking down the fraudsters who took advantage of the scheme. As we reported earlier, the number of daily cases in the UK has fallen sharply from the peak at the start of the year. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 is also now falling - although the total remains high. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine gives people good protection against the new coronavirus variant which is now dominant in the UK, its developers say. They found similar efficacy against theB117 ""Kent"" variant,externalto the original virus, based on swabs from volunteers. It is still unclear how well the jab works againstother variants with more worrying mutations. But the Oxford team says it can easilyupdate its vaccineand deploy a new version in the autumn if needed. Vaccine developers say it is a relatively straightforward process to tweak the current recipe to target any new variants, which occur often in viruses and are not unexpected. Scientists behind the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines also say early research suggests their vaccines appear to protect against the dominant new variant in the UK. Reality Check Talking about the coronavirus lockdown, the Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady said on the BBCâs Today programme:âEven Sage said shutting down hospitality for instance, was not proven to have any significant effect on the transmission of the virusâ. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises the government, has said on a number of occasions that the hospitality sector carries a risk of spreading the virus. These include:  We went back to Sir Graham Brady who pointed us to a line in a Sage document from mid-September. âOverall, the evidence base on which to judge the effectiveness and harms associated with different interventions is weak and so there is considerable uncertainty around the estimates presented here,â the report says. The report notes that this is because âpackages of interventionsâ are often taken together so singling out the impact of one of them is difficult. Itâs worth noting though that the same Sage document includes the âclosure of all bars, restaurants and cafesâ in a list of interventions â to tackle infections â 'that should be considered for immediate introduction'. The US unemployment rate fell from 6.7% to 6.3% in January, new figures show, but only 49,000 jobs were added. The unemployment rate reached 14.7% in April last year, but has fallen steadily since then. As this chart shows, the pandemic led to a dramatic interruption of what had been years of falling unemployment under Presidents Obama and Trump. The leaders of France and Germany have defended the EU's vaccine policy, after a slow start to their programme (see chart below). The EU has a collective approach to buying vaccines, and French President Emmanuel Macron told a news conference: ""I fully support the European approach. What would people say if countries like France and Germany were competing with each other on vaccines?"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe needed to increase pharmaceutical production, but insisted: ""The basic decision to order together as the European Union was and is right."" Macron also seemed to admit the EU had been caught off-guard by the swiftness of vaccine development. ""Nobody could have known that we were going to have safe vaccines so quickly,"" he said. Itâs been a difficult few months with a surge in infections, tens of thousands of deaths and a damaging lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But there are now plenty of reasons to be, at least cautiously, hopeful that we are on the road to recovery. So what are they? Weâre past the peak- Infection levels have been falling since early January and, in recent weeks, that has translated into fewer people being admitted to hospital. Vaccination programme going well- The UK has vaccinated more than 10 million people - more per head of population than almost anywhere in the world. Vaccination should slow the spread- As well as protecting the individual who has been vaccinated from developing Covid, there are growing signs the immunisation programme will also slow the spread of the virus between people. Infection offers long-lasting protection- Another factor that will help reduce the burden of Covid is that so many people have now been exposed to the virus, and the latest research suggests they should have lasting protection. The mutations can be beaten- There has been a lot of concern about how the virus is mutating â with new varients being found in the UK and South Africa. But this does not mean the vaccinations are ineffective. Read more on thishere. There are no current plans to bring in vaccine passports for people who have had both jabs, the health secretary has said. Speaking to journalists, Matt Hancock reiterated that going on holiday is currently ""illegal"" during this latest lockdown. He added: ""Of course, we're constantly working with other countries and we keep these sorts of things under review, but for now there are still 31,670 people in hospital with Covid. ""It's imperative, that even with the good news on the vaccine and even with cases starting to fall, it's imperative that everybody follows the rules and stays at home unless you absolutely have to leave."" Mr Hancock said while there is positive news around the pandemic out there, the country still has ""very serious problems"" that it needs to get through.  Â© 2025 BBC.

More Dairy Milk production to return to Bournville,"New investment means 125 million more Dairy Milk bars will be made in Birmingham The owner of Cadbury is set to return more of its Dairy Milk production to its historic Bournville factory. Mondelez International - which owns the chocolate brand - said some production in continental Europe would return to the UK. Announcing a Â£15m investment at the Birmingham site, the company said from 2022, 125 million more Dairy Milk bars would be manufactured there. Bournville village was built by the Cadbury brothers in the 1870s. Bournville has been home to Cadbury since the 1870s Mondelez' UK managing director Louise Stigant said Bournville was still considered the ""heart of Cadbury"" and bringing more Dairy milk production back ""home"" offered an opportunity to invest in the plant. Until now, about two thirds of Cadbury's chocolate has been made in Birmingham, and the company said the new investment would see ""almost all"" of its products made at Bournville. About Â£11m of the new funding will go towards a new production line. The remaining Â£4m will be spent increasing its chocolate-making capacity. Last year, Bournville produced 35,000 tonnes of Cadbury Dairy Milk tablets - about 234 million bars - and this investment will allow them to make an additional 12,000 tonnes of chocolate. Some production will remain overseas, Mondelez said, and the firm also confirmed the investment would not lead to the creation of any new jobs. Memories of Cadbury's 'factory in a garden' Latest news and updates from the West Midlands ""At a time when manufacturing in the UK is facing significant challenges, it has never been more vital to secure the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of our business,"" Ms Stigant added. Millions of chocolate bars are produced at the Bournville factory Joe Clarke, national officer for Unite, said the decision meant the long-term security of the site was now ""very positive"". ""It's exceptional news as a proud Brummie who's looked after the site Cadbury site for a number of years, it's always good to see job security, investment and more products coming back to the UK and in particular Birmingham,"" he said. ""It's the home of Cadbury Dairy Milk and I think it's welcome to be having this increase in volumes with the increase in demand for chocolate under the present times we are enduring."" Mondelez, which owns other brands including Toblerone and Milka, is one of the largest chocolate, biscuit and coffee producers in the EU. ""Bournville is now much more competitive across our manufacturing network, particularly when it comes to producing high volume products such as Cadbury Dairy Milk tablets,"" Bournville manufacturing director, Roberto Gambaccini, said. ""It's important that we continue this journey and this investment will see us take full advantage of the efficiencies that modernisation, and upskilling can create to continue the growth and success of the Bournville site.""

MPs challenge value for money of meal vouchers,"MPs wanted better protection for taxpayers' spending on the school vouchers contract The Department for Education should have sought better value for money from a private contract for vouchers to replace free school meals in England during the pandemic, MPs have warned. The Public Accounts Committee spending watchdog warned of ""missed potential opportunities"" for savings in the Â£425m deal with voucher firm Edenred. MPs said the DfE seemed ""surprisingly unconcerned"" about the firm's profits. But Edenred rejected ""entirely any suggestion of profiteering"". A DfE statement also dismissed accusations of profiteering, adding: ""In its investigation the National Audit Office acknowledged the rapid action this government took to deliver free school meals for eligible pupils, the significant improvements that were made to the scheme and our oversight of it."" A total of Â£380m worth of food vouchers were issued to disadvantaged families in England between March and August 2020, when children could not get free meals in school. But in the early stages, there were ""serious problems"" and ""unacceptable delays"" with the scheme, according to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report. The vouchers replaced free meals when schools were closed Both the DfE and Edenred took over a month to realise 40,000 order codes for conversion into vouchers had not been delivered to families, say MPs. Edenred's website was also difficult to navigate and its systems failed to cope with the volume of calls and emails from families struggling to access the scheme. Families still waiting for free meal vouchers Schools give food while vouchers delayed What free school meals are children supposed to get? Compass apologises for school meal parcels that 'fell short' Meanwhile, the DfE extended the contract with Edenred on two occasions, which was originally worth Â£78m, but did not seek to renegotiate any of the terms. The DfE was ""surprisingly unconcerned about whether Edenred was profiting from the voucher scheme at taxpayers' expense,"" said the report, ""and missed potential opportunities to reduce the cost or share in the profits."" The Edenred voucher scheme was relaunched in January this year to provide vouchers worth Â£15 a week to disadvantaged children in England. Meg Hillier, the committee's chairwoman, said: ""Government's failure to learn from its repeated contracting mistakes, over and over, large and small, is costing this nation too dear. ""After the initial urgency we have seen the government continuing to play catch up on how to support families whose children are entitled to free school meals and despite the contract with Edenred growing more than five-fold there was no discussion about tendering the contract or even renegotiating it."" The Association of School and College Leaders' general secretary, Geoff Barton, called the service provided by Edenred ""an absolute shambles"", adding that ""it adds insult to injury"" to find out that opportunities to reduced costs were ""missed"". ""The DfE is constantly lecturing schools about the importance of running efficiently and saving costs wherever possible, but appears not to have brought the same rigour to bear on its own management of this scheme,"" said Mr Barton. Edenred's profits from the scheme are not in the public domain but the DfE has previously said it's ""very comfortable"" with the money the French-owned company made. One per cent of the contract's value has been handed back to the government as part of a rebate, according to a spokesman for the firm. The government agreed a Â£425m contract with the voucher firm Edenred The spokesman said: ""With 95% of families saying [the scheme] has worked well for them and a contract which has ensured that every pound of public money was passed on to the children and families who needed it, with no charges to the DfE or the taxpayer, Edenred has delivered a programme which has provided vital support for families through the pandemic and value for money for the DfE."" However, the PAC report called on the government to learn lessons ""to secure better value for the taxpayer"" in the future. The report also criticised the DfE's failure to hold Edenred to the terms of the contract, including a requirement that Edenred answer 90% of telephone enquiries within 30 seconds, which it failed to meet, with many calls unanswered. It also said DfE should have done more to ensure supermarket chains taking part in the scheme were accessible to families, as early on almost 2,500 schools were more than 5km from a participating shop. Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: ""The scheme came up short not least because the Department for Education had insufficient understanding of the real-world needs of low income parents. ""We know that cash payments work best for families as they allow flexibility, safety and choice - and give parents confidence that they can reliably feed their children -  since every shop takes cash and everyone knows how it works."" A DfE statement said: ""We have already made further improvements to the scheme which take account of the recommendations in [the PAC] report, including improving the terms of the contract to ensure the better value for money for taxpayers.""

Brexit: 71 pages of paperwork for 1 lorry of fishHow new rules on exporting to the European Union have affected a British fishing firm.Business,"""It's slow, it's outdated, it's challenging in a number of ways we never expected,"" says Charlie Samways. His grandfather founded Dorset-based fish merchant Samways 60 years ago, selling fish from a wooden barrow. Today, with Charlie as sales director, the firm promises to get its fish and seafood ""from port to plate"" in 24 hours. But extensive paperwork, rising costs and border delays following the end of the Brexit transition period have put that pledge under threat. Samways buys seafood from 150 local fishermen who operate in Lyme Bay. Its most popular products are Dover sole, lemon sole, cuttlefish and plaice - about 90% of which is exported to France, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy on its fleet of lorries. This Monday, Mr Samways is overseeing the shipment of several tonnes of these fish, as well as scallops and seabass, to the EU on one truck. Before the end of the Brexit transition period, the process was simple, he says. Each shipment needed a delivery note, made up of just one or two forms and invoices. But the UK is now outside the EU - and its customs union and single market - so exporters face a very different set of requirements. Charlie Samways, the firm's sales director, handles cuttlefish heading out on a shipment To begin with, British exporters need an ID number (called an EORI number). They must also make sure the fishermen they work with have a licence to sell sea fish and register their own premises as an ""approved establishment"" to do business with the EU. The firm had taken these steps ahead of time and felt ""ready to go on day one"" when the new trade rules came in, Mr Samways says. But the day-to-day reality is different. Two employees out of eight in the Samways office now focus on Brexit-related administration. Chris Sheath and Katie Smith start filling out the new necessary forms for the lorry at 08:00. For each shipment, they must fill out and submit a catch certificate, which proves that the fish was caught legally. That involves manually entering on a government website 149 different lines of data that was not previously required, such as the name of the vessel that caught the fish and the type of species being exported. The certificate for this shipment is27 pageslong. They also have to get an export health certificate for each consignment to prove that the fish meet EU health standards. Information on the products, such as species and the weight of the fish, is uploaded and sent to an approved vet, who has to inspect the goods on-site later. Mr Samways is considering recruiting a new employee to tackle the extra forms, which take until 13:00 to complete. That would cost the firm Â£30,000-Â£40,000 per year. ""We are a family business and you get used to the fact that you do long hours. But Brexit means we have to put an unholy amount of pressure onto every member of the team."" Throughout the morning, Chris and Katie are also talking to a customs agent that Samways has hired. The customs agent handles the new paperwork requirements on the import side, and produces a ""statement of value"", which istwo pages. Samways pays them roughly Â£200 per shipment to do this, which will work out to about Â£51,000 this year. They input similar information on the fish and upload the catch certificate to an EU system (Traces NT). They also notify French authorities that animal products will soon be arriving at a border control post, which must be done at least one working day in advance. At 14:00, a vet from Sherbourne arrives to inspect the fish. They sign, stamp and number each page of an export health certificate, which for this truck is20 pageslong, after checking the products. Once the vet has watched the truck being loaded and sealed, there are a few final hurdles before the driver can set off. The agent must upload all of the signed-off documents to a UK government system to obtain a customs barcode, which takes about an hour to arrive and is printed out. It is bundled together as part of an ""export pack"" for the shipment, which includes the catch certificates, export health certificates (in English and French), the statement of value and22 invoicesto show at the checkpoint. For this one truck it totals71 pages. At this point, the driver gets ready to go - provided they have a Kent Access Permit, which confirms they have the correct documents for EU import controls before they enter Kent. Each one lasts 24 hours and they need a new one each time they travel to the EU via the Port of Dover. Due to the pandemic, they also need proof of a negative Covid test taken in the last 72 hours. The driver sets off from the depot in Bridport at 17:00 on his way to Dover. Seven or eight 44-tonne Samways' trucks make the same journey each week. At the ferry port, the driver must show the customs barcode that was printed off. No barcode and they may face a fine and severe delays. After the 22:00 ferry crossing through to Dunkirk in France, the driver heads to the border control post. French customs officials there inspect the fish and all of the paperwork. Samways has faced major hold-ups at the French border, with lorries stuck for six or seven hours at a time while forms are examined. The firm's transport manager has had to take urgent phone calls in the middle of the night with updates. A small mistake, or an omission, on one form can also mean a consignment is held. But Mr Samways says their customs agent gets little feedback as to what, if anything, is wrong with the papers. Once any problems are resolved, the French authorities update EU systems with the outcome of the inspection. The fish are approved for release, the driver continues to their destination. Samways' plaice, scallops and sea bass will reach European dinner plates on Wednesday evening - 24 hours longer than was typical before the end of the Brexit transition period. This video can not be played Samways boss: ""The paperwork is excessive... we can't go on like this"" Mr Samways says he initially felt ""extremely prepared"" for Brexit, but was surprised by the ""excessive"" amount of paperwork required. The government says that it is aware of a ""small number of issues"" since 1 Januaryand that the recent announcement of a Â£23m fundfor fishing firms should help those ""experiencing export delays"". But Mr Samways dismisses the suggestion that these are just teething problems. He has concerns that delays and extra costs could mean UK fishermen will take their catch directly to ports on the Continent, cutting out exporters like him. ""That's something we cannot afford.""

Pub closures will 'waste 87 million pints of beer',"Up to 87 million pints of beer will be thrown away as a result of pub closures during Covid lockdowns around the UK, an industry body has calculated. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) called the waste - equivalent to Â£331m in sales - ""heartbreaking"". Chief executive Emma McClarkin urged the government to give publicans more help in the Budget, including extending the VAT cut for the hospitality sector. The Treasury said keeping businesses going was its ""priority"". Barrelled beer not sold by its best-before date has to be returned to breweries and disposed of. For pasteurised beers - including most lagers - this is usually about three to four months after delivery to pubs. For real ales and other unpasteurised beer, the timescale is normally around six to nine weeks. Will the UK's pubs stay shut until May? UK pub numbers rise for the first time in a decade 'Up to 50m pints' going to waste in empty pubs Can you still go to the pub? The BBPA has worked out, from industry feedback, that 70 million pints of beer were thrown away during the first lockdown. With publicans more alert to the risk of wastage - and amid ongoing restrictions imposed on large parts of the UK - they bought less stock after reopening. This meant that, when further lockdowns occurred around the UK last autumn, seven million pints were wasted, with another 10 million expected to go the same way during the current one, the BBPA found. 20Olympic swimming pools 33 millionstandard-sized electric kettles 495,000baths (to the usual level required for a bather) Sources: New South Wales Irrigators' Council, bestkettles.co.uk, Bathbarn.co.uk Before the pandemic, the number of pubs in the UKhad started rising slightly,,externalfollowing many years of decline. But the difficulties since then mean many of the 39,000 premises operating at that point have closed or are ""struggling"", Ms McClarkin told the BBC. ""Pubs and breweries are effectively having to pour their businesses down the drain,"" she said. The licensed trade was ""in limbo"", with ""no idea or clarity from government on when we can reopen again"", she added. Garry Tallent and partner Sandy Masson have incurred big losses during the pandemic Garry Tallent, landlord of the Red Lion in Chobham, Surrey, did up his pub at a cost of around Â£330,000 last year and estimates he has lost Â£20,000 in stock during lockdowns, Â£6,000 of that in beer. ""The government has got to give some real fiscal stimulation to get us through this,"" he said. ""We're all fighters in this trade but we've been through a year of grief through no fault of our own."" Mr Tennant employs 16 staff, whose pension contributions he has continued to pay. His total losses since the pandemic could total Â£130,000 by the time pubs reopen, he said. Ms McClarkin asked Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep thecurrent 5% VAT rate,externalfor the hospitality industry - down from the usual 20% - in place after pubs reopen, arguing that venues closed during lockdowns have not been able to benefit from it yet. Thebusiness rates holiday,external- due to finish at the end of this financial year - should also be extended in the Budget, on 3 March, she added. A Treasury statement said the hospitality sector was receiving ""significant support"", including one-off grants worth up to Â£9,000, monthly grants of up to Â£3,000, and a Â£1,000 grant that was provided to pubs not serving food at the time during tiered restrictions when so-called ""wet pubs"" were forced to close. ''We've also extended the furlough scheme until the end of April, provided 100% relief on business rates, and have cut VAT for hospitality businesses,"" they added. ""At the upcoming Budget we'll outline the next stages of our plan for jobs to support businesses and families across the UK. That has been our priority throughout the past year and it will be the priority for the year to come.""
