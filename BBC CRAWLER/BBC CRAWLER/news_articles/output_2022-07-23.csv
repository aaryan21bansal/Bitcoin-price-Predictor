Paid leave for premature births aims to be a relief,"Hazel with her son Theo Parents could take up to an extra 12 weeks of paid leave if their child is born prematurely, as part of a new law. Both parents would qualify for one week's extra help - in addition to existing maternity and paternity leave and pay entitlements - for every seven days their baby was in neonatal care. One in seven UK newborns,externalneeds to be placed in a specialist hospital unit. The Neonatal Care (Leave and Pay) Bill completed its second reading in Parliament last week. Proposed by SNP MP Stuart McDonald, it still needs to go through a number of stages of parliamentary scrutiny before becoming law but has received cross-party support in the House of Commons. Itwould also provide support,externalfor babies born at full term who need neonatal care, so long as they are no older than 28 days when admitted to a unit. When Hazel Naghi gave birth to her son Theo at 32 weeks, last year, she had to split her time at hospital with her partner, Oliver, a night-shift worker. ""Because of his prematurity, we had to be transferred to another hospital an hour away [when he was born] and he spent five days in that hospital in an incubator,"" she tells BBC News. ""He was then transferred back to the local hospital and spent a further four weeks in there until we could bring him home Even then, Theo needed a feeding tube for an additional month. Hazel ""wouldn't have been mentally prepared"" to return to work nine months after Theo's due date and says the extra time off proposed in this bill would have really helped, making her feel ""she wasn't alone"". ""It means a lot that the government understands this happens on a regular basis,"" Hazel says, ""and this law would take weight off the minds of parents and give them a sense of relief. ""Having a baby prematurely is a very different experience to having a child full term. ""I don't think many people realise how common it is to have a premature baby, so knowing that there could be support from the government and that your employer would mean you wouldn't have to panic."" Theo was born at 32 weeks More than 100,000 babies were admitted to neonatal care in the UK in 2016,research from Imperial College London,externalshows. And Mr McDonald told MPs his proposal would ""give parents the emotional and financial support needed at a time of great stress and trauma"". Others shared their experiences, including fellow SNP MP David Linden, who said he would remember until his ""dying day"" watching his daughter turn blue in an incubator as neonatal nurses rushed to resuscitate her. A baby is considered to be premature if it is born before the 37th week of pregnancy. It is possible for a baby to survive when born at about 24 weeks of pregnancy - but the earlier it is, the more complications there could be. With incubators to keep babies warm, neonatal units are also used for newborns with complications such as low weight, infections and jaundice and recovery from surgery or a difficult birth. Source: NHS,external All mothers are entitled to 52 weeks'maternity leave,external, while paid paternity leave is up to two weeks. Parents can also split their leave between them - up to 50 weeks' leave and 37 weeks' pay. Some employers offer more time off, at their discretion.

"The audacious PR plot that spread climate change doubtThirty years ago, a bold plan was hatched to persuade people that climate change was not a problem.","Thirty years ago, a bold plan was cooked up to spread doubt and persuade the public that climate change was not a problem. The little-known meeting - between some of America's biggest industrial players and a PR genius - forged a devastatingly successful strategy that endured for years, and the consequences of which are all around us. On an early autumn day in 1992, E Bruce Harrison, a man widely acknowledged as the father of environmental PR, stood up in a room full of business leaders and delivered a pitch like no other. At stake was a contract worth half a million dollars a year - about Â£850,000 in today's money. The prospective client, the Global Climate Coalition (GCC) - which represented the oil, coal, auto, utilities, steel, and rail industries - was looking for a communications partner to change the narrative on climate change. Don Rheem and Terry Yosie, two of Harrison's team present that day, are sharing their stories for the first time. ""Everybody wanted to get the Global Climate Coalition account,"" says Rheem, ""and there I was, smack in the middle of it."" The GCC had been conceived only three years earlier, as a forum for members to exchange information and lobby policy makers against action to limit fossil fuel emissions. Though scientists were making rapid progress in understanding climate change, and it was growing in salience as a political issue, in its first years the Coalition saw little cause for alarm. President George HW Bush was a former oilman, and as a senior lobbyist told the BBC in 1990, his message on climate was the GCC's message. There would be no mandatory fossil fuel reductions. But all that changed in 1992. In June, the international community created a framework for climate action, and November's presidential election brought committed environmentalist Al Gore into the White House as vice-president. It was clear the new administration would try to regulate fossil fuels. The Coalition recognised that it needed strategic communications help and put out a bid for a public relations contractor. E Bruce Harrison was known as the âDean of green PRâ Though few outside the PR industry might have heard of E Bruce Harrison or the eponymous company he had run since 1973, he had a string of campaigns for some of the US's biggest polluters under his belt. He had worked for the chemical industry discrediting research on the toxicity of pesticides; for the tobacco industry, and had recently run a campaign against tougher emissions standards for the big car makers. Harrison had built a firm that was considered one of the very best. Media historian Melissa Aronczyk, who interviewed Harrison before he died in 2021, says he was a strategic linchpin for his clients, ensuring everyone was on the same page. ""He was a master at what he did,"" she says. Big Oil v the World Drawing on thousands of newly discovered documents, this three-part film charts how the oil industry mounted a campaign to sow doubt about the science of climate change, the consequences of which we are living through today. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Before the pitch, Harrison had assembled a team of both seasoned PR professionals and almost total novices. Among them was Don Rheem, who had no industry credentials. He had studied ecology before becoming an environmental journalist. A chance meeting with Harrison, who must have seen the strategic value of adding Rheem's environmental and media connections to the team, led to a job offer on the GCC pitch. ""I thought, 'Wow, this is an opportunity to get a front row seat at probably one of the most pressing science policy and public policy issues that we were facing.' ""It just felt enormously important,"" Rheem says. Don Rheem as a younger man Terry Yosie - who had recently been recruited from the American Petroleum Institute, becoming a senior vice-president at the firm - remembers that Harrison began the pitch by reminding his audience that he was instrumental in fighting the auto reforms. He had done so, in part, by reframing the issue. The same tactics would now help beat climate regulation. They would persuade people that the scientific facts weren't settled, and that alongside the environment, policy makers needed to consider how action on climate change would - in the GCC's view - negatively affect American jobs, trade and prices. The strategy would be implemented through an extensive media campaign, everything from placing quotes and pitching opinion pieces (so-called op-eds), to direct contacts with journalists. An extract from a GCC business card for reporters, shared by former journalist Nicky Sundt ""A lot of reporters were assigned to write stories,"" Rheem says, ""and they were struggling with the complexity of the issue. So I would write backgrounders so reporters could read them and get up to speed."" Uncertainty ran through the full gamut of the GCC's publications, a creative array of letters, glossy brochures, and monthly newsletters. Rheem and the team were prolific - within a year, Harrison's firm claimed to have secured more than 500 specific mentions in the media. An extract from a 1994/5 GCC booklet made by E Bruce Harrison's team, from the collection of Nicky Sundt In August 1993, Harrison took stock of progress in another meeting with the GCC. ""The rising awareness of the scientific uncertainty has caused some in Congress to pause on advocating new initiatives,"" declared an updated internal strategy pitch, shared with the BBC by Terry Yosie. ""Activists sounding the alarm over 'global warming' have publicly conceded that they lost ground in the communications arena over the past year."" Now, Harrison counselled, they needed to expand the external voices making their case. ""Scientists, economists, academics and other noted experts carry greater credibility with the media and general public than industry representatives."" Harrison was ""a master at what he did,"" says historian Melissa Aronczyk, who shared this undated advert with the BBC While most climate scientists agreed that human-caused climate change was a real issue that would require action, a small group argued there was no cause for alarm. The plan was to pay these sceptics to give speeches or write op-eds - about $1,500 (Â£1,250) per article - and to arrange media tours so they could appear on local TV and radio stations. ""My role was to identify the voices that were not in the mainstream and to give those voices a stage,"" Rheem says. ""There was a lot we didn't know at the time. And part of my role was to highlight what we didn't know."" He says the media was hungry for these perspectives. ""Journalists were actually actively looking for the contrarians. It was really feeding an appetite that was already there."" Many of these sceptics or deniers have rejected the idea that funding from the GCC and other industry groups had any impact on their views. But the scientists and environmentalists tasked with repudiating them - arguing the reality of climate change - encountered a well-organised and effective campaign they found hard to match. ""The Global Climate Coalition is seeding doubt everywhere, fogging the airâ¦ And environmentalists really don't know what's hitting them,"" environmental campaigner John Passacantando remembers. ""What the geniuses of the PR firms who work for these big fossil fuel companies know is that truth has nothing to do with who wins the argument. If you say something enough times, people will begin to believe it."" Harrison's company paid experts to argue that mainstream climate scientists were overstating the problem In a document dating from around 1995, shared with the BBC by Melissa Aronczyk, Harrison wrote that the ""GCC has successfully turned the tide on press coverage of global climate change science, effectively countering the eco-catastrophe message and asserting the lack of scientific consensus on global warming."" The groundwork had been laid for the industry's biggest campaign to date - opposing international efforts to negotiate emissions reductions at Kyoto, in Japan, in December 1997. By then, a consensus had emerged among scientists that human-caused warming was now detectable. But the US public was still showing signs of doubt. As many as 44% of respondents to a Gallup poll believed scientists were divided. Public antipathy made it harder for politicians to fight for action, and America never implemented the agreement reached in Kyoto. It was a major victory for the industry coalition. ""I think E Bruce Harrison was proud of the work he did. He knew how central he had been to moving the needle on how companies intervened in the conversation about global warming,"" says Aronczyk. The same year as the Kyoto negotiation, Harrison sold his firm. Rheem decided that public relations wasn't the right career, while Yosie had long since moved on to other environmental projects for the firm. Meanwhile, the GCC began to disintegrate, as some members grew uncomfortable with its hard line. But the tactics, the playbook, and the message of doubt were now embedded and would outlive their creators. Three decades on, the consequences are all around us. ""I think it's the moral equivalent of a war crime,"" says former US Vice-President Al Gore of the big oil companies' efforts to block action. ""I think it is, in many ways, the most serious crime of the post-World War Two era, anywhere in the world. The consequences of what they've done are just almost unimaginable."" Don Rheem is now a workplace and leadership consultant ""Would I do anything differently? It's a hard question to answer,"" reflects Don Rheem, who says he was ""way down the totem pole"" of the GCC's operation. ""There's some sadness that not much has happened."" He maintains that climate science was too uncertain in the 1990s to warrant ""drastic actions"", and that developing countries - particularly China and Russia - have ultimately been responsible for the decades of climate inaction, rather than American industry. ""I think it's really easy to create a conspiracy theory about really pernicious intent of industry to completely halt any progress,"" Rheem says. ""Personally, I didn't see that. ""I was very young. I was very curious... Knowing what I know today, would I have done some things differently then? ""Perhaps, probably."" How do we know climate change is caused by humans?

Too many divorces wrongly ending in court - judge,"Too many divorce cases are going to court and the language used there is too hostile, a leading judge has said. Sir Andrew McFarlane - who is head of family courts in England and Wales - estimated one fifth of marriage break-ups were wrongly ending up in court with one partner suing the other. He said parents are fooling themselves if they think children are unaffected. It is a rare public intervention from a sitting judge and his remarks are likely to resonate with many families. Speaking toBBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme,Sir Andrew said thousands of divorce cases were rightly heard in court because of safety concerns for the adults and children involved. But the top family judge said still too many were ending up in court because couples saw their issue as a legal issue, rather than a relationship issue. He said ""the law provides a structure... to resolve the dispute"" but ""in the end, it is not a legal issue, it's a relationship problem that they have"". He added: ""We are seen at the moment as the first port of call, but we should be the last resort for them where there aren't issues of domestic abuse or protection or safeguarding. ""My feeling is that about 20% of the families who come to court to have a dispute about their children resolved, would be better served by at least, first of all trying to sort it out themselves in other ways."" And he said the hostile, adversarial language used in family court often made things worse and needs to change - comparing the problem to the bitter divorce battle made famous in the 1979 film Kramer Vs Kramer. ""The court cases are still listed as Smith against Smith or whatever it is and barristers talk about 'my opponent' or someone is the 'applicant' and someone is the 'respondent',"" he said. ""And we have hearings which are called dispute resolution hearings where we should just be problem solving for the future of the child."" Sir Andrew also spoke about how the lengthy process could be harming children. ""Research shows consistently that if you're the child of parents who are at odds with each other, whether or not they are coming to court, that is unhealthy. It does your head in to put it in straightforward terms."" ""You've just asked me about whether children are harmed by what goes on in their family and the evidence is, yes. And parents are, I think, fooling themselves if they say we are not involving the children or the children don't know."" He said family courts were trialling cases being provided with a ""child impact assessment"" - to ""provide a wake up call to the parents as to the impact of what they are doing on their child"". In 2020,a report by the Family Solutions Group,externalfound the family justice system was in crisis, with the numbers of parents making applications unmanageable. Sir Andrew said the report was accurate - and that they were ""fully stretched"". Latest figuresfrom the Office for National Statistics,externalshow that there were more than 103,000 divorces in England and Wales in 2020. In his interview, Sir Andrew said he thought the family court's role in society was ""very important"" and people ""need to know more about what we do"". The Ministry of Justice said it had introduced the biggest change to divorce law in half a century, including Â£324m of investment ""to provide swifter access to justice in family courts"". A spokesperson also highlighted funding for a scheme providing a Â£500 contribution to mediation services, saying it could help families ""resolve their disputes without the stress and trauma of lengthy courtroom battles"".

"Xi Jinping vaccinated against Covid, China says","Xi Jinping has been vaccinated against Covid, officials said President Xi Jinping and other top politicians have been given domestically produced Covid vaccines, China has said. The news was released as part of a campaign to increase vaccination rates, especially of boosters. The deputy head of China's National Health Commission, Zeng Yixin, said it showed the leadership's confidence in the Chinese vaccines. Health information about these figures is not usually shared with the public. Mr Zeng said the country's leaders had ""all taken the home-grown Covid-19 vaccination jabs"". He added: ""This has fully displayed that they attach great importance to the epidemic prevention and control work and highly trust the home-grown Covid-19 vaccines."" Officials are trying to increase vaccination rates, which are considered too low for the country to reopen safely. China continues to follow a""zero Covid""strategy, including mass testing, strict isolation rules and local lockdowns. While there have been far fewer deaths than in many other countries, this approach is facing growing opposition as people and businesses continue to face thestrain of restrictions. President Xi has repeatedly said that there is no alternative to zero Covid. China has seen 2,167,619 cases and 14,647 deaths since the pandemic began, according toJohns Hopkins University,external. This compares with 23,088,074 cases and 181,398 deaths in the UK. An outbreak of Covid inShanghaiin April saw the city placed into lockdown for more than two months. During the outbreak, concerns were raised over low vaccination rates. Officials said just 38% of those over 60 had received a booster, while only 15% of over-80s had been given two doses. Recent figures show that across the country, 90% of people have now had two jabs.

Massive NHS backlog is national emergency - Sunak,"Tackling the backlog in the NHS is the biggest public services emergency, Rishi Sunak has said, as he and Liz Truss vie to become the UK's next prime minister. More than 6.6 million people in England are waiting for hospital treatment. Mr Sunak plans to eliminate one-year waiting times by September 2024 and get overall numbers falling by next year. Meanwhile, Ms Truss has announced plans for a ""bonfire"" of EU laws retained after Brexit. She has promised to scrap or replace laws that she argues hinder growth by the end of 2023. Speaking in Kent, where she was meeting Conservative party members, Ms Truss said it was time for ""bold action"" to drive the economy forward. ""I would make sure that people who work hard are rewarded, I'd make sure that businesses have incentives to invest in Britain so that we can get the jobs and growth we need to succeed at the next election and to drive Britain forward in the future."" The pledges come as the two remaining contenders in the contest to be party leader and the next prime minister step up campaigning, with Conservative Party members due to start receiving ballot papers this week. The winner will be announced on 5 September. What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Who are the Tories that will choose the next PM? Truss v Sunak: Who is winning the social media war? In a campaign speech in Grantham, the hometown of former Tory PM Margaret Thatcher, Mr Sunak said tackling the NHS backlog was the biggest public service emergency. ""We need a fundamentally different approach,"" he said. ""We will take the best of our Covid response and apply those lessons to clearing the massive backlog in the NHS."" Without a radically different approach, the NHS will come under unsustainable pressure and break, Mr Sunak says. As part of a number of measures, he is promising to offer more diagnostic services - such as MRI and CT scans - in repurposed empty High Street shops. Mr Sunak told his wife and children he had never been prouder to say he loved them all Mr Sunak admitted he was the ""underdog"" in the race to become prime minister. The former chancellor claimed there were ""forces"" in the Tory party who wanted the contest to be a ""coronation"" for his rival, Ms Truss, tipped as favourite among Conservative party voters. He went on to criticise her plans for tax cuts, saying there was ""nothing noble or good about wracking up money"" on credit. He said no amount of undeliverable promises would change that, in another swipe at Ms Truss. Speaking to the Times,externalearlier, Mr Sunak said a ""business-as-usual mentality isn't going to cut it"" when it comes to dealing with challenges that are ""staring us in the face"", including the economy, migration as well as the NHS. ""From day one of being in office I'm going to put us on a crisis footing."" Liz Truss, pictured here in Kent, is hoping to woo party members with a pitch to scrap EU laws Ms Truss rejected Mr Sunak's criticism that it would be wrong to raise government borrowing to fund tax cuts - a major policy difference between the candidates. She is pledging around Â£30bn in immediate tax cuts, arguing they will boost growth, while Mr Sunak has said immediate cuts could fuel already-soaring inflation. The foreign secretary said: ""We know fuel bills are higher. We know that food bills are higher. And what my changes would do is help people with the cost of living, but also drive growth in the economy that's going to lead to higher tax revenues so we can pay back that debt."" Ms Truss added: ""I'm being very honest about the situation. We face the biggest economic crisis we have for a generation and now is not the time for business as usual."" Of Mr Sunak's suggestion that she was the frontrunner, Ms Truss said: ""I'm not taking anything for granted. I want the support of Conservative members."" Earlier on Saturday she outlined her own pitch to be leader, describing herself as an ""insurgent"" who wants change, in an interview in theDaily Telegraph,external. She said after two decades of low growth and now the economic shock from the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the UK was facing a ""pivotal moment"". Ms Truss, among the ministers who did not resign from Boris Johnson's government earlier this month, has announced a plan to review thousands of laws inherited from the EU after Brexit. Although she campaigned to stay in the EU at the 2016 referendum - unlike Leave-voting Mr Sunak - she has since embraced Brexit and is now seeking to argue she is best placed to ensure it delivers economic benefits. She has promised to scrap or replace by the end of 2023 EU laws deemed to hold back the economy. Ms Truss has specifically said she would scrap EU rules for the insurance industry known as Solvency II, arguing they had deterred investment in infrastructure projects. The rules are alreadysubject to a government review,external. Mr Sunak, who quit as part of the cabinet mutiny against Boris Johnson, has clashed repeatedly with Ms Truss over economic policy during the campaign so far. Mr Sunak topped the MPs' ballots to qualify for the final run-off with Ms Truss, but polls currently suggest the foreign secretary is the favoured candidate of party members, who decide the leader. It is thought a significant chunk of the 160,000 or so Tory members will vote in the coming weeks. Hustings will take place throughout July and August, and the two candidates will square off in a live BBC TV debate on Monday, followed by another hosted by The Sun and TalkTV on Tuesday.

$1bn Lord of the Rings TV show wows at Comic-Con,"Actress Sophia Nomvete plays the dwarven Princess Disa of Khazad-Dum ""We wanted to find a huge, Tolkienian mega epic!"" That's how showrunner Patrick McKay described his mission for The Rings of Power - Amazon Prime's hotly anticipated Lord of the Rings TV spin-off, as he unveiled a new trailer and unseen footage at San Diego Comic-Con on Thursday. In his armoury: a huge cast of comely elves, a rare female dwarf, the Hobbits' ancestors, a seriously impressive CGI city, a mystery menace, an entwife and a surprise Balrog. The Rings of Power is the most expensive show ever made, at $1bn (Â£832m) for five seasons - and this is fans' best guide to how it will look, sound and feel. But what everyone really wants to know is, can it compete with Peter Jackson's beloved Lord of the Rings film trilogy, the winner of 17 Oscars, benchmark for composers, and populariser of second breakfast? Wisely, it's not trying - instead setting the action 4,000 years before the Hobbits Frodo and Sam journeyed through Middle Earth. This is the Second Age, where the 20 Rings of Power are forged and the evil Sauron, Lord of Mordor, rises to assault the realms' hard-won peace. The source material is Tolkien's appendix to the Lord of the Rings books. The core question: ""How far into the darkness would you go to protect the things you care about the most?"" says McKay's fellow showrunner JD Payne. It's a mix of new characters, some of them original to the show, and old favourites in younger form, like the immortal Elves Galadriel and Elrond (Morfydd Clark and Robert Aramayo), who are seen sharing a tender moment in one exclusive clip played at Comic-Con. Another atmospheric scene showed Elrond and the dwarf King Durin IV (Owain Arthur) competing to split rocks in a high-stakes test of strength. And orcs - the blighted race that formed Sauron's army in Tolkien's books - featured in combat with the elf Arondir (Ismael Cruz Cordova) as he battles his way out of enslavement. More than 20 cast members rotated on to the stage to share character insights, including Clark, who referenced the stately calm of Cate Blanchett's Galadriel in Jackson's films. ""I wanted to show how the serenity of Galadriel in the films comes hard-fought,"" she says. Arthur said he felt an affinity with the mine-dwelling dwarves, as his family had worked in a Welsh slate quarry - but the physical transformation into Durin was a challenge: ""Three hours every day and 45 minutes to take it all off!"" The fantasy drama is set thousands of years before the Lord of the Rings saga The Lord Of The Rings: The Rings Of Power will premiere on Amazon Prime Video on 2 September The lack of female dwarves in screen Tolkien has also been delightfully addressed - to the joy of actress Sophia Nomvete, who plays the dwarven Princess Disa of Khazad-Dum. ""I have the joy to host that revolutionary moment!"" she declared - before sharing that she had auditioned for the role ""when I was two days off giving birth... and then I got the call to say, you will be flying the torch for this incredible character, when my daughter was five days old"". Her costume as Princess Disa was designed so she could feed her weeks-old baby between takes. But if The Rings of Power relishes expanding into new territory, it also respects the established Tolkien lore. Some actors playing elves told the BBC at a media round-table they had worked with a specialist to get the pronunciation of Elvish languages right. Elrond actor Robert Aramayo said: ""When you encounter any Elvish, you sort of understand it in a deeper way, what the professor [Tolkien]... language was so important to him."" ""My most exciting thing was learning to write it!"" enthuses Charles Edwards, who plays the elven smith Celebrimbor who forges the Rings of Power. ""I took to it like a fish to water, I must say,"" beams Ismael Cruz Cordova (who is Puerto Rican), to laughter. ""It shares a lot of vowel sounds with Spanish!"" Arondir, Cruz CÃ³rdoba's elf character, shares a forbidden love with human healer Bronwyn (Nazanin Boniadi), who's also the mother of ""a somewhat rebellious teenager son"", as she describes it. Bronwyn is a rounded individual in her own right, however - something praised by Boniadi. ""They've given every female character such agency,"" she says. ""We don't serve the men."" Musically, we can expect more of the resonant drums and choral chanting that permeated Jackson's films. Series composer Bear McCreary, who conducted a live orchestra and choir at the panel event, said he wanted to honour the original score - and indeed, its composer Howard Shore created the series' theme music. Comedian and Tolkien superfan Stephen Colbert, who hosted the panel, told the audience he had read the Lord of the Rings trilogy more than 50 times. While many may simply wonder how he found time, if highlights the intensity of feeling this mythology conjures up for fans.

Paid leave for premature births aims to be a reliefA new law would give parents with babies in neonatal units up to an extra 12 weeks of paid leave.Health,"Hazel with her son Theo Parents could take up to an extra 12 weeks of paid leave if their child is born prematurely, as part of a new law. Both parents would qualify for one week's extra help - in addition to existing maternity and paternity leave and pay entitlements - for every seven days their baby was in neonatal care. One in seven UK newborns,externalneeds to be placed in a specialist hospital unit. The Neonatal Care (Leave and Pay) Bill completed its second reading in Parliament last week. Proposed by SNP MP Stuart McDonald, it still needs to go through a number of stages of parliamentary scrutiny before becoming law but has received cross-party support in the House of Commons. Itwould also provide support,externalfor babies born at full term who need neonatal care, so long as they are no older than 28 days when admitted to a unit. When Hazel Naghi gave birth to her son Theo at 32 weeks, last year, she had to split her time at hospital with her partner, Oliver, a night-shift worker. ""Because of his prematurity, we had to be transferred to another hospital an hour away [when he was born] and he spent five days in that hospital in an incubator,"" she tells BBC News. ""He was then transferred back to the local hospital and spent a further four weeks in there until we could bring him home Even then, Theo needed a feeding tube for an additional month. Hazel ""wouldn't have been mentally prepared"" to return to work nine months after Theo's due date and says the extra time off proposed in this bill would have really helped, making her feel ""she wasn't alone"". ""It means a lot that the government understands this happens on a regular basis,"" Hazel says, ""and this law would take weight off the minds of parents and give them a sense of relief. ""Having a baby prematurely is a very different experience to having a child full term. ""I don't think many people realise how common it is to have a premature baby, so knowing that there could be support from the government and that your employer would mean you wouldn't have to panic."" Theo was born at 32 weeks More than 100,000 babies were admitted to neonatal care in the UK in 2016,research from Imperial College London,externalshows. And Mr McDonald told MPs his proposal would ""give parents the emotional and financial support needed at a time of great stress and trauma"". Others shared their experiences, including fellow SNP MP David Linden, who said he would remember until his ""dying day"" watching his daughter turn blue in an incubator as neonatal nurses rushed to resuscitate her. A baby is considered to be premature if it is born before the 37th week of pregnancy. It is possible for a baby to survive when born at about 24 weeks of pregnancy - but the earlier it is, the more complications there could be. With incubators to keep babies warm, neonatal units are also used for newborns with complications such as low weight, infections and jaundice and recovery from surgery or a difficult birth. Source: NHS,external All mothers are entitled to 52 weeks'maternity leave,external, while paid paternity leave is up to two weeks. Parents can also split their leave between them - up to 50 weeks' leave and 37 weeks' pay. Some employers offer more time off, at their discretion.

Apology after tenant lay dead in flat for yearsResidents repeatedly told the landlord of a bad smell and maggots coming from Sheila Seleoane's flat.London,"Nobody entered Sheila Seleoane's flat for years A housing group that did not realise one of its residents had been dead for two and a half years has apologised. Sheila Seleoane, 58, was found in her Peckham flat in February and had to be identified by dental records. Residents repeatedly told Peabody of a foul stench and maggots in summer 2019. It only made one ""proactive attempt"" to contact the tenant and cut off her gas. ""We weren't asking the fundamental question: is Sheila OK?"" Peabody's chief executive Ian McDermott admitted. He said: ""We've apologised to the family. We're deeply sorry for what happened. ""The biggest apology though I think does go to the residents of Lord's Court. They did tell us that something was wrong."" Tenants need rogue landlord crackdown, says mayor Residents 'betrayed' over Olympics housing pledge Miss Seleoane lived on the top floor Miss Seleoane's last known contact was with her GP in August 2019, the same month she stopped paying rent at her south-east London flat. Landlord Peabody cut off her gas supply in June 2020, three months after applying for Universal Credit to cover her rent when the first lockdown started. Peabody has not yet paid this money back but says it will. A post-mortem examination found the cause of her death was unascertained due to the advanced state of decomposition of Ms Seleoane's body. However, she had Crohn's disease and bowel inflammation. Neighbours told Peabody of their concerns An inquest on Thursday found there had been numerous missed opportunities by both Peabody and the police. Delivering an open verdict, coroner Dr Julian Morris said: ""Any death is sad. To lie undetected for in all likelihood over two years is difficult to fathom in 2022."" Dead woman lay undiscovered in flat for two years There were two police visits to Lord's Court within a week in October 2020, one at the request of residents and another at the request of Peabody. Officers were unable to make contact with Miss Seleoane. However, a miscommunication by a Met Police controller led to the mistaken conclusion that Ms Seleoane had been seen alive and well and this was the information that was passed on to Peabody. Unopened post was found in a mailbox on the ground floor of the building Mr McDermott said: ""We asked the police to get involved, they called in and and reassured us that Sheila was alive. ""Clearly that wasn't the case. We should have spotted those signs earlier."" In response, the Met Police said in October 2020 a Peabody representative contacted the force to ask if Ms Seleoane was safe and well and the Met said it ""mistakenly informed"" the housing body she was. A spokeswoman added: ""This response was based on information held on MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) systems as to the outcome of officer attendance that day. ""The staff member who documented that incorrect information no longer works for the MPS, but had they still been employed they would have been referred to Professional Standards for unsatisfactory performance. ""We sincerely apologise for the error and for any distress that it caused to the family of Ms Seleoane."" Ms Seleoane's body was found in February by police officers who forced entry after residents heard her balcony door swinging open following Storm Eunice. Her skeletal remains were discovered lying in the recovery position. She had been wearing blue pyjamas and a white top, while there was ""a brown substance around her body which must be a product of decomposition"", police said. Residents have told the BBC their concerns were not taken seriously and they have ""so many unanswered questions"". One neighbour said: ""How embarrassing - 89 attempts yet they closed the case based on the police saying they spoke to her but somehow they couldn't. ""My thoughts are the same as the residents, really. It's all words until we see the action and they have yet to demonstrate how 'sorry' they are.

Staycations slump as Covid boom fizzles out,"Self-catered accommodation has taken a big hit this years, says Jim Jones from North Wales Tourism Demand for staycations in Wales is ""dire"", with the cost of living pushing businesses to the brink, tourism bosses have said. Industry body North Wales Tourism said self-catering accommodation has been hit especially hard. This is despite worries of flight cancellations and possible rail strikes making airport access tricky. The Welsh government said it had pumped tens of millions of pounds into the sector. Flight cancellations and airport delays are expected to continue throughout the summer. British Airways and EasyJet have alreadytaken about 40,000 flightsoff their schedules. Network Railstaff are due to walk outon 27 July and on 18 and 20 August over pay and conditions, with train driversset to strikeon 30 July. But all that has not translated into holidaymakers staying put. Staycation boom 'to stay', say tourism bosses Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? North Wales Tourism boss Jim Jones said there had been high hopes a profitable summer would get businesses back in pre-pandemic shape after a boost in 2021 when people shied away from foreign holidays during the pandemic. ""It's kind of unprecedented because it was really busy in 2021 but this year is very strange, very quiet in terms of what we're used to."" The biggest problem is the cost of living with the price of fuel making driving expensive and Mr Jones said businesses anxious for a good season were working to stay open and maintain staffing levels. He added: ""The situation is dire, we were hoping for lots more support once we came out of the pandemic from the Welsh government, that hasn't been forthcoming. So businesses are kind of left to their own devices."" Suzanne Cumpston says people want the exotic holidays they have missed out on Suzanne Cumpston of Cowbridge's Sam Smith Travel said Wales had lots to offer but there was ""a huge appetite"" for going abroad. While some were holding back because of costs, she said the firm had not seen a sales dip. ""In the pandemic there was a huge peak of demand for domestic tourism within the UK, however, prices have escalated and I think there is more of a demand to go back overseas,"" Ms Cumpston said. Going to north Wales or Spain for a week could cost you about the same, she added. One visitor to Rhossili Bay was surprised about how few people were there Jodie Scott and daughter Chloe have been at their caravan at Rhossili Bay, Gower, all week. Ms Scott said: ""Given how stunning it is we always say it's amazing that there's very few people there."" Nannie Schoeren, who was visiting Wales from the Netherlands for the first time, said: ""We just looked in our guide and I thought, 'hey, this is the nicest place to be'. And it is!"" Deborah Smith visits her holiday home in nearby Three Cliffs Bay for two weeks every year. ""It's very very popular now with French people, German people, Dutch people,"" she said. ""We've spoken to loads this week who are all coming over here from abroad so the word's out there."" The owners of Vanner Caravan, Camping and Holiday Cottages say they've relied on last minute bookings Delyth Vaughan Rowlands said her holiday business was usually booked up early, but she has only just filled August. The owner of Vanner Caravan, Camping and Holiday Cottages in Dolgellau, Gwynedd, said: ""This year is a perfect storm. There's much more competition as the market is saturated."" This video can not be played What is the climate's impact on the rail network? She added it was hard to compete with all-inclusive offers abroad. ""It's much more challenging as we get out of the Covid pandemic, with the cost-of-living crisis and the current political instability and the impact it has on the economy."" Eirian Ifan has worked in hospitality for 28 years and owns Llannerch Goch holiday cottages in Capel Garmon, Conwy Valley. She has had an ""unusual"" season affected by people going abroad, saying she has ""never seen anything like it"". Instead of being fully booked, last-minute bookings were keeping them ticking them over while the normally busy months of September and October were mostly free, so she has been adapting to get more guests, offering cheaper and shorter stays and allowing dogs. ""People are concerned about the cost of living and others are going abroad,"" she said. ""There's also a lot more cottages, glamping pods, yurts and huts in the market at the moment."" Thomas Scarrott says there ""was always going to be gaps"" after Covid Vale Holiday Parks owner Thomas Scarrott, said the business, based in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, had struggled to fill peak seasons. Getting people to stay at one of the firm's 10 parks instead of going abroad was challenging. ""After the lockdown we were pretty much at 100% occupancy and now we are looking at around 70-75%,"" he said, which included a lot of last-minute bookings from people who had been turned away at airports. Beach towns like Aberystwyth are full of ""staff wanted"" signs, says park owner Thomas Scarott Getting staff was difficult, said Mr Scarrott, as many re-trained during the pandemic, leaving him with ""so many vacancies across our parks, especially in the hospitality part of our business"". The Welsh government said it was working with the sector to ensure summer was successful as part of its plan to achieve sustainable growth for tourism. It said it appreciated inflation, operating costs and staffing challenges made it a worrying time for businesses and was providing a Â£116m package meaning the sector would get 50% business rate relief in 2022-23. A spokesman added: ""However, the main support levers rest with UK ministers. We again call on the UK government to do far more to help businesses, individuals, and communities with the cost-of-living crisis."" The UK government has been asked to comment.

Gridlock persists for thousands travelling to France,"Travellers heading to France are facing delays of several hours amid continuing gridlock on roads near Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone. More than 17,000 passengers had left Dover on ferries by lunchtime on one of the busiest weekends of the year. P&O Ferries warned customers to allow three to four hours to clear local roads and security checks on Saturday. Passengers using Eurotunnel also faced lengthy delays on the journey to the Folkestone terminal. Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? This weekend is one of the busiest for UK overseas travel as most schools in England and Wales have broken up for the summer. Families travelling to the Eurotunnel terminal told the BBC they faced delays of more than six hours amid heavy congestion around Folkestone. Passengers using Eurotunnel were asked to arrive two hours early by the operator. John Keefe, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, said traffic disruption had been caused by an accident on the M20 on Friday, and stretches of the road being used solely for freight traffic, with holidaymakers diverted on to A-roads. Saturday's delays follow long waits on Friday when a major incident was declared after routes around the Kent terminals were in gridlock and traffic queues four miles long also formed on the eastbound M2. This video can not be played Thousands of lorries stacked on M20 outside Dover A war of words broke out between UK and French officials over the cause of the disruption. In a visit to Kent on Saturday afternoon, Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss claimed delays at Dover ferry port were down to a lack of French border staff. She said: ""I'm very clear that we need to see action from them to resolve the terrible situation that people are facing."" But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont rejected this and said additional checks post-Brexit and a lack of capacity at the port were behind the problem. He also told BBC News the Port of Dover was ""too small"" and there were too few kiosks due to lack of space. Some 3,000 lorries are also waiting to cross the Channel. They are currently parked on the M20 outside Dover, while holiday traffic is prioritised. Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry drivers had waited to cross the Channel for ""well over 18 hours"" in queues with no toilet facilities. Jane Dennis and her family managed to escape the gridlock after six hours by taking a detour Jane Dennis, her husband and their five children, aged between three and 11, barely moved for six hours while trying to reach the Eurotunnel terminal. Between around 7am and 1pm they advanced approximately 70 metres before deciding to take a detour that friends had used. ""We hit the queue at about 07:05 BST, and we left the queue six hours later at about 13:10 BST, when we'd travelled 70 metres or so,"" she told the BBC. ""Literally inching a couple of cars' worth forward every hour."" She said the traffic queues weren't being managed by anyone, adding: ""It was just the way the gridlock happened, the one we were in initially there was nowhere for people to budge."" Once they made the detour, traffic was flowing freely on other roads. They eventually arrived in France 12 hours after setting off from home in Hampshire, and had to try to find a hotel to stay in overnight, before continuing their journey to a campsite in Vendee on Sunday. Anna Parkinson faced long delays while travelling with her three children. Holidaymaker Anna Parkinson took seven hours to travel two miles to the Eurotunnel terminal - with three ""fractious"" children sat in the back. She said she felt for local residents who ""currently can't leave their local villages because they're hemmed in by all of us desperately trying to get on the train that we should have caught five hours ago"". Tim Povall, travelling to Budapest with his wife, two sons and their dog, had been queuing for nearly seven hours when he spoke to the BBC, meaning their planned stopover in Bruges was disrupted. He says there should have been better organisation at Folkestone to avoid a ""free-for-all"". ""It's ruined this evening. My two sons are angry and my dog isn't happy. It just doesn't make sense. ""There are lots of pregnant people and people with kids walking around. It's hot, I feel sorry for them."" By Dan Johnson, BBC News We're told that things are flowing a bit more freely and that they are starting to eat into that backlog that built up yesterday. There are a lot of cars queuing here at the port at the moment. But in a sense this is the good queue. This is the queue you want to be part of. The problem is that thousands of people are stuck on the roads miles out from Dover trying to get across Kent to the port. They've been held back by the police operations that have been in place to try to manage the traffic, to try to stop Dover itself getting completely snarled up. And that does seem to have been a bit more successful today, but drivers are still being warned that they do face big delays. Has your journey been affected by the delays in Dover?

Head teacher smacks down career for WWE,"This video can not be played Five years ago Eddie Dennis was teaching maths, now he's living his dream as a WWE superstar A head teacher has swapped the school bell for the wrestling ring to become a WWE professional. Eddie Dennis, who taught maths at Berkshire's LVS Ascot private school, has loved the sport since he was five. The 36-year-old took a ""risk"" five years ago, trading his chalk board to follow his dream. Now the 6ft 6in (198cm) mathematician is getting ready to rumble at the WWE Clash at the Castle - actually at the Principality Stadium - on 3 September. According to the WWE, 230lb (104kg) Eddie has ""a brutal dark side and a major chip on his shoulder"" and anyone preparing to do battle should be aware ""the towering Welshman is as dangerous as they come"". Shark wrestler: Welsh tourist Paul Marshallsea to the rescue Actor backs 'freak show' dwarf wrestling WWE: Drew McIntyre vows to put Tyson Fury 'on his back like a turtle' From Gwaun Cae Gurwen, Neath Port Talbot, he said it would be an honour to return to his native Wales for the WWE's biggest UK stadium event in decades. ""It was a risk giving up teaching altogether to pursue my dream,"" he said. ""It was pretty terrifying... I had a very much established a life, my fiancÃ©e and I had a mortgage. I was leaving that to go and wrestle independently."" Five years ago Eddie was a mathematics teacher at a private school Eddie, who went to Ysgol Gyfun Ystalyfera in Neath Port Talbot ""loved the Ultimate Warrior and then later on Shawn Michaels came along and he captivated me"". ""I would be trying to mimic their movements and characteristics and learning the way they speak. ""I watched [Shawn Michaels] in an Iron Man match in Wrestlemania 12 [in 1996], now [he] is giving me advice on my career and my profession. It's surreal."" But as a pupil in Wales, he said there was ""no clear route"" to a career in wrestling. He did a teaching qualification at Cardiff Metropolitan University, then got a degree in maths before starting his teaching career, all while training in his free time. He juggled his full-time career while performing in the wrestling circuit on weekends. Before he became a star, Eddie was a head teacher during the week and a wrestler on weekends In his day job, he worked his way up to head teacher. But in the ring, he had started to make a name for himself in NXT UK where wrestlers are coached by WWE's RAW and Smackdown superstars to become the sport's next big thing. By 2017 he said the UK wrestling industry was ""having a resurgence"". ""They ran the first WWE UK championship tournament, loads of people I knew were on that,"" he said. ""I was sat on my sofa with my fiancÃ©e and cat watching my best friends perform on the stage we've all dreamt of and I wasn't with them because of the path that I had chosen. ""A month later I handed in my notice to focus on wrestling."" Eddie's background as a teacher is part of his wrestling persona Delyth Spurway is the deputy head teacher at Ysgol Gyfun Ystalyfera and started her career as a teacher at the same time Eddie started as a pupil. ""It's really amazing that he's gone and chased his dreams and made it in that industry,"" she said. ""The children think it's really cool, the ones that watch WWE are saying 'wow, look miss, he came to this school'. ""He was quite a quiet and conscientious pupil. He's changed so much, looking at him now, I barely recognise him, but it's the eyes that look the same."" Eddie can rely on plenty of support from his former school when he wrestles in Cardiff Pupils at the school are also big fans. Year 7 pupil Olifer said: ""It shows that even if you come from somewhere small like this area you can do anything you want to in life. You don't have to come from America. Owen, a Year 3 pupil, said Eddie was an ""inspiration"", adding: ""The WWE don't come to Wales often, the big shows are normally in America so this is really exciting."" And Eddie will be getting support from Year 7 pupil Ryan, who said: ""He went to this school so he's my favourite wrestler. It's cool."" Eddie will be up against some of the sport's current superstars at the WWE's event in Cardiff, including Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, Charlotte Flair, Finn Balor and Drew Mcintyre.

LiveLiveTravellers heading to France face gridlock at coast13 minutes ago,"Travellers trying to cross the English Channel are facing lengthy delays for a second day Officials in Kent declare a major incident as long queues of cars wait to get to Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone About 10,000 cars are expected to be processed going out of the port today, up 1,500 on Friday's figure The AA says those queueing to cross the Channel are still facing three to four hours waits There are also currently 3,000 lorries parked on the M20 outside Dover Edited by Chris Giles We're pausing our coverage of events in Dover and Folkestone now, but before we go... here's a recap of what's happened:  Today's live page was brought to you by: Catherine Evans, Marie Jackson, Tanya Gupta, Alex Kleiderman and Chris Giles. Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the disruption at the port of Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone has been caused by a lack of resources put in place by French authorities at the border. Speaking during a campaign visit to Kent today, she said: ""I'm very clear that we need to see action from them to resolve the terrible situation that people are facing."" She adds that she has been ""in touch with the French authorities"". When pressed on whether the situation has been caused by Brexit she insisted a lack of resources was to blame. Maddy Haxton, a security
officer at Heathrow airport, is travelling with a family
of seven from Ashford, Middlesex, to Berny-RiviÃ¨re in France. Theyâre in a convoy with three other families. Itâs their first
holiday since the start of the pandemic and they are all really looking to
getting away. She says: ""Weâve been in the area very close to the Eurotunnel for more than six hours. ""Weâre on the A20. We can hear the euro trains go past, weâre that close,"" she adds. ""Itâs
ridiculous â a nightmare! The seven of
us are getting sick of each other. The kids are accepting it though. ""We go to
France most years. It normally takes an hour-and-a-half."" Tim Povall is travelling to Budapest with his wife, two sons and their dog. They've been queuing for nearly seven hours on their way to the Eurotunnel, meaning their planned stopover in Bruges this evening has been disrupted. ""I don't think the severity of the situation is being
communicated well enough,"" says Tim. ""People are all talking about the delays in Dover for
the ferry, but I am certain that it's nowhere near as bad as this. ""We are nowhere near passport control. It's really
bad."" He says there should have been better organisation at Folkestone to avoid a ""free-for-all"". ""It's ruined this
evening. My two sons are angry and my dog isn't happy. It just doesn't make
sense. ""There are lots of pregnant people and people with kids
walking around. It's hot, I feel sorry for them."" Travellers heading to the port of Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone are still facing delays of between three and four hours, according to the AA. Meanwhile it says the
jams felt earlier across the south of England have cleared, although a few isolated pockets of traffic remain. It adds roads are expected to be much quieter tomorrow, compared to Friday and Saturday. But the next big
challenge facing the south east is clearing the backlog of freight that has
been queuing on the M20 outside Dover. Jack
Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, said there has been ""steady improvement"" throughout the day. But he said this would be ""little comfort"" to those still stuck in traffic. Dan JohnsonReporting from Dover Weâre told that things are flowing a bit more freely and that they are starting to eat into that backlog that built up yesterday. There are a lot of cars queuing here at the port at the moment. But in a sense this is the good queue. This is the queue you want to be part of. The problem is that thousands of people are stuck on the roads miles out from Dover trying to get across Kent to the port. Theyâve been held back by the police operations that have been in place to try to manage the traffic, to try to stop Dover itself getting completely snarled up. And that does seem to have been a bit more successful today, but drivers are still being warned that they do face big delays. Simon Oliver, his wife and two teenage sons have been
queueing for the Eurotunnel for eight-and-a-half hours (so far). They drove down to
Folkestone from Durham last night and stayed in a hotel, setting off at
615am this morning. Simon says they've been stop-starting every 20 yards. They're supposed to be at their cottage in the Loire valley by now. But theyâve booked another
night in Calais as they donât think theyâll get there in time tonight. Simon says the family are ""fine, just tired, and
frustrated"". But his eldest son has autism ""so his anxiety is fairly bad"". ""Weâre keeping him happy. Weâre doing our best with him.
Weâre putting on a brave face."" Freight drivers have been reminded they have to follow signs and use the M20. The Kent Resilience Forum (KRF) has said any hauliers trying to jump the queue not only risk a fine of Â£300 but will also be sent to the back of the line by police or other enforcers. In the past 24 hours, over 100 fixed penalty notices have been issued for non-compliance. Toby Howe, Tactical lead for the KRF, said traffic controls were the ""best option for keeping the county moving"". Marion Pettet and her husband David have made it through the channel tunnel after
long delays and are now en route to their holiday in France. She says the lack of information was ""bothersome"". ""There was no explanation as to what was happening. The
information panels were inaccurate, they werenât giving out the same
information as the tannoys."" But she says she is relieved this is happening after the recent heatwave, which saw record temperatures. ""Itâs frustrating, itâs annoying. The only thing I can say is
at least it wasnât 40 degrees."" A French MP has claimed the British government rejected a proposal to double the number of passport booths given to the French Police in Dover a few months ago. Pierre-Henri Dumont, Republican MP for Calais, also said the traffic jams at the port were because of Brexit. Hetweeted,external: ""No
need to blame French authorities for the traffic jams in Dover thatâs an
aftermath of Brexit.
We have to run more and longer checks."" Dumont also said yesterday the Port of Dover was âtoo smallâ and there were too few kiosks due to lack of space. The chief executive of the Port of Dover, Doug Bannister, has said that in a post-Brexit environment ""there will be increased transaction times at  the border"" but also said the port had created more capacity. The BBC has asked the Department for Transport for a response. Jane Dennis, her
husband and their five children (ranging from three to 11 years old) told us they left their queue and took a detour after being gridlocked. Insix hours, they had driven only75 metres. Jane says they've moved a bit now, after a friend recommended another way. But they're still a long way off from the camping site in Vendee, with another seven-hour drive once they reach France. I think we saved ourselves hours. Itâs incredible, and quite unfair on the people in the queue weâve left. Our friends had taken this detour and told us about it.  But in the queue there was no information, no traffic control, no police. Everyone was getting out of the cars, walking to Tesco to stock up on supplies. I did that with the kids. We took a risk, but we had to do something. Itâs been an absolute nightmare. Jane Dennis Holidaymakers have been facing long delays again today - but some predict they could become a regular feature for those heading for a European getaway. From September, the EU will be introducing even more checks - with biometric testing at the border for non-EU nationals. So, now we're not in the EU anymore, we'll see facial recognition and fingerprinting becoming the norm. It's already prompting warnings of more delays. Delayed holidaymaker Anna Parkinson has finally reached the Eurotunnel terminal. It has taken herseven hours to travel two miles- with three ""fractious"" children sat in the back. ""Actually theyâve been
very good, weâve played a few games, theyâve eaten a lot of food, Iâm glad we
brought copious amounts of snacks and iPads,"" she laughs. She's now on her way to her holiday, but says she feels for residents who ""currently canât leave their
local villages because theyâre hemmed in by all of us desperately
trying to get on the train that we should have caught five hours ago"". Lorries queuing during Operation Brock on the M20 near Ashford in Kent Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry
drivers had waited to cross the Channel for âwell over 18 hoursâ. She said: âOur primary concern is about the welfare of those
drivers that are in the queue but also importantly making sure we can get them
moving again, get them through the port as quickly as possible.â She said there were no toilet facilities in the queue and it was understood they couldnât be deployed for safety reasons. Chapman said it was hoped there would
be welfare support at some point. âWhat weâre certainly advising to any drivers who are heading to
the port or to Eurotunnel is - please come prepared, bring plenty of food and
drink with you, make sure you go to the loo before you leave, and just be
prepared for a long wait.â At least 17,215 passengers had made their way through the Port of Dover by lunchtime today, latest figures show. On Twitter, spokespeople for the port said they were ""working hard with our partners to get all passengers on their way as quickly as possible"". But thousands of cars and lorries remain queuing on roads leading up to the port. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we've been reporting, measures to smooth the flow of traffic in Kent continue after the major incident was declared. With thousands of cars and lorries still stuck on roads into Dover, the Operation Brock contraflow is also in place on the M20, say National Highways. It means a queue of lorries is parked on the motorway. Under the latest national Highways update: When Brexit voters thought they were ""taking back control"", the French actually took control of their own border, an union representative has told the BBC. Lucy Moreton, professional officer for the ISU union
that represents borders, immigration and customs staff, says the queues are ""not upsetting the French particularly"". ""This isnât our border that weâve taken back control of. In
fact, France has taken back control of its border in this respect."" Moreton adds it was a ""reasonably predictable"" outcome after Britain leaving the EU. ""This is the time that it's chosen to bite,"" she says. While Eurotunnel passengers have been complaining they have been caught up in delays reaching the terminal at Folkestone today - the company says its services are operating ""smoothly"". John Keefe, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, told the BBC drivers were experiencing delays on the motorways amid heavy holiday traffic and road restrictions due to the lorries parked on the M20 because of the Dover disruption. âWhile itâs slowing things down on traffic down moving through the county, itâs actually bringing... [them] to the terminal in a very orderly fashion,â he says. But he says increased EU border checks since Brexit have resulted in longer journey times for its passengers. Travellers using the Channel Tunnel shuttle service are now being asked to arrive at the terminal in Folkestone about two hours before departure. âThis infrastructure was created for borderless travel. So when the Channel Tunnel was built [there were] no requirements for passport controls, no requirements for customs controls on goods moving backwards and forwards between the UK and France, and thatâs different now."" he says. If you're a parent, you probably know how challenging long car trips with a young child can be. Dave Harvey and his family have been stuck in their car since leaving home early this morning on their way to the Eurostar terminal at Folkestone. ""Weâre moving now though... [we've] been
queuing for probably three hours now to get through,"" he says. He adds, ""[It's a] bit of a joke
really. The M20's closed. I donât know why itâs closed to be quite frank
with you."" So how does he feel at the start of his family summer holiday? ""Frustrated. Especially with the young
one. Sad and frustrated."" Dan JohnsonBBC News Weâre told the backlog is starting to clear but that it will take some time to get everyone where they need to be. Traffic is moving through Dover itself, into the port and onto ferries. Local streets are moving more freely than yesterday. But there are still thousands of cars and lorries held on roads into Dover. Motorists are being warned to carry water and food - itâs a warm day on the roads of Kent. Theyâve been told if they miss their ferry theyâll be put on the first one available. 10,000 cars are expected to pass through the port today, on top of the 8,500 yesterday. Itâs the busiest weekend of the year and because of the pandemic Dover hasnât seen anything like this since 2019. Local people are saying theyâve never seen it this bad. Brexit also means passport checks have changed and now take longer but drivers are asking why there arenât more staff and resources in place to handle the heavy demand. Â© 2025 BBC.

Gridlock persists for thousands travelling to FrancePassengers are warned to allow three to four hours to clear roads and security checks at the port.,"Travellers heading to France are facing delays of several hours amid continuing gridlock on roads near Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone. More than 17,000 passengers had left Dover on ferries by lunchtime on one of the busiest weekends of the year. P&O Ferries warned customers to allow three to four hours to clear local roads and security checks on Saturday. Passengers using Eurotunnel also faced lengthy delays on the journey to the Folkestone terminal. Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? This weekend is one of the busiest for UK overseas travel as most schools in England and Wales have broken up for the summer. Families travelling to the Eurotunnel terminal told the BBC they faced delays of more than six hours amid heavy congestion around Folkestone. Passengers using Eurotunnel were asked to arrive two hours early by the operator. John Keefe, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, said traffic disruption had been caused by an accident on the M20 on Friday, and stretches of the road being used solely for freight traffic, with holidaymakers diverted on to A-roads. Saturday's delays follow long waits on Friday when a major incident was declared after routes around the Kent terminals were in gridlock and traffic queues four miles long also formed on the eastbound M2. This video can not be played Thousands of lorries stacked on M20 outside Dover A war of words broke out between UK and French officials over the cause of the disruption. In a visit to Kent on Saturday afternoon, Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss claimed delays at Dover ferry port were down to a lack of French border staff. She said: ""I'm very clear that we need to see action from them to resolve the terrible situation that people are facing."" But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont rejected this and said additional checks post-Brexit and a lack of capacity at the port were behind the problem. He also told BBC News the Port of Dover was ""too small"" and there were too few kiosks due to lack of space. Some 3,000 lorries are also waiting to cross the Channel. They are currently parked on the M20 outside Dover, while holiday traffic is prioritised. Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry drivers had waited to cross the Channel for ""well over 18 hours"" in queues with no toilet facilities. Jane Dennis and her family managed to escape the gridlock after six hours by taking a detour Jane Dennis, her husband and their five children, aged between three and 11, barely moved for six hours while trying to reach the Eurotunnel terminal. Between around 7am and 1pm they advanced approximately 70 metres before deciding to take a detour that friends had used. ""We hit the queue at about 07:05 BST, and we left the queue six hours later at about 13:10 BST, when we'd travelled 70 metres or so,"" she told the BBC. ""Literally inching a couple of cars' worth forward every hour."" She said the traffic queues weren't being managed by anyone, adding: ""It was just the way the gridlock happened, the one we were in initially there was nowhere for people to budge."" Once they made the detour, traffic was flowing freely on other roads. They eventually arrived in France 12 hours after setting off from home in Hampshire, and had to try to find a hotel to stay in overnight, before continuing their journey to a campsite in Vendee on Sunday. Anna Parkinson faced long delays while travelling with her three children. Holidaymaker Anna Parkinson took seven hours to travel two miles to the Eurotunnel terminal - with three ""fractious"" children sat in the back. She said she felt for local residents who ""currently can't leave their local villages because they're hemmed in by all of us desperately trying to get on the train that we should have caught five hours ago"". Tim Povall, travelling to Budapest with his wife, two sons and their dog, had been queuing for nearly seven hours when he spoke to the BBC, meaning their planned stopover in Bruges was disrupted. He says there should have been better organisation at Folkestone to avoid a ""free-for-all"". ""It's ruined this evening. My two sons are angry and my dog isn't happy. It just doesn't make sense. ""There are lots of pregnant people and people with kids walking around. It's hot, I feel sorry for them."" By Dan Johnson, BBC News We're told that things are flowing a bit more freely and that they are starting to eat into that backlog that built up yesterday. There are a lot of cars queuing here at the port at the moment. But in a sense this is the good queue. This is the queue you want to be part of. The problem is that thousands of people are stuck on the roads miles out from Dover trying to get across Kent to the port. They've been held back by the police operations that have been in place to try to manage the traffic, to try to stop Dover itself getting completely snarled up. And that does seem to have been a bit more successful today, but drivers are still being warned that they do face big delays. Has your journey been affected by the delays in Dover?

WWE chief McMahon retires amid misconduct reports,"McMahon both ran WWE's day-to-day business and starred in the firm's shows World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) boss Vince McMahon, who turned the firm from a regional player to global giant, says he will retire amid a flurry of misconduct claims. He stepped down from his roles in WWE last month following reports he paid millions to suppress allegations of sexual misconduct and infidelity. Mr McMahon remains WWE's majority shareholder. He has led WWE for decades, often appearing as a performer in the ring. In a statement that did not mention the allegations against him, Mr McMahon said he has the ""deepest appreciation and admiration for our generations of fans all over the world"". ""Our global audience can take comfort in knowing WWE will continue to entertain you with the same fervour, dedication, and passion as always,"" the 77-year-old said. ""My personal thanks to our community and business partners, shareholders, and Board of Directors for their guidance and support through the years. Then. Now. Forever. Together."" His daughter Stephanie will serve as interim chairperson and co-CEO. In June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr McMahon had agreed to pay $3m (Â£2.5m) to a former paralegal who said he sexually harassed her at work. He reportedly agreed to an upfront payment of $1m, with the rest to be doled out over five years and apparently paid by Mr McMahon personally. Despite initial reports that he would remain in post as the company's CEO and chairman, the WWE board announced an investigation after it emerged that he had paid more than $12m to four other women to hide numerous allegations of infidelity. He was replaced as acting CEO and chairperson by his daughter. The women - all former employees of WWE - signed agreements with Mr McMahon that barred them from discussing their relationships with him in exchange for the payments. Mr McMahon has overseen the WWE's growth into a media juggernaut whose content is broadcast in more than 180 countries and 30 languages. When he purchased the then World Wrestling Federation from his father in 1982, matches took place in small venues and its rare television broadcasts were limited to local US cable channels. McMahon faced off against future President Donald Trump in a 'Battle of the Billionaires' event in 2007 But the organisation underwent a seismic change under his management, with events like WrestleMania, a live event featuring the sport's top stars, drawing in millions of viewers. In 2021 the company's revenue exceed $1bn for the first time. As the sport grew, Mr McMahon leveraged his abrasive and bombastic personality to become one of its most recognisable faces. He has been at the centre of some of its most famous moments, including being attacked by future US President Donald Trump at a WrestleMania event in 2007, and his feuds with stars like 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin and Hulk Hogan became box office viewing.

LiveLiveTravellers heading to France face gridlock at coast8 minutes ago,"Travellers trying to cross the English Channel are facing lengthy delays for a second day Officials in Kent declare a major incident as long queues of cars wait to get to Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone About 10,000 cars are expected to be processed going out of the port today, up 1,500 on Friday's figure The AA says those queueing to cross the Channel are still facing three to four hours waits There are also currently 3,000 lorries parked on the M20 outside Dover Edited by Chris Giles We're pausing our coverage of events in Dover and Folkestone now, but before we go... here's a recap of what's happened:  Today's live page was brought to you by: Catherine Evans, Marie Jackson, Tanya Gupta, Alex Kleiderman and Chris Giles. Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the disruption at the port of Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone has been caused by a lack of resources put in place by French authorities at the border. Speaking during a campaign visit to Kent today, she said: ""I'm very clear that we need to see action from them to resolve the terrible situation that people are facing."" She adds that she has been ""in touch with the French authorities"". When pressed on whether the situation has been caused by Brexit she insisted a lack of resources was to blame. Maddy Haxton, a security
officer at Heathrow airport, is travelling with a family
of seven from Ashford, Middlesex, to Berny-RiviÃ¨re in France. Theyâre in a convoy with three other families. Itâs their first
holiday since the start of the pandemic and they are all really looking to
getting away. She says: ""Weâve been in the area very close to the Eurotunnel for more than six hours. ""Weâre on the A20. We can hear the euro trains go past, weâre that close,"" she adds. ""Itâs
ridiculous â a nightmare! The seven of
us are getting sick of each other. The kids are accepting it though. ""We go to
France most years. It normally takes an hour-and-a-half."" Tim Povall is travelling to Budapest with his wife, two sons and their dog. They've been queuing for nearly seven hours on their way to the Eurotunnel, meaning their planned stopover in Bruges this evening has been disrupted. ""I don't think the severity of the situation is being
communicated well enough,"" says Tim. ""People are all talking about the delays in Dover for
the ferry, but I am certain that it's nowhere near as bad as this. ""We are nowhere near passport control. It's really
bad."" He says there should have been better organisation at Folkestone to avoid a ""free-for-all"". ""It's ruined this
evening. My two sons are angry and my dog isn't happy. It just doesn't make
sense. ""There are lots of pregnant people and people with kids
walking around. It's hot, I feel sorry for them."" Travellers heading to the port of Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone are still facing delays of between three and four hours, according to the AA. Meanwhile it says the
jams felt earlier across the south of England have cleared, although a few isolated pockets of traffic remain. It adds roads are expected to be much quieter tomorrow, compared to Friday and Saturday. But the next big
challenge facing the south east is clearing the backlog of freight that has
been queuing on the M20 outside Dover. Jack
Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, said there has been ""steady improvement"" throughout the day. But he said this would be ""little comfort"" to those still stuck in traffic. Dan JohnsonReporting from Dover Weâre told that things are flowing a bit more freely and that they are starting to eat into that backlog that built up yesterday. There are a lot of cars queuing here at the port at the moment. But in a sense this is the good queue. This is the queue you want to be part of. The problem is that thousands of people are stuck on the roads miles out from Dover trying to get across Kent to the port. Theyâve been held back by the police operations that have been in place to try to manage the traffic, to try to stop Dover itself getting completely snarled up. And that does seem to have been a bit more successful today, but drivers are still being warned that they do face big delays. Simon Oliver, his wife and two teenage sons have been
queueing for the Eurotunnel for eight-and-a-half hours (so far). They drove down to
Folkestone from Durham last night and stayed in a hotel, setting off at
615am this morning. Simon says they've been stop-starting every 20 yards. They're supposed to be at their cottage in the Loire valley by now. But theyâve booked another
night in Calais as they donât think theyâll get there in time tonight. Simon says the family are ""fine, just tired, and
frustrated"". But his eldest son has autism ""so his anxiety is fairly bad"". ""Weâre keeping him happy. Weâre doing our best with him.
Weâre putting on a brave face."" Freight drivers have been reminded they have to follow signs and use the M20. The Kent Resilience Forum (KRF) has said any hauliers trying to jump the queue not only risk a fine of Â£300 but will also be sent to the back of the line by police or other enforcers. In the past 24 hours, over 100 fixed penalty notices have been issued for non-compliance. Toby Howe, Tactical lead for the KRF, said traffic controls were the ""best option for keeping the county moving"". Marion Pettet and her husband David have made it through the channel tunnel after
long delays and are now en route to their holiday in France. She says the lack of information was ""bothersome"". ""There was no explanation as to what was happening. The
information panels were inaccurate, they werenât giving out the same
information as the tannoys."" But she says she is relieved this is happening after the recent heatwave, which saw record temperatures. ""Itâs frustrating, itâs annoying. The only thing I can say is
at least it wasnât 40 degrees."" A French MP has claimed the British government rejected a proposal to double the number of passport booths given to the French Police in Dover a few months ago. Pierre-Henri Dumont, Republican MP for Calais, also said the traffic jams at the port were because of Brexit. Hetweeted,external: ""No
need to blame French authorities for the traffic jams in Dover thatâs an
aftermath of Brexit.
We have to run more and longer checks."" Dumont also said yesterday the Port of Dover was âtoo smallâ and there were too few kiosks due to lack of space. The chief executive of the Port of Dover, Doug Bannister, has said that in a post-Brexit environment ""there will be increased transaction times at  the border"" but also said the port had created more capacity. The BBC has asked the Department for Transport for a response. Jane Dennis, her
husband and their five children (ranging from three to 11 years old) told us they left their queue and took a detour after being gridlocked. Insix hours, they had driven only75 metres. Jane says they've moved a bit now, after a friend recommended another way. But they're still a long way off from the camping site in Vendee, with another seven-hour drive once they reach France. I think we saved ourselves hours. Itâs incredible, and quite unfair on the people in the queue weâve left. Our friends had taken this detour and told us about it.  But in the queue there was no information, no traffic control, no police. Everyone was getting out of the cars, walking to Tesco to stock up on supplies. I did that with the kids. We took a risk, but we had to do something. Itâs been an absolute nightmare. Jane Dennis Holidaymakers have been facing long delays again today - but some predict they could become a regular feature for those heading for a European getaway. From September, the EU will be introducing even more checks - with biometric testing at the border for non-EU nationals. So, now we're not in the EU anymore, we'll see facial recognition and fingerprinting becoming the norm. It's already prompting warnings of more delays. Delayed holidaymaker Anna Parkinson has finally reached the Eurotunnel terminal. It has taken herseven hours to travel two miles- with three ""fractious"" children sat in the back. ""Actually theyâve been
very good, weâve played a few games, theyâve eaten a lot of food, Iâm glad we
brought copious amounts of snacks and iPads,"" she laughs. She's now on her way to her holiday, but says she feels for residents who ""currently canât leave their
local villages because theyâre hemmed in by all of us desperately
trying to get on the train that we should have caught five hours ago"". Lorries queuing during Operation Brock on the M20 near Ashford in Kent Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry
drivers had waited to cross the Channel for âwell over 18 hoursâ. She said: âOur primary concern is about the welfare of those
drivers that are in the queue but also importantly making sure we can get them
moving again, get them through the port as quickly as possible.â She said there were no toilet facilities in the queue and it was understood they couldnât be deployed for safety reasons. Chapman said it was hoped there would
be welfare support at some point. âWhat weâre certainly advising to any drivers who are heading to
the port or to Eurotunnel is - please come prepared, bring plenty of food and
drink with you, make sure you go to the loo before you leave, and just be
prepared for a long wait.â At least 17,215 passengers had made their way through the Port of Dover by lunchtime today, latest figures show. On Twitter, spokespeople for the port said they were ""working hard with our partners to get all passengers on their way as quickly as possible"". But thousands of cars and lorries remain queuing on roads leading up to the port. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we've been reporting, measures to smooth the flow of traffic in Kent continue after the major incident was declared. With thousands of cars and lorries still stuck on roads into Dover, the Operation Brock contraflow is also in place on the M20, say National Highways. It means a queue of lorries is parked on the motorway. Under the latest national Highways update: When Brexit voters thought they were ""taking back control"", the French actually took control of their own border, an union representative has told the BBC. Lucy Moreton, professional officer for the ISU union
that represents borders, immigration and customs staff, says the queues are ""not upsetting the French particularly"". ""This isnât our border that weâve taken back control of. In
fact, France has taken back control of its border in this respect."" Moreton adds it was a ""reasonably predictable"" outcome after Britain leaving the EU. ""This is the time that it's chosen to bite,"" she says. While Eurotunnel passengers have been complaining they have been caught up in delays reaching the terminal at Folkestone today - the company says its services are operating ""smoothly"". John Keefe, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, told the BBC drivers were experiencing delays on the motorways amid heavy holiday traffic and road restrictions due to the lorries parked on the M20 because of the Dover disruption. âWhile itâs slowing things down on traffic down moving through the county, itâs actually bringing... [them] to the terminal in a very orderly fashion,â he says. But he says increased EU border checks since Brexit have resulted in longer journey times for its passengers. Travellers using the Channel Tunnel shuttle service are now being asked to arrive at the terminal in Folkestone about two hours before departure. âThis infrastructure was created for borderless travel. So when the Channel Tunnel was built [there were] no requirements for passport controls, no requirements for customs controls on goods moving backwards and forwards between the UK and France, and thatâs different now."" he says. If you're a parent, you probably know how challenging long car trips with a young child can be. Dave Harvey and his family have been stuck in their car since leaving home early this morning on their way to the Eurostar terminal at Folkestone. ""Weâre moving now though... [we've] been
queuing for probably three hours now to get through,"" he says. He adds, ""[It's a] bit of a joke
really. The M20's closed. I donât know why itâs closed to be quite frank
with you."" So how does he feel at the start of his family summer holiday? ""Frustrated. Especially with the young
one. Sad and frustrated."" Dan JohnsonBBC News Weâre told the backlog is starting to clear but that it will take some time to get everyone where they need to be. Traffic is moving through Dover itself, into the port and onto ferries. Local streets are moving more freely than yesterday. But there are still thousands of cars and lorries held on roads into Dover. Motorists are being warned to carry water and food - itâs a warm day on the roads of Kent. Theyâve been told if they miss their ferry theyâll be put on the first one available. 10,000 cars are expected to pass through the port today, on top of the 8,500 yesterday. Itâs the busiest weekend of the year and because of the pandemic Dover hasnât seen anything like this since 2019. Local people are saying theyâve never seen it this bad. Brexit also means passport checks have changed and now take longer but drivers are asking why there arenât more staff and resources in place to handle the heavy demand. Â© 2025 BBC.

What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?,"Symptoms of monkeypox include a rash which starts on the face and spreads to the body Cases of monkeypox - a rare, little-known disease - are being investigated in European countries including the UK, as well as in the US, Canada and Australia. In the UK there have been around 3,400 confirmed cases since May. Infections are usually mild and the risk to the general population is low, but stocks of a vaccine to guard against the virus are set to run out in the UK - although 100,000 more jabs are due to arrive in September. Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe and experts say chances of infection are low. It occurs mostly in remote parts of central and west African countries, near tropical rainforests. In those regions, there have been more than 1,200 cases of monkeypox since the start of the year. Two main strains of the virus - west African and central African - are known to exist, and it's the milder one from west Africa which is now circulating in other regions of the world. The unusually high numbers of people infected with monkeypox outside of Africa with no travel links to the region, means the virus is now spreading in the community. TheUK Health Security Agency,externalsays anyone concerned they could be infected should phone NHS 111 or contact their local sexual health clinic, but call or email ahead of a visit. It is also advising those infected not to have sex while they have symptoms and use condoms for eight weeks after an infection, as a precaution. Monkeypox cases rise as new UK sex advice issued What is Monkeypox? James Gallagher explains what it is and if we should be worried. Available now on BBC iPlayer Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain, aching muscles. Once the fever breaks a rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Monkeypox can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth. It has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by close contact. Guidance,externalis advising anyone with the virus to abstain from sex while they have symptoms. While there is currently no available evidence that monkeypox can be spread in sexual fluids, people confirmed to have the virus are advised to use condoms for eight weeks after infection as a precaution. It can also be spread by contact with infected animals such as monkeys, rats and squirrels, or by virus-contaminated objects, such as bedding and clothing. Monkeypox virus particle Most cases of the virus are mild, sometimes resembling chickenpox, and clear up on their own within a few weeks. Monkeypox can sometimes be more severe. Twelve people have died worldwide with it in the most recent outbreak, but none in the UK. Although some of the cases have been seen in gay and bisexual men, anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has monkeypox could potentially get the virus. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said ""a notable proportion"" of the recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men ""so we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned"". Monkeypox: Handing out health advice without stigma The virus was first identified in a captive monkey and since 1970 there have been sporadic outbreaks reported across 10 African countries. In 2003 there was an outbreak in the US, the first time it had been seen outside Africa. Patients caught the disease from close contact with prairie dogs that had been infected by small mammals imported into the country. A total of 81 cases were reported, but none resulted in deaths. In 2017, Nigeria experienced the largest known outbreak. There were 172 suspected cases and 75% of victims were men between 21 and 40 years old. Outbreaks can be controlled by infection prevention. Vaccination against smallpox has been proven to be 85% effective in preventing monkeypox. TheUK has bought tens of thousands of doses of the smallpox vaccineand those at high risk of being infected, plus some high-risk close contacts - including some healthworkers - are being offered one. Antiviral drugs may also help and the UK has approved one, called tecovirimat, for this. Health protection teams are contacting people who've come into close contact with confirmed cases and are at high risk. They are offering advice and monitoring them. They are advising anyone else who has been in close contact with someone infected by monkeypox to isolate at home for up to 21 days.

Serbia refuses Ecclestone raid suspect extradition,"Police believe the man known to them as Daniel Vukovic left Heathrow Airport for Belgrade in December 2019 The extradition from Serbia of a wanted man accused of one of the biggest burglaries in English legal history was refused, the BBC has found. Known to the Met Police as Daniel Vukovic he is said to have led a series of burglaries on the luxury homes of three celebrities in December 2019. This included a Â£25m raid on the home of model Tamara Ecclestone. Court documents obtained by the BBC show the Met Police applied to extradite him from Serbia last spring. This first application was made on 14 April 2021 and was brought to the High Court in Belgrade by the Republic of Serbia's specialised department for organised crime. It was made at the request of the Met Police who wanted Mr Vukovic extradited to be prosecuted for ""conspiracy to commit a burglary"" and for ""conspiracy to launder money"". The extradition was refused on 15 July by a High Court in Belgrade, court documents show. Months later on 13 October this decision was appealed but again upheld by the High Court in Belgrade. Details in the document say ""Ljubomir Romanov"" is a ""legal resident"" of Serbia and therefore the legal basis for extradition was not met. It then cites an extradition treaty agreement betweenSerbia and the UK signed in December 1900,externalin which each country can deny extradition of its own citizens. Who Stole Tamara Ecclestone's Diamonds? Who is really behind Britain's biggest ever burglary? The police, the victims and even the suspects talk for the first time about the Â£26m series of raids on celebrity homes. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) ABBC investigation found a fresh image of Mr Vukovicleaving Heathrow Airport in December 2019, and that he uses at least 19 different aliases. He has links to countries including Serbia, Italy, Croatia, Bosnia and Peru. Italian authorities suggest his name is Alfredo Lindley, while government documents in Serbia show the request to extradite him came under another name - Ljubomir Romanov. In a world exclusive interview the British model spoke for the first time about the raid on her west London mansion The burglars used crowbars as they spent an hour ransacking the Kensington mansion of Tamara Ecclestone More than 400 items - including necklaces, watches, earrings and bangles - were stolen The suspect is believed to have been part of a gang of three other Italians who were jailed last November for their role in raiding the homes ofMs Ecclestone, Frank Lampard and a townhouse belonging to the now-deceased ex-owner of Leicester City Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. In total Â£26m worth of goods were stolen from the properties. The BBC has traced Mr Vukovic's last-known movements to the Serbian capital Belgrade In a BBC Sounds podcast, Met Police Det Con Andrew Payne said: ""It's clear Daniel Vukovic had a leading role in the conspiracy. ""The gang have links to Italy. They also have criminal associates in other European countries. It's highly likely that the stolen goods have gone through camps in Milan. ""It's also a fair assumption that the goods are likely to be in Serbia which is the host country where Daniel Vukovic is. ""This is a classic case of it's buried treasure. It's out there somewhere. Someone knows where it is. And at some point some of it has to surface.""

Travellers facing more lengthy delays at Dover,"Travellers heading to France are facing delays of several hours amid continuing gridlock on roads near Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone. More than 17,000 passengers had left Dover on ferries by lunchtime on one of the busiest weekends of the year. P&O Ferries warned customers to allow three to four hours to clear local roads and security checks on Saturday. Passengers using Eurotunnel also faced lengthy delays on the journey to the Folkestone terminal. Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? This weekend is one of the busiest for UK overseas travel as most schools in England and Wales have broken up for the summer. Families travelling to the Eurotunnel terminal told the BBC they faced delays of more than six hours amid heavy congestion around Folkestone. Passengers using Eurotunnel were asked to arrive two hours early by the operator. John Keefe, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, said traffic disruption had been caused by an accident on the M20 on Friday, and stretches of the road being used solely for freight traffic, with holidaymakers diverted on to A-roads. Saturday's delays follow long waits on Friday when a major incident was declared after routes around the Kent terminals were in gridlock and traffic queues four miles long also formed on the eastbound M2. This video can not be played Thousands of lorries stacked on M20 outside Dover A war of words broke out between UK and French officials over the cause of the disruption. In a visit to Kent on Saturday afternoon, Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss claimed delays at Dover ferry port were down to a lack of French border staff. She said: ""I'm very clear that we need to see action from them to resolve the terrible situation that people are facing."" But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont rejected this and said additional checks post-Brexit and a lack of capacity at the port were behind the problem. He also told BBC News the Port of Dover was ""too small"" and there were too few kiosks due to lack of space. Some 3,000 lorries are also waiting to cross the Channel. They are currently parked on the M20 outside Dover, while holiday traffic is prioritised. Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry drivers had waited to cross the Channel for ""well over 18 hours"" in queues with no toilet facilities. Jane Dennis and her family managed to escape the gridlock after six hours by taking a detour Jane Dennis, her husband and their five children, aged between three and 11, barely moved for six hours while trying to reach the Eurotunnel terminal. Between around 7am and 1pm they advanced approximately 70 metres before deciding to take a detour that friends had used. ""We hit the queue at about 07:05 BST, and we left the queue six hours later at about 13:10 BST, when we'd travelled 70 metres or so,"" she told the BBC. ""Literally inching a couple of cars' worth forward every hour."" She said the traffic queues weren't being managed by anyone, adding: ""It was just the way the gridlock happened, the one we were in initially there was nowhere for people to budge."" Once they made the detour, traffic was flowing freely on other roads. They eventually arrived in France 12 hours after setting off from home in Hampshire, and had to try to find a hotel to stay in overnight, before continuing their journey to a campsite in Vendee on Sunday. Anna Parkinson faced long delays while travelling with her three children. Holidaymaker Anna Parkinson took seven hours to travel two miles to the Eurotunnel terminal - with three ""fractious"" children sat in the back. She said she felt for local residents who ""currently can't leave their local villages because they're hemmed in by all of us desperately trying to get on the train that we should have caught five hours ago"". Tim Povall, travelling to Budapest with his wife, two sons and their dog, had been queuing for nearly seven hours when he spoke to the BBC, meaning their planned stopover in Bruges was disrupted. He says there should have been better organisation at Folkestone to avoid a ""free-for-all"". ""It's ruined this evening. My two sons are angry and my dog isn't happy. It just doesn't make sense. ""There are lots of pregnant people and people with kids walking around. It's hot, I feel sorry for them."" By Dan Johnson, BBC News We're told that things are flowing a bit more freely and that they are starting to eat into that backlog that built up yesterday. There are a lot of cars queuing here at the port at the moment. But in a sense this is the good queue. This is the queue you want to be part of. The problem is that thousands of people are stuck on the roads miles out from Dover trying to get across Kent to the port. They've been held back by the police operations that have been in place to try to manage the traffic, to try to stop Dover itself getting completely snarled up. And that does seem to have been a bit more successful today, but drivers are still being warned that they do face big delays. Has your journey been affected by the delays in Dover?

"Airport workers on what's going on behind the scenesPilots, flight attendants and a baggage handler tell us what is happening where they work.","Busy airports have become a familiar sight this year. The summer tourist season is under way, with some people travelling abroad for the first time since the Covid pandemic. But what is causing chaos at some UK airports? BBC News has spoken to a number of airline workers anonymously over the last few weeks. We got the inside story from front-line staff, including pilots, baggage handlers and cabin crew. Here's what they had to say about what's going on behind the scenes and how the airport and airlines have responded to them. A British Airways cabin crew member based at Heathrow Airport told the BBC that most long-haul flights are operating short of crew, which has a knock-on effect on staff tiredness. Though flights are still crewed above the legal minimums, he said the company was ""recruiting like mad to fill the gaps"". This can be a lengthy process, with delays to processing airside passes slowing things down. ""Whether it's us, or baggage handlers, we have to go through so much security checking in advance of employment. The system is way too slow."" He said team morale was a ""mixed bag"", with most happy to be flying with customers again. However, he described the negative feeling that sets in for cabin crew, as the plane descends into Heathrow. ""You used to land and think '30 minutes later I'll be on the way home'. Now, it's 'how long will this go on for?'."" He says that a shortage of airport workers and cleaners is behind delays in getting passengers and crew off the plane, includingpeople who use wheelchairs. ""None of us feel we can walk off the plane and leave people. It's a huge security risk. I'm sick to death with delays to that sort of thing."" British Airways told BBC News: ""We're grateful for the hard work of our colleagues whose wellbeing is extremely important to us and we are doing everything we can to support them during this busy time, while still providing the best service to our customers."" Throughout the summer, pictures of baggage piled up at airports has become a common sight. Another senior cabin crew member at a major airline operating out of Heathrow said pressure on staff to redress the backlogs made things worse. ""Stress is leading to a high sickness rate and absenteeism. Stand-by cover has been reduced, which can lead to flight cancellations, even a couple of hours before a plane is due to depart. ""We're flying our socks off to the legal minimums and maximums, and so many of the staff are new that it's much harder. We have to do half their jobs and it's not what they were expecting, so they often just leave. ""Customers are so rude and that can be a lot to take when it's someone's first real job."" A ground baggage handler, who has worked at Heathrow for 12 years, described the situation as ""a shambles"". ""Imagine a duck paddling on water; it's manic,"" he told the BBC. ""There are not enough baggage belts for the amount of flights. You could be waiting half an hour for a belt when a flight comes in. Within that half an hour, another flight will come in, which makes it 10 times worse. It's disheartening when you walk out and see all the passengers."" In more than a decade of ground handling, he says he has never seen things this bad, including whenash from an Icelandic volcanogrounded planes in 2011. He feels the problems stem from a lack of investment - on top of recruitment problems - and added that some baggage is sorted on a system that is about 40 years old. ""This is like a really bad snow day, but three months of it,"" he says. ""The school holidays will be worse. I'm petrified to go on holiday. I would not want to be transferring now - the chances of your bag making it are very slim."" A spokesperson for Heathrow Airport said: ""We recognise that the baggage system in T2 is old - that's why we want to replace it and have urged the CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] to allow us to invest in a new system as part of the next regulatory settlement. ""There is no shortage of airport workers - all parts of the airport are operational and we have the same capacity in security as summer 2019. ""We aren't responsible for airline ground handlers or air crew - both work directly for airlines."" The summer holidays will be a key test for an industry scarred by the impact of Covid. To try to better match demand to available resources, schedules and ambitions have been trimmed - in some cases, slashed - and some airports have placed limits on flight or passenger numbers. The calculation is that this sort of advance disruption is better than last-minute, on-the-day delays and cancellations. Will it be enough to ensure things do go smoothly? Some businesses appear to have done much better than others on the staffing front, and some airlines have made far fewer cancellations than others. Airports say they have recruited hundreds of new security officers. But aviation is a complex ecosystem, involving many different teams - and businesses. There are still some staffing weak spots, for example among ground handlers. Generally, firms say they have done what they can to minimise the chances of further disruption and delays, and they are focused on getting people away for their long-awaited holidays. But no-one can promise a completely hitch-free summer. Airport staff have told BBC News that they believe there has been a lack of forward planning ahead of the summer holidays. ""This year airports are more chaotic than usual,"" according to a pilot, who has worked for Virgin Atlantic for decades. He said staff have their own security queues which have been longer than normal and presumes that is because there are fewer staff. He added that passenger queues have been longer this summer, with some people even queueing outside. ""Passengers seem to realise the stress the industry is suffering. I was called out from stand-by to take a flight for which we had no captain. Passengers had been waiting for an hour or so past the departure time at the gate. I got a round of applause and high-fived."" He said cabin crew are telling him that passengers are in good spirits once they are under way but staff themselves are stressed. Cabin crew are working at or near minimum cabin manning levels with pilots experiencing fatigue. ""I feel the company has adopted a hostile working culture,"" he said. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: ""Due to airside ID referencing delays for new crew members, we've recently operated some flights with fewer cabin crew than would typically be on board. ""The crew complement on all flights fully adheres to the strict safety regulations stipulated by the CAA. ""We recognise the challenges that Heathrow Airport and the wider aviation ecosystem faces this summer and apologise to any of our customers who have been affected by longer wait times or sticking points in their journey."" Another pilot, who is taking a break from the industry, told us: ""My experience of the aviation industry is of a gradual decline, with periods of chaos due to that decline and not being prepared."" He added that the current problems are effects of decisions made since the start of the Covid pandemic, with no thought of the increased demand for travel afterwards. However, his biggest criticism lies with the drive for low prices and big profits where ""everything gets cut to the bone and during unusual times it will mean system breakdown"".

Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the disruption at the port of Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone has been caused by a lack of resources put in place by French authorities at the border. Speaking during a campaign visit to Kent today, she said: ""I'm very clear that we need to see action from them to resolve the terrible situation that people are facing."" She adds that she has been ""in touch with the French authorities"". When pressed on whether the situation has been caused by Brexit she insisted a lack of resources was to blame. Maddy Haxton, a security
officer at Heathrow airport, is travelling with a family
of seven from Ashford, Middlesex, to Berny-RiviÃ¨re in France. Theyâre in a convoy with three other families. Itâs their first
holiday since the start of the pandemic and they are all really looking to
getting away. She says: ""Weâve been in the area very close to the Eurotunnel for more than six hours. ""Weâre on the A20. We can hear the euro trains go past, weâre that close,"" she adds. ""Itâs
ridiculous â a nightmare! The seven of
us are getting sick of each other. The kids are accepting it though. ""We go to
France most years. It normally takes an hour-and-a-half."" Tim Povall is travelling to Budapest with his wife, two sons and their dog. They've been queuing for nearly seven hours on their way to the Eurotunnel, meaning their planned stopover in Bruges this evening has been disrupted. ""I don't think the severity of the situation is being
communicated well enough,"" says Tim. ""People are all talking about the delays in Dover for
the ferry, but I am certain that it's nowhere near as bad as this. ""We are nowhere near passport control. It's really
bad."" He says there should have been better organisation at Folkestone to avoid a ""free-for-all"". ""It's ruined this
evening. My two sons are angry and my dog isn't happy. It just doesn't make
sense. ""There are lots of pregnant people and people with kids
walking around. It's hot, I feel sorry for them."" Travellers heading to the port of Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone are still facing delays of between three and four hours, according to the AA. Meanwhile it says the
jams felt earlier across the south of England have cleared, although a few isolated pockets of traffic remain. It adds roads are expected to be much quieter tomorrow, compared to Friday and Saturday. But the next big
challenge facing the south east is clearing the backlog of freight that has
been queuing on the M20 outside Dover. Jack
Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, said there has been ""steady improvement"" throughout the day. But he said this would be ""little comfort"" to those still stuck in traffic. Dan JohnsonReporting from Dover Weâre told that things are flowing a bit more freely and that they are starting to eat into that backlog that built up yesterday. There are a lot of cars queuing here at the port at the moment. But in a sense this is the good queue. This is the queue you want to be part of. The problem is that thousands of people are stuck on the roads miles out from Dover trying to get across Kent to the port. Theyâve been held back by the police operations that have been in place to try to manage the traffic, to try to stop Dover itself getting completely snarled up. And that does seem to have been a bit more successful today, but drivers are still being warned that they do face big delays. Simon Oliver, his wife and two teenage sons have been
queueing for the Eurotunnel for eight-and-a-half hours (so far). They drove down to
Folkestone from Durham last night and stayed in a hotel, setting off at
615am this morning. Simon says they've been stop-starting every 20 yards. They're supposed to be at their cottage in the Loire valley by now. But theyâve booked another
night in Calais as they donât think theyâll get there in time tonight. Simon says the family are ""fine, just tired, and
frustrated"". But his eldest son has autism ""so his anxiety is fairly bad"". ""Weâre keeping him happy. Weâre doing our best with him.
Weâre putting on a brave face."" Freight drivers have been reminded they have to follow signs and use the M20. The Kent Resilience Forum (KRF) has said any hauliers trying to jump the queue not only risk a fine of Â£300 but will also be sent to the back of the line by police or other enforcers. In the past 24 hours, over 100 fixed penalty notices have been issued for non-compliance. Toby Howe, Tactical lead for the KRF, said traffic controls were the ""best option for keeping the county moving"". Marion Pettet and her husband David have made it through the channel tunnel after
long delays and are now en route to their holiday in France. She says the lack of information was ""bothersome"". ""There was no explanation as to what was happening. The
information panels were inaccurate, they werenât giving out the same
information as the tannoys."" But she says she is relieved this is happening after the recent heatwave, which saw record temperatures. ""Itâs frustrating, itâs annoying. The only thing I can say is
at least it wasnât 40 degrees."" A French MP has claimed the British government rejected a proposal to double the number of passport booths given to the French Police in Dover a few months ago. Pierre-Henri Dumont, Republican MP for Calais, also said the traffic jams at the port were because of Brexit. Hetweeted,external: ""No
need to blame French authorities for the traffic jams in Dover thatâs an
aftermath of Brexit.
We have to run more and longer checks."" Dumont also said yesterday the Port of Dover was âtoo smallâ and there were too few kiosks due to lack of space. The chief executive of the Port of Dover, Doug Bannister, has said that in a post-Brexit environment ""there will be increased transaction times at  the border"" but also said the port had created more capacity. The BBC has asked the Department for Transport for a response. Jane Dennis, her
husband and their five children (ranging from three to 11 years old) told us they left their queue and took a detour after being gridlocked. Insix hours, they had driven only75 metres. Jane says they've moved a bit now, after a friend recommended another way. But they're still a long way off from the camping site in Vendee, with another seven-hour drive once they reach France. I think we saved ourselves hours. Itâs incredible, and quite unfair on the people in the queue weâve left. Our friends had taken this detour and told us about it.  But in the queue there was no information, no traffic control, no police. Everyone was getting out of the cars, walking to Tesco to stock up on supplies. I did that with the kids. We took a risk, but we had to do something. Itâs been an absolute nightmare. Jane Dennis Holidaymakers have been facing long delays again today - but some predict they could become a regular feature for those heading for a European getaway. From September, the EU will be introducing even more checks - with biometric testing at the border for non-EU nationals. So, now we're not in the EU anymore, we'll see facial recognition and fingerprinting becoming the norm. It's already prompting warnings of more delays. Delayed holidaymaker Anna Parkinson has finally reached the Eurotunnel terminal. It has taken herseven hours to travel two miles- with three ""fractious"" children sat in the back. ""Actually theyâve been
very good, weâve played a few games, theyâve eaten a lot of food, Iâm glad we
brought copious amounts of snacks and iPads,"" she laughs. She's now on her way to her holiday, but says she feels for residents who ""currently canât leave their
local villages because theyâre hemmed in by all of us desperately
trying to get on the train that we should have caught five hours ago"". Lorries queuing during Operation Brock on the M20 near Ashford in Kent Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry
drivers had waited to cross the Channel for âwell over 18 hoursâ. She said: âOur primary concern is about the welfare of those
drivers that are in the queue but also importantly making sure we can get them
moving again, get them through the port as quickly as possible.â She said there were no toilet facilities in the queue and it was understood they couldnât be deployed for safety reasons. Chapman said it was hoped there would
be welfare support at some point. âWhat weâre certainly advising to any drivers who are heading to
the port or to Eurotunnel is - please come prepared, bring plenty of food and
drink with you, make sure you go to the loo before you leave, and just be
prepared for a long wait.â At least 17,215 passengers had made their way through the Port of Dover by lunchtime today, latest figures show. On Twitter, spokespeople for the port said they were ""working hard with our partners to get all passengers on their way as quickly as possible"". But thousands of cars and lorries remain queuing on roads leading up to the port. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we've been reporting, measures to smooth the flow of traffic in Kent continue after the major incident was declared. With thousands of cars and lorries still stuck on roads into Dover, the Operation Brock contraflow is also in place on the M20, say National Highways. It means a queue of lorries is parked on the motorway. Under the latest national Highways update: When Brexit voters thought they were ""taking back control"", the French actually took control of their own border, an union representative has told the BBC. Lucy Moreton, professional officer for the ISU union
that represents borders, immigration and customs staff, says the queues are ""not upsetting the French particularly"". ""This isnât our border that weâve taken back control of. In
fact, France has taken back control of its border in this respect."" Moreton adds it was a ""reasonably predictable"" outcome after Britain leaving the EU. ""This is the time that it's chosen to bite,"" she says. While Eurotunnel passengers have been complaining they have been caught up in delays reaching the terminal at Folkestone today - the company says its services are operating ""smoothly"". John Keefe, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, told the BBC drivers were experiencing delays on the motorways amid heavy holiday traffic and road restrictions due to the lorries parked on the M20 because of the Dover disruption. âWhile itâs slowing things down on traffic down moving through the county, itâs actually bringing... [them] to the terminal in a very orderly fashion,â he says. But he says increased EU border checks since Brexit have resulted in longer journey times for its passengers. Travellers using the Channel Tunnel shuttle service are now being asked to arrive at the terminal in Folkestone about two hours before departure. âThis infrastructure was created for borderless travel. So when the Channel Tunnel was built [there were] no requirements for passport controls, no requirements for customs controls on goods moving backwards and forwards between the UK and France, and thatâs different now."" he says. If you're a parent, you probably know how challenging long car trips with a young child can be. Dave Harvey and his family have been stuck in their car since leaving home early this morning on their way to the Eurostar terminal at Folkestone. ""Weâre moving now though... [we've] been
queuing for probably three hours now to get through,"" he says. He adds, ""[It's a] bit of a joke
really. The M20's closed. I donât know why itâs closed to be quite frank
with you."" So how does he feel at the start of his family summer holiday? ""Frustrated. Especially with the young
one. Sad and frustrated."" Dan JohnsonBBC News Weâre told the backlog is starting to clear but that it will take some time to get everyone where they need to be. Traffic is moving through Dover itself, into the port and onto ferries. Local streets are moving more freely than yesterday. But there are still thousands of cars and lorries held on roads into Dover. Motorists are being warned to carry water and food - itâs a warm day on the roads of Kent. Theyâve been told if they miss their ferry theyâll be put on the first one available. 10,000 cars are expected to pass through the port today, on top of the 8,500 yesterday. Itâs the busiest weekend of the year and because of the pandemic Dover hasnât seen anything like this since 2019. Local people are saying theyâve never seen it this bad. Brexit also means passport checks have changed and now take longer but drivers are asking why there arenât more staff and resources in place to handle the heavy demand. Â© 2025 BBC.

walking around. It's hot, I feel sorry for them."" Travellers heading to the port of Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone are still facing delays of between three and four hours, according to the AA. Meanwhile it says the
jams felt earlier across the south of England have cleared, although a few isolated pockets of traffic remain. It adds roads are expected to be much quieter tomorrow, compared to Friday and Saturday. But the next big
challenge facing the south east is clearing the backlog of freight that has
been queuing on the M20 outside Dover. Jack
Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, said there has been ""steady improvement"" throughout the day. But he said this would be ""little comfort"" to those still stuck in traffic. Dan JohnsonReporting from Dover Weâre told that things are flowing a bit more freely and that they are starting to eat into that backlog that built up yesterday. There are a lot of cars queuing here at the port at the moment. But in a sense this is the good queue. This is the queue you want to be part of. The problem is that thousands of people are stuck on the roads miles out from Dover trying to get across Kent to the port. Theyâve been held back by the police operations that have been in place to try to manage the traffic, to try to stop Dover itself getting completely snarled up. And that does seem to have been a bit more successful today, but drivers are still being warned that they do face big delays. Simon Oliver, his wife and two teenage sons have been
queueing for the Eurotunnel for eight-and-a-half hours (so far). They drove down to
Folkestone from Durham last night and stayed in a hotel, setting off at
615am this morning. Simon says they've been stop-starting every 20 yards. They're supposed to be at their cottage in the Loire valley by now. But theyâve booked another
night in Calais as they donât think theyâll get there in time tonight. Simon says the family are ""fine, just tired, and
frustrated"". But his eldest son has autism ""so his anxiety is fairly bad"". ""Weâre keeping him happy. Weâre doing our best with him.
Weâre putting on a brave face."" Freight drivers have been reminded they have to follow signs and use the M20. The Kent Resilience Forum (KRF) has said any hauliers trying to jump the queue not only risk a fine of Â£300 but will also be sent to the back of the line by police or other enforcers. In the past 24 hours, over 100 fixed penalty notices have been issued for non-compliance. Toby Howe, Tactical lead for the KRF, said traffic controls were the ""best option for keeping the county moving"". Marion Pettet and her husband David have made it through the channel tunnel after
long delays and are now en route to their holiday in France. She says the lack of information was ""bothersome"". ""There was no explanation as to what was happening. The
information panels were inaccurate, they werenât giving out the same
information as the tannoys."" But she says she is relieved this is happening after the recent heatwave, which saw record temperatures. ""Itâs frustrating, itâs annoying. The only thing I can say is
at least it wasnât 40 degrees."" A French MP has claimed the British government rejected a proposal to double the number of passport booths given to the French Police in Dover a few months ago. Pierre-Henri Dumont, Republican MP for Calais, also said the traffic jams at the port were because of Brexit. Hetweeted,external: ""No
need to blame French authorities for the traffic jams in Dover thatâs an
aftermath of Brexit.
We have to run more and longer checks."" Dumont also said yesterday the Port of Dover was âtoo smallâ and there were too few kiosks due to lack of space. The chief executive of the Port of Dover, Doug Bannister, has said that in a post-Brexit environment ""there will be increased transaction times at  the border"" but also said the port had created more capacity. The BBC has asked the Department for Transport for a response. Jane Dennis, her
husband and their five children (ranging from three to 11 years old) told us they left their queue and took a detour after being gridlocked. Insix hours, they had driven only75 metres. Jane says they've moved a bit now, after a friend recommended another way. But they're still a long way off from the camping site in Vendee, with another seven-hour drive once they reach France. I think we saved ourselves hours. Itâs incredible, and quite unfair on the people in the queue weâve left. Our friends had taken this detour and told us about it.  But in the queue there was no information, no traffic control, no police. Everyone was getting out of the cars, walking to Tesco to stock up on supplies. I did that with the kids. We took a risk, but we had to do something. Itâs been an absolute nightmare. Jane Dennis Holidaymakers have been facing long delays again today - but some predict they could become a regular feature for those heading for a European getaway. From September, the EU will be introducing even more checks - with biometric testing at the border for non-EU nationals. So, now we're not in the EU anymore, we'll see facial recognition and fingerprinting becoming the norm. It's already prompting warnings of more delays. Delayed holidaymaker Anna Parkinson has finally reached the Eurotunnel terminal. It has taken herseven hours to travel two miles- with three ""fractious"" children sat in the back. ""Actually theyâve been
very good, weâve played a few games, theyâve eaten a lot of food, Iâm glad we
brought copious amounts of snacks and iPads,"" she laughs. She's now on her way to her holiday, but says she feels for residents who ""currently canât leave their
local villages because theyâre hemmed in by all of us desperately
trying to get on the train that we should have caught five hours ago"". Lorries queuing during Operation Brock on the M20 near Ashford in Kent Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry
drivers had waited to cross the Channel for âwell over 18 hoursâ. She said: âOur primary concern is about the welfare of those
drivers that are in the queue but also importantly making sure we can get them
moving again, get them through the port as quickly as possible.â She said there were no toilet facilities in the queue and it was understood they couldnât be deployed for safety reasons. Chapman said it was hoped there would
be welfare support at some point. âWhat weâre certainly advising to any drivers who are heading to
the port or to Eurotunnel is - please come prepared, bring plenty of food and
drink with you, make sure you go to the loo before you leave, and just be
prepared for a long wait.â At least 17,215 passengers had made their way through the Port of Dover by lunchtime today, latest figures show. On Twitter, spokespeople for the port said they were ""working hard with our partners to get all passengers on their way as quickly as possible"". But thousands of cars and lorries remain queuing on roads leading up to the port. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we've been reporting, measures to smooth the flow of traffic in Kent continue after the major incident was declared. With thousands of cars and lorries still stuck on roads into Dover, the Operation Brock contraflow is also in place on the M20, say National Highways. It means a queue of lorries is parked on the motorway. Under the latest national Highways update: When Brexit voters thought they were ""taking back control"", the French actually took control of their own border, an union representative has told the BBC. Lucy Moreton, professional officer for the ISU union
that represents borders, immigration and customs staff, says the queues are ""not upsetting the French particularly"". ""This isnât our border that weâve taken back control of. In
fact, France has taken back control of its border in this respect."" Moreton adds it was a ""reasonably predictable"" outcome after Britain leaving the EU. ""This is the time that it's chosen to bite,"" she says. While Eurotunnel passengers have been complaining they have been caught up in delays reaching the terminal at Folkestone today - the company says its services are operating ""smoothly"". John Keefe, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, told the BBC drivers were experiencing delays on the motorways amid heavy holiday traffic and road restrictions due to the lorries parked on the M20 because of the Dover disruption. âWhile itâs slowing things down on traffic down moving through the county, itâs actually bringing... [them] to the terminal in a very orderly fashion,â he says. But he says increased EU border checks since Brexit have resulted in longer journey times for its passengers. Travellers using the Channel Tunnel shuttle service are now being asked to arrive at the terminal in Folkestone about two hours before departure. âThis infrastructure was created for borderless travel. So when the Channel Tunnel was built [there were] no requirements for passport controls, no requirements for customs controls on goods moving backwards and forwards between the UK and France, and thatâs different now."" he says. If you're a parent, you probably know how challenging long car trips with a young child can be. Dave Harvey and his family have been stuck in their car since leaving home early this morning on their way to the Eurostar terminal at Folkestone. ""Weâre moving now though... [we've] been
queuing for probably three hours now to get through,"" he says. He adds, ""[It's a] bit of a joke
really. The M20's closed. I donât know why itâs closed to be quite frank
with you."" So how does he feel at the start of his family summer holiday? ""Frustrated. Especially with the young
one. Sad and frustrated."" Dan JohnsonBBC News Weâre told the backlog is starting to clear but that it will take some time to get everyone where they need to be. Traffic is moving through Dover itself, into the port and onto ferries. Local streets are moving more freely than yesterday. But there are still thousands of cars and lorries held on roads into Dover. Motorists are being warned to carry water and food - itâs a warm day on the roads of Kent. Theyâve been told if they miss their ferry theyâll be put on the first one available. 10,000 cars are expected to pass through the port today, on top of the 8,500 yesterday. Itâs the busiest weekend of the year and because of the pandemic Dover hasnât seen anything like this since 2019. Local people are saying theyâve never seen it this bad. Brexit also means passport checks have changed and now take longer but drivers are asking why there arenât more staff and resources in place to handle the heavy demand. Â© 2025 BBC.

Trailer showcases $1bn Lord of the Rings TV show,"Actress Sophia Nomvete plays the dwarven Princess Disa of Khazad-Dum ""We wanted to find a huge, Tolkienian mega epic!"" That's how showrunner Patrick McKay described his mission for The Rings of Power - Amazon Prime's hotly anticipated Lord of the Rings TV spin-off, as he unveiled a new trailer and unseen footage at San Diego Comic-Con on Thursday. In his armoury: a huge cast of comely elves, a rare female dwarf, the Hobbits' ancestors, a seriously impressive CGI city, a mystery menace, an entwife and a surprise Balrog. The Rings of Power is the most expensive show ever made, at $1bn (Â£832m) for five seasons - and this is fans' best guide to how it will look, sound and feel. But what everyone really wants to know is, can it compete with Peter Jackson's beloved Lord of the Rings film trilogy, the winner of 17 Oscars, benchmark for composers, and populariser of second breakfast? Wisely, it's not trying - instead setting the action 4,000 years before the Hobbits Frodo and Sam journeyed through Middle Earth. This is the Second Age, where the 20 Rings of Power are forged and the evil Sauron, Lord of Mordor, rises to assault the realms' hard-won peace. The source material is Tolkien's appendix to the Lord of the Rings books. The core question: ""How far into the darkness would you go to protect the things you care about the most?"" says McKay's fellow showrunner JD Payne. It's a mix of new characters, some of them original to the show, and old favourites in younger form, like the immortal Elves Galadriel and Elrond (Morfydd Clark and Robert Aramayo), who are seen sharing a tender moment in one exclusive clip played at Comic-Con. Another atmospheric scene showed Elrond and the dwarf King Durin IV (Owain Arthur) competing to split rocks in a high-stakes test of strength. And orcs - the blighted race that formed Sauron's army in Tolkien's books - featured in combat with the elf Arondir (Ismael Cruz Cordova) as he battles his way out of enslavement. More than 20 cast members rotated on to the stage to share character insights, including Clark, who referenced the stately calm of Cate Blanchett's Galadriel in Jackson's films. ""I wanted to show how the serenity of Galadriel in the films comes hard-fought,"" she says. Arthur said he felt an affinity with the mine-dwelling dwarves, as his family had worked in a Welsh slate quarry - but the physical transformation into Durin was a challenge: ""Three hours every day and 45 minutes to take it all off!"" The fantasy drama is set thousands of years before the Lord of the Rings saga The Lord Of The Rings: The Rings Of Power will premiere on Amazon Prime Video on 2 September The lack of female dwarves in screen Tolkien has also been delightfully addressed - to the joy of actress Sophia Nomvete, who plays the dwarven Princess Disa of Khazad-Dum. ""I have the joy to host that revolutionary moment!"" she declared - before sharing that she had auditioned for the role ""when I was two days off giving birth... and then I got the call to say, you will be flying the torch for this incredible character, when my daughter was five days old"". Her costume as Princess Disa was designed so she could feed her weeks-old baby between takes. But if The Rings of Power relishes expanding into new territory, it also respects the established Tolkien lore. Some actors playing elves told the BBC at a media round-table they had worked with a specialist to get the pronunciation of Elvish languages right. Elrond actor Robert Aramayo said: ""When you encounter any Elvish, you sort of understand it in a deeper way, what the professor [Tolkien]... language was so important to him."" ""My most exciting thing was learning to write it!"" enthuses Charles Edwards, who plays the elven smith Celebrimbor who forges the Rings of Power. ""I took to it like a fish to water, I must say,"" beams Ismael Cruz Cordova (who is Puerto Rican), to laughter. ""It shares a lot of vowel sounds with Spanish!"" Arondir, Cruz CÃ³rdoba's elf character, shares a forbidden love with human healer Bronwyn (Nazanin Boniadi), who's also the mother of ""a somewhat rebellious teenager son"", as she describes it. Bronwyn is a rounded individual in her own right, however - something praised by Boniadi. ""They've given every female character such agency,"" she says. ""We don't serve the men."" Musically, we can expect more of the resonant drums and choral chanting that permeated Jackson's films. Series composer Bear McCreary, who conducted a live orchestra and choir at the panel event, said he wanted to honour the original score - and indeed, its composer Howard Shore created the series' theme music. Comedian and Tolkien superfan Stephen Colbert, who hosted the panel, told the audience he had read the Lord of the Rings trilogy more than 50 times. While many may simply wonder how he found time, if highlights the intensity of feeling this mythology conjures up for fans.

Google fires engineer who said AI tech has feelings,"Blake Lemoine photographed in San Francisco last month Google has fired one of its engineers who said the company's artificial intelligence system has feelings. Last month, Blake Lemoine went public with his theory that Google's language technology is sentient and should therefore have its ""wants"" respected. Google, plus several AI experts, denied the claims and on Friday the company confirmed he had been sacked. Mr Lemoine told the BBC he is getting legal advice, and declined to comment further. Google engineer says AI system may have feelings How human-like are the most sophisticated chatbots? In a statement, Google said Mr Lemoine's claims aboutThe Language Model for Dialogue Applications (Lamda),externalwere ""wholly unfounded"" and that the company worked with him for ""many months"" to clarify this. ""So, it's regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information,"" the statement said. Lamda is a breakthrough technology that Google says can engage in free-flowing conversations. It is the company's tool for building chatbots. Blake Lemoine started making headlines last monthwhen he said Lamda was showing human-like consciousness. It sparked discussion among AI experts and enthusiasts about the advancement of technology that is designed to impersonate humans. Mr Lemoine, who worked for Google's Responsible AI team, toldThe Washington Post,externalthat his job was to test if the technology used discriminatory or hate speech. He found Lamda showed self-awareness and could hold conversations about religion, emotions and fears. This led Mr Lemoine to believe that behind its impressive verbal skills might also lie a sentient mind. His findings were dismissed by Google and he was placed on paid leave for violating the company's confidentiality policy. Mr Lemoine then published a conversation he and another person had with Lamda, to support his claims. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sunak would put UK on 'crisis footing' as PM,"Tackling the backlog in the NHS is the biggest public services emergency, Rishi Sunak has said, as he and Liz Truss vie to become the UK's next prime minister. More than 6.6 million people in England are waiting for hospital treatment. Mr Sunak plans to eliminate one-year waiting times by September 2024 and get overall numbers falling by next year. Meanwhile, Ms Truss has announced plans for a ""bonfire"" of EU laws retained after Brexit. She has promised to scrap or replace laws that she argues hinder growth by the end of 2023. Speaking in Kent, where she was meeting Conservative party members, Ms Truss said it was time for ""bold action"" to drive the economy forward. ""I would make sure that people who work hard are rewarded, I'd make sure that businesses have incentives to invest in Britain so that we can get the jobs and growth we need to succeed at the next election and to drive Britain forward in the future."" The pledges come as the two remaining contenders in the contest to be party leader and the next prime minister step up campaigning, with Conservative Party members due to start receiving ballot papers this week. The winner will be announced on 5 September. What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Who are the Tories that will choose the next PM? Truss v Sunak: Who is winning the social media war? In a campaign speech in Grantham, the hometown of former Tory PM Margaret Thatcher, Mr Sunak said tackling the NHS backlog was the biggest public service emergency. ""We need a fundamentally different approach,"" he said. ""We will take the best of our Covid response and apply those lessons to clearing the massive backlog in the NHS."" Without a radically different approach, the NHS will come under unsustainable pressure and break, Mr Sunak says. As part of a number of measures, he is promising to offer more diagnostic services - such as MRI and CT scans - in repurposed empty High Street shops. Mr Sunak told his wife and children he had never been prouder to say he loved them all Mr Sunak admitted he was the ""underdog"" in the race to become prime minister. The former chancellor claimed there were ""forces"" in the Tory party who wanted the contest to be a ""coronation"" for his rival, Ms Truss, tipped as favourite among Conservative party voters. He went on to criticise her plans for tax cuts, saying there was ""nothing noble or good about wracking up money"" on credit. He said no amount of undeliverable promises would change that, in another swipe at Ms Truss. Speaking to the Times,externalearlier, Mr Sunak said a ""business-as-usual mentality isn't going to cut it"" when it comes to dealing with challenges that are ""staring us in the face"", including the economy, migration as well as the NHS. ""From day one of being in office I'm going to put us on a crisis footing."" Liz Truss, pictured here in Kent, is hoping to woo party members with a pitch to scrap EU laws Ms Truss rejected Mr Sunak's criticism that it would be wrong to raise government borrowing to fund tax cuts - a major policy difference between the candidates. She is pledging around Â£30bn in immediate tax cuts, arguing they will boost growth, while Mr Sunak has said immediate cuts could fuel already-soaring inflation. The foreign secretary said: ""We know fuel bills are higher. We know that food bills are higher. And what my changes would do is help people with the cost of living, but also drive growth in the economy that's going to lead to higher tax revenues so we can pay back that debt."" Ms Truss added: ""I'm being very honest about the situation. We face the biggest economic crisis we have for a generation and now is not the time for business as usual."" Of Mr Sunak's suggestion that she was the frontrunner, Ms Truss said: ""I'm not taking anything for granted. I want the support of Conservative members."" Earlier on Saturday she outlined her own pitch to be leader, describing herself as an ""insurgent"" who wants change, in an interview in theDaily Telegraph,external. She said after two decades of low growth and now the economic shock from the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the UK was facing a ""pivotal moment"". Ms Truss, among the ministers who did not resign from Boris Johnson's government earlier this month, has announced a plan to review thousands of laws inherited from the EU after Brexit. Although she campaigned to stay in the EU at the 2016 referendum - unlike Leave-voting Mr Sunak - she has since embraced Brexit and is now seeking to argue she is best placed to ensure it delivers economic benefits. She has promised to scrap or replace by the end of 2023 EU laws deemed to hold back the economy. Ms Truss has specifically said she would scrap EU rules for the insurance industry known as Solvency II, arguing they had deterred investment in infrastructure projects. The rules are alreadysubject to a government review,external. Mr Sunak, who quit as part of the cabinet mutiny against Boris Johnson, has clashed repeatedly with Ms Truss over economic policy during the campaign so far. Mr Sunak topped the MPs' ballots to qualify for the final run-off with Ms Truss, but polls currently suggest the foreign secretary is the favoured candidate of party members, who decide the leader. It is thought a significant chunk of the 160,000 or so Tory members will vote in the coming weeks. Hustings will take place throughout July and August, and the two candidates will square off in a live BBC TV debate on Monday, followed by another hosted by The Sun and TalkTV on Tuesday.

Who's winning the social media war?,"Social media is a key battleground in any election - even one with a very small electorate. How are Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss trying to win over the Tory members who will choose the next PM? They are two very different characters, with two very different campaigning styles. ""Everything about Sunak's approach is slick,"" says PR expert Mark Borkowski. ""It is overly professional in some points. I am not sure whether that is a good or a bad thing. There seems to be a lot of strategy and thinking behind it."" The Truss campaign on the other hand ""feels a little bit more homespun"", he adds. Who are the Tories that will choose the next PM? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Sunak's social media strategy is masterminded by Cass Horowitz, son of best-selling novelist Anthony Horowitz. As a special adviser to Sunak when he was chancellor, Horowitz used fancy graphics and clever tag lines to sell ""Brand Rishi"" to a younger, politically unengaged audience on Instagram. Theglossy ""origin story"" video,externalSunak used to launch his leadership campaign on Twitter - in which he talked about how his mother came to the UK in the early 1960s ""armed with hope for a better life"" - has been viewed more than 8 million times. Rishi Sunak's back story video has been viewed more than 8 million times So slick was this film that it raised suspicions that it had been in the works for some time - a suspicion shared by Mark Borkowski, who notes: ""You don't create this sort of campaign overnight"". Team Sunak insist the video was put together in 24 hours, after Boris Johnson announced he was standing down. Liz Truss's social team, run by Reuben Solomon, former head of digital at the Conservative Party, and a protege of Boris Johnson's favourite election strategist Sir Lynton Crosby, have played it safer so far. Theforeign secretary's launch film,externalis an attempt to project her as an international stateswoman. There is little about her own back story, and no spontaneous ""behind the scenes"" footage. There is much talk about ""delivery"". Liz Truss projects herself as an international stateswoman who is ready to lead One similarity between the two candidates - and indeed all of the Tory MPs who threw their hats into the leadership ring - is their desire to be on first name terms with the electorate. This is not a smart move, according to Anthony Ridge-Newman, associate professor of media and communication at Liverpool Hope University. ""Boris Johnson is one of the few politicians to ever be referred to commonly by his first name. The online campaign slogans, both Liz for Leader; and Ready for Rishi, are an attempt to emulate Boris's first name appeal. ""Had either of the Tory leadership candidates come to me for my expert advice, I would have suggested foregrounding their last names, Sunak and Truss. ""It would help their campaigns appear more prime ministerial, which, if I know anything about the Conservative Party, is something they look for in their candidates."" Rishi Sunak reacts to news that he has made the final two, in a campaign video Rishi Sunak's use of video has been more adventurous, with candid, supposedly off-the-cuff footage of him reacting to key moments. There was even an unexpected venture into comedy, with a parody of 1930s cinema newsreel, in a video trumpeting his Brexiteer credentials. But neither candidate is a natural in front of the camera or the smartphone, in Ridge-Newman's opinion, lacking the fluency of Boris Johnson or David Cameron. ""Sunak's digital content is largely presenting him to be a regular guy,"" which may be an attempt to neutralise recent media portrayals of him as a member of the wealthy ""elite"". he says. Team Sunak venture into parody with an early social video ""Truss on the other hand is presenting herself in a more statuesque manner. The digital content comes across quite posed and generic, and plays on her role, time and successes as foreign secretary. ""While Truss does not come across as a digital native, her social media campaign seems as though it is most strategically steered towards the Conservative Party membership, who are the ones who will be voting to decide Britain's next prime minister."" Liz Truss emphasises 'delivery' in her launch video One problem for Team Truss is that memes making fun of their candidate have been shared far more than anything produced by the campaign. ""She seems to be the one suffering from a lot of parody,"" says Mark Borkowski. So far, Google searches for ""Liz Truss"" have far outranked those for ""Rishi Sunak"", but they are often accompanied by the word ""cheese"". This is a reference to a2015 conference speech. in which he she says, in an impassioned voice: ""We import two-thirds of our cheese. That. Is. A. Disgrace."" Mr Sunak has also attracted derision on social media, with Labour supporters and others sharing a clip of him as a teenager talking about how he has no working class friends. The Truss campaign quotes the Daily Mail in a social media post But ultimately this is not a campaign that will be won and lost on social media. As theBBC's Media Editor Amol Rajan has pointed out, the Tory membership are ""a narrow section of the population that is much more attuned to newsprint than most Britons"". And Liz Truss appears to have one of the UK's biggest-selling papers The Daily Mail in her corner, which could prove decisive for her. ""In this old-fashioned newspaper election, the tenor of newsprint coverage over the next week could have a significant impact on who becomes prime minister - especially if the Times, Sun and Telegraph decide that, like the Mail, they know who they want, and give hell to whosoever they decide they don't want,"" says Amol Rajan.

Travel gridlock at Dover could worsen over weekend,"Travellers heading to France are facing delays of several hours amid continuing gridlock on roads near Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone. More than 17,000 passengers had left Dover on ferries by lunchtime on one of the busiest weekends of the year. P&O Ferries warned customers to allow three to four hours to clear local roads and security checks on Saturday. Passengers using Eurotunnel also faced lengthy delays on the journey to the Folkestone terminal. Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? This weekend is one of the busiest for UK overseas travel as most schools in England and Wales have broken up for the summer. Families travelling to the Eurotunnel terminal told the BBC they faced delays of more than six hours amid heavy congestion around Folkestone. Passengers using Eurotunnel were asked to arrive two hours early by the operator. John Keefe, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, said traffic disruption had been caused by an accident on the M20 on Friday, and stretches of the road being used solely for freight traffic, with holidaymakers diverted on to A-roads. Saturday's delays follow long waits on Friday when a major incident was declared after routes around the Kent terminals were in gridlock and traffic queues four miles long also formed on the eastbound M2. This video can not be played Thousands of lorries stacked on M20 outside Dover A war of words broke out between UK and French officials over the cause of the disruption. In a visit to Kent on Saturday afternoon, Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss claimed delays at Dover ferry port were down to a lack of French border staff. She said: ""I'm very clear that we need to see action from them to resolve the terrible situation that people are facing."" But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont rejected this and said additional checks post-Brexit and a lack of capacity at the port were behind the problem. He also told BBC News the Port of Dover was ""too small"" and there were too few kiosks due to lack of space. Some 3,000 lorries are also waiting to cross the Channel. They are currently parked on the M20 outside Dover, while holiday traffic is prioritised. Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry drivers had waited to cross the Channel for ""well over 18 hours"" in queues with no toilet facilities. Jane Dennis and her family managed to escape the gridlock after six hours by taking a detour Jane Dennis, her husband and their five children, aged between three and 11, barely moved for six hours while trying to reach the Eurotunnel terminal. Between around 7am and 1pm they advanced approximately 70 metres before deciding to take a detour that friends had used. ""We hit the queue at about 07:05 BST, and we left the queue six hours later at about 13:10 BST, when we'd travelled 70 metres or so,"" she told the BBC. ""Literally inching a couple of cars' worth forward every hour."" She said the traffic queues weren't being managed by anyone, adding: ""It was just the way the gridlock happened, the one we were in initially there was nowhere for people to budge."" Once they made the detour, traffic was flowing freely on other roads. They eventually arrived in France 12 hours after setting off from home in Hampshire, and had to try to find a hotel to stay in overnight, before continuing their journey to a campsite in Vendee on Sunday. Anna Parkinson faced long delays while travelling with her three children. Holidaymaker Anna Parkinson took seven hours to travel two miles to the Eurotunnel terminal - with three ""fractious"" children sat in the back. She said she felt for local residents who ""currently can't leave their local villages because they're hemmed in by all of us desperately trying to get on the train that we should have caught five hours ago"". Tim Povall, travelling to Budapest with his wife, two sons and their dog, had been queuing for nearly seven hours when he spoke to the BBC, meaning their planned stopover in Bruges was disrupted. He says there should have been better organisation at Folkestone to avoid a ""free-for-all"". ""It's ruined this evening. My two sons are angry and my dog isn't happy. It just doesn't make sense. ""There are lots of pregnant people and people with kids walking around. It's hot, I feel sorry for them."" By Dan Johnson, BBC News We're told that things are flowing a bit more freely and that they are starting to eat into that backlog that built up yesterday. There are a lot of cars queuing here at the port at the moment. But in a sense this is the good queue. This is the queue you want to be part of. The problem is that thousands of people are stuck on the roads miles out from Dover trying to get across Kent to the port. They've been held back by the police operations that have been in place to try to manage the traffic, to try to stop Dover itself getting completely snarled up. And that does seem to have been a bit more successful today, but drivers are still being warned that they do face big delays. Has your journey been affected by the delays in Dover?

Google fires engineer who said AI tech has feelingsBlake Lemoine went public with his beliefs that Google's breakthrough Lamda technology is sentient.Technology,"Blake Lemoine photographed in San Francisco last month Google has fired one of its engineers who said the company's artificial intelligence system has feelings. Last month, Blake Lemoine went public with his theory that Google's language technology is sentient and should therefore have its ""wants"" respected. Google, plus several AI experts, denied the claims and on Friday the company confirmed he had been sacked. Mr Lemoine told the BBC he is getting legal advice, and declined to comment further. Google engineer says AI system may have feelings How human-like are the most sophisticated chatbots? In a statement, Google said Mr Lemoine's claims aboutThe Language Model for Dialogue Applications (Lamda),externalwere ""wholly unfounded"" and that the company worked with him for ""many months"" to clarify this. ""So, it's regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information,"" the statement said. Lamda is a breakthrough technology that Google says can engage in free-flowing conversations. It is the company's tool for building chatbots. Blake Lemoine started making headlines last monthwhen he said Lamda was showing human-like consciousness. It sparked discussion among AI experts and enthusiasts about the advancement of technology that is designed to impersonate humans. Mr Lemoine, who worked for Google's Responsible AI team, toldThe Washington Post,externalthat his job was to test if the technology used discriminatory or hate speech. He found Lamda showed self-awareness and could hold conversations about religion, emotions and fears. This led Mr Lemoine to believe that behind its impressive verbal skills might also lie a sentient mind. His findings were dismissed by Google and he was placed on paid leave for violating the company's confidentiality policy. Mr Lemoine then published a conversation he and another person had with Lamda, to support his claims. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It added that any employee concerns about the company's technology are reviewed ""extensively"", and that Lamda has been through 11 reviews. ""We wish Blake well"", the statement ended.
