Born Doris Mary Ann Von Kappelhoff in April 1922, Day originally wanted to be a dancer but had to abandon her dream after breaking her right leg in a car accident. Instead she began her singing career at the age of 15. Her first hit, Sentimental Journey, would become a signature tune. Her films, which included Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much and That Touch of Mink, made her known around the world. But she never won an Oscar and was nominated only once, in 1960, for Pillow Talk, the first of her three romantic comedies with Hudson. Honours she did receive included the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004 and a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2008. Her last release, the compilation album My Heart, went to number one in the UK in 2011. Day's real life was not as upbeat as her on-screen persona Day's wholesome, girl-next-door image was a popular part of her myth that sometimes invited ridicule. ""I've been around so long, I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin,"" the musician Oscar Levant once remarked. Day herself said her ""Miss Chastity Belt"" image was ""more make-believe than any film part [she] ever played."" Her life was certainly not as sunny. She married four times, was divorced three times and was widowed once. She also suffered a mental breakdown and had severe financial trouble after one husband squandered her money. In the 1970s, she turned away from performing to focus her energies on her animal foundation. According to the organisation, she wished to have no funeral, memorial service or grave marker. In later life she became an advocate for animal welfare Dick Van Dyke, another Hollywood legend from the same era although he never worked with Day, said she had an ""energy about her"". ""She wasn't trying to act. It was just who Doris Day was, I think, a great energy and exhilaration, and she seemed to love life, at least that's the impression you got,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""It was a great era."" Star Trek actor William Shatner remembered Dayon Twitter,externalas ""the World's Sweetheart,"" saying she was ""beloved by all"". Fellow Star Trek cast member George Takei said she was ""synonymous with Hollywood icon,external"", while Spanish actor Antonio Banderas wrote: ""Thank you for your talent,external."" Novelist Paulo Coelho marked her passingby quoting lyrics from Secret Love,external, one of her numbers in Calamity Jane. ""We've lost another great Hollywood talent,""tweeted,externalFamily Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, while actor Luke Evanssaid,externalhe had ""always loved"" her voice and ""beautiful"" songs. Former Beatles member Paul McCartney paid tribute to Day on his website, describing her as ""very funny lady who I shared many laughs with"", adding: ""I will miss her but will always remember her twinkling smile and infectious laugh"". And his daughter, fashion designer Stella McCartney, shared a photo of her and Day alongside words which read: ""The one, the only, the woman who inspired so much of what I do.""

WhatsApp discovers surveillance attack,"WhatsApp has 1.5bn users, but it believed the attacks were highly-targeted Hackers were able to remotely install surveillance software on phones and other devices using a major vulnerability in messaging app WhatsApp, it has been confirmed. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, said the attack targeted a ""select number"" of users and was orchestrated by ""an advanced cyber-actor"". A fix was rolled out on Friday. On Monday, WhatsApp urged all of its 1.5 billion users to update their apps as an added precaution. The surveillance software involved was developed by Israeli firmNSO Group, according to a report in theFinancial Times,external. Why the WhatsApp spies may have eyes on Iran Facebook first discovered the flaw in WhatsApp earlier in May. WhatsApp promotes itself as a ""secure"" communications app because messages areend-to-end encrypted, meaning they should only be displayed in a legible form on the sender or recipient's device. However, the surveillance software would have let an attacker read the messages on the target's device. Some users of the app have questioned why the app store notes associated with the latest update are not explicit about the fix. ""Journalists, lawyers, activists and human rights defenders"" are most likely to have been targeted, saidAhmed Zidan,externalfrom the non-profit Committee to Protect Journalists. Android Open theGoogle Playstore Tap the menu at the top left of the screen Tap My Apps & Games If WhatsApp has recently been updated, it will appear in the list of apps with a button that says Open If WhatsApp has not been automatically updated, the button will say Update. Tap Update to install the new version The latest version of WhatsApp on Android is 2.19.134 iOS Open theApp Store At the bottom of the screen, tap Updates If WhatsApp has recently been updated, it will appear in the list of apps with a button that says Open If WhatsApp has not been automatically updated, the button will say Update. Tap Update to install the new version The latest version of WhatsApp on iOS is 2.19.51 It involved attackers using WhatsApp's voice calling function to ring a target's device. Even if the call was not picked up, the surveillance software could be installed. According to the FT report, the call would often disappear from the device's call log. WhatsApp told the BBC its security team was the first to identify the flaw. It shared that information with human rights groups, selected security vendors and the US Department of Justice earlier this month. ""The attack has all the hallmarks of a private company reportedly that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems,â the company said on Monday in a briefing document note for journalists. What is encryption? What we know about the secretive NSO Group The firm also published anadvisory to security specialists,external, in which it described the flaw as: ""A buffer overflow vulnerability in WhatsApp VOIP [voice over internet protocol] stack allowed remote code execution via specially crafted series of SRTCP [secure real-time transport protocol] packets sent to a target phone number.â Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey said it was a ""pretty old-fashioned"" method of attack. ""A buffer overflow is where a program runs into memory it should not have access to.  It overflows the memory it should have and hence has access to memory in which malicious code can potentially be run,"" he explained. ""If you are able to pass some code through the app, you can run your own code in that area. ""In VOIP there is an initial process that dials up and establishes the call, and the flaw was in that bit. Consequently you did not need to answer the call for the attack to work."" The NSO Group is an Israeli company that has been referred to in the past as a ""cyber-arms dealer"". While some cyber-security companies report the flaws they find so that they can be fixed, others keep problems to themselves so they can be exploited or sold to law enforcement. The NSO Group ispart-owned by the London-based private equity firm Novalpina Capital,external, which acquired a stake in February. NSO's flagship software, Pegasus, has the ability to collect intimate data from a target device, including capturing data through the microphone and camera, and gathering location data. In a statement, the group said: ""NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. On the frontline of India's WhatsApp fake news war WhatsApp sets new rules after mob killings ""The company does not operate the system, and after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions. We investigate any credible allegations of misuse and if necessary, we take action, including shutting down the system. ""Under no circumstances would NSO be involved in the operating or identifying of targets of its technology, which is solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. NSO would not or could not use its technology in its own right to target any person or organisation."" WhatsApp said it was too early to know how many users had been affected by the vulnerability, although it added that suspected attacks were highly-targeted. According to theNew York Times,external, one of the people targeted was a London-based lawyer involved in a lawsuit against the NSO Group. Amnesty International, which said it had been targeted by tools created by the NSO Group in the past, said this attack was one human rights groups had long feared was possible. ""They're able to infect your phone without you actually taking an action,"" said Danna Ingleton, deputy programme director for Amnesty Tech. She said there was mounting evidence that the tools were being used by regimes to keep prominent activists and journalists under surveillance. ""There needs to be some accountability for this, it can't just continue to be a wild west, secretive industry."" On Tuesday, a Tel Aviv court will hear a petition led by Amnesty International that calls for Israel's Ministry of Defence to revoke the NSO Group's licence to export its products. How many people were targeted?WhatsApp says it is too early in its investigation to say how many people were targeted, or how long the flaw was present in the app Does updating WhatsApp remove the spyware?While the update fixes the flaw that let this attack take place, WhatsApp has not said whether the update removes any spyware that has already infected a compromised device What could the spyware do?WhatsApp has not said whether the attack could extend beyond the confines of WhatsApp, reaching further into a device and accessing emails, photos and more ""Using an app as an attack route is limited on iOS as they run apps in very tightly controlled sandboxes,"" said Prof Woodward. ""We're all assuming that the attack was just a corruption of WhatsApp but analysis is still ongoing. ""The nightmare scenario would be if you could get something much more capable onto the device without the user having to do anything,"" he said. The BBC has asked WhatsApp for clarification. _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

America's archetypal girl next door,"Doris Day was the fresh-faced, all-American girl who became one of the world's most bankable film stars. Her glittering singing career included timeless classics like Whip Crack Away, QuÃ© SerÃ¡ SerÃ¡ and Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps. On screen, the wholesome, girl-next-door never failed to find love.  Off screen, she could not have had less luck: she married four times. One of them beat her and another one robbed her. Later in life, she suffered the agony of watching her beloved only child die of an untreatable tumour. She retreated to a house in California, surrounding herself with animals and campaigning for their welfare. Doris Mary Ann Von Kappelhoff came into the world in Cincinnati, Ohio - the descendant of German immigrants - in April 1922. But for decades, she would insist she was actually born in 1924. In 2018, her birth certificate was dug out of the state Office of Vital Statistics to settle the dispute. She was wrong, but shrugged it off. ""I've always said that age is just a number,"" she said. ""I've never paid much attention to birthdays."" Doris Day, aged 13, with her dance partner Jerry Doherty Her father, who worked as a music teacher, left his wife for another woman when Doris was 12. The future star was brought up by her mother. She attended dance classes from an early age and, by the time she entered her teens, was performing regularly with her dance partner, Jerry Doherty, winning prizes at local pageants. The pair had dreams of trying their luck in Hollywood but, the night before they were due to depart, Day's car was hit by a train. One of her legs was badly broken; her dancing career in ruins. It took months to recover.  She passed the time singing along to the radio and, as she put it, ""discovered a talent I didn't know I had"". She was particularly enamoured with the sound of Ella Fitzgerald. Her mother arranged singing lessons for her which led to sessions on a local radio station, where she was heard by the bandleader Barney Rapp. According to Rapp, he auditioned about 200 singers before signing the young Doris Kappelhoff. The song that bowled him over was Day by Day. Rapp suggested she took inspiration from the title and change her name. Kappelhoff was too long to display on the scrolling marquees outside concert venues. Her breakthrough came while she was working with the Les Brown Orchestra, with whom she had her first hit, Sentimental Journey, in 1945. She fostered her girl-next-door image By this time she had met, married and quickly divorced her first husband, the musician Al Jorden, who sadly proved physically abusive. The couple had one child, her son Terry. Her second marriage, to actor George Weidler in 1946, lasted just eight months after he failed to come to terms with the success of her career. By the time she left Les Brown in 1946 she had become one of the highest-paid female vocalists in the world with a string of chart hits. After singing at a party given by songwriter Sammy Cahn, Doris Day was given a Warner Brothers contract and the lead in the 1948 film, Romance on the High Seas. Over the next few years, she played in a series of musicals, including Tea for Two, On Moonlight Bay, By the Light of the Silvery Moon and I'll See You in My Dreams. Her roles were undemanding, but as Miss American Pie, the tomboy girl-next-door who morphed into the beautiful blonde, audiences found Doris Day irresistible and US soldiers serving in the Korean War voted her their favourite star. In 1952 she formed her own production company, in partnership with third husband, Martin Melcher, and a year later starred in the film musical Calamity Jane, which contained a string of hit songs including the Oscar-winning Secret Love. She surprised the critics with the strength of her performance in Love Me or Leave Me, a fictionalised account of the  life of nightclub singer Ruth Etting, who suffered the violent attacks of her gangster husband, played by James Cagney. She starred with Rock Hudson in 1959's Pillow Talk There was also a performance in the Alfred Hitchcock film The Man Who Knew Too Much, which spawned one of her biggest hits - QuÃ© SerÃ¡ SerÃ¡. Her biggest cinema hit came in 1959, with Pillow Talk, where her on-screen partnership with Rock Hudson, earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. She continued to make films in the 1960s, some of them such as Glass Bottom Boat and Where Were You When the Lights Went Out, did reasonably well at the box office. But as the sexual revolution of the 1960s stormed Hollywood, Doris went out of fashion. Critics poked fun at the wholesome image: one declaring himself ""so old, I remember her before she became a virgin"". Audiences found it increasingly hard to connect. She turned down the Sound of Music, declaring herself too American to play a nun from Salzburg. But nor was she ready to change her image and embrace the times: rejecting the role of Mrs Robinson in The Graduate. She said she found the script to be ""vulgar and offensive"". Her husband, who had been managing her career, died suddenly in 1968 and Day was horrified to discover he had squandered all her earnings, leaving her bankrupt. Prior to his death, and without her knowledge, he had also committed her to a television series; Day was exhausted but honoured the contract and The Doris Day Show ran successfully for five years until 1973. Doris Day and her only son, Terry Melcher, in the late 1980s Day fought a long battle in the courts against her husband's business partner, the lawyer Jerome Rosenthal. She was eventually awarded more than $22m, then the biggest civil settlement in Californian legal history - although she eventually settled for a quarter of that sum. In 1976, she was married for the fourth time, to Barry Comden, who was a waiter at one of her favourite restaurants. The union ended in 1981. There was a brief comeback when she released her 29th studio album, My Heart, which contained songs she had recorded but never released during the 1980s. It reached the UK Top 10 in September 2011. Doris Day had been a strong advocate for animal welfare since founding Actors and Others for Animals in 1971, which campaigned against the fur trade. She collected furry things wherever she found them, becoming known on set as the ""Dog Catcher of Beverley Hills"". Following her retirement she ran the Doris Day Animal League at her home in Carmel, California, her house filled with stray animals rescued from the streets. She repeatedly turned down the offer of a lifetime achievement Oscar but, in 2004, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W Bush for her work as an entertainer and her commitment to animal welfare. She devoted the latter part of her life to animals Her fear of flying prevented her attending the ceremony in person. In the same year, her only child Terry, who had tasted success as a songwriter and producer, died of melanoma. She remained active in choosing which films, adverts and TV shows got to play the Doris Day hits, but resisted all attempts to lure her out of retirement.  She chose dogs and cats over fame and fortune, but had no regrets. ""I've always believed things work out exactly as they're supposed to,"" she told one interviewer.

UK should consider defence boost - Hunt,"The UK should consider ""decisively"" increasing defence spending after Brexit, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. He told the Lord Mayor's Banquet in London the threats facing the UK had changed ""markedly"" since the Cold War. He said any extra money should be spent on ""new capabilities and not simply plugging gaps"". Labour said real-terms funding for defence had been cut by Â£9bn since 2010. The government will decide its spending commitments up to 2021 and potentially beyond in the Comprehensive Spending Review this autumn. PM 'could set resignation date this week' Reality Check: What's happening to defence spending? There has not been a full-scaleStrategic Defence and Security Review,external, looking at future defence challenges and capabilities since 2015 and one is expected in 2020. Mr Hunt said it was ""not sustainable"" to expect the US to spend 4% of its GDP on defence while other Nato allies spent between 1% and 2%. The UK already spends 2% of its economic output on defence but many European countries do not - although all Nato members have agreed to do this by 2024. ""So for these and other reasons I believe it is time for the next Strategic Defence and Security Review to ask whether, over the coming decade, we should decisively increase the proportion of GDP we devote to defence,"" he said. ""We simply do not know what the balance of power in the world will be in 25 years' time."" Mr Hunt said the UK currently accounted for almost 20% of total EU defence spending, and British forces contributed a ""hugely disproportionate share"" of some key capabilities. But he added that the UK had entered a ""multipolar world"" without the ""assurance provided by unquestioned American dominance"". ""We face a more aggressive Russia and a more assertive China. We simply do not know what the balance of power in the world will be in 25 years time,"" he said. On Brexit Mr Hunt said the UK must leave the EU ""cleanly and properly"", and to fail to do so ""would betray the promise of a democracy"". The foreign secretary is among those expected to stand to succeed Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party when she steps down. Mrs May has already promised to go once the first stage of Brexit is over. Pressure has grown on the PM to set out a date for her departure following the Conservatives'drubbing at the local elections. Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith said Mr Hunt had sat in successive cabinets since 2010 which had cut defence spending.

Any Brexit deal 'must include fresh vote',"This video can not be played Michael Gove resists calls to set a deadline for the talks A cross-party Brexit deal will not get through Parliament unless it is subject to a fresh public vote, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says. Talks between Labour and ministers over leaving the EU have been going on for a month with little sign of progress. Sir Keirtold the Guardian,externalthat without a new referendum up to 150 Labour MPs would vote against any agreement made. Environment Secretary Michael Gove suggested Labour needed more time to come to terms with the idea of a deal. ""For some in the Labour Party it will be a significant step to accept supporting Brexit and to come behind the prime minister's approach,"" he told the BBC. After talks broke up on Monday evening, a Labour spokesperson said the shadow cabinet would be updated on what had been discussed. The BBC's Iain Watson said: ""It sounds like the plug has not been pulled on these yet, but it doesn't sound as if there's substantial progress to report."" A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""In preparation for an update to cabinet tomorrow, today's meeting took stock across the range of issues discussed in talks over the last few weeks"". ""We continue to seek to agree a way forward in order to secure our orderly withdrawal from the EU."" The UK was due to leave the EU on 29 March but the deadline was pushed back to 31 October after MPs rejected Theresa May's proposed deal three times. Brexit: All you need to know What happens next? Fresh Brexit vote would put democracy at risk, says DUP's Foster Talks between the government and Labour aimed at finding a way to end the impasse resumed on Monday, with pressure growing on both sides to show progress or pull out.

No 10 said there was a ""clear desire"" to get on with the process. Asked if there was a deadline, a spokesman said: ""Let's see where we get to this evening."" If there is no agreement, Theresa May has said she will return to Parliament and ask MPs to vote again on a range of possible options. This video can not be played The deputy Labour leader urges voters to reject ""nationalism"" and ""populism"" in the EU elections Parliament failed to unite behind a way forward in a series of ""indicative votes"" in March, but the PM says the government would now be prepared to accept whatever commanded a majority, so long as Labour did too. Sir Keir said he would not be afraid to end the talks as soon as this week if the PM did not budge on her so-called red lines - positions that she feels cannot be changed in the Brexit deal. He suggested a referendum on the final deal had become a red line of its own for many Labour MPs, saying ""A significant number, probably 120 if not 150, would not back a deal if it hasn't got a confirmatory vote."" Labour's stated policy is that it supports a further referendum on Brexit under certain circumstances. It has rejected the idea of campaigning for one in any event but will demand a public vote if it cannot get changes to the government's deal or an election. On this day: Labour leader John Smith dies at 55,external Pollwatch: Euro elections European elections: What you need to know Labour agrees a Brexit referendum position Labour's Stephen Kinnock, who backs the UK leaving but retaining the closest possible economic links with the EU, said it would be a ""real shame"" if the talks were ""torpedoed"" by his party's insistence on another referendum. ""If you try to insert a second referendum into these talks they won't get through because the Conservatives will not whip their MPs to support it,"" he told Radio 4's World At One. However, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, said another public vote was the only ""way out"" of the current stalemate. This video can not be played Lord Adonis: ""The great majority of people do want a referendum - that's very clear from the polling."" Asked whether Labour wanted to leave or remain in the EU, he told Radio 4's Today: ""We are a remain and reform party,"" but ""when it comes to a deal people can form their own view."" In a speech later marking the 25th anniversary of former Labour leader John Smith's death, Mr Watson reflected on Mr Smith's pro-Europeanism and said he would have backed a ""People's Vote"". Asked if a deadline should be set for the talks, Mr Gove said the government needed time to properly ""understand and explore"" Labour's position. While another referendum would be a ""bad idea"" he said, Mr Gove declined to rule out any of Labour's main proposals, such assome form of customs union with the EU. The reality is these talks have been genuine, but very difficult. Neither side wanted to pull the plug before the local elections 10 days or so ago. But now, as time goes on, it may well be we are reaching the moment where they have to throw up their hands and say: ""We just can't do it."" Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May are both on lonely tightropes trying to get across the other side of this slow-moving crisis. I think they would both like it to be over with, maybe with a cross-party deal. But the prime minister doesn't want to put a huge compromise on the table, she doesn't want another referendum. Jeremy Corbyn doesn't want to help out the government unless he can get genuine changes. If neither of them feel they can really budge, well, the talks are not going to be able to succeed, and the government will then have to try to move on to votes in Parliament, the next part of the process.

Six jailed over Glasgow 'war zone' gang feud,"The guilty men included (clockwise, from top left) Peter Bain, Brian Ferguson, Andrew Gallacher and John Hardie Six men who tried to turn Glasgow into a ""war zone"" during a feud with a rival gang have been jailed for a total of 104 years. The associates of the Lyons criminal family were found guilty of plotting attempts to kill five men linked to their rivals, the Daniel family. Police said it was a ""miracle"" that no-one died in the violent attacks. The judge, Lord Mulholland, said the ""sophisticated plot"" was foiled by ""good, old-fashioned detective work"". Brian Ferguson, 37, Andrew Gallacher, 40, Robert Pickett, 53, Andrew Sinclair, 32, John Hardie, 35, and Peter Bain, 45, werefound guilty of conspiracy to murderlast month. Ferguson, Gallacher and Hardie were each jailed for 20 years; Picket was jailed for 16 years; Bain was jailed for 15 years; and Sinclair was jailed for 13 years and three months. This video can not be played Lord Mulholland sentenced the men to 104 years in jail Lord Mulhollandtold them,external: ""You sought to turn Glasgow into a war zone for your feud. ""This is a civilised city, which is based on the rule of law. There is no place for this type of conduct, retribution or the law of the jungle."" The men had targeted Robert Daniel, Thomas Bilsland, Gary Petty, Ryan Fitzsimmons and Steven Daniel between June 2016 and September 2017 at locations in Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and Manchester. Their attackers were tracked down during Operation Engagement, the latest investigation linked to the feud - which has been connected to dozens of tit-for-tat attacks, including a murder. The trial heard that victim Steven Daniel knew Kevin ""Gerbil"" Carroll, who was shot dead in the car park of Asda, Robroyston, in January 2010. The first murder trial, which later collapsed, heard thatCarroll's killer, William Paterson, visited a member of the Lyons family in prison, two days after the supermarket murder. The latest 14-week trial at the High Court in Glasgow, which was held amid tight security, focused on five attempted murders in five months. This video can not be played CCTV captures a high-speed chase towards the M8 motorway The murder bids included an attack on Steven Daniel on 18 May 2017. After a high-speed car chase which ended with a crash on an off-ramp of the M8, he was attacked with a cleaver and a hammer. His nose was almost severed from his face, and hisinjuries were so severethat police initially thought he had been shot at close range. The Audi S3 used in the attack was set on fire, but a bloodied machete was discovered in the back seat. Mr Daniel was badly injured in the attack in May 2017 The first attack was on Robert Daniel, whose car was rammed by another vehicle before he was chased into a house in Robroyston on 8 December 2016. Once inside the house he was struck twice on the back of the head with what he later told police was a hatchet or a machete. A month later, Thomas Bilsland suffered a fractured skull after he was set upon in Glasgow's Cranhill. Gary Petty was targeted after he visited an Italian takeaway in Maryhill on 7 March 2017. A Landrover Discovery was found after the attack on Robert Daniel Former soldier Ryan Fitzsimmons was left unconscious and brain-damaged after being ambushed in the street by a masked gang on 28 April 2017. The 34-year-old was attacked with a sword and a hammer outside the home he shared with his mother in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. He told jurors: ""It felt like death was coming."" His mum Geraldine, 61, was so affected by what happened that she suffered a heart attack in the street. Mr Fitzsimmons told jurors he had ""no enemies"" but jurors heard his older brother Martyn had once been charged with shooting Ross Monaghan, the man cleared of murdering Carroll outside Asda. Last year soldier turned gun-runner Martyn was jailed for 10-and-a-half years after admitting having a Glock and ammunition, and hiding Â£36,000 of crime cash. He was part of a nine-man crime gang - described asScotland's most dangerous- jailed for 87 years after Operation Escalade, a massive probe into violence, drugs and firearms offences. A machete was found in the back of the burnt-out car Lord Mullholland described Ryan Fitzsimmons as ""a hard-working man living peacefully with his mother"". He said: ""As a result of the extensive injuries sustained during the attack upon him he has had to give up work and is dependent on his mother for his care and support. The need for care and support will persist for the rest of his life."" Lord Mulholland said Steven Daniel had told the trial that he was not aware of a feud between the Lyons and Daniel families. ""I did not believe a word and, more importantly, neither did the jury,"" he said. The judge said the ""sophisticated"" murder plot had involved high-tech tracker devices and encrypted mobile phones. But he told the six men: ""You were caught by good, old-fashioned detective work, identifying DNA on a tracker - and everything followed from there."" Det Insp Jim Bradley described the level of violence as ""horrific"" Det Inp Jim Bradley said it was a ""miracle"" that no one died. ""It's been documented in the trial that if it hadn't been for medical intervention and the expertise of medical staff that a couple of our victims would have died,"" he said. ""The level of violence in such a planned and premeditated manner was horrific. ""There's no other word for it - just totally horrific."" He added that there had been repeated attempts to ""calm things down"" and stop the violence. ""Hopefully this will be a deterrent to anybody that's going to involve themselves in this kind of activity,"" he said. ""There's no winners in this type of crime.""

London Bridge victim 'slipped' before attack,"Sara Zelenak was stabbed during the attack at London Bridge and Borough Market An Australian au pair was being helped up by a passer-by after slipping over in her high heels when they were both fatally stabbed, the inquest into the London Bridge attack has heard. Sara Zelenak, 21, was on a night out with a friend when she was set upon by men armed with 12in (30cm) blades on the evening of 3 June 2017. Briton James McMullan, 32, was also targeted as he tried to help Ms Zelenak to her feet, a witness said. The inquest is in its second week. Ms Zelenak and Mr McMullan were among eight people killed when Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before jumping out and stabbing people. Witness Erick Siguenza told the Old Bailey Ms Zelenak jumped out of the way of the crashing van before being stabbed by the driver. Gareth Patterson QC, representing the victims' families, said she was wearing high heels and the ground was ""quite wet"" on the night of the attack. When asked if Ms Zelenak had lost her balance, Mr Siguenza said: ""Yes. She was completely on the ground. He [Mr McMullan] just grabbed her left arm and gently tried to pick her up. ""But by then the attackers were in close proximity and that's when they started attacking."" ""There was no time for him to be able to help her up because the driver and the other terrorists were already running towards them,"" he added. James McMullan was stabbed to death as he tried to help Ms Zelenak up, the inquest heard Ms Zelenak was stabbed in the neck while Mr McMullan was stabbed in the chest. The court heard Ms Zelenak and her friend, Priscila Goncalves, had left the London Grind bar minutes before the attack to continue their night out and ""have fun"". Ms Goncalves told the inquest they were crossing the bridge when they spotted another bar, with red lights and tables outside. They had started down the steps towards it when they heard the van crash. The friends went back up the steps to see what had happened but became separated in the chaos as people ran away. The court was shown CCTV of Ms Zelenak before she was killed ""I had no idea what was going on,"" Ms Goncalves said. ""We were together. People said 'Run', I started to run. I thought she was with me and then I looked, she was not. Everybody was running,"" she added. Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened CCTV shown to the court showed Ms Goncalves among a crowd of people who were running away. Mr Siguenza filmed people fleeing the scene as Ms Zelenak and Mr McMullan were attacked. James McMullan's parents Simon and Mila McMullan attended the inquest Mr Siguenza described how the three attackers reached the area outside the bar below the bridge, where people threw glasses and a chair at them. The attackers realised they were outnumbered and fled, he said. They continued their attack elsewhere. Eight people were killed and 48 injured. The attackers were later shot dead by armed police. BBC reporter Katie Wright, at the inquest Julie and Mark Wallace, Ms Zelenak's mother and stepfather, also attended the inquest Questions over why it took so long for paramedics to arrive became the focus for much of the fifth day of the inquest. Ms Zelenak's mother and stepfather, Julie and Mark Wallace, watched from the courtroom as the details of her death were laid out. Their expressions remained composed during a morning of gruelling evidence. Two of the first police officers on the scene, PC Clint Wallis and PC Richard Norton, explained how they had performed CPR on Ms Zelenak CPR for about 10 minutes - but PC Norton agreed that they had been ""desperately in need of paramedics"". They continued to provide treatment to victims despite the sound of gunfire. The court heard that paramedic Gary Edwards was one of the first medics to arrive. As a tactical response paramedic, he had received specialist training for a situation such as this. However, reports of a gunman meant he couldn't enter the market as it had become a ""hot zone"" and wasn't ""safe enough"". The court heard this refusal led to an angry exchange with a police officer demanding help - but Mr Edwards said that even with hindsight, he would still have responded in the same way. PC Richard Norton told the court he asked members of the public to try to flag down paramedics as he and PC Clint Wallis performed CPR on Ms Zelenak. PC Norton said he was trained to treat minor injuries but paramedics had more equipment and were better trained to deal with the kind of injuries Ms Zelenak had suffered. He said he later heard medics were being held back until the scene was made safe. This was part of standard protocol for dangerous areas or ""hot zones"", the court heard. The inquest heard there were three paramedics on the scene at about 22:24 BST, some 15 minutes after the attack started. The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan Last week, Ms Zelenak's mother told the inquest her daughter was""the happiest she had ever been""in the lead-up to the attack. And Mr McMullan had been celebrating securing financial backing for his online education company on the night he was killed. The inquests continue.

Felicity Huffman pleads guilty to fraud,"This video can not be played Felicity Huffman was silent as she left court US actress Felicity Huffman has pleaded guilty to fraudulently conspiring to win a college place for her daughter. In a Boston court, the Desperate Housewives star admitted paying $15,000 (Â£11,500) to have her daughter's exam answers secretly corrected in 2017. In a statement last month, she said she was in ""full acceptance"" of her guilt. Prosecutors recommended a four-month prison term and a $20,000 fine. Huffman, 56, was among 50 charged in the college admissions scandal. The wealthy parents charged in the investigation allegedly paid bribes, had exams altered, and even had their children edited into stock photos to fake sporting talents. They managed to fraudulently secure spots for the teenagers at elite US universities including Yale, Georgetown and Stanford. Parents and college athletics coaches were charged in the scheme, but none of the children were indicted. Huffman did not speak to reporters outside court as she arrived to Monday's hearing holding hands with her brother. How much difference does going to a top US university make? She admitted one count of mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. The Emmy-winning actress cried while speaking to the judge, according to reporters in the courtroom. Her plea deal recommendation of four months in prison was at the lower end of sentencing guidelines, which could have carried a custodial term of up to 20 years. According to court documents, she was secretly recorded by the scam's confessed mastermind, William Singer, after he began co-operating with investigators. Singer helped Huffman falsify a college entrance exam score for her oldest daughter, Sophia Macy. When Sophia's school initially wanted to invigilate as she sat her test, Huffman expressed concern to Singer. The actress emailed to him, ""Ruh Ro!"" - the catchphrase of cartoon dog Scooby-Doo when he was in trouble. Actress Lori Loughlin pleaded not guilty to her role in the scam Singer arranged so that Sophia could complete the SAT, which is the US college entrance test, elsewhere. Sophia scored an SAT score of 1420 out of a possible 1600 on the doctored test, about 400 points higher than a preliminary SAT she had taken a year earlier. The actress made arrangements to cheat a second time, for her younger daughter, before deciding not to do so, according to prosecutors. Her husband - actor William H Macy - also had contact with Singer, though Mr Macy was spared charges. Huffman said her daughter was unaware of the cheating, and that she felt ""regret and shame"" for having ""betrayed"" her. She will be sentenced on 13 September. Last month, Netflix announced it would postpone the release of a movie, Otherhood, starring Huffman that was originally set for release on 26 April. It did not specify a new premiere date. Though Huffman was among the most high-profile figures indicted, the $15,000 she parted with was among the smallest sums allegedly paid by any of the other parents charged in the scandal, according to court documents. Lori Loughlin, another Hollywood actress ensnared in the scandal along with her husband, has pleaded not guilty to paying $500,000 in bribes to have their daughters accepted to the University of Southern California as members of the rowing team.

Deepest-ever sub dive finds plastic waste,"The latest dive reached 10,927m (35,849ft) beneath the waves - a new record An American explorer has found plastic waste on the seafloor while breaking the record for the deepest ever dive. Victor Vescovo descended nearly 11km (seven miles) to the deepest place in the ocean - the Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench. He spent four hours exploring the bottom of the trench in his submersible, built to withstand the immense pressure of the deep. He found sea creatures, but also found a plastic bag and sweet wrappers. It is the third time humans have reached the ocean's extreme depths. The explorers believe they have discovered four new species of prawn-like crustaceans called amphipods The first dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench took place in 1960 by US Navy lieutenant Don Walsh and Swiss engineer Jacques Piccard in a vessel called the bathyscaphe Trieste. Movie director James Cameron then made a solo plunge half a century later in 2012 in his bright green sub. Mariana Trench: Deepest ocean 'teems with microbes' Fly through the Mariana Trench James Cameron back on surface after deepest ocean dive The latest descent, which reached 10,927m (35,849ft) beneath the waves, is now the deepest by 11m - making Victor Vescovo the new record holder. Don Walsh (left), who dived to the bottom of the Mariana Trench in 1960, congratulated Victor Vescovo (right) In total, Mr Vescovo and his team made five dives to the bottom of the trench during the expedition.  Robotic landers were also deployed to explore the remote terrain. Mr Vescovo said: ""It is almost indescribable how excited all of us are about achieving what we just did. ""This submarine and its mother ship, along with its extraordinarily talented expedition team, took marine technology to a ridiculously higher new level by diving - rapidly and repeatedly - into the deepest, harshest, area of the ocean."" This video can not be played Victor Vescovo descended almost 11km in a submersible to the deepest part of the Pacific Ocean Witnessing the dive from the Pacific was Don Walsh. He told BBC News: ""I salute Victor Vescovo and his outstanding team for the successful completion of their historic explorations into the Mariana Trench. ""Six decades ago, Jacques Piccard and I were the first to visit that deepest place in the world's oceans. ""Now in the winter of my life, it was a great honour to be invited on this expedition to a place of my youth."" The team believes it has discovered four new species of prawn-like crustaceans called amphipods, saw a creature called a spoon worm 7,000m-down and a pink snailfish at 8,000m. They also discovered brightly coloured rocky outcrops, possibly created by microbes on the seabed, and collected samples of rock from the seafloor. Humanity's impact on the planet was also evident with the discovery of plastic pollution. It's something that other expeditions using landers have seen before. Millions of tonnes of plastic enter the oceans each year, but little is known about where a lot of it ends up. Victor Vescovo spent four hours exploring the bottom of the trench The scientists now plan to test the creatures they collected to see if they contain microplastics - a recent study found this was a widespread problem, even for animals living in the deep. The dive forms part of the Five Deeps expedition - an attempt to explore the deepest points in each of the world's five oceans. It has been funded by Mr Vescovo, a private equity investor, who before turning his attention to the ocean's extreme depths also climbed the highest peaks on the planet's seven continents. The 4.6m-long, 3.7m-high DSV Limiting Factor submersible was built by the US-based company Triton Submarines After the record dive, the submersible was brought back on the expedition's main vessel - the DSSV Pressure Drop As well as the Mariana Trench in the Pacific, in the last six months dives have also taken place in the Puerto Rico Trench in the Atlantic Ocean (8,376m/27,480ft down), the South Sandwich Trench in the Southern Ocean (7,433m/24,388ft) and the Java Trench in Indian Ocean (7,192m/23,596ft). The final challenge will be to reach the bottom of the Molloy Deep in the Arctic Ocean, which is currently scheduled for August 2019. The 4.6m-long, 3.7m-high submersible - called the DSV Limiting Factor - was built by the US-based company Triton Submarines, with the aim of having a vessel that could make repeated dives to any part of the ocean. At its core is a 9cm-thick titanium pressure hull that can fit two people, so dives can be performed solo or as a pair. It can withstand the crushing pressure found at the bottom of the ocean: 1,000 bars, which is the equivalent of 50 jumbo jets piled on top of a person.  10,994Deepest natural trench in metres 1960First dive 3Number of dives to date 2,146Higher than Mount Everest in metres, if inverted As well as working under pressure, the sub has to operate in the pitch black and near freezing temperatures. These conditions also made it challenging to capture footage - the Five Deeps expedition has been followed by Atlantic Productions for a documentary for the Discovery Channel. Anthony Geffen, creative director of Atlantic Productions, said it was the most complicated filming he'd ever been involved with. ""Our team had to pioneer new camera systems that could be mounted on the submersible, operate at up to 10,000m below sea level and work with robotic landers with camera systems that would allow us to film Victor's submersible on the bottom of the ocean. ""We also had to design new rigs that would go inside Victor's submersible and capture every moment of Victor's dives."" After the Five Deeps expedition is complete later this year, the plan is to pass the submersible onto science institutions so researchers can continue to use it. The challenges of exploring the deep ocean - even with robotic vehicles - has made the ocean trenches one of the last frontiers on the planet. Once thought to be remote, desolate areas, the deep sea teems with life. There is also growing evidence that they are carbon sinks, playing a role in regulating the Earth's chemistry and climate.

NI economy 'weakened in past three months',"This video can not be played ""Retail performed particularly badly,"" says BBC News NI's John Campbell Northern Ireland's economy appears to have weakened significantly over the past three months, research from Ulster Bank has suggested. The bank conducts a monthly survey of private sector activity in what is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. April saw a contraction in new orders, exports, employment and overall output. That follows a fall in output in March and a weakening employment performance since the start of the year. Manufacturing decline weakens economy Economy 'set for two-year dip' Richard Ramsey, the bank's chief economist, said it was the sharpest fall in business activity since the end of 2012. ""April saw an improvement in business conditions across most of the UK regions,"" he said. ""However, Northern Ireland was a notable exception to this trend. ""Rather than improving, the pace of contraction across a range of indicators accelerated."" He added that Brexit and the lack of a Northern Ireland Executive continued to be cited as factors negatively affecting business. Richard Ramsey said it was the sharpest fall in business activity since the end of 2012 As in March, manufacturing was the only sector to record an expansion in output. By contrast, the data for retail sales was the worst in almost seven years. Mr Ramsey said that the survey should not be interpreted as a clear sign of the beginning of a downturn as Brexit factors could be responsible for volatility in some company performances. By John Campbell, BBC News NI Economics and Business Editor A modern economy is a complex, dynamic system - changes are rarely about one factor. However, it is clear that Brexit is having an impact in some areas - particularly business investment. But there are other forces shaping our economy - for example, retailing is in the throes of technologically-driven change, which has nothing to do with Brexit. Official data for the whole of the UK, published last week, suggestedthe economy picked up in the first three months of the yearafter manufacturers' stockpiling ahead of Brexit helped to boost growth. Growth was 0.5% in the quarter, up from 0.2% in the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The manufacturing sector grew at its fastest rate since 1988 in the period. The ONS said this was driven by manufacturers rushing to deliver orders beforethe original Brexit deadline of 29 March. Pharmaceuticals was one of the sectors most affected, expanding 9.4% between January and March. Previous business surveys had shown manufacturers stockpiling goods for Brexit in case the UK left the EU without a transition deal, which they feared could lead to delays at UK borders.

What happened to the boy in the photo?,"  By Jon Kay Words: Jon Kay Video/photos:Andy Alcroft,Alex Littlewood It’s New Year’s Eve. In a cold, bare council flat in south-west England, Amar rips open a sealed packet and pulls out a cotton-wool swab. He doesn’t need to read the instruction sheet. He has already read it many times. He watches himself in the mirror as he rolls the swab around the inside of his cheek for 30 seconds. Then he waves it in the air to dry for 30 seconds and places it in the envelope labelled DNA SAMPLE. So quick. So simple. Just 60 seconds in total. Sixty seconds that could change Amar’s life. For a short time in the early 1990s, Amar Kanim was famous. His scarred face and desperate story featured on newspaper front pages around the world. He was introduced to diplomats and ambassadors. He even attended a session of the United Nations. He was known as the little boy who had lost everything in a napalm attack. He came to personify the suffering of the Iraqi people at the hands of their own president. Amar’s body had been left covered in burns when Saddam Hussein bombed Shia Muslim communities in southern Iraq in March 1991. The Iraqi leader was trying to exert his authority after being pushed back from Kuwait by an American-led coalition in the Gulf War. In the aftermath of that war, thousands of Iraqis rose up against his regime, including the Kurds in the north and the Shia of the south. Saddam dispatched his troops to put down the uprisings with terrifying ferocity.  Amar remembers the day of the attack on the southern city of Basra clearly: “It was a beautiful afternoon. While we were out playing, we heard gunshots, sirens and planes overhead. My sister and I hid on the ground floor of a warehouse known as “the silo” with about 30 other people. “There was a huge bang above us - and a bomb came crashing down through the levels of the building. There was a blinding white flash. I couldn’t find my sister. All I could do was cover my eyes. “Everyone else had gone deeper into the warehouse and they were trapped, but I was next to the door. I smashed it down and ran for my life. I think I was the only one to get out alive. “I knew the Shatt al-Arab River was a short distance away, so I jumped into the water to stop the agonising burning of my skin. I must have passed out after that because I don’t really remember anything else.” Exactly what happened next is unclear, but it appears that anti-Saddam troops found Amar, alone and unconscious on the riverbank, and transported the traumatised boy across the border to a refugee camp in Iran. He remembers waking up in a hospital ward, covered in burns. “I just lay there. I was in so much pain,” he says. “Every movement was agonising. I couldn’t speak, eat, drink or swallow. I didn’t know where my family was. I was alone and I didn’t think I was going to make it.” Six months later, in September 1991, the British politician Emma (now Baroness) Nicholson found the silent Amar in a hospital ward in the Iranian city of Ahvaz. “It was a terrible sight,” she remembers. “There was this poor child sitting all alone, burned from head to foot and in desperate agony.” The MP was on a fact-finding mission to the Middle East to raise awareness of the plight of Marsh Arabs in southern Iraq. The UK had been part of the coalition which had successfully pushed Saddam back from Kuwait, but - with the war now over - Lady Nicholson felt the dictator’s subsequent actions against his own people were being ignored by the international community. She was told that Amar was the only member of his family to have survived, so she asked the doctors and aid workers what she could do to help him. Medical experts told her that Amar urgently needed to be flown to the UK for complex plastic surgery. So Lady Nicholson launched a fund-raising campaign in conjunction with the Sunday Times. Pictures of the haunted-looking boy staring into the camera resonated with readers who had recently witnessed television reports of the Gulf War. They soon donated thousands of pounds for Amar’s transport and treatment. Lady Nicholson managed to acquire an Iranian diplomatic passport for Amar, and in February 1992 dozens of photographers and reporters were waiting at Heathrow Airport when the rather bemused little boy stepped off the plane, hand-in-hand with the member of parliament. They were an unlikely pair: the MP dressed in a bright blue, shoulder-padded 90s “power jacket”, with her young companion wearing a stone-washed denim suit and red bow-tie, which Iranian nurses had bought for his special journey. Apart from the clothes he was wearing, Amar had nothing. No suitcase. No hand luggage.  “He’s a complete orphan. He’s lost everything - his life, his home, his whole family,” Lady Nicholson said in a television interview at the time. It’s hard to imagine what the child described in the Sunday Times headline as “the little boy Saddam tried to exterminate” must have been thinking, as he was driven in an Range Rover through London to the hospital where he would begin treatment. Just a few months earlier Amar had been living a carefree rural existence with his mother, two brothers and three sisters in Iraq. “I had never seen a camera before. I hadn’t even seen a television. I didn’t really understand what was going on,” says Amar. “But I felt like I was safe with Emma. I felt I had to go to London. It was the only way I would get the help I needed. I had nobody else, so I just went along with it.” Over the next year, Amar had 27 plastic surgery operations on the 10th floor of Guy’s Hospital. In the Rothschild Ward, some of the world’s most eminent consultants performed pioneering medical procedures to graft skin from his hip to his neck, in a form of reconstructive surgery known as “waltzing”. His progress was followed by the BBC. Watching those archive reports now, you see a shy and nervous little boy slowly gaining confidence and understanding as the weeks pass. He became less self-conscious about his scars. He began to speak a few words of English. He played computer games on a Nintendo Game Boy. He started to smile. “I had no idea that Amar would stay in England,” reflects Lady Nicholson today. “I anticipated that we would find some relatives and he would go back to Iraq once his surgery was completed. But that didn’t happen because, as soon as the paediatricians at Westminster Hospital saw him, they said that if Amar was moved again, he would die.” There were attempts to place the boy with a British-Iraqi family in London, but Lady Nicholson says he never adapted to city life and kept running away. So, instead, he moved to her constituency home in rural Devon where she lived with her businessman husband, Sir Michael Caine. Although they became his legal guardians, Amar chose not to be adopted. He always hoped that one day he would find some relatives and return to his homeland. But he speaks fondly of those early years in south-west England. He remembers the foreign holidays, the drum kit birthday present and the Michael Jackson posters on his bedroom wall. The little Iraqi boy aroused a great deal of interest when he arrived in the traditional farming community, but he settled in quickly. He attended the village school, made good friends, played drums in a village rock band and acquired a love of football and fishing.  “I was grateful. Emma had saved my life,” he says. “I felt safe and secure in the countryside. People made me feel welcome. But in quiet moments, I sometimes struggled to cope. I’d lost all my relatives - everything I knew. You feel completely empty. Like the whole world has let you down. “I felt very isolated at times. I felt like I couldn’t trust anyone. It’s the most horrible position to be in because, without a family, you feel like you don’t belong to anyone. You feel like you’re born out of nothing.” The death of Sir Michael from cancer in 1999 hit Amar hard. The businessman had acted as a father-figure to the teenage boy, and losing him had a profound effect. “It was another loss I had to deal with,” reflects Amar. He says it turned him into an angry young man. He left Devon and moved to London for a few years, where he “drifted” and spent time sleeping on friends’ sofas and even living in his car. “It was a difficult time. I fell out with Emma. I chose to go it alone. I didn’t really know what I wanted or who I was.” In the summer of 2018, BBC cameraman Andy Alcroft was waiting to film an interview at Exeter St David’s railway station, when he was approached by one of Amar’s friends. “You should do a report about him - Amar. The boy who came over from Iraq. Remember him? He’s got an amazing story,” he said. Andy took some contact details and we went to meet Amar in the Devon village where he still lives. We thought we might end up doing some kind of “catch-up” feature. “Whatever happened to the orphan Amar?” - that kind of thing. But when Amar revealed he had been receiving unexpected social media messages from a stranger, the story took an unexpected turn. Watch Amar's story The Iraqi Orphan: 30 Lost Years The Iraqi Orphan: 30 Lost Years We find Amar in an empty flat. He’s lived here for nearly 10 years after returning from London, but there is little to show for it. Few personal possessions on display; no pictures or photographs; just a stack of bills on the table and some washing-up in the kitchen sink. He must be in his late 30s now, but he looks much younger - not very different, in fact, from the boy in those grainy archive TV reports. He is slightly built and softly spoken. Amar tells us that his gas supply was cut off a year ago because he couldn’t afford the payments. He has had no central heating through the harsh West Country winter. He is selling his fishing rod and his beloved bicycle to raise some cash. He’s single, out of work and on benefits. “Life is tough on the breadline,” he says. In one of the rooms, I find some drawings faintly sketched in pencil on the wall. Amar looks a little embarrassed. He can’t quite explain what he has drawn, but he says they are images from deep in his memory. Scenes he recalls from his childhood in Iraq: riverbanks and reed-beds, leaping fish and soaring birds of prey. “The trauma means I don’t remember much of that time in my life. I don’t really remember my family or my home, but I do know I was happy then, before the bombing started. Drawing these pictures - it kind of helps.” The quiet routine of Amar’s daily life has recently been shaken. He tells us that, out of nowhere, he has received mysterious Facebook messages from a stranger in the Middle East. He shows them to us - including some grainy video footage of a woman who claims she is his mother. The mother whom Amar believed was killed in Basra three decades ago. Amar stares at the screen and shakes his head. “I thought it was just a scam to start with,” he says. “I deleted it. I assumed it was somebody trying to get money out of me. A prank. But then I received another message and another one. It can’t be true. Can it?” The footage is so heavily pixelated - and Amar’s phone screen is so badly cracked - that it’s hard to make out exactly what is happening, but the video is taken from a Kurdish TV station, and shows an elderly woman approaching a reporter during a live news broadcast from a food market. In a croaky voice, the woman in a black hijab says she is in poor health and going blind. Then she holds up a photograph to the camera. It is the famous newspaper picture of Amar arriving at Heathrow with Emma Nicholson in 1992. “He is my son,” she sobs to the reporter. “He is my Amar.” Thousands of miles away, alone in his Devon flat, Amar has been replaying the video over and over again. “She does look like my mother,” he says, still stunned by what he sees. “But she looks much older than I remember. She looks a bit like me, I suppose. It’s so hard to tell from the picture.” Amar asks us to help him. So, Andy, our producer Alex Littlewood and I begin a journey together, with no idea that it will end up taking us from the lush green fields of Dartmoor to the deserts of Iraq. The first thing we need to establish is where the video clip has come from. It has been sent to Amar via Facebook by an Iraqi man called Mustafa. We contact him and over the phone he tells us he is not a relative. He’s a 36-year-old office worker with a wife and three children, living in the northern city of Erbil. “I didn’t know anything about Amar or his story, but when I saw the old woman on TV, I knew I had to help,” says Mustafa. He tells us he was “heartbroken” when he saw her interrupt the reporter’s live broadcast on NRT Television in April 2018. Mustafa tells us how, over the days and weeks that followed, he trawled the internet for any information about the boy in the picture. He eventually realised that a young orphan called Amar Kanim from Basra had been taken to the UK in 1992 and that his story had inspired Emma Nicholson to establish the Amar Foundation. The dates, details and pictures seemed to match, so Mustafa then tried to trace Amar, eventually finding him in Devon via Facebook. Trying to establish whether the woman’s story was genuine was going to require time and patience. However, over the next few weeks, with the help of Mustafa, Amar’s Arabic-speaking friends in England and our colleagues from BBC Arabic, we make good progress. Using social media and on-the-ground contacts in Iraq, we are put in touch with a man called Juma and we begin communicating with him. He tells us that he is married to the woman who is claiming to be Amar’s mother. He says her name is Zahra and that Amar’s biological father died in a road accident before Saddam’s attack on his own people. Amar confirms this detail is true. He says they now live in the city of Karbala, 500km (311 miles) north of Basra, where Amar grew up. In tears, he tells us that he always promised his wife that he would do everything possible to find her son. And he can’t believe that contact has finally been made. The phone connections are often poor, and the conversations highly emotional. Amar sometimes finds it difficult to listen. “My head is spinning,” he says. The couple send us a torn and faded black-and-white photograph which Zahra claims is a school portrait of Amar. But Amar can’t be sure that it’s him. The little boy in the picture has no scars, and Amar doesn’t know what he looked like before his face was burned. Zahra also sends us copies of documents and certificates which, she says, prove that she is Amar’s mother. Some of the details she provides do make sense to him. The names of his brothers and sister are correct. The places and incidents she refers to sound familiar. Her account of the napalm attack is consistent with what he remembers. She weeps as she describes how her youngest daughter Zainab was killed in the attack. “I carried her body to the cemetery and then came back to the bombed building to look for my little Amar. I searched through the rubble for days, but I couldn’t find any trace of him. “There were rumours that he’d been injured and carried away by local soldiers. Years later I heard a story that he might have been taken to Europe. I’ve been trying to find him for 30 years.” A couple of years ago, she explains, a family friend found an internet picture of a little boy called Amar holding hands with a politician in England in the 1990s. Zahra suspected it was her son, but couldn’t be sure because of the child’s scars. “Since then we’ve tried to contact charities, embassies and government officials, but nobody has helped us. We put an advert in the paper. We have approached journalists in the street. But it’s very hard for people like us to meet officials in Iraq.” Amar is still dubious. His own memories are hazy and he struggles to accept what he is being told. It all seems too much. He’s concerned that the woman, or those around her, might be inventing the story, looking for a route out of Iraq. Or looking for money. But Mustafa believes the woman’s poverty makes her story more credible. “These people have nothing,” he explains. “They are very poor. They have little education. They have no internet. No smartphones. No links to the authorities. That’s why they have not been able to reach him.” In the confusion and chaos of war, was a terrible mistake made? “I want it to be true,” Amar sighs. “I really want to believe it. But for 30 years I’ve been alone. For 30 years I’ve been told my family is dead. And now they might not be. It’s like a movie. It doesn’t make sense. I need proof.” The woman agrees to Amar’s suggestion that they both undergo a DNA test. For Lady Nicholson, the possibility that Amar may have found his biological mother comes as a shock. “Family is the most important thing in life,” she says. “It’s who you are. It’s your identity. From the very beginning I did everything I could to try to trace any of Amar’s relatives in Iraq. I hoped we would find someone, but I struggled.” After rescuing Amar from Iraq, the politician set up an international charity in his name. Today the Amar Foundation is a highly successful operation, working with vulnerable people in conflict zones across the Middle East, including a school for orphans in Basra, where Amar was born. Lady Nicholson says several women came forward claiming to be Amar’s mother in the years after he first arrived in the UK, but they all turned out to be hoaxes. “In the mid-90s we did manage to find an auntie in Baghdad,” the politician explains, “but she was so frightened when we approached her under Saddam’s regime. She fainted and her husband begged us never to turn up again.” After the longest two weeks of his life, Amar stands in his flat, his hands trembling. “I hope it’s true,” he says. “I’ve been exhausted. I’ve had sleepless nights because of this. It feels like I’ve been waiting so long for this moment.” He rips open the envelope. The piece of paper inside is a confusing blizzard of numbers, letters and symbols. Amar’s eyes scan the technical data and genetic code but, at the bottom of the page, he finds the words he has been searching for. It is more than 99.9999% proven that Zahra is his biological mother. There it is. Finally. In black and white. Amar stares silently at the page. He’s stunned. “I’ve got a mum… I couldn’t be happier about this. Nobody loves you more than your mother.” For the first time since we met him six months earlier, a broad smile spreads across Amar’s face. “I’m going to frame this piece of paper. And I might even have a few drinks tonight to celebrate. The next step is to meet them…”  Three decades after that terrified little boy arrived at Heathrow gripping Emma Nicholson’s hand, Amar strides through the same airport, heading back to Baghdad, this time holding his British passport. This will be his first trip back to Iraq since he left in 1992. “I’m nervous, but I’m so excited. This is the biggest thing to happen in my life.” During the long journey - 10 hours in total - Amar’s eyes are fixed on the little graphic aeroplane on the in-flight screen. Every few seconds the map refreshes, and Amar watches the plane’s progress as it pulses from London towards the Middle East. “It just feels very unreal. It’s hard to believe, to be honest, how quick things have happened,” he says. As the landscape thousands of feet below changes from green fields to endless desert, Amar worries about how he will react when he meets his mother. To prepare for this journey he has spoken to psychologists and counsellors about his lifelong struggle to express emotions: “I’ve learned to hold back my feelings. I don’t allow myself to show them. Because of the war, the loss I suffered and the injuries I sustained, I have learned to live with things. I’ve learned to keep my feelings closed.” It’s 11 o’clock. The morning sun is gaining strength. Pigeons swoop overhead. The sound of a muezzin calling Muslims to prayer drifts from a minaret across the Baghdad skyline. Amar stands in the shade of a palm tree, to protect his scarred skin. He rearranges the collar of his new shirt. The moment of the reunion has finally arrived. “The purpose of this journey has been purely for her. Purely for the woman.” He pauses to correct himself. “My mother, I should say. I’ve got to get used to saying that word. Mother. My mother.” Amar has chosen to meet her in the garden of the BBC offices in Baghdad. It is a quiet, enclosed space - hidden from the bustle and business of city life. He hears an engine approaching. A car door slams. Footsteps shuffle down the path towards him. The garden gate opens. The outline of a woman appears. She is dressed in a long black chador cloak with a hijab around her head. “Mother. My mother.” “Amauri. Amauri,” she calls. My little Amar. You can sense the utter disbelief in her breaking voice. Arms oustretched, mother and son collapse into one another. They hold on firmly. Not letting go. They stroke one another. Kiss one another. Stare at one another’s faces. They whisper reassurances. Repeat one another’s names. But there are few other words. None are needed. Zahra softly runs her fingers over the scars on Amar’s face. Then she pats her son’s arms and legs up and down. She examines his hands. She tells him she is looking for signs of injuries. She thought he would be unable to walk. She expected him to have more severe physical disabilities as a result of his burns. But here he stands, hugging her. Without thinking about it, the Arabic language Amar thought he’d forgotten suddenly returns. Zahra:You are my lion. My son. Amar:I am your son. Zahra:Do you remember me? I’m your mother. I raised you… Amar:Of course you did. Zahra:Look. This is my son. My brave boy. Oh God, you’ve brought me my son. Please don’t take him away. Amar:No, no-one will take me away. It’s all in the hands of God. Zahra:It’s fate, my darling. It’s God’s will. I can’t believe it, I’ve seen my son. Amar. I’ve seen my little boy, Amar. Watching from a short distance away, it’s remarkable just how naturally and comfortably the pair interact. He forgets all his concerns about showing emotion. The connection - the love - that he worried would be absent couldn’t be more obvious. His feelings are unlocked. As the minutes pass and the immediate intensity subsides, Amar and his mother relax into a gentle chat. How do you resume a conversation after 30 years? This mother and son have so little in common. And yet, they have everything in common. For both of them, everything has changed. But somehow, nothing has changed. The bond Amar has worried about is still there. “My son is a hero, a superhero,” shouts a jubilant Zahra, nestling into Amar’s chest and kissing him. “He missed me. He cares about me and he wanted to find me. This is all I ever wished for. We had wars. So many wars. I lost Amar. I survived, but I was only thinking about Amar. And now he came back, finally. I’m so happy today. I would do anything for Amar. Anything.” From the magnitude of their loss, they quickly move on to discussing the little things they’ve missed. Amar pulls out his phone and shows his mother photographs of the fish he caught in Devon. Her eyesight is failing so she has to hold the device right next to her face. She beams with pride and reminds him of the fishing they used to do in Basra. That was hundreds of miles away - a lifetime ago - but it’s as if Amar and Zahra have only been apart for a few days. Amar is also reunited with his younger brother, Tahrir. Once again, there are plenty of tears and hugs, but there is no awkwardness. No silences. No agenda. The way they speak to one another, touch one another and interact with one another, seems incredibly easy. They remember the tricks they played on their parents. They laugh about football games and bird-hunting. Sharing chickpea stew and chicken kebabs, they tease, giggle and joke. They are a family again. The next day Amar says he wants to visit his family’s house in Karbala - about two hours south of Baghdad. What he finds there is very different from the rural home he remembers from his childhood in Basra. His mother, brother, sister-in-law and stepfather share a cramped breeze-block hut on a piece of polluted wasteland. Their roof is just a sheet of tarpaulin. There is little in the way of sanitation. Loose electric cables dangle from the power lines overhead. Before he returned to Iraq, Amar was worried that he would find it too upsetting to visit the house. He says he feels guilty that his family is living in such poverty. But, once again, his anxiety quickly subsides. Instead of focusing on the dirty floor, he smiles at old family photographs hanging on the wall. He laughs when his mother tips a celebratory bag of sweets over his head, like he is a little boy once again. The place quickly fills with the sound of laughter. Although he has never lived in this house, it soon feels like his home. Zahra unzips the bag of documents and photographs that she has carried with her for years, in the hope that one day she would find Amar. She unfolds the birth certificate, which reveals his real date of birth. Without any official paperwork, doctors in the UK could only guess Amar’s birthday from the state of his teeth and the length of his bones when he first arrived as a refugee. It turns out they got it wrong. Amar is three years older than they estimated. “It’s my 40th birthday next week,” he laughs. “And now I’ve finally got something to celebrate.” And there is another surprise. It turns out that the strange inky dot on the inside of Amar’s right arm is actually a family tattoo. His mother and brother have identical marks. Amar could never remember where his came from - or why it was there - but Tahrir explains how, as a young boy, he gave each family member a blue dot, so they would be able to identify one another if they were ever lost. “And now we have found our Amar,” he says. For a few poignant seconds, they all sit in silence, comparing their small blue dots. Five days after touching down in Baghdad, it is time for Amar to head back to the UK. Saying goodbye to his family was always going to be painful, but there is a calm confidence about their farewell. It is dignified, rather than dramatic. Realistic. Amar promises to return one day. He says he will try to send some money, but they understand that he doesn’t have much to give. “Thank you for finding me,” he says. “Thank you for coming back,” his family replies. From the top floor of a nearby building, Amar watches the sun setting beyond the Tigris River. It’s his final night in Iraq. He reflects on what he describes as an “overwhelming” week. “I’ve been alone for all these years - with all this trauma - but now I feel reborn. All I wanted was for my mother to be proud of me. And I think she is. “For so long, my life has been empty, but now I have a purpose. I want to come back and visit my family again soon.” In the park below some brothers are playing football. They’re about the same age Amar was when he lost his family. He smiles. “This has been the best moment of my life,” he says. Back in his Devon flat, Amar has put some ornaments and photos on display. There are prayer beads, which his mother gave him as a parting gift, and some stones that he picked up from the ground near the family grave in Najaf. Since returning home, Amar has been in regular contact with his family. Most nights his phone lights up as they share messages and photos. He’s now thinking about moving to London to find a job. He wants to fund another trip to Iraq and provide his relatives with some financial assistance. Lady Nicholson has described Amar’s reunion with his family as “an absolute miracle”. After several years without much contact, Amar has now reconnected with the politician and shared his news. Having met her again in Westminster, he is now keen to rebuild their relationship and maybe do some work for the Amar Foundation. Lady Nicholson has promised to help him in whatever way she can. She’s invited him to visit some of the projects that have been set up by the Amar Foundation - particularly its school for orphans in Basra. A year after he received that mysterious Facebook message, Amar looks out of the window towards Dartmoor and beyond. “I feel blessed. Everything makes sense. My life is finally complete.” "
Hillsborough safety officer fined,"Former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell had responsibility for safety at Hillsborough stadium The stadium safety officer in charge at the time of the Hillsborough disaster has been fined Â£6,500. Former secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Graham Mackrell, is the first person to be convicted of an offence relating to the tragedy. Mackrell, 69, of Stocking Pelham, Hertfordshire, failed to ensure there were enough turnstiles to prevent large crowds building up. He was also ordered to pay Â£5,000 towards the prosecution costs. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died following the crush in the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989. The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster Mackrell sat in the well of the court rather than the dock for the sentencing hearing at Preston Crown Court. He wasfound guilty last monthafter an 11-week trial of failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act in respect of ensuring there were enough turnstiles to prevent unduly large crowds building up outside the ground. The jury in the trial was unable to reach a verdict over match commander David Duckenfield, 74, who denied the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans. No verdict on Hillsborough police chief Hillsborough safety boss 'had no training' Duckenfield treated as 'target of blame' The court heard there were seven turnstiles available for the 10,100 Liverpool fans with standing tickets. Judge Sir Peter Openshaw said: ""He should have realised there was an obvious risk that so many spectators could not pass through seven turnstiles in time for kick-off."" But Judge Openshaw said Mackrell's offence did not directly cause the disaster inside the ground. He said: ""The defendant's offence was at least one of the direct causes of the crush at the turnstiles outside the ground but it was not a direct cause of the crush on the terraces inside the ground that resulted in the deaths of 96 spectators and injury to many more, to which the crush outside the ground did no more than set the scene."" The jury heard 96 men, women and children died as a result of a fatal crush on the Leppings Lane terrace In a statement, Mackrell said he was ""grateful"" the judge had recognised ""my conduct did not cause or contribute to the death of any person or cause any person to be injured on that tragic day"". He added: ""Despite that, I do wish to take this opportunity to make clear my sympathy to all those impacted by this appalling tragedy. ""No-one should have to go through what the families have experienced."" Outside court, Louise Brookes, whose brother Andrew died at Hillsborough, called the sentence ""shameful"" and said the fine amounted to Â£67.70 per life lost. ""Our 96 deserve better than this and us families deserve better than this. We are all getting on in age and enough is enough,"" she said. ""My weekly shopping costs more than Â£67.70."" Christine Burke, whose father Henry died in the disaster, added: ""When Hillsborough happened he [Mackrell] was in charge of the safety certificate at the time and he should have been sacked straight away. ""He went on to bigger and better things, he was promoted. This is a man who has been paid very well and gone on to do other things. That should not have happened."" The court heard Mackrell made Â£700 a week in his job as administrator for the Football League Managers' Association and earned an additional Â£670 a week from pensions. A hearing to decide whether Mr Duckenfield will face a retrial is expected to be held next month. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after the disaster.

Sweden reopens Assange rape inquiry,"This video can not be played A Swedish prosecutor announces that the case has been reopened Swedish prosecutors have reopened an investigation into a rape allegation made against Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange in 2010. The inquiry has been revived at the request of the alleged victim's lawyer. Assange, who denies the accusation, has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012. The 47-year-old was evicted last month and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions. He is currently being held at Belmarsh prison in London. Swedish prosecutors originally decided to drop the rape investigation two years ago, saying they felt unable to take the case forward while Assange remained holed up inside the embassy. But on Monday, Sweden's deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, announced the case would be reopened because there was still ""probable cause to suspect"" that Assange had committed the alleged rape. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline of saga ""Now that he has left Ecuador's embassy, the conditions in the case have changed and... the conditions are in place once again to pursue the case,"" she said at a news conference, adding that a European Arrest Warrant would now be issued. This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? His removal from the embassy, and the subsequent decision to reopen the inquiry, is likely to raise the question of which extradition request should take precedence: that of Sweden or the US. The US is seeking Assange's extradition from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material by Wikileaks in 2010. Australian-born Assange facesa charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US,external. He is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a prison term of up to five years. How likely is an Assange conviction in US? Sweden's original extradition request was made under the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) arrangements. However, it was withdrawn and so the extradition request from the US now ranks first in line. In order to displace it, Sweden's deputy director of public prosecutions said a fresh EAW request would now be issued. If that does happen the decision as to which of the two requests take precedence will be made by UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid. He would make his decision primarily on the basis of which alleged offence was considered to be more serious. Rape is likely to be considered more serious than conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. That would mean ordering Assange's extradition to Sweden. Assange challenged the original Swedish request through the UK courts and could bring fresh challenges in response to a new request. These would most likely be based on human rights grounds and in particular that it would be unjust or oppressive in light of his health to extradite him. Wikileaks said the reopening of the rape case would give Assange ""a chance to clear his name"". ""There has been considerable political pressure on Sweden to reopen their investigation, but there has always been political pressure surrounding this case,"" its editor-in-chief, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in a statement. A lawyer for Assange told Swedish broadcaster SVT that the decision was ""embarrassing for Sweden"", adding that his client wanted to resolve the case but feared being extradited to the US. This video can not be played Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London At a separate news conference, the alleged victim's lawyer, Elisabeth Massi Fritz, said the decision to reopen the case had been ""very gratifying"" and that she expected this would result in a criminal charge. Nick Vamos, former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service, told Reuters news agency that the UK proceedings should not take more than 18 months. Considering Assange's potential objections to extradition, Mr Vamos said he did not think courts would accept the US case was politically motivated. Assange was accused of rape by a woman and sexual assault by another one following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual. He also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out. Prosecutors have decided to reopen the rape case before the 10-year statute of limitations expires in August 2020. The sexual assault investigation was dropped after the five-year statute of limitations expired. Assange dragged from Ecuadorean embassy.

"What happened to the boy in the photo?A napalm attack, an orphan and a life-changing message three decades later","  By Jon Kay Words: Jon Kay Video/photos:Andy Alcroft,Alex Littlewood It’s New Year’s Eve. In a cold, bare council flat in south-west England, Amar rips open a sealed packet and pulls out a cotton-wool swab. He doesn’t need to read the instruction sheet. He has already read it many times. He watches himself in the mirror as he rolls the swab around the inside of his cheek for 30 seconds. Then he waves it in the air to dry for 30 seconds and places it in the envelope labelled DNA SAMPLE. So quick. So simple. Just 60 seconds in total. Sixty seconds that could change Amar’s life. For a short time in the early 1990s, Amar Kanim was famous. His scarred face and desperate story featured on newspaper front pages around the world. He was introduced to diplomats and ambassadors. He even attended a session of the United Nations. He was known as the little boy who had lost everything in a napalm attack. He came to personify the suffering of the Iraqi people at the hands of their own president. Amar’s body had been left covered in burns when Saddam Hussein bombed Shia Muslim communities in southern Iraq in March 1991. The Iraqi leader was trying to exert his authority after being pushed back from Kuwait by an American-led coalition in the Gulf War. In the aftermath of that war, thousands of Iraqis rose up against his regime, including the Kurds in the north and the Shia of the south. Saddam dispatched his troops to put down the uprisings with terrifying ferocity.  Amar remembers the day of the attack on the southern city of Basra clearly: “It was a beautiful afternoon. While we were out playing, we heard gunshots, sirens and planes overhead. My sister and I hid on the ground floor of a warehouse known as “the silo” with about 30 other people. “There was a huge bang above us - and a bomb came crashing down through the levels of the building. There was a blinding white flash. I couldn’t find my sister. All I could do was cover my eyes. “Everyone else had gone deeper into the warehouse and they were trapped, but I was next to the door. I smashed it down and ran for my life. I think I was the only one to get out alive. “I knew the Shatt al-Arab River was a short distance away, so I jumped into the water to stop the agonising burning of my skin. I must have passed out after that because I don’t really remember anything else.” Exactly what happened next is unclear, but it appears that anti-Saddam troops found Amar, alone and unconscious on the riverbank, and transported the traumatised boy across the border to a refugee camp in Iran. He remembers waking up in a hospital ward, covered in burns. “I just lay there. I was in so much pain,” he says. “Every movement was agonising. I couldn’t speak, eat, drink or swallow. I didn’t know where my family was. I was alone and I didn’t think I was going to make it.” Six months later, in September 1991, the British politician Emma (now Baroness) Nicholson found the silent Amar in a hospital ward in the Iranian city of Ahvaz. “It was a terrible sight,” she remembers. “There was this poor child sitting all alone, burned from head to foot and in desperate agony.” The MP was on a fact-finding mission to the Middle East to raise awareness of the plight of Marsh Arabs in southern Iraq. The UK had been part of the coalition which had successfully pushed Saddam back from Kuwait, but - with the war now over - Lady Nicholson felt the dictator’s subsequent actions against his own people were being ignored by the international community. She was told that Amar was the only member of his family to have survived, so she asked the doctors and aid workers what she could do to help him. Medical experts told her that Amar urgently needed to be flown to the UK for complex plastic surgery. So Lady Nicholson launched a fund-raising campaign in conjunction with the Sunday Times. Pictures of the haunted-looking boy staring into the camera resonated with readers who had recently witnessed television reports of the Gulf War. They soon donated thousands of pounds for Amar’s transport and treatment. Lady Nicholson managed to acquire an Iranian diplomatic passport for Amar, and in February 1992 dozens of photographers and reporters were waiting at Heathrow Airport when the rather bemused little boy stepped off the plane, hand-in-hand with the member of parliament. They were an unlikely pair: the MP dressed in a bright blue, shoulder-padded 90s “power jacket”, with her young companion wearing a stone-washed denim suit and red bow-tie, which Iranian nurses had bought for his special journey. Apart from the clothes he was wearing, Amar had nothing. No suitcase. No hand luggage.  “He’s a complete orphan. He’s lost everything - his life, his home, his whole family,” Lady Nicholson said in a television interview at the time. It’s hard to imagine what the child described in the Sunday Times headline as “the little boy Saddam tried to exterminate” must have been thinking, as he was driven in an Range Rover through London to the hospital where he would begin treatment. Just a few months earlier Amar had been living a carefree rural existence with his mother, two brothers and three sisters in Iraq. “I had never seen a camera before. I hadn’t even seen a television. I didn’t really understand what was going on,” says Amar. “But I felt like I was safe with Emma. I felt I had to go to London. It was the only way I would get the help I needed. I had nobody else, so I just went along with it.” Over the next year, Amar had 27 plastic surgery operations on the 10th floor of Guy’s Hospital. In the Rothschild Ward, some of the world’s most eminent consultants performed pioneering medical procedures to graft skin from his hip to his neck, in a form of reconstructive surgery known as “waltzing”. His progress was followed by the BBC. Watching those archive reports now, you see a shy and nervous little boy slowly gaining confidence and understanding as the weeks pass. He became less self-conscious about his scars. He began to speak a few words of English. He played computer games on a Nintendo Game Boy. He started to smile. “I had no idea that Amar would stay in England,” reflects Lady Nicholson today. “I anticipated that we would find some relatives and he would go back to Iraq once his surgery was completed. But that didn’t happen because, as soon as the paediatricians at Westminster Hospital saw him, they said that if Amar was moved again, he would die.” There were attempts to place the boy with a British-Iraqi family in London, but Lady Nicholson says he never adapted to city life and kept running away. So, instead, he moved to her constituency home in rural Devon where she lived with her businessman husband, Sir Michael Caine. Although they became his legal guardians, Amar chose not to be adopted. He always hoped that one day he would find some relatives and return to his homeland. But he speaks fondly of those early years in south-west England. He remembers the foreign holidays, the drum kit birthday present and the Michael Jackson posters on his bedroom wall. The little Iraqi boy aroused a great deal of interest when he arrived in the traditional farming community, but he settled in quickly. He attended the village school, made good friends, played drums in a village rock band and acquired a love of football and fishing.  “I was grateful. Emma had saved my life,” he says. “I felt safe and secure in the countryside. People made me feel welcome. But in quiet moments, I sometimes struggled to cope. I’d lost all my relatives - everything I knew. You feel completely empty. Like the whole world has let you down. “I felt very isolated at times. I felt like I couldn’t trust anyone. It’s the most horrible position to be in because, without a family, you feel like you don’t belong to anyone. You feel like you’re born out of nothing.” The death of Sir Michael from cancer in 1999 hit Amar hard. The businessman had acted as a father-figure to the teenage boy, and losing him had a profound effect. “It was another loss I had to deal with,” reflects Amar. He says it turned him into an angry young man. He left Devon and moved to London for a few years, where he “drifted” and spent time sleeping on friends’ sofas and even living in his car. “It was a difficult time. I fell out with Emma. I chose to go it alone. I didn’t really know what I wanted or who I was.” In the summer of 2018, BBC cameraman Andy Alcroft was waiting to film an interview at Exeter St David’s railway station, when he was approached by one of Amar’s friends. “You should do a report about him - Amar. The boy who came over from Iraq. Remember him? He’s got an amazing story,” he said. Andy took some contact details and we went to meet Amar in the Devon village where he still lives. We thought we might end up doing some kind of “catch-up” feature. “Whatever happened to the orphan Amar?” - that kind of thing. But when Amar revealed he had been receiving unexpected social media messages from a stranger, the story took an unexpected turn. Watch Amar's story The Iraqi Orphan: 30 Lost Years The Iraqi Orphan: 30 Lost Years We find Amar in an empty flat. He’s lived here for nearly 10 years after returning from London, but there is little to show for it. Few personal possessions on display; no pictures or photographs; just a stack of bills on the table and some washing-up in the kitchen sink. He must be in his late 30s now, but he looks much younger - not very different, in fact, from the boy in those grainy archive TV reports. He is slightly built and softly spoken. Amar tells us that his gas supply was cut off a year ago because he couldn’t afford the payments. He has had no central heating through the harsh West Country winter. He is selling his fishing rod and his beloved bicycle to raise some cash. He’s single, out of work and on benefits. “Life is tough on the breadline,” he says. In one of the rooms, I find some drawings faintly sketched in pencil on the wall. Amar looks a little embarrassed. He can’t quite explain what he has drawn, but he says they are images from deep in his memory. Scenes he recalls from his childhood in Iraq: riverbanks and reed-beds, leaping fish and soaring birds of prey. “The trauma means I don’t remember much of that time in my life. I don’t really remember my family or my home, but I do know I was happy then, before the bombing started. Drawing these pictures - it kind of helps.” The quiet routine of Amar’s daily life has recently been shaken. He tells us that, out of nowhere, he has received mysterious Facebook messages from a stranger in the Middle East. He shows them to us - including some grainy video footage of a woman who claims she is his mother. The mother whom Amar believed was killed in Basra three decades ago. Amar stares at the screen and shakes his head. “I thought it was just a scam to start with,” he says. “I deleted it. I assumed it was somebody trying to get money out of me. A prank. But then I received another message and another one. It can’t be true. Can it?” The footage is so heavily pixelated - and Amar’s phone screen is so badly cracked - that it’s hard to make out exactly what is happening, but the video is taken from a Kurdish TV station, and shows an elderly woman approaching a reporter during a live news broadcast from a food market. In a croaky voice, the woman in a black hijab says she is in poor health and going blind. Then she holds up a photograph to the camera. It is the famous newspaper picture of Amar arriving at Heathrow with Emma Nicholson in 1992. “He is my son,” she sobs to the reporter. “He is my Amar.” Thousands of miles away, alone in his Devon flat, Amar has been replaying the video over and over again. “She does look like my mother,” he says, still stunned by what he sees. “But she looks much older than I remember. She looks a bit like me, I suppose. It’s so hard to tell from the picture.” Amar asks us to help him. So, Andy, our producer Alex Littlewood and I begin a journey together, with no idea that it will end up taking us from the lush green fields of Dartmoor to the deserts of Iraq. The first thing we need to establish is where the video clip has come from. It has been sent to Amar via Facebook by an Iraqi man called Mustafa. We contact him and over the phone he tells us he is not a relative. He’s a 36-year-old office worker with a wife and three children, living in the northern city of Erbil. “I didn’t know anything about Amar or his story, but when I saw the old woman on TV, I knew I had to help,” says Mustafa. He tells us he was “heartbroken” when he saw her interrupt the reporter’s live broadcast on NRT Television in April 2018. Mustafa tells us how, over the days and weeks that followed, he trawled the internet for any information about the boy in the picture. He eventually realised that a young orphan called Amar Kanim from Basra had been taken to the UK in 1992 and that his story had inspired Emma Nicholson to establish the Amar Foundation. The dates, details and pictures seemed to match, so Mustafa then tried to trace Amar, eventually finding him in Devon via Facebook. Trying to establish whether the woman’s story was genuine was going to require time and patience. However, over the next few weeks, with the help of Mustafa, Amar’s Arabic-speaking friends in England and our colleagues from BBC Arabic, we make good progress. Using social media and on-the-ground contacts in Iraq, we are put in touch with a man called Juma and we begin communicating with him. He tells us that he is married to the woman who is claiming to be Amar’s mother. He says her name is Zahra and that Amar’s biological father died in a road accident before Saddam’s attack on his own people. Amar confirms this detail is true. He says they now live in the city of Karbala, 500km (311 miles) north of Basra, where Amar grew up. In tears, he tells us that he always promised his wife that he would do everything possible to find her son. And he can’t believe that contact has finally been made. The phone connections are often poor, and the conversations highly emotional. Amar sometimes finds it difficult to listen. “My head is spinning,” he says. The couple send us a torn and faded black-and-white photograph which Zahra claims is a school portrait of Amar. But Amar can’t be sure that it’s him. The little boy in the picture has no scars, and Amar doesn’t know what he looked like before his face was burned. Zahra also sends us copies of documents and certificates which, she says, prove that she is Amar’s mother. Some of the details she provides do make sense to him. The names of his brothers and sister are correct. The places and incidents she refers to sound familiar. Her account of the napalm attack is consistent with what he remembers. She weeps as she describes how her youngest daughter Zainab was killed in the attack. “I carried her body to the cemetery and then came back to the bombed building to look for my little Amar. I searched through the rubble for days, but I couldn’t find any trace of him. “There were rumours that he’d been injured and carried away by local soldiers. Years later I heard a story that he might have been taken to Europe. I’ve been trying to find him for 30 years.” A couple of years ago, she explains, a family friend found an internet picture of a little boy called Amar holding hands with a politician in England in the 1990s. Zahra suspected it was her son, but couldn’t be sure because of the child’s scars. “Since then we’ve tried to contact charities, embassies and government officials, but nobody has helped us. We put an advert in the paper. We have approached journalists in the street. But it’s very hard for people like us to meet officials in Iraq.” Amar is still dubious. His own memories are hazy and he struggles to accept what he is being told. It all seems too much. He’s concerned that the woman, or those around her, might be inventing the story, looking for a route out of Iraq. Or looking for money. But Mustafa believes the woman’s poverty makes her story more credible. “These people have nothing,” he explains. “They are very poor. They have little education. They have no internet. No smartphones. No links to the authorities. That’s why they have not been able to reach him.” In the confusion and chaos of war, was a terrible mistake made? “I want it to be true,” Amar sighs. “I really want to believe it. But for 30 years I’ve been alone. For 30 years I’ve been told my family is dead. And now they might not be. It’s like a movie. It doesn’t make sense. I need proof.” The woman agrees to Amar’s suggestion that they both undergo a DNA test. For Lady Nicholson, the possibility that Amar may have found his biological mother comes as a shock. “Family is the most important thing in life,” she says. “It’s who you are. It’s your identity. From the very beginning I did everything I could to try to trace any of Amar’s relatives in Iraq. I hoped we would find someone, but I struggled.” After rescuing Amar from Iraq, the politician set up an international charity in his name. Today the Amar Foundation is a highly successful operation, working with vulnerable people in conflict zones across the Middle East, including a school for orphans in Basra, where Amar was born. Lady Nicholson says several women came forward claiming to be Amar’s mother in the years after he first arrived in the UK, but they all turned out to be hoaxes. “In the mid-90s we did manage to find an auntie in Baghdad,” the politician explains, “but she was so frightened when we approached her under Saddam’s regime. She fainted and her husband begged us never to turn up again.” After the longest two weeks of his life, Amar stands in his flat, his hands trembling. “I hope it’s true,” he says. “I’ve been exhausted. I’ve had sleepless nights because of this. It feels like I’ve been waiting so long for this moment.” He rips open the envelope. The piece of paper inside is a confusing blizzard of numbers, letters and symbols. Amar’s eyes scan the technical data and genetic code but, at the bottom of the page, he finds the words he has been searching for. It is more than 99.9999% proven that Zahra is his biological mother. There it is. Finally. In black and white. Amar stares silently at the page. He’s stunned. “I’ve got a mum… I couldn’t be happier about this. Nobody loves you more than your mother.” For the first time since we met him six months earlier, a broad smile spreads across Amar’s face. “I’m going to frame this piece of paper. And I might even have a few drinks tonight to celebrate. The next step is to meet them…”  Three decades after that terrified little boy arrived at Heathrow gripping Emma Nicholson’s hand, Amar strides through the same airport, heading back to Baghdad, this time holding his British passport. This will be his first trip back to Iraq since he left in 1992. “I’m nervous, but I’m so excited. This is the biggest thing to happen in my life.” During the long journey - 10 hours in total - Amar’s eyes are fixed on the little graphic aeroplane on the in-flight screen. Every few seconds the map refreshes, and Amar watches the plane’s progress as it pulses from London towards the Middle East. “It just feels very unreal. It’s hard to believe, to be honest, how quick things have happened,” he says. As the landscape thousands of feet below changes from green fields to endless desert, Amar worries about how he will react when he meets his mother. To prepare for this journey he has spoken to psychologists and counsellors about his lifelong struggle to express emotions: “I’ve learned to hold back my feelings. I don’t allow myself to show them. Because of the war, the loss I suffered and the injuries I sustained, I have learned to live with things. I’ve learned to keep my feelings closed.” It’s 11 o’clock. The morning sun is gaining strength. Pigeons swoop overhead. The sound of a muezzin calling Muslims to prayer drifts from a minaret across the Baghdad skyline. Amar stands in the shade of a palm tree, to protect his scarred skin. He rearranges the collar of his new shirt. The moment of the reunion has finally arrived. “The purpose of this journey has been purely for her. Purely for the woman.” He pauses to correct himself. “My mother, I should say. I’ve got to get used to saying that word. Mother. My mother.” Amar has chosen to meet her in the garden of the BBC offices in Baghdad. It is a quiet, enclosed space - hidden from the bustle and business of city life. He hears an engine approaching. A car door slams. Footsteps shuffle down the path towards him. The garden gate opens. The outline of a woman appears. She is dressed in a long black chador cloak with a hijab around her head. “Mother. My mother.” “Amauri. Amauri,” she calls. My little Amar. You can sense the utter disbelief in her breaking voice. Arms oustretched, mother and son collapse into one another. They hold on firmly. Not letting go. They stroke one another. Kiss one another. Stare at one another’s faces. They whisper reassurances. Repeat one another’s names. But there are few other words. None are needed. Zahra softly runs her fingers over the scars on Amar’s face. Then she pats her son’s arms and legs up and down. She examines his hands. She tells him she is looking for signs of injuries. She thought he would be unable to walk. She expected him to have more severe physical disabilities as a result of his burns. But here he stands, hugging her. Without thinking about it, the Arabic language Amar thought he’d forgotten suddenly returns. Zahra:You are my lion. My son. Amar:I am your son. Zahra:Do you remember me? I’m your mother. I raised you… Amar:Of course you did. Zahra:Look. This is my son. My brave boy. Oh God, you’ve brought me my son. Please don’t take him away. Amar:No, no-one will take me away. It’s all in the hands of God. Zahra:It’s fate, my darling. It’s God’s will. I can’t believe it, I’ve seen my son. Amar. I’ve seen my little boy, Amar. Watching from a short distance away, it’s remarkable just how naturally and comfortably the pair interact. He forgets all his concerns about showing emotion. The connection - the love - that he worried would be absent couldn’t be more obvious. His feelings are unlocked. As the minutes pass and the immediate intensity subsides, Amar and his mother relax into a gentle chat. How do you resume a conversation after 30 years? This mother and son have so little in common. And yet, they have everything in common. For both of them, everything has changed. But somehow, nothing has changed. The bond Amar has worried about is still there. “My son is a hero, a superhero,” shouts a jubilant Zahra, nestling into Amar’s chest and kissing him. “He missed me. He cares about me and he wanted to find me. This is all I ever wished for. We had wars. So many wars. I lost Amar. I survived, but I was only thinking about Amar. And now he came back, finally. I’m so happy today. I would do anything for Amar. Anything.” From the magnitude of their loss, they quickly move on to discussing the little things they’ve missed. Amar pulls out his phone and shows his mother photographs of the fish he caught in Devon. Her eyesight is failing so she has to hold the device right next to her face. She beams with pride and reminds him of the fishing they used to do in Basra. That was hundreds of miles away - a lifetime ago - but it’s as if Amar and Zahra have only been apart for a few days. Amar is also reunited with his younger brother, Tahrir. Once again, there are plenty of tears and hugs, but there is no awkwardness. No silences. No agenda. The way they speak to one another, touch one another and interact with one another, seems incredibly easy. They remember the tricks they played on their parents. They laugh about football games and bird-hunting. Sharing chickpea stew and chicken kebabs, they tease, giggle and joke. They are a family again. The next day Amar says he wants to visit his family’s house in Karbala - about two hours south of Baghdad. What he finds there is very different from the rural home he remembers from his childhood in Basra. His mother, brother, sister-in-law and stepfather share a cramped breeze-block hut on a piece of polluted wasteland. Their roof is just a sheet of tarpaulin. There is little in the way of sanitation. Loose electric cables dangle from the power lines overhead. Before he returned to Iraq, Amar was worried that he would find it too upsetting to visit the house. He says he feels guilty that his family is living in such poverty. But, once again, his anxiety quickly subsides. Instead of focusing on the dirty floor, he smiles at old family photographs hanging on the wall. He laughs when his mother tips a celebratory bag of sweets over his head, like he is a little boy once again. The place quickly fills with the sound of laughter. Although he has never lived in this house, it soon feels like his home. Zahra unzips the bag of documents and photographs that she has carried with her for years, in the hope that one day she would find Amar. She unfolds the birth certificate, which reveals his real date of birth. Without any official paperwork, doctors in the UK could only guess Amar’s birthday from the state of his teeth and the length of his bones when he first arrived as a refugee. It turns out they got it wrong. Amar is three years older than they estimated. “It’s my 40th birthday next week,” he laughs. “And now I’ve finally got something to celebrate.” And there is another surprise. It turns out that the strange inky dot on the inside of Amar’s right arm is actually a family tattoo. His mother and brother have identical marks. Amar could never remember where his came from - or why it was there - but Tahrir explains how, as a young boy, he gave each family member a blue dot, so they would be able to identify one another if they were ever lost. “And now we have found our Amar,” he says. For a few poignant seconds, they all sit in silence, comparing their small blue dots. Five days after touching down in Baghdad, it is time for Amar to head back to the UK. Saying goodbye to his family was always going to be painful, but there is a calm confidence about their farewell. It is dignified, rather than dramatic. Realistic. Amar promises to return one day. He says he will try to send some money, but they understand that he doesn’t have much to give. “Thank you for finding me,” he says. “Thank you for coming back,” his family replies. From the top floor of a nearby building, Amar watches the sun setting beyond the Tigris River. It’s his final night in Iraq. He reflects on what he describes as an “overwhelming” week. “I’ve been alone for all these years - with all this trauma - but now I feel reborn. All I wanted was for my mother to be proud of me. And I think she is. “For so long, my life has been empty, but now I have a purpose. I want to come back and visit my family again soon.” In the park below some brothers are playing football. They’re about the same age Amar was when he lost his family. He smiles. “This has been the best moment of my life,” he says. Back in his Devon flat, Amar has put some ornaments and photos on display. There are prayer beads, which his mother gave him as a parting gift, and some stones that he picked up from the ground near the family grave in Najaf. Since returning home, Amar has been in regular contact with his family. Most nights his phone lights up as they share messages and photos. He’s now thinking about moving to London to find a job. He wants to fund another trip to Iraq and provide his relatives with some financial assistance. Lady Nicholson has described Amar’s reunion with his family as “an absolute miracle”. After several years without much contact, Amar has now reconnected with the politician and shared his news. Having met her again in Westminster, he is now keen to rebuild their relationship and maybe do some work for the Amar Foundation. Lady Nicholson has promised to help him in whatever way she can. She’s invited him to visit some of the projects that have been set up by the Amar Foundation - particularly its school for orphans in Basra. A year after he received that mysterious Facebook message, Amar looks out of the window towards Dartmoor and beyond. “I feel blessed. Everything makes sense. My life is finally complete.” "
China hits back in trade war with US,"China has said it will raise tariffs on $60bn (Â£46bn) of US goods from 1 June, extending a bilateral trade war. The move comes three days after the US more than doubled tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports. The escalation hit stock markets, with Asia markets falling on Tuesday after Wall Street closed with sharp losses. US President Donald Trump had warned China not to raise levies but Beijing said it would not swallow any ""bitter fruit"" that harmed its interests. Items affected include beef, lamb and pork products, as well as various varieties of vegetables, fruit juice, cooking oil, tea and coffee. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news briefing in Beijing that China would ""never surrender to external pressure"". The move hit stock markets in the US on Monday, with the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 closing down 2.4%, while the Nasdaq index lost 3.4%. On Tuesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.6%. The latest round of US-Chinese trade negotiations ended in Washington on Friday without a deal. What you asked about US-China trade The US-China trade war in charts The next US-China battleground US-China trade war in 300 words The US argues that China's trade surplus with the US is the result of unfair practices, including state support for domestic companies. It also accuses China of stealing intellectual property from US firms. As well as ordering a tariff increase on $200bn worth of Chinese imports, Mr Trump also directed the US trade department ""to begin the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from China"",estimated to be valued at around $300bn.,external Though on Monday, Mr Trump said that he had ""not made a decision"" on whether to go ahead with those additional levies. Despite failing to reach a deal last week, Mr Trump said on Monday that the US has ""a very good relationship"" with China. He said the two sides would talk at the next G20 summit which takes place in Japan on 28-29 June. ""Maybe something will happen,"" he said. ""We're going to be meeting, as you know, at the G20 in Japan and that'll be, I think, probably a very fruitful meeting."" Earlier, the president had warned China against a tit-for-tat response to the US's actions last week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""China should not retaliate - will only get worse!"" Mr Trump tweeted shortly before news of the Chinese decision came. Mr Trump also said China had ""taken so advantage of the US for so many years"". He added that US consumers could avoid the tariffs by buying the same products from other sources. ""Many tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That's why China wants to make a deal so badly!"" he said.

Police 'miss' chances to improve face tech,"Police facial recognition systems have been shown to do poorly when analysing non-white faces Black and minority ethnic people could be falsely identified and face questioning because police have failed to test how well their systems deal with non-white faces, say campaigners. At least three chances to assess how well the systems deal with ethnicity were missed over the past five years, the BBC found. Campaigners said the tech had too many problems to be used widely. ""It must be dropped immediately,"" said privacy rights group Big Brother Watch. Several UK police forces have been trialling controversial new facial recognition technology, including automated systems which attempt to identify the faces of people in real time as they pass a camera. Documents from the police, Home Office and university researchers show that police are aware that ethnicity can have an impact on such systems, but have failed on several occasions to test this. The Home Office said facial recognition can be an ""invaluable tool"" in fighting crime. ""The technology continues to evolve, and the Home Office continues to keep its effectiveness under constant review,"" a spokesman told the BBC. The ability of facial recognition software to cope with black and ethnic minority faces has proved a key concern for those worried about the technology, who claim the software is often trained on predominantly white faces. Minutes from a police working group reveal that the UK police's former head of facial recognition knew that skin colour was an issue. At an April 2014 meeting, Durham Police Chief Constable Mike Barton noted ""that ethnicity can have an impact on search accuracy"". He asked CGI, the Canadian company managing the police's facial image database, to investigate the issue, but subsequent minutes from the working group do not mention a follow-up. Met police boss Cressida Dick said she use of facial recognition was ""lawful and appropriate"" Facial recognition was introduced on the Police National Database (PND), which includes around 13 million faces, in 2014. The database has troubled privacy groups because it contains images of people subsequently cleared of any offence. A 2012 court decision ruled that holding such images was unlawful. The ""unlawful"" images are still held on the PND. The government is currently investigating ways to purge them from the system. Despite this, the PND facial recognition system, provided by German company Cognitec, has proved very popular. The number of face match searches done on the PND grew from 3,360 in 2014 to 12,504 in 2017, Freedom of Information requests to the Home Office have revealed. In 2015, a team of assessors from the Home Office tested the PND facial search system, using about 200 sample images. They had identified ethnicity information about the sample photos but, once again, failed to use this opportunity to check how well the system worked with different skin colours. Student says Apple AI led to false arrest Amazon defends facial-recognition tool Police face recognition tools 'inaccurate' The same Home Office report also estimated that, across the entire PND, about 40% of the images were duplicated. It noted that this meant the UK government has overpaid hundreds of thousands of pounds to Cognitec, because the company charges more once the number of images (or ""templates"") on the database exceeds 10 million. The Home Office assessment also found the facial recognition system was only half as good as the human eye. It said: ""Out of the initial 211 searches, the automated facial search of PND identified just 20 true matches, whereas visual examination by the tester identified a total of 56 matches."" Cognitec declined to comment on costs, but said its matching technology had improved since the Home Office report, and that facial recognition results always required review by a human. A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs Council said the technology had the potential to disrupt criminals, but said any roll-out must show its effectiveness within ""sufficient safeguards"". It added that work is being done to improve the system's accuracy and remove duplicates. Police checked faces during London's Notting Hill Carnival Another chance to check for racial bias was missed last year during trials by South Wales of real-time facial recognition software, which was used at sports events and concerts.Cardiff University carried out an assessment,externalof the force's use of the technology, That study stated that ""due to limited funds for this trial"", ethnicity was not tested. Cardiff's report noted, however, that ""during the evaluation period, no overt racial discrimination effects were observed"", but said this may be due to the demographic make-up of the watch lists used by the force. In addition,an interim report by a biometrics advisory group,externalto the government considering ethical issues of facial recognition highlighted concerns about the lack of ethnic diversity in datasets. Under-representation of certain types of faces, particularly those from ethnic minorities, could mean bias ""feeds forward"" into the use of the technology, it said. Silkie Carlo, director of campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ""The police's failure to do basic accuracy testing for race speaks volumes. ""Their wilful blindness to the risk of racism, and the risk to Brits' rights as a whole, reflects the dangerously irresponsible way in which facial recognition has crept on to our streets."" The technology had too many problems to justify its used, she said. ""It must be dropped immediately,"" Ms Carlo added. Big Brother Watch is currently taking legal action against the Metropolitan Police over its use of automated facial recognition systems.

Walkers in access row with aristocrat,"Traffic cones and rocks have been used to discourage parking A Scottish aristocrat has been accused of making ""strenuous efforts"" to stop people from using a popular riverside walk near his Highlands home. Lord Lovat, Simon Fraser, has blocked off car parking areas at Lovat Bridge near Beauly, making the walking route inaccessible for many people. ""Unofficial"" parking tickets have also been left on cars parked in the area. A spokesman for Lovat estates said it welcomed walkers but asked that they used public parking. Rocks and traffic cones have been used to block lay-bys and other areas used for parking, local residents have said. Lord Lovat recently returned to live in his ancestral lands but has upset local people by the moves. Walkers say he has removed a well-used car park and blocked up other areas. A walking group for older people and families with young children are among those affected. Lord Lovat's estate has asked that people use public parking and not park on a private road Liz Hoey, a local resident who has been walking in the area for the past 20 years, said she had enjoyed the previous ease access to her walk because of arthritis. She told BBC Scotland: ""They want you to park in Beauly but that would add on so much of a walk and it's a single track pavement with big lorries rushing past. ""This pavement is not good for either dog walkers or small children. A lot of people I know that used to walk there just can't now, including a friend who leads the Beauly Walking Group which is a walking group for older people who are trying to exercise to keep healthy and they can't park anywhere near. ""I'm very disappointed about the whole thing because it's a beautiful walk that people have used for years."" A spokesman for Lovat Estates said: ""We are asking people not to park down a private road, they are very welcome to walk, as is their right."" He said this was because the estate had to pay for the maintenance and upkeep costs of the road which were ""considerable"". The spokesman also said a number of verges were being ruined by cars parking on them and cars were blocking access for the estate's farm vehicles. Local people say they previously had unrestricted access to the riverside walk However, he said the estate had made improvements to benefit walkers, including installing a fence alongside a core path to help walkers who were worried about walking through livestock and by replacing dead and dying trees. A Highland Council spokesperson said: ""The River Beauly - Lovat Circuit is not on the Catalogue of Rights of Way maintained by Scotways, no-one has provided the council with evidence that any of it is a public right of way and, as a circuit, it is unlikely to meet the requirements of a public right of way. The council has received several complaints about it. ""The complaints have been about the diversion of the path by the river; and the closure of a car park near the Dutch Barn at the junction of the A862 and A831 (notices being placed on cars and walkers being approached while out walking)."" Davie Black, access officer at Mountaineering Scotland, which represents the interests of outdoor pursuits enthusiasts including walkers, said Scotland had some of the best land access legislation. But he said car parking was not protected under the Land Reform Act. He told BBC Radio Scotland's John Beattie programme: ""Where you don't have a right of vehicular access this is where we come into a problematic area. ""Where do you put your cars when you want to take to the hills?""

"Jeremy Kyle Show suspended after guest deathITV is conducting a review into the episode and everyone at the show is ""shocked and saddened"".Entertainment & Arts","ITV has suspended The Jeremy Kyle show after a guest died shortly after filming, and is conducting a review into the episode ""given the seriousness of this event"". The broadcaster took Monday's show off air and replaced it with a repeat of Dickinson's Real Deal. The participant from the episode died a week after recording it. ITV said everyone at the show is ""shocked and saddened"" and ""thoughts are with the family and friends"". It will not screen the episode and said both filming and broadcasting were suspended with ""immediate effect"". All previous episodes of the showhave also been taken down,externalfrom the channel's catch-up service, ITV Hub. Episodes will also not air on ITV2.

Although we can only assess content that has been broadcast, we are discussing this programme with ITV as a priority to understand what took place."" The show has been broadcast in its mid-morning slot since 2005. Its guests discuss relationship issues and conflicts with each other in front of Kyle's studio audience. It is well-known for its often heated debates, with Kyle mediating between guests. The show's website,externalasks for participants to contact the programme to discuss issues involving DNA and lie detector tests, fighting with an ex over access to a child, feuding families, break-ups, relationship problems, bad parents, addictions, and reunions. It is the most popular show on ITV's daytime schedule, with an average of one million viewers and a 22% audience share. The show had been due to screen a special episode featuring celebrities on 14 May, with troubled ex-EastEnders star Danniella Westbrook and former X Factor contestant Christopher Maloney as guests.

Heart deaths up for first time in 50 yearsThe British Heart Foundation says increasing rates of diabetes and obesity are partly responsible.,"Deaths from heart and circulatory diseases among people under 75 are on the rise for the first time in 50 years, UK figures show. The British Heart Foundation (BHF) says increasing rates of diabetes and obesity are partly responsible. In 2017 there were 42,384 deaths in under-75s from heart and circulatory conditions, up from 41,042 in 2014. The charity says the historic pace of progress in reducing these deaths ""has slowed to a near standstill"". Heart and circulatory diseases remain a leading cause of death in the UK, with millions at risk because of conditions like high blood pressure. Other risk factors include high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, smoking and family history. According to the charity's report, more than 14 million adults have high blood pressure but nearly 5 million do not know it because they have yet to be diagnosed. And around 15 million, or one in every four, adults in the UK is obese. Over the last five years the UK has seen an 18% increase in people diagnosed with diabetes.

Circulatory diseases include stroke and diseases of the arteries. Obesity: increased disease and death risk Type 2 diabetes: NHS to offer 800-calorie diet treatment Historically, the UK has made great strides at treating and preventing heart disease, thanks to better prevention - getting more people to stop smoking, for example - and new treatments. The BHF says a slowdown in the rate of improvement in death rates combined with a growing population is partly to blame for the reversal it is now seeing. Between 2012 and 2017, the premature death rates for heart and circulatory disease in the UK fell by just 9%, compared with a fall of 25% between 2007 and 2012. Simon Gillespie, chief executive at the BHF, said:Â âIn the UK weâve made phenomenal progress in reducing the number of people who die of a heart attack or stroke. ""ButÂ weâre seeing more people die each year from heart and circulatory
diseases in the UK before they reach their 75th, or even 65th, birthday. We are
deeply concerned by this reversal. âHeart and circulatory diseases remainÂ a leading cause of death in the UK, with
millions at risk because of conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes. ""We need to work in partnership with government, the NHS and medical research community to increase research investment and accelerateÂ innovative
approaches to diagnose and support the millions of people at risk of a heart attack or stroke.""

Who is Julian Assange?,"Julian Assange spent years fighting extradition to the US To his supporters, Julian Assange is a valiant campaigner for truth. To his critics, he is a publicity seeker who has endangered lives by putting a mass of sensitive information into the public domain. Assange is described by those who have worked with him as intense, driven and highly intelligent, with an exceptional ability to crack computer codes. He set up Wikileaks, which publishes confidential documents and images, in 2006, making headlines around the world in April 2010 when it released footage showing US soldiers shooting dead 18 civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. But later that year the Australian was detained in the UK - and later bailed - after Sweden issued an international arrest warrant over allegations of sexual assault. Assange argued it was a ploy to ultimately extradite to the US to face espionage charges - kicking off a legal saga which has now spanned 14 years, embroiled five countries and reached some of the world's highest courts. But the 52-year-old is now free - bailed and on his way to the Northern Mariana Islands - where he is on Wednesday expected to plead guilty to a single charge after reaching a deal with US authorities. He is expected to be released immediately, given the time he has already served in prison in the UK, and will return to Australia. Follow live reaction to the Assange plea deal Wikileaks founder Julian Assange freed after US plea deal A timeline of the Julian Assange saga Assange has been generally reluctant to talk about his background, but media interest since the emergence of Wikileaks has thrown up some insight into his influences. He was born in Townsville in the Australian state of Queensland in 1971, and led a rootless childhood while his parents ran a touring theatre. He became a father at 18 and custody battles soon followed. The development of the internet gave him a chance to use his early promise at maths, though this too led to difficulties. After pleading guilty to ""hacking"", Assange escaped prison on the condition he did not reoffend In 1995 Assange was accused, with a friend, of dozens of hacking activities. Though the group of hackers was skilled enough to track detectives tracking them, Assange was eventually caught and pleaded guilty. He was fined several thousand Australian dollars - only escaping a prison term on the condition that he did not reoffend. He dabbled in the world of academia - co-writing a bestselling book on the emerging, subversive side of the internet, before studying physics and maths. Assange began Wikileaks in 2006 with a group of like-minded people from across the web, creating a web-based ""dead-letterbox"" for would-be leakers. ""[To] keep our sources safe, we have had to spread assets, encrypt everything, and move telecommunications and people around the world to activate protective laws in different national jurisdictions,"" he told the BBC in 2011. ""We've become good at it, and never lost a case, or a source, but we can't expect everyone to go through the extraordinary efforts that we do."" Assange told the BBC that in order to protect sources he would ""encrypt everything"" Adopting a nomadic lifestyle, he ran Wikileaks from temporary, shifting locations. He could go for long stretches without eating and focus on work with very little sleep, according to Raffi Khatchadourian, a reporter for the New Yorker magazine who spent several weeks travelling with him. ""He creates this atmosphere around him where the people who are close to him want to care for him, to help keep him going. I would say that probably has something to do with his charisma."" But it was in 2010 that Wikileaks - and Assange - really shot to prominence, with the release of the footage of the US helicopter firing on civilians in Iraq. He promoted and defended the video, as well as the massive release of classified US military documents on the Afghan and Iraq wars in July and October 2010. The whistleblowing website went on to release new tranches of documents, including five million confidential emails from US-based intelligence company Stratfor. It soon found itself fighting for survival, when a number of US financial institutions began to block donations. And shortly after, Swedish authorities began chasing him for questioning over claims that he had raped one woman and sexually molested and coerced another in August 2010, while on a visit to Stockholm to give a lecture. By the end of 2010, an international warrant had been issued for his arrest. From the embassy's balcony in 2012, Assange urged the US to end its ""witchhunt"" against Wikileaks Assange says the encounters were entirely consensual - and the rape allegations were part of a politically motivated smear campaign - spending a year and a half challenging the warrant in court. When the UK Supreme Court upheld it, Assange turned to then Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa for help, the two men having expressed similar views on freedom in the past. In June 2012 he sought asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London to avoid extradition. His stay at the embassy was punctuated by occasional press statements and interviews. He made a submission to the UK's Leveson Inquiry into press standards, saying he had faced ""widespread inaccurate and negative media coverage"". It was during this time that concerns over his health first began to surface - but Assange dismissed reports that he would be leaving the embassy to seek medical treatment. Assange dismissed reports in 2014 that he would be leaving the embassy to seek medical treatment After spending almost seven years inside the embassy, Assange was dramatically dragged from the premises and arrested by British police on 11 April 2019. Ecuadorean President LenÃ­n Moreno - who said he had ""inherited"" the situation from his predecessor - tweeted that his country had taken ""a sovereign decision"", to withdraw his asylum status. Mr Moreno and his government had grown increasingly frustrated with Assange and his refusal to follow the rules they had imposed for his continued stay in the embassy. There were ""repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols"" by Assange, he said in a video statement. But Ecuador had requested that Great Britain guarantee that Assange would not be extradited to a country where he could face torture or the death penalty, Mr Moreno added. In 2019 Met Police officers dragged Assange out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he had stayed since 2012 Assange was taken into custody at a central London police station - charged with failing to surrender to court back in 2012 - and on 1 May 2019 was sentenced to 50 weeks in jail. In the following weeks, Swedish prosecutors promptly reopened their investigation into the 2010 rape claims and the US publicly charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act, related to the publication of classified documents in 2010. The US Department of Justice has described the leaks as ""one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States"". Wikileaks said the announcement was ""madness"" and ""the end of national security journalism"". As Assange prepared to fight against extradition to the US, Swedish prosecutors announced that the investigation into the 2010 rape allegation had been dropped, because the evidence against Assange was ""not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment"". Since then his case has been tied up in legal back-and-forth and a series of appeals. In 2021, a British court ruled in his favour, blocking his extradition - but that was later successfully appealed by the US government. And just last month the UK Supreme Court decided that Assange could appeal the US extradition order - again. All the while, Assange has sat in London's maximum security Belmarsh Prison. It was there that in 2022 he married his partner of seven years, Stella Moris, a South African lawyer and long-time member of his legal team. She is also the mother of Assange's two young children, who were conceived while Assange was living in the Ecuadorean embassy. This video can not be played Julian Assangeâs wife said she dreaded going public with their relationship His family have long said his health was steadily and dramatically declining and they feared he would die or kill himself. As the saga has dragged on, the UK and the US have faced growing pressure - from public campaign and from Assange's home country of Australia - to resolve the case. In February Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the country as a whole shared the view that ""enough is enough"". ""This thing cannot just go on and on and on indefinitely"". Rights groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have all called for his release, saying his treatment has been cruel and his case a threat to press freedom. He's also won support from countless figures of global power and influence, including former leader of the UK Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn, linguist Noam Chomsky, Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, and the late fashion icon Dame Vivienne Westwood. The late Dame Vivienne Westwood had appeared at rallies calling for Assange's release But his critics - which include former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and retiring Republican stalwart Mitch McConnell- say he is not a journalist and endangers lives by publishing troves of documents without redaction. After the final hearing on Wednesday in the US territory of Saipan - a Pacific island north of Guam - he is expected to return to Australia and be reunited with his family. They have expressed relief and thanked his supporters. ""I am grateful that my son's ordeal is finally coming to an end. This shows the importance and power of quiet diplomacy,"" his mother Christine Assange said in a statement.

Why is he a wanted man?,"The bearded figure being dragged from his home, into a waiting police van, was a far cry from the man who had entered the building seven years previously. Julian Assange - who co-founded website Wikileaks - had sought sanctuary in Ecuador's embassy from extradition to Sweden and, he feared, to the US. Ecuador withdrew his asylum on Thursday, leading to his arrest and thenconviction for failing to surrender to the court. But who exactly is Assange and what has he been accused of? This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London Julian Assange was born in Townsville, Australia, in 1971. His parents ran a touring theatre and his childhood was filled with upheaval. He became a father at 18, later becoming entangled in custody battles. He showed an aptitude for computers and was fined several thousand Australian dollars in 1995 after pleading guilty to hacking activities. Assange avoided jail on the condition that he would not reoffend. He went on to help write a book about the internet, before studying physics and maths at Melbourne University. In 2006, Assange co-founded the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks, along with a group of like-minded people from across the internet. Julian Assange: Campaigner or attention-seeker? iA timeline of the Julian Assange saga The site published thousands of classified documents covering everything from the film industry to national security and war. One of its most high-profile releases came in 2010,when it published a video from a US military helicopter that showed the killing of 18 civilians in Baghdad, Iraq,external. Helicopter footage was posted on Wikileaks In the same year, Wikileaks published hundreds of thousands of documents leaked by former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. They revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents during the war in Afghanistan. Files from the Iraq war showed that 66,000 civilians had been killed and that prisoners had been tortured by Iraqi forces. At the time, the US governmentmade it clearit hoped to prosecute Assange over the leak of the secret files. Wikileaks' document dumps that shook world How likely is an Assange conviction in US? Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange over allegations of sexual assault in 2010.  He was detained in the UK, and later bailed over the allegations. It followed claims that while on a visit to Stockholm to give a lecture, Assange had raped one woman and sexually molested and coerced another. Assange says both encounters were entirely consensual and the Swedish efforts against him are part of a smear campaign. This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? Following a long legal battle, the Wikileaks founder took refuge in Ecuador's embassy in 2012 to avoid being taken to Sweden to be questioned. He argued that he could also be extradited to the US and put on trial for publishing the secret US documents The Ecuadorian embassy was an obvious choice, since the South American country's then-president, Rafael Correa, was a strong advocate for Wikileaks, Swedish prosecutors dropped the rape investigation into Assange in 2017because they were unable to formally notify him of the allegations while he stayed in the embassy. The two other charges of molestation and unlawful coercion had to be dropped in 2015 because time had run out. But even after Sweden dropped the charges, Assange stayed in the embassy as he still faced a UK charge of failing to surrender to a court. Why Ecuador ended Assange's stay in its embassy Relations between Assange and Ecuador's government worsened under President LenÃ­n Moreno, who took office in 2017. Before withdrawing Assange's asylum, Ecuador accused him of improper behaviour, interference in the affairs of other countries and spying. Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed Assange's arrest, saying it showed that ""no one is above the law"" in the UK. ButLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Assange had revealed ""evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan""and that his extradition to the US ""should be opposed by the British government"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Assange should face the criminal justice system if Swedish authorities decide to charge him. Assange's lawyer Jennifer Robinson said they would fight the US extradition request. She said it set a ""dangerous precedent"" where any journalist could face US charges for ""publishing truthful information about the United States"". Pamela Anderson visiting Julian Assange at the Ecuadorean Embassy Actress Pamela Anderson - a friend of Assange - has said the UK is ""America's bitch"" in response to the arrest. Assange faces legal action in three countries - the UK, Sweden and the US. Westminster Magistrates' Court found him guilty of a British charge of breaching bail on Thursday. He faces up to 12 months in prison for that conviction. Meanwhile, Swedish authorities have said they are considering reopening their investigation into sexual assault allegations against him. The US has already charged the 47-year-old with a single count of participating in the hacking of intelligence computers to reveal controversial intelligence operations in the United States. But he is likely to face more charges if he is extradited to the US - a decision that will be taken by a judge and the UK home secretary. If Sweden also makes an extradition request,one legal experthas said it would be for the home secretary to decide which request would take precedence. Who is Julian Assange?

Born Doris Mary Ann Von Kappelhoff in April 1922, Day originally wanted to be a dancer but had to abandon her dream after breaking her right leg in a car accident. Instead she began her singing career at the age of 15. Her first hit, Sentimental Journey, would become a signature tune. Her films, which included Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much and That Touch of Mink, made her known around the world. But she never won an Oscar and was nominated only once, in 1960, for Pillow Talk, the first of her three romantic comedies with Hudson. Honours she did receive included the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004 and a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2008. Her last release, the compilation album My Heart, went to number one in the UK in 2011. Day's real life was not as upbeat as her on-screen persona Day's wholesome, girl-next-door image was a popular part of her myth that sometimes invited ridicule. ""I've been around so long, I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin,"" the musician Oscar Levant once remarked. Day herself said her ""Miss Chastity Belt"" image was ""more make-believe than any film part [she] ever played."" Her life was certainly not as sunny. She married four times, was divorced three times and was widowed once. She also suffered a mental breakdown and had severe financial trouble after one husband squandered her money. In the 1970s, she turned away from performing to focus her energies on her animal foundation. According to the organisation, she wished to have no funeral, memorial service or grave marker. In later life she became an advocate for animal welfare Dick Van Dyke, another Hollywood legend from the same era although he never worked with Day, said she had an ""energy about her"". ""She wasn't trying to act. It was just who Doris Day was, I think, a great energy and exhilaration, and she seemed to love life, at least that's the impression you got,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""It was a great era."" Star Trek actor William Shatner remembered Dayon Twitter,externalas ""the World's Sweetheart,"" saying she was ""beloved by all"". Fellow Star Trek cast member George Takei said she was ""synonymous with Hollywood icon,external"", while Spanish actor Antonio Banderas wrote: ""Thank you for your talent,external.""

""We've lost another great Hollywood talent,""tweeted,externalFamily Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, while actor Luke Evanssaid,externalhe had ""always loved"" her voice and ""beautiful"" songs. Former Beatles member Paul McCartney paid tribute to Day on his website, describing her as ""very funny lady who I shared many laughs with"", adding: ""I will miss her but will always remember her twinkling smile and infectious laugh"".

"China hits back in trade war with USChina says it will impose new tariffs on some US imports from 1 June, extending a mutual trade war.Business","China has said it will raise tariffs on $60bn (Â£46bn) of US goods from 1 June, extending a bilateral trade war. The move comes three days after the US more than doubled tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports. The escalation hit stock markets, with Asia markets falling on Tuesday after Wall Street closed with sharp losses. US President Donald Trump had warned China not to raise levies but Beijing said it would not swallow any ""bitter fruit"" that harmed its interests. Items affected include beef, lamb and pork products, as well as various varieties of vegetables, fruit juice, cooking oil, tea and coffee. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news briefing in Beijing that China would ""never surrender to external pressure"". The move hit stock markets in the US on Monday, with the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 closing down 2.4%, while the Nasdaq index lost 3.4%. On Tuesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.6%. The latest round of US-Chinese trade negotiations ended in Washington on Friday without a deal. What you asked about US-China trade The US-China trade war in charts The next US-China battleground US-China trade war in 300 words The US argues that China's trade surplus with the US is the result of unfair practices, including state support for domestic companies. It also accuses China of stealing intellectual property from US firms. As well as ordering a tariff increase on $200bn worth of Chinese imports, Mr Trump also directed the US trade department ""to begin the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from China"",estimated to be valued at around $300bn.,external Though on Monday, Mr Trump said that he had ""not made a decision"" on whether to go ahead with those additional levies. Despite failing to reach a deal last week, Mr Trump said on Monday that the US has ""a very good relationship"" with China. He said the two sides would talk at the next G20 summit which takes place in Japan on 28-29 June. ""Maybe something will happen,"" he said. ""We're going to be meeting, as you know, at the G20 in Japan and that'll be, I think, probably a very fruitful meeting."" Earlier, the president had warned China against a tit-for-tat response to the US's actions last week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""China should not retaliate - will only get worse!"" Mr Trump tweeted shortly before news of the Chinese decision came. Mr Trump also said China had ""taken so advantage of the US for so many years"". He added that US consumers could avoid the tariffs by buying the same products from other sources. ""Many tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That's why China wants to make a deal so badly!"" he said. Mr Trump's approach in the dispute has put him at odds with his own top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who has said ""both sides will suffer"".

Six men jailed for rival gang murder bids,"The guilty men included (clockwise, from top left) Peter Bain, Brian Ferguson, Andrew Gallacher and John Hardie Six men who tried to turn Glasgow into a ""war zone"" during a feud with a rival gang have been jailed for a total of 104 years. The associates of the Lyons criminal family were found guilty of plotting attempts to kill five men linked to their rivals, the Daniel family. Police said it was a ""miracle"" that no-one died in the violent attacks. The judge, Lord Mulholland, said the ""sophisticated plot"" was foiled by ""good, old-fashioned detective work"". Brian Ferguson, 37, Andrew Gallacher, 40, Robert Pickett, 53, Andrew Sinclair, 32, John Hardie, 35, and Peter Bain, 45, werefound guilty of conspiracy to murderlast month. Ferguson, Gallacher and Hardie were each jailed for 20 years; Picket was jailed for 16 years; Bain was jailed for 15 years; and Sinclair was jailed for 13 years and three months. This video can not be played Lord Mulholland sentenced the men to 104 years in jail Lord Mulhollandtold them,external: ""You sought to turn Glasgow into a war zone for your feud. ""This is a civilised city, which is based on the rule of law. There is no place for this type of conduct, retribution or the law of the jungle."" The men had targeted Robert Daniel, Thomas Bilsland, Gary Petty, Ryan Fitzsimmons and Steven Daniel between June 2016 and September 2017 at locations in Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and Manchester. Their attackers were tracked down during Operation Engagement, the latest investigation linked to the feud - which has been connected to dozens of tit-for-tat attacks, including a murder. The trial heard that victim Steven Daniel knew Kevin ""Gerbil"" Carroll, who was shot dead in the car park of Asda, Robroyston, in January 2010. The first murder trial, which later collapsed, heard thatCarroll's killer, William Paterson, visited a member of the Lyons family in prison, two days after the supermarket murder. The latest 14-week trial at the High Court in Glasgow, which was held amid tight security, focused on five attempted murders in five months. This video can not be played CCTV captures a high-speed chase towards the M8 motorway The murder bids included an attack on Steven Daniel on 18 May 2017. After a high-speed car chase which ended with a crash on an off-ramp of the M8, he was attacked with a cleaver and a hammer. His nose was almost severed from his face, and hisinjuries were so severethat police initially thought he had been shot at close range. The Audi S3 used in the attack was set on fire, but a bloodied machete was discovered in the back seat. Mr Daniel was badly injured in the attack in May 2017 The first attack was on Robert Daniel, whose car was rammed by another vehicle before he was chased into a house in Robroyston on 8 December 2016. Once inside the house he was struck twice on the back of the head with what he later told police was a hatchet or a machete. A month later, Thomas Bilsland suffered a fractured skull after he was set upon in Glasgow's Cranhill. Gary Petty was targeted after he visited an Italian takeaway in Maryhill on 7 March 2017. A Landrover Discovery was found after the attack on Robert Daniel Former soldier Ryan Fitzsimmons was left unconscious and brain-damaged after being ambushed in the street by a masked gang on 28 April 2017. The 34-year-old was attacked with a sword and a hammer outside the home he shared with his mother in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. He told jurors: ""It felt like death was coming."" His mum Geraldine, 61, was so affected by what happened that she suffered a heart attack in the street. Mr Fitzsimmons told jurors he had ""no enemies"" but jurors heard his older brother Martyn had once been charged with shooting Ross Monaghan, the man cleared of murdering Carroll outside Asda. Last year soldier turned gun-runner Martyn was jailed for 10-and-a-half years after admitting having a Glock and ammunition, and hiding Â£36,000 of crime cash. He was part of a nine-man crime gang - described asScotland's most dangerous- jailed for 87 years after Operation Escalade, a massive probe into violence, drugs and firearms offences. A machete was found in the back of the burnt-out car Lord Mullholland described Ryan Fitzsimmons as ""a hard-working man living peacefully with his mother"". He said: ""As a result of the extensive injuries sustained during the attack upon him he has had to give up work and is dependent on his mother for his care and support. The need for care and support will persist for the rest of his life."" Lord Mulholland said Steven Daniel had told the trial that he was not aware of a feud between the Lyons and Daniel families. ""I did not believe a word and, more importantly, neither did the jury,"" he said. The judge said the ""sophisticated"" murder plot had involved high-tech tracker devices and encrypted mobile phones. But he told the six men: ""You were caught by good, old-fashioned detective work, identifying DNA on a tracker - and everything followed from there."" Det Insp Jim Bradley described the level of violence as ""horrific"" Det Inp Jim Bradley said it was a ""miracle"" that no one died. ""It's been documented in the trial that if it hadn't been for medical intervention and the expertise of medical staff that a couple of our victims would have died,"" he said. ""The level of violence in such a planned and premeditated manner was horrific. ""There's no other word for it - just totally horrific."" He added that there had been repeated attempts to ""calm things down"" and stop the violence. ""Hopefully this will be a deterrent to anybody that's going to involve themselves in this kind of activity,"" he said. ""There's no winners in this type of crime.""

"Refuge vow for domestic abuse victimsCouncils in England will have a legal duty to provide secure homes for victims, the PM says.UK","At present, support for victims in England varies depending on the area Councils in England will have a legal duty to provide secure homes for victims of domestic abuse under new plans announced by Theresa May. People seeking refuge from abuse and violence can receive varying levels of support depending on their location. But Mrs May has vowed to end the ""postcode lottery"" for victims and their children, creating a legal duty for councils to provide refuge. One victim described the move as ""absolutely momentous"" news. Charlotte Kneer, who stayed in a refuge herself and now runs one in Surrey, told the BBC she cried when she heard the news. Having a refuge space can be ""life-saving"" - but some women cannot get one, because local authorities' budgets have been ""squeezed"", she said. ""This is something Women's Aid and lots of other campaigners have been asking for, for years and years,"" she added. 'I was raped' by police officer ex-husband New app secretly tracks domestic abuse The prime minister said the ""abhorrent crime"" had ""no place"" in the UK. In a message to victims, she added: ""Whoever you are, wherever you live and whatever the abuse you face, you will have access to the services you need to be safe."" The prime minister spoke to a case worker and domestic violence survivor at a London centre on Monday Mrs May's new plans are backed by funding. Â The prime minister visited a London charity that helps women and children who have survived domestic abuse on Monday and said she hoped the bill would be of ""real benefit"" to people. One woman told her that her support for the issue ""makes a world of difference"". But while charities and councils say the government's moves are positive, they want to know how much money will be provided in the face of cuts to local authority budgets. The Domestic Abuse Bill will also introduce the first ever statutory government definition of domestic abuse to specifically include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical abuse. The legislation will establish a new Domestic Abuse Commissioner and prohibit the cross-examination of victims by their abusers in family courts. This video can not be played Charlotte Kneer on why the plan is important Ms Kneer, who runs Reigate and Banstead Women's Aid, said having a safe place to go is a human right, adding: ""For me and many other women, having a refuge is literally life-saving."" She added people fleeing domestic abuse had to seek refuge in a place outside their hometown, to avoid seeing their attacker or their acquaintances. Because they weren't services for local people, refuges had often been ""easy cuts"" for local authorities to make. ""Hopefully this is the start of securing the future for refuges,"" she said. Diana James is optimistic about the plans - but has concerns about how they will be implemented Diana James, a domestic abuse survivor who works with refuge services in south-west England, said she was ""optimistic"" about the plans but concerned about how it would be put into practice, particularly for LGBT people. ""Some refuges accept LGBT people, others say they do but filter them out, and some just don't,"" she said. ""This is a step forward, but it's about the implementation. ""I hope [the government's] heart is in the right place and that they want to make this work."" Nicki Norman, acting co-chief executive of Women's Aid, said many of her organisation's member services were providing support on a ""shoestring budget"", so a move to consistent, dedicated funding was ""desperately needed"". ""We look forward to working with the government to ensure that this important move to fund refuges is safe, sustainable and delivers the resources that services urgently require to support all women and children fleeing domestic abuse,"" she said. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, also welcomed Mrs May's announcement, which she said could secure ""life-saving services"". ""This has the potential to end the postcode lottery for refuge places and could put these life-saving services on a secure financial footing for the first time,"" Ms Horley said. Ministers have launched a consultation to determine how much funding is needed and where it should go by talking to victims and survivors, as well as organisations supporting victims and their children every day. Funding totalling Â£22m has already been made available to local authorities toÂ buy more than 2,000 beds in refuges and other safe accommodation - and to provide access to education and employment. Local government secretary James Brokenshire said it was estimated an extra Â£90m a year would be needed for local authorities to provide accommodation for victims. The details on funding would be settled through the Spending Review process, he added. Councillor Simon Blackburn of the Local Government Association welcomed extra support but said councils could not tackle the issue alone. ""Our ambition must be to reduce the number of victims, with greater investment in early intervention and prevention schemes that helps stop domestic abuse occurring in the first place,"" he said. The plans only apply to England and not councils in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, which do not currently have directly comparable systems in place.

Refuge vow for domestic abuse victims,"At present, support for victims in England varies depending on the area Councils in England will have a legal duty to provide secure homes for victims of domestic abuse under new plans announced by Theresa May. People seeking refuge from abuse and violence can receive varying levels of support depending on their location. But Mrs May has vowed to end the ""postcode lottery"" for victims and their children, creating a legal duty for councils to provide refuge. One victim described the move as ""absolutely momentous"" news. Charlotte Kneer, who stayed in a refuge herself and now runs one in Surrey, told the BBC she cried when she heard the news. Having a refuge space can be ""life-saving"" - but some women cannot get one, because local authorities' budgets have been ""squeezed"", she said. ""This is something Women's Aid and lots of other campaigners have been asking for, for years and years,"" she added. 'I was raped' by police officer ex-husband New app secretly tracks domestic abuse The prime minister said the ""abhorrent crime"" had ""no place"" in the UK. In a message to victims, she added: ""Whoever you are, wherever you live and whatever the abuse you face, you will have access to the services you need to be safe."" The prime minister spoke to a case worker and domestic violence survivor at a London centre on Monday Mrs May's new plans are backed by funding. Â The prime minister visited a London charity that helps women and children who have survived domestic abuse on Monday and said she hoped the bill would be of ""real benefit"" to people. One woman told her that her support for the issue ""makes a world of difference"". But while charities and councils say the government's moves are positive, they want to know how much money will be provided in the face of cuts to local authority budgets. The Domestic Abuse Bill will also introduce the first ever statutory government definition of domestic abuse to specifically include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical abuse. The legislation will establish a new Domestic Abuse Commissioner and prohibit the cross-examination of victims by their abusers in family courts. This video can not be played Charlotte Kneer on why the plan is important Ms Kneer, who runs Reigate and Banstead Women's Aid, said having a safe place to go is a human right, adding: ""For me and many other women, having a refuge is literally life-saving."" She added people fleeing domestic abuse had to seek refuge in a place outside their hometown, to avoid seeing their attacker or their acquaintances. Because they weren't services for local people, refuges had often been ""easy cuts"" for local authorities to make. ""Hopefully this is the start of securing the future for refuges,"" she said. Diana James is optimistic about the plans - but has concerns about how they will be implemented Diana James, a domestic abuse survivor who works with refuge services in south-west England, said she was ""optimistic"" about the plans but concerned about how it would be put into practice, particularly for LGBT people.

Hillsborough safety officer finedEx-Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Mackrell was found guilty of a health and safety charge.Liverpool,"Former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell had responsibility for safety at Hillsborough stadium The stadium safety officer in charge at the time of the Hillsborough disaster has been fined Â£6,500. Former secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Graham Mackrell, is the first person to be convicted of an offence relating to the tragedy. Mackrell, 69, of Stocking Pelham, Hertfordshire, failed to ensure there were enough turnstiles to prevent large crowds building up. He was also ordered to pay Â£5,000 towards the prosecution costs. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died following the crush in the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989. The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster Mackrell sat in the well of the court rather than the dock for the sentencing hearing at Preston Crown Court. He wasfound guilty last monthafter an 11-week trial of failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act in respect of ensuring there were enough turnstiles to prevent unduly large crowds building up outside the ground. The jury in the trial was unable to reach a verdict over match commander David Duckenfield, 74, who denied the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans. No verdict on Hillsborough police chief Hillsborough safety boss 'had no training' Duckenfield treated as 'target of blame' The court heard there were seven turnstiles available for the 10,100 Liverpool fans with standing tickets. Judge Sir Peter Openshaw said: ""He should have realised there was an obvious risk that so many spectators could not pass through seven turnstiles in time for kick-off."" But Judge Openshaw said Mackrell's offence did not directly cause the disaster inside the ground. He said: ""The defendant's offence was at least one of the direct causes of the crush at the turnstiles outside the ground but it was not a direct cause of the crush on the terraces inside the ground that resulted in the deaths of 96 spectators and injury to many more, to which the crush outside the ground did no more than set the scene."" The jury heard 96 men, women and children died as a result of a fatal crush on the Leppings Lane terrace In a statement, Mackrell said he was ""grateful"" the judge had recognised ""my conduct did not cause or contribute to the death of any person or cause any person to be injured on that tragic day"". He added: ""Despite that, I do wish to take this opportunity to make clear my sympathy to all those impacted by this appalling tragedy. ""No-one should have to go through what the families have experienced."" Outside court, Louise Brookes, whose brother Andrew died at Hillsborough, called the sentence ""shameful"" and said the fine amounted to Â£67.70 per life lost. ""Our 96 deserve better than this and us families deserve better than this. We are all getting on in age and enough is enough,"" she said. ""My weekly shopping costs more than Â£67.70."" Christine Burke, whose father Henry died in the disaster, added: ""When Hillsborough happened he [Mackrell] was in charge of the safety certificate at the time and he should have been sacked straight away. ""He went on to bigger and better things, he was promoted. This is a man who has been paid very well and gone on to do other things. That should not have happened."" The court heard Mackrell made Â£700 a week in his job as administrator for the Football League Managers' Association and earned an additional Â£670 a week from pensions. A hearing to decide whether Mr Duckenfield will face a retrial is expected to be held next month. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after the disaster.

Labour agrees Brexit poll stance,"Labour's governing body has agreed to support a further referendum on Brexit under certain circumstances. The National Executive Committee met to decide the wording of its manifesto for May's European elections. It rejected the idea of campaigning for a referendum under all circumstances - as supported by deputy leader Tom Watson and many ordinary members. But the party will demand a public vote if it cannot get changes to the government's deal or an election. The National Executive Committee (NEC) oversees the overall direction of the party and is made up of representatives including shadow cabinet members, MPs, councillors and trade unions. Labour to redraft Euro election leaflets What's the mood on the doorstep? How many Labour supporters voted Leave? A Labour source said: ""The NEC agreed the manifesto which will be fully in line with Labour's existing policy to support Labour's alternative plan and if we can't get the necessary changes to the government's deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote."" The decision was sufficiently nuanced, though, that MPs have interpreted it in different ways. Wes Streeting, who favours another referendum, tweeted,externalthat the NEC had ""made the right call and confirmed that a public vote will be in our manifesto for the European elections"". Fellow pro-referendum MP Bridget Phillipson said Labour had ""done the bare minimum needed"" and she could ""only hope"" it would be enough to win over voters who want another say on Brexit. On the other side of the party,Gloria De Piero, who is against another vote, also welcomed the decision,external, arguing it meant the manifesto would ""not contain a pledge"" to hold a referendum - only keeping it as ""an option"" if a general election could not be engineered. The UK will have to take part in European Parliamentary elections on 23 May unless a Brexit deal is accepted by MPs before then. Labour agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government's withdrawal deal with the EU - which it has effectively done three times - or talks ended in no-deal, there should be a general election. But if it could not force one, conference agreed that the party ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"". Since then, though, Labour has entered into cross-party talks with the Conservatives to see if they can reach a consensus on how to get a Brexit deal through Parliament so that Britain can leave. Many Labour members wanted the party to make its agreement to any deal conditional on it being put to a public vote - what Labour calls a ""confirmatory ballot"". Labour have not yet made clear what their proposed referendum would be on, but a party briefing paper to MPs published earlier this year said it would need to have ""a credible Leave option and Remain"" on the ballot paper. On the surface it doesn't look like Labour's position has changed - but it has a little bit. Tom Watson, along with some trade unions and some party members, wanted a full-throated commitment to a referendum under all circumstances. What they have ended up with instead is a compromise or a fudge. Labour will call for a referendum if the Conservatives don't make changes to their Brexit deal. Some pro-referendum MPs aren't too disappointed because they believe the Conservatives won't move far enough and that leaves the door open to a referendum in the end anyway. Others, though, are disappointed because they think this is a way of avoiding a clear commitment in the run-up to the European elections. In truth, it puts the ball back into the Tories' court when it comes to those cross-party Brexit talks. Jeremy Corbyn is saying to Theresa May ""if you can compromise with us, we can hold back the tide of demands in our own party for a referendum."" That's the bargain he's offering. Speaking ahead of the NEC's decision, Tom Watson, the party's deputy leader, said ""the context has changed"" since the 2018 party conference and Labour should now throw its full support behind a second referendum ""to heal the divide in the country"". Afterwards, he described the party's agreed manifesto as ""very good"" and insisted he was not ""disappointed"" with the outcome - although he said would say more when the document was published next week. Manuel Cortes, secretary of the TSSA union which has a seat on the NEC, said he was disappointed that Labour had missed the opportunity to commit to giving voters another say. The latest talks between the government and Labour on Monday were described as ""positive"" and ""productive"" by the two sides.

Trump defiant over China tariff hike,"US President Donald Trump has denied that US consumers will pay for higher tariffs on Chinese imports and has warned China not to follow suit. The US more than doubled tariffs on $200bn (Â£153.7bn) of Chinese goods on Friday, in a sharp escalation of their trade war. But in a series of tweets, Mr Trump said China had ""taken so advantage of the US for so many years"". ""Therefore, China should not retaliate - will only get worse!"" he added. Mr Trump said US consumers could avoid the tariffs by buying the same products from other sources. ""Many tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That's why China wants to make a deal so badly!"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, Mr Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said ""both sides will suffer"" from the trade dispute. But Mr Trump downplayed the impact of the tariff hike on the US. ""We are right where we want to be with China. Remember, they broke the deal with us & tried to renegotiate,"" Mr Trump wrote in another post on Twitter. ""We will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from China. Buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal), or buy it from non-tariffed countries."" Allow Twitter content?

In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Mr Kudlow admitted that it was American businesses that paid the tariffs on any goods brought in from China, and that US consumers would also foot the bill if firms passed on the cost increase. Mr Kudlow said he thought the tariffs would also have an impact on China's economy, as the higher cost would reduce US demand for Chinese goods. On Friday, the US increased a 10% tariff on $200bn worth of Chinese goods - including fish, handbags, clothing and footwear - to 25%. TheOffice of the United States Trade Representative,externalhas also said it has been ordered to ""begin the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from China, which are valued at approximately $300 billion"". China has said it will retaliate but has not announced any details, including when it would take action. What you asked about US-China trade The US-China trade war in charts The next US-China battleground US-China trade war in 300 words The higher tariffs will be paid by American companies importing goods from China. Economists have said a 25% tariff will be much harder for businesses to absorb than 10%, which means they are more likely to pass on some of the cost to consumers. Asked in an interview with Fox News Sunday whether it was correct to say that it was US businesses and US consumers who pay for the tariff, Mr Kudlow said: ""Yes, to some extent. I don't disagree with that."" ""Both sides will suffer on this."" Mr Kudlow also said there was a ""strong possibility"" that Mr Trump would meet China's President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit in Japan in late June. China said on Friday it ""deeply regrets"" the US decision to hike tariffs and that it will have to retaliate with the ""necessary countermeasures."" In the past, the Chinese have introduced retaliatory tariffs almost immediately after US tariffs have gone into force. China has responded saying it will not swallow any ""bitter fruit"". The commentary is due for publication on Monday in the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily. The US argues that China's trade surplus with the US is the result of unfair practices, including state support for domestic companies. It also accuses China of stealing intellectual property from US firms.

Heart deaths up for first time in 50 years,"Deaths from heart and circulatory diseases among people under 75 are on the rise for the first time in 50 years, UK figures show. The British Heart Foundation (BHF) says increasing rates of diabetes and obesity are partly responsible. In 2017 there were 42,384 deaths in under-75s from heart and circulatory conditions, up from 41,042 in 2014. The charity says the historic pace of progress in reducing these deaths ""has slowed to a near standstill"". Heart and circulatory diseases remain a leading cause of death in the UK, with millions at risk because of conditions like high blood pressure. Other risk factors include high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, smoking and family history. According to the charity's report, more than 14 million adults have high blood pressure but nearly 5 million do not know it because they have yet to be diagnosed. And around 15 million, or one in every four, adults in the UK is obese. Over the last five years the UK has seen an 18% increase in people diagnosed with diabetes.

Circulatory diseases include stroke and diseases of the arteries. Obesity: increased disease and death risk Type 2 diabetes: NHS to offer 800-calorie diet treatment Historically, the UK has made great strides at treating and preventing heart disease, thanks to better prevention - getting more people to stop smoking, for example - and new treatments. The BHF says a slowdown in the rate of improvement in death rates combined with a growing population is partly to blame for the reversal it is now seeing. Between 2012 and 2017, the premature death rates for heart and circulatory disease in the UK fell by just 9%, compared with a fall of 25% between 2007 and 2012. Simon Gillespie, chief executive at the BHF, said:Â âIn the UK weâve made phenomenal progress in reducing the number of people who die of a heart attack or stroke. ""ButÂ weâre seeing more people die each year from heart and circulatory
diseases in the UK before they reach their 75th, or even 65th, birthday. We are
deeply concerned by this reversal. âHeart and circulatory diseases remainÂ a leading cause of death in the UK, with
millions at risk because of conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes. ""We need to work in partnership with government, the NHS and medical research community to increase research investment and accelerateÂ innovative
approaches to diagnose and support the millions of people at risk of a heart attack or stroke.""

Puppy farm ban set to be confirmed,"A new law aimed at cracking down on so-called puppy farms in England is being presented to Parliament on Monday. Known as Lucy's Law, it will ban the sale of kittens and puppies from third parties from spring 2020, making buyers deal with breeders directly. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the new rules would give animals ""the best possible start in life"". The RSPCA said it was ""absolutely thrilled"" with the legislation - but stressed it required enforcement. 'Dad said we were going to a dentist, but never came back' The meaning behind Archie and Harrison Gaga's billowing gown unravels at Met Gala The new law would require animals to be born and reared in a safe environment, with their mother, and to be sold from their place of birth. The rules, which will apply to England, are also designed to deter smugglers who abuse the Pet Travel Scheme to bring young animals into the UK to be sold. Named after Lucy, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who died in 2016 after being poorly treated on a puppy farm, the ban is scheduled to come into force on 6 April next year, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.

But Paula Boyden, veterinary director at Dogs Trust, the UK's largest dog welfare charity, urged the government to go further. She said: ""We would like to see additional measures introduced to ensure the ban is as robust as possible. ""There is time before April 2020 for the government to consider regulation of re-homing organisations and sanctuaries, ensure full traceability of all puppies sold, and strengthening of the pet travel scheme.""

"Trump defiant over China tariff hikeMr Trump's comments come after his top economic adviser said ""both sides will suffer"" from tariff hikes.","US President Donald Trump has denied that US consumers will pay for higher tariffs on Chinese imports and has warned China not to follow suit. The US more than doubled tariffs on $200bn (Â£153.7bn) of Chinese goods on Friday, in a sharp escalation of their trade war. But in a series of tweets, Mr Trump said China had ""taken so advantage of the US for so many years"". ""Therefore, China should not retaliate - will only get worse!"" he added. Mr Trump said US consumers could avoid the tariffs by buying the same products from other sources. ""Many tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That's why China wants to make a deal so badly!"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, Mr Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said ""both sides will suffer"" from the trade dispute. But Mr Trump downplayed the impact of the tariff hike on the US. ""We are right where we want to be with China. Remember, they broke the deal with us & tried to renegotiate,"" Mr Trump wrote in another post on Twitter. ""We will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from China. Buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal), or buy it from non-tariffed countries."" Allow Twitter content?

In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Mr Kudlow admitted that it was American businesses that paid the tariffs on any goods brought in from China, and that US consumers would also foot the bill if firms passed on the cost increase. Mr Kudlow said he thought the tariffs would also have an impact on China's economy, as the higher cost would reduce US demand for Chinese goods. On Friday, the US increased a 10% tariff on $200bn worth of Chinese goods - including fish, handbags, clothing and footwear - to 25%. TheOffice of the United States Trade Representative,externalhas also said it has been ordered to ""begin the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from China, which are valued at approximately $300 billion"". China has said it will retaliate but has not announced any details, including when it would take action. What you asked about US-China trade The US-China trade war in charts The next US-China battleground US-China trade war in 300 words The higher tariffs will be paid by American companies importing goods from China. Economists have said a 25% tariff will be much harder for businesses to absorb than 10%, which means they are more likely to pass on some of the cost to consumers. Asked in an interview with Fox News Sunday whether it was correct to say that it was US businesses and US consumers who pay for the tariff, Mr Kudlow said: ""Yes, to some extent. I don't disagree with that."" ""Both sides will suffer on this."" Mr Kudlow also said there was a ""strong possibility"" that Mr Trump would meet China's President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit in Japan in late June. China said on Friday it ""deeply regrets"" the US decision to hike tariffs and that it will have to retaliate with the ""necessary countermeasures."" In the past, the Chinese have introduced retaliatory tariffs almost immediately after US tariffs have gone into force. China has responded saying it will not swallow any ""bitter fruit"". The commentary is due for publication on Monday in the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily. The US argues that China's trade surplus with the US is the result of unfair practices, including state support for domestic companies. It also accuses China of stealing intellectual property from US firms.

"Six men jailed for rival gang murder bidsFive men were targeted in the ""gangsterous"" attacks, which took place in and around Glasgow.Glasgow & West Scotland","The guilty men included (clockwise, from top left) Peter Bain, Brian Ferguson, Andrew Gallacher and John Hardie Six men who tried to turn Glasgow into a ""war zone"" during a feud with a rival gang have been jailed for a total of 104 years. The associates of the Lyons criminal family were found guilty of plotting attempts to kill five men linked to their rivals, the Daniel family. Police said it was a ""miracle"" that no-one died in the violent attacks. The judge, Lord Mulholland, said the ""sophisticated plot"" was foiled by ""good, old-fashioned detective work"". Brian Ferguson, 37, Andrew Gallacher, 40, Robert Pickett, 53, Andrew Sinclair, 32, John Hardie, 35, and Peter Bain, 45, werefound guilty of conspiracy to murderlast month. Ferguson, Gallacher and Hardie were each jailed for 20 years; Picket was jailed for 16 years; Bain was jailed for 15 years; and Sinclair was jailed for 13 years and three months. This video can not be played Lord Mulholland sentenced the men to 104 years in jail Lord Mulhollandtold them,external: ""You sought to turn Glasgow into a war zone for your feud. ""This is a civilised city, which is based on the rule of law. There is no place for this type of conduct, retribution or the law of the jungle."" The men had targeted Robert Daniel, Thomas Bilsland, Gary Petty, Ryan Fitzsimmons and Steven Daniel between June 2016 and September 2017 at locations in Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and Manchester. Their attackers were tracked down during Operation Engagement, the latest investigation linked to the feud - which has been connected to dozens of tit-for-tat attacks, including a murder. The trial heard that victim Steven Daniel knew Kevin ""Gerbil"" Carroll, who was shot dead in the car park of Asda, Robroyston, in January 2010. The first murder trial, which later collapsed, heard thatCarroll's killer, William Paterson, visited a member of the Lyons family in prison, two days after the supermarket murder. The latest 14-week trial at the High Court in Glasgow, which was held amid tight security, focused on five attempted murders in five months. This video can not be played CCTV captures a high-speed chase towards the M8 motorway The murder bids included an attack on Steven Daniel on 18 May 2017. After a high-speed car chase which ended with a crash on an off-ramp of the M8, he was attacked with a cleaver and a hammer. His nose was almost severed from his face, and hisinjuries were so severethat police initially thought he had been shot at close range. The Audi S3 used in the attack was set on fire, but a bloodied machete was discovered in the back seat. Mr Daniel was badly injured in the attack in May 2017 The first attack was on Robert Daniel, whose car was rammed by another vehicle before he was chased into a house in Robroyston on 8 December 2016. Once inside the house he was struck twice on the back of the head with what he later told police was a hatchet or a machete. A month later, Thomas Bilsland suffered a fractured skull after he was set upon in Glasgow's Cranhill. Gary Petty was targeted after he visited an Italian takeaway in Maryhill on 7 March 2017. A Landrover Discovery was found after the attack on Robert Daniel Former soldier Ryan Fitzsimmons was left unconscious and brain-damaged after being ambushed in the street by a masked gang on 28 April 2017. The 34-year-old was attacked with a sword and a hammer outside the home he shared with his mother in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. He told jurors: ""It felt like death was coming."" His mum Geraldine, 61, was so affected by what happened that she suffered a heart attack in the street. Mr Fitzsimmons told jurors he had ""no enemies"" but jurors heard his older brother Martyn had once been charged with shooting Ross Monaghan, the man cleared of murdering Carroll outside Asda. Last year soldier turned gun-runner Martyn was jailed for 10-and-a-half years after admitting having a Glock and ammunition, and hiding Â£36,000 of crime cash. He was part of a nine-man crime gang - described asScotland's most dangerous- jailed for 87 years after Operation Escalade, a massive probe into violence, drugs and firearms offences. A machete was found in the back of the burnt-out car Lord Mullholland described Ryan Fitzsimmons as ""a hard-working man living peacefully with his mother"". He said: ""As a result of the extensive injuries sustained during the attack upon him he has had to give up work and is dependent on his mother for his care and support. The need for care and support will persist for the rest of his life."" Lord Mulholland said Steven Daniel had told the trial that he was not aware of a feud between the Lyons and Daniel families. ""I did not believe a word and, more importantly, neither did the jury,"" he said. The judge said the ""sophisticated"" murder plot had involved high-tech tracker devices and encrypted mobile phones. But he told the six men: ""You were caught by good, old-fashioned detective work, identifying DNA on a tracker - and everything followed from there."" Det Insp Jim Bradley described the level of violence as ""horrific"" Det Inp Jim Bradley said it was a ""miracle"" that no one died. ""It's been documented in the trial that if it hadn't been for medical intervention and the expertise of medical staff that a couple of our victims would have died,"" he said. ""The level of violence in such a planned and premeditated manner was horrific. ""There's no other word for it - just totally horrific."" He added that there had been repeated attempts to ""calm things down"" and stop the violence. ""Hopefully this will be a deterrent to anybody that's going to involve themselves in this kind of activity,"" he said. ""There's no winners in this type of crime.""

Sweden to give decision on Assange case,"Assange was arrested in London last month after Ecuador abruptly withdrew its protection Swedish prosecutors are set to announce whether they are reopening an inquiry into a rape allegation against Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange. The investigation may be revived at the request of the alleged victim's lawyer. Assange, who denies the accusation, has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012. But the 47-year-old was evicted last month and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions. The US also wants to extradite Assange from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material in 2010. On Monday, Sweden's deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, will announce her decision on whether to revisit the sexual assault investigation after it was dropped two years ago. Swedish prosecutors said at the time they felt they were unable to take the case forward while Assange was inside the Ecuadorean embassy. However, the woman who made the allegation now wants the case reopened, and since Assange's arrest last month - Ecuador abruptly withdrew its protection and invited the police to arrest him - Swedish prosecutors have been considering their options. Under Swedish law, they have until next year to pursue the case. If they do re-open the investigation, it is likely to raise the question of which extradition request should take precedence: that of Sweden or the US. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline: Julian Assange saga How likely is an Assange conviction in US? Australian-born Assange facesa charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US,external. He is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a prison term of up to five years. This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? Afterhis dramatic arrest last month,he was taken to Westminster Magistrates' Court and found guilty of a British charge of breaching bail. He is currently being held at Belmarsh prison in London. The United Nations has called for his right to a fair trial to be respected during any extradition process. Assange was accused of rape and other sexual offences against two women following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual. He also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out. Prosecutors have been re-examining the rape case to decide whether to resume it before the statute of limitations expires in August 2020. The alleged victim's lawyer, Elizabeth Massi Fritz, said Assange's arrest came as a shock,externalbut ""what we have been waiting and hoping for since 2012 has now finally happened"". She said: ""No rape victim should have to wait nine years to see justice be served."" Lawyer Rebecca Niblock, who specialises in extradition cases, said decisions lie primarily with the courts and that only a judge can decide whether an extradition breaches an individual's human rights. The home secretary can consider a limited number of issues when deciding whether or not to order an extradition, including whether the person is at risk of the death penalty. However, if Sweden made an extradition request, Ms Niblock said it would be for the home secretary to decide which request would take precedence, considering factors such as the seriousness of the offence and which request was made first. Nick Vamos, former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service, said the UK proceedings should not take more than 18 months. Considering Assange's potential objections to extradition, Mr Vamos said that he did not think courts would accept the US case was politically motivated. But he said Assange may be able to argue that his likely treatment in the US prison system would breach his human rights and that could not receive a fair trial due to his notoriety and links to political scandals.

Breaking|Breaking newsSweden reopens Assange rape inquirySwedish prosecutors reopen inquiry into a rape allegation made against Wikileaks co-founder Julian AssangeEurope,"This video can not be played A Swedish prosecutor announces that the case has been reopened Swedish prosecutors have reopened an investigation into a rape allegation made against Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange in 2010. The inquiry has been revived at the request of the alleged victim's lawyer. Assange, who denies the accusation, has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012. The 47-year-old was evicted last month and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions. He is currently being held at Belmarsh prison in London. Swedish prosecutors originally decided to drop the rape investigation two years ago, saying they felt unable to take the case forward while Assange remained holed up inside the embassy. But on Monday, Sweden's deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, announced the case would be reopened because there was still ""probable cause to suspect"" that Assange had committed the alleged rape. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline of saga ""Now that he has left Ecuador's embassy, the conditions in the case have changed and... the conditions are in place once again to pursue the case,"" she said at a news conference, adding that a European Arrest Warrant would now be issued. This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? His removal from the embassy, and the subsequent decision to reopen the inquiry, is likely to raise the question of which extradition request should take precedence: that of Sweden or the US. The US is seeking Assange's extradition from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material by Wikileaks in 2010. Australian-born Assange facesa charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US,external. He is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a prison term of up to five years. How likely is an Assange conviction in US? Sweden's original extradition request was made under the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) arrangements. However, it was withdrawn and so the extradition request from the US now ranks first in line. In order to displace it, Sweden's deputy director of public prosecutions said a fresh EAW request would now be issued. If that does happen the decision as to which of the two requests take precedence will be made by UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid. He would make his decision primarily on the basis of which alleged offence was considered to be more serious. Rape is likely to be considered more serious than conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. That would mean ordering Assange's extradition to Sweden. Assange challenged the original Swedish request through the UK courts and could bring fresh challenges in response to a new request. These would most likely be based on human rights grounds and in particular that it would be unjust or oppressive in light of his health to extradite him. Wikileaks said the reopening of the rape case would give Assange ""a chance to clear his name"". ""There has been considerable political pressure on Sweden to reopen their investigation, but there has always been political pressure surrounding this case,"" its editor-in-chief, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in a statement. A lawyer for Assange told Swedish broadcaster SVT that the decision was ""embarrassing for Sweden"", adding that his client wanted to resolve the case but feared being extradited to the US. This video can not be played Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London At a separate news conference, the alleged victim's lawyer, Elisabeth Massi Fritz, said the decision to reopen the case had been ""very gratifying"" and that she expected this would result in a criminal charge.

Considering Assange's potential objections to extradition, Mr Vamos said he did not think courts would accept the US case was politically motivated.

Baker back on stage after Twitter row,"The former BBC 5 Live presenter was accused of mocking the Duchess of Sussex's racial heritage Broadcaster Danny Baker has performed his first live show since a tweet which led to accusations of racism and him being sacked by the BBC. He addressed ""the elephant in the room"" at the start, describing his tweet about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's baby as ""revolting"" and ""misjudged"". However, he again denied being racist. The show at Nottingham's Theatre Royal ended with a standing ovation and Baker describing it as ""one of the greatest nights of my career"". He had invited anyone who wanted to heckle to do so at the start of the show, but none could be heard.

Ã¢ÂÂA title triumph as much about grit as qualityÃ¢ÂÂ,"Manchester City are the first side to retain the title since Manchester United in 2008-09 Manchester City let Liverpool dream for 83 seconds before slamming the door shut on any possibility that the last day of the Premier League season would provide one final dramatic twist in the tale. This was the time it took for Sergio Aguero to put Manchester City level after Glenn Murray had stunned the visiting fans basking in glorious Sussex sunshine in Brighton's Amex Stadium. And for the moment to arrive when this compelling battle for the title finally swung decisively in City's favour. Manchester City had been sleepwalking into trouble. It had arrived. Liverpool's lead over Wolves at Anfield already had them on top of the time-honoured 'as it stands' table and now City had an added obstacle to overcome. The team Pep Guardiola has built is too strong, mentally and when measured in talent, and had come too far to be denied so close to the finishing line - and so it proved. Murray's moment actually turned out to be the shock to the system they required - the push towards glory they needed. And yet, for those few seconds, Manchester City supporters were silent. Manchester City's players stood still, shocked. They feared the worst. They, rather like those who had travelled to watch them, were lethargic, lacking in urgency and suddenly left facing the nightmare. Balague on the unseen moments behind triumph My toughest title yet - Guardiola City come from behind to beat Brighton and retain title How those 83 seconds must have dragged for those thousands, for Manchester City's players and for manager Guardiola who instantly cast aside his trademark grey cardigan. Superstition? The soaring temperatures? Or simply the stress of the possibility that this thrilling story was to have the most painful of conclusions for the Catalan? Brighton's supporters, with Premier League status safely assured, revelled in City's brief suffering. It may have only been 83 seconds but that is time enough for the worst-case scenario to form even in minds now so accustomed to victory and success. It was the first time they had trailed in the Premier League since they lost at Newcastle United on 29 January, their last league defeat. And then, as he has done so famously before against Queen's Park Rangers in 2012 to win the title, Manchester City's greatest goalscorer Aguero made a defining final day contribution, pouncing with an angled finish to change the mood, the mindset and most significantly the destiny of the Premier League title. Sergio Aguero scored 21 Premier League goals this season - one short of golden boot winners Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Yes, Guardiola's side still needed to score again to secure the victory they required to finally keep Liverpool at bay - but there was a sense of the inevitable once Aguero proved once more he is Manchester City's man for all occasions. Aymeric Laporte, Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan delivered the final blows in a title battle with Liverpool that has turned into a season-long face-off between two teams - and two managers in Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp - of the highest calibre. It was a tightrope walk for less than two minutes but City kept their balance and eventually strolled imperiously to the three points that continues their domestic supremacy. Manchester City can now add the Premier League to the League Cup. The prospect of an unprecedented domestic treble is on the table when they face Watford in the FA Cup Final at Wembley on Saturday, 18 May. The Premier League table tells the story and for all Liverpool's brilliance they came up against a team that proved to be one point better than them. It was a suitably miniscule measure of victory after a campaign settled on thefinest margins, from the 11.7mm separating John Stones from an own goal against Klopp's side in January to the 29.51mm that ensured Aguero scored the winning goal at Burnley to put City back on top with two games left. Manchester City went into the history books by racking up 100 points to win the title last season, but when the celebrations died down and they made their way back north to Etihad Stadium for their title celebration on Sunday night this may have proved to be an even sweeter, more satisfying triumph. The statistics build a monument to Manchester City's brilliance over these two stellar, title-winning seasons. In the last two campaigns they have amassed 198 points, scoring 201 goals. This was their 14th straight victory and their 32nd this season, equalling their own record set last season. City were the first since Manchester United a decade ago to retain their crown and they did it without the comfort blanket they made for themselves last season. This was a dogfight as Liverpool and Klopp tracked them every inch of the way only to end the smallest step behind. Rejuvenated and reconnected - the silver lining for Liverpool Special season only first step - Klopp Manchester City are decorated in compliments about their style, elegance and creation - and yet this title triumph was the result of players with abundant natural gifts mining every facet of their character and quality. Liverpool's relentless pursuit forced City into a sudden death quest to retain their title where they could not afford to blink in their last 14 games as they assembled a remarkable sequence of success to retain their crown. If City had slipped in just one of those games, the title would have gone to Anfield. It was a remarkable run to claim the prize. Klopp's Liverpool were on their shoulder or ahead of them in a call-and-response race to the tape, which finally came into view for Guardiola and his players here in the Sussex sunshine. When the challenge of Murray's goal was thrown down, City answered it in emphatic, ruthless fashion. This video can not be played Brighton 1-4 Manchester City: Pep Guardiola 'so happy' with back-to-back titles When City went out of the Champions League quarter-final to Tottenham in agonising fashion, it was a shattering blow. The questions were posed. How will they react? How will it hit Manchester City mentally and physically? Will it derail their title challenge? The answer - they locked down even more. City ground out 1-0 wins against Spurs, Burnley and Leicester City and brushed aside Manchester United. Not many marks for artistic merit but maximum for the fortitude of champions. It says much about Liverpool that they assembled 97 points and lost only once in a season which, in every other year, would have ensured their first title since 1990. It says even more about Manchester City that they demonstrated the concrete-clad mentality and quality to ensure Liverpool finished second. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has now won four Premier League titles Guardiola's City have shown that artistry alone does not make champions. It must be bolted on to heart, character and a refusal to yield even in the face of opponents as outstanding and enduring as Liverpool. The 3ft 5in Premier League trophy hoisted high by Vincent Kompany has been dwarfed by the scale and quality of this title pursuit as Guardiola and Klopp traded blows before City delivered the coup de grace at The Amex Stadium. Manchester City have responded when the stakes and jeopardy were at their highest, particularly when they faced Liverpool at Etihad Stadium on 3 January. Liverpool knew victory would put them 10 points clear, a gap that would have surely been insurmountable. Guardiola knew defeat for City would be decisive and they secureda 2-1 victorythat became their most important of the campaign. It kept them in a race they would eventually win. City's title triumph is also of huge significance psychologically, both now and in the future. They will surely feel as if a layer of invincibility has been added to their armoury. If they have survived this sustained season-long assault Liverpool have mounted on them and prevailed, City will feel they can come out winners in any domestic circumstances. And Liverpool, whose season has been almost flawless, could be forgiven for feeling that if 97 points cannot navigate them around Manchester City, what must they do to end that 29-year wait for the trophy they crave most of all? Raheem Sterling scored 17 goals and had 10 assists this season City are built on the old reliables such as Kompany, Aguero and David Silva, but this season the full bloom of Raheem Sterling has provided an added dimension to a star-studded squad. Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson and the flawless Laporte have made key contributions and it is a title win brought back home without the services of arguably their finest player, the Belgian Kevin de Bruyne, for long periods when he suffered so many injury problems. The gifted teenager Phil Foden, a key component of City's future, made his mark with the vital winner against Spurs at Etihad Stadium. Liverpool are not going away under Klopp but City may still feel they have just seen off as big a challenge to their supremacy on home soil that they will face. This has been a golden season in the Premier League as the lead changed hands 32 times before the final day, but in the end continuity was the order of the day as the champions put back-to-back triumphs in the record books. The Premier League has provided a special season. Manchester City have proved, by leaving Liverpool in second place, that they are a very special team.

"Walkers in access row with aristocratLord Lovat is accused of blocking off car parking areas near his Beauly home and leaving ""unofficial"" parking tickets on cars.Highlands & Islands","Traffic cones and rocks have been used to discourage parking A Scottish aristocrat has been accused of making ""strenuous efforts"" to stop people from using a popular riverside walk near his Highlands home. Lord Lovat, Simon Fraser, has blocked off car parking areas at Lovat Bridge near Beauly, making the walking route inaccessible for many people. ""Unofficial"" parking tickets have also been left on cars parked in the area. A spokesman for Lovat estates said it welcomed walkers but asked that they used public parking. Rocks and traffic cones have been used to block lay-bys and other areas used for parking, local residents have said. Lord Lovat recently returned to live in his ancestral lands but has upset local people by the moves. Walkers say he has removed a well-used car park and blocked up other areas. A walking group for older people and families with young children are among those affected. Lord Lovat's estate has asked that people use public parking and not park on a private road Liz Hoey, a local resident who has been walking in the area for the past 20 years, said she had enjoyed the previous ease access to her walk because of arthritis. She told BBC Scotland: ""They want you to park in Beauly but that would add on so much of a walk and it's a single track pavement with big lorries rushing past. ""This pavement is not good for either dog walkers or small children. A lot of people I know that used to walk there just can't now, including a friend who leads the Beauly Walking Group which is a walking group for older people who are trying to exercise to keep healthy and they can't park anywhere near. ""I'm very disappointed about the whole thing because it's a beautiful walk that people have used for years."" A spokesman for Lovat Estates said: ""We are asking people not to park down a private road, they are very welcome to walk, as is their right."" He said this was because the estate had to pay for the maintenance and upkeep costs of the road which were ""considerable"". The spokesman also said a number of verges were being ruined by cars parking on them and cars were blocking access for the estate's farm vehicles. Local people say they previously had unrestricted access to the riverside walk However, he said the estate had made improvements to benefit walkers, including installing a fence alongside a core path to help walkers who were worried about walking through livestock and by replacing dead and dying trees. A Highland Council spokesperson said: ""The River Beauly - Lovat Circuit is not on the Catalogue of Rights of Way maintained by Scotways, no-one has provided the council with evidence that any of it is a public right of way and, as a circuit, it is unlikely to meet the requirements of a public right of way. The council has received several complaints about it. ""The complaints have been about the diversion of the path by the river; and the closure of a car park near the Dutch Barn at the junction of the A862 and A831 (notices being placed on cars and walkers being approached while out walking)."" Davie Black, access officer at Mountaineering Scotland, which represents the interests of outdoor pursuits enthusiasts including walkers, said Scotland had some of the best land access legislation. But he said car parking was not protected under the Land Reform Act. He told BBC Radio Scotland's John Beattie programme: ""Where you don't have a right of vehicular access this is where we come into a problematic area. ""Where do you put your cars when you want to take to the hills?"" Highland Council said the River Beauly was not on the Catalogue of Rights of Way Snow warning extended following widespread disruption Electric heater deals: These Dreo space heaters are heavily discounted Missing manâs family fear deep freeze could kill him Live updates: Weather warning extended as temperatures set to plummet Highland school and nursery closures after heavy snow leave over 20,000 youngsters at home Wick festive lighting volunteers âhave got to be commendedâ Wick festive lighting volunteers âhave got to be commendedâ Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

PM to end domestic abuse 'postcode lottery'Theresa May wants to ensure support for people fleeing abuse is the same wherever they are.UK,"At present, support for victims in England varies depending on the area Councils in England will have a legal duty to provide secure homes for victims of domestic abuse under new plans announced by Theresa May. People seeking refuge from abuse and violence can receive varying levels of support depending on their location. But Mrs May has vowed to end the ""postcode lottery"" for victims and their children, creating a legal duty for councils to provide refuge. One victim described the move as ""absolutely momentous"" news. Charlotte Kneer, who stayed in a refuge herself and now runs one in Surrey, told the BBC she cried when she heard the news. Having a refuge space can be ""life-saving"" - but some women cannot get one, because local authorities' budgets have been ""squeezed"", she said. ""This is something Women's Aid and lots of other campaigners have been asking for, for years and years,"" she added. 'I was raped' by police officer ex-husband New app secretly tracks domestic abuse The prime minister said the ""abhorrent crime"" had ""no place"" in the UK. In a message to victims, she added: ""Whoever you are, wherever you live and whatever the abuse you face, you will have access to the services you need to be safe."" The prime minister spoke to a case worker and domestic violence survivor at a London centre on Monday Mrs May's new plans are backed by funding. Â The prime minister visited a London charity that helps women and children who have survived domestic abuse on Monday and said she hoped the bill would be of ""real benefit"" to people. One woman told her that her support for the issue ""makes a world of difference"". But while charities and councils say the government's moves are positive, they want to know how much money will be provided in the face of cuts to local authority budgets. The Domestic Abuse Bill will also introduce the first ever statutory government definition of domestic abuse to specifically include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical abuse. The legislation will establish a new Domestic Abuse Commissioner and prohibit the cross-examination of victims by their abusers in family courts. This video can not be played Charlotte Kneer on why the plan is important Ms Kneer, who runs Reigate and Banstead Women's Aid, said having a safe place to go is a human right, adding: ""For me and many other women, having a refuge is literally life-saving."" She added people fleeing domestic abuse had to seek refuge in a place outside their hometown, to avoid seeing their attacker or their acquaintances. Because they weren't services for local people, refuges had often been ""easy cuts"" for local authorities to make. ""Hopefully this is the start of securing the future for refuges,"" she said. Diana James is optimistic about the plans - but has concerns about how they will be implemented Diana James, a domestic abuse survivor who works with refuge services in south-west England, said she was ""optimistic"" about the plans but concerned about how it would be put into practice, particularly for LGBT people. ""Some refuges accept LGBT people, others say they do but filter them out, and some just don't,"" she said. ""This is a step forward, but it's about the implementation. ""I hope [the government's] heart is in the right place and that they want to make this work."" Nicki Norman, acting co-chief executive of Women's Aid, said many of her organisation's member services were providing support on a ""shoestring budget"", so a move to consistent, dedicated funding was ""desperately needed"". ""We look forward to working with the government to ensure that this important move to fund refuges is safe, sustainable and delivers the resources that services urgently require to support all women and children fleeing domestic abuse,"" she said. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, also welcomed Mrs May's announcement, which she said could secure ""life-saving services"". ""This has the potential to end the postcode lottery for refuge places and could put these life-saving services on a secure financial footing for the first time,"" Ms Horley said. Ministers have launched a consultation to determine how much funding is needed and where it should go by talking to victims and survivors, as well as organisations supporting victims and their children every day. Funding totalling Â£22m has already been made available to local authorities toÂ buy more than 2,000 beds in refuges and other safe accommodation - and to provide access to education and employment. Local government secretary James Brokenshire said it was estimated an extra Â£90m a year would be needed for local authorities to provide accommodation for victims. The details on funding would be settled through the Spending Review process, he added. Councillor Simon Blackburn of the Local Government Association welcomed extra support but said councils could not tackle the issue alone. ""Our ambition must be to reduce the number of victims, with greater investment in early intervention and prevention schemes that helps stop domestic abuse occurring in the first place,"" he said. The plans only apply to England and not councils in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, which do not currently have directly comparable systems in place.

Economy 'weakened in past three months'Ulster Bank says the first quarter had the sharpest fall in business activity since the end of 2012.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played ""Retail performed particularly badly,"" says BBC News NI's John Campbell Northern Ireland's economy appears to have weakened significantly over the past three months, research from Ulster Bank has suggested. The bank conducts a monthly survey of private sector activity in what is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. April saw a contraction in new orders, exports, employment and overall output. That follows a fall in output in March and a weakening employment performance since the start of the year. Manufacturing decline weakens economy Economy 'set for two-year dip' Richard Ramsey, the bank's chief economist, said it was the sharpest fall in business activity since the end of 2012. ""April saw an improvement in business conditions across most of the UK regions,"" he said. ""However, Northern Ireland was a notable exception to this trend. ""Rather than improving, the pace of contraction across a range of indicators accelerated."" He added that Brexit and the lack of a Northern Ireland Executive continued to be cited as factors negatively affecting business. Richard Ramsey said it was the sharpest fall in business activity since the end of 2012 As in March, manufacturing was the only sector to record an expansion in output. By contrast, the data for retail sales was the worst in almost seven years. Mr Ramsey said that the survey should not be interpreted as a clear sign of the beginning of a downturn as Brexit factors could be responsible for volatility in some company performances. By John Campbell, BBC News NI Economics and Business Editor A modern economy is a complex, dynamic system - changes are rarely about one factor. However, it is clear that Brexit is having an impact in some areas - particularly business investment. But there are other forces shaping our economy - for example, retailing is in the throes of technologically-driven change, which has nothing to do with Brexit. Official data for the whole of the UK, published last week, suggestedthe economy picked up in the first three months of the yearafter manufacturers' stockpiling ahead of Brexit helped to boost growth. Growth was 0.5% in the quarter, up from 0.2% in the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The manufacturing sector grew at its fastest rate since 1988 in the period. The ONS said this was driven by manufacturers rushing to deliver orders beforethe original Brexit deadline of 29 March. Pharmaceuticals was one of the sectors most affected, expanding 9.4% between January and March. Previous business surveys had shown manufacturers stockpiling goods for Brexit in case the UK left the EU without a transition deal, which they feared could lead to delays at UK borders.

âA title triumph as much about grit as qualityâ,"Manchester City are the first side to retain the title since Manchester United in 2008-09 Manchester City let Liverpool dream for 83 seconds before slamming the door shut on any possibility that the last day of the Premier League season would provide one final dramatic twist in the tale. This was the time it took for Sergio Aguero to put Manchester City level after Glenn Murray had stunned the visiting fans basking in glorious Sussex sunshine in Brighton's Amex Stadium. And for the moment to arrive when this compelling battle for the title finally swung decisively in City's favour. Manchester City had been sleepwalking into trouble. It had arrived. Liverpool's lead over Wolves at Anfield already had them on top of the time-honoured 'as it stands' table and now City had an added obstacle to overcome. The team Pep Guardiola has built is too strong, mentally and when measured in talent, and had come too far to be denied so close to the finishing line - and so it proved. Murray's moment actually turned out to be the shock to the system they required - the push towards glory they needed. And yet, for those few seconds, Manchester City supporters were silent. Manchester City's players stood still, shocked. They feared the worst. They, rather like those who had travelled to watch them, were lethargic, lacking in urgency and suddenly left facing the nightmare. Balague on the unseen moments behind triumph My toughest title yet - Guardiola City come from behind to beat Brighton and retain title How those 83 seconds must have dragged for those thousands, for Manchester City's players and for manager Guardiola who instantly cast aside his trademark grey cardigan. Superstition? The soaring temperatures? Or simply the stress of the possibility that this thrilling story was to have the most painful of conclusions for the Catalan? Brighton's supporters, with Premier League status safely assured, revelled in City's brief suffering. It may have only been 83 seconds but that is time enough for the worst-case scenario to form even in minds now so accustomed to victory and success. It was the first time they had trailed in the Premier League since they lost at Newcastle United on 29 January, their last league defeat. And then, as he has done so famously before against Queen's Park Rangers in 2012 to win the title, Manchester City's greatest goalscorer Aguero made a defining final day contribution, pouncing with an angled finish to change the mood, the mindset and most significantly the destiny of the Premier League title. Sergio Aguero scored 21 Premier League goals this season - one short of golden boot winners Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Yes, Guardiola's side still needed to score again to secure the victory they required to finally keep Liverpool at bay - but there was a sense of the inevitable once Aguero proved once more he is Manchester City's man for all occasions. Aymeric Laporte, Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan delivered the final blows in a title battle with Liverpool that has turned into a season-long face-off between two teams - and two managers in Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp - of the highest calibre. It was a tightrope walk for less than two minutes but City kept their balance and eventually strolled imperiously to the three points that continues their domestic supremacy. Manchester City can now add the Premier League to the League Cup. The prospect of an unprecedented domestic treble is on the table when they face Watford in the FA Cup Final at Wembley on Saturday, 18 May. The Premier League table tells the story and for all Liverpool's brilliance they came up against a team that proved to be one point better than them. It was a suitably miniscule measure of victory after a campaign settled on thefinest margins, from the 11.7mm separating John Stones from an own goal against Klopp's side in January to the 29.51mm that ensured Aguero scored the winning goal at Burnley to put City back on top with two games left. Manchester City went into the history books by racking up 100 points to win the title last season, but when the celebrations died down and they made their way back north to Etihad Stadium for their title celebration on Sunday night this may have proved to be an even sweeter, more satisfying triumph. The statistics build a monument to Manchester City's brilliance over these two stellar, title-winning seasons. In the last two campaigns they have amassed 198 points, scoring 201 goals. This was their 14th straight victory and their 32nd this season, equalling their own record set last season. City were the first since Manchester United a decade ago to retain their crown and they did it without the comfort blanket they made for themselves last season. This was a dogfight as Liverpool and Klopp tracked them every inch of the way only to end the smallest step behind. Rejuvenated and reconnected - the silver lining for Liverpool Special season only first step - Klopp Manchester City are decorated in compliments about their style, elegance and creation - and yet this title triumph was the result of players with abundant natural gifts mining every facet of their character and quality. Liverpool's relentless pursuit forced City into a sudden death quest to retain their title where they could not afford to blink in their last 14 games as they assembled a remarkable sequence of success to retain their crown. If City had slipped in just one of those games, the title would have gone to Anfield. It was a remarkable run to claim the prize. Klopp's Liverpool were on their shoulder or ahead of them in a call-and-response race to the tape, which finally came into view for Guardiola and his players here in the Sussex sunshine. When the challenge of Murray's goal was thrown down, City answered it in emphatic, ruthless fashion. This video can not be played Brighton 1-4 Manchester City: Pep Guardiola 'so happy' with back-to-back titles When City went out of the Champions League quarter-final to Tottenham in agonising fashion, it was a shattering blow. The questions were posed. How will they react? How will it hit Manchester City mentally and physically? Will it derail their title challenge? The answer - they locked down even more. City ground out 1-0 wins against Spurs, Burnley and Leicester City and brushed aside Manchester United. Not many marks for artistic merit but maximum for the fortitude of champions. It says much about Liverpool that they assembled 97 points and lost only once in a season which, in every other year, would have ensured their first title since 1990. It says even more about Manchester City that they demonstrated the concrete-clad mentality and quality to ensure Liverpool finished second. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has now won four Premier League titles Guardiola's City have shown that artistry alone does not make champions. It must be bolted on to heart, character and a refusal to yield even in the face of opponents as outstanding and enduring as Liverpool. The 3ft 5in Premier League trophy hoisted high by Vincent Kompany has been dwarfed by the scale and quality of this title pursuit as Guardiola and Klopp traded blows before City delivered the coup de grace at The Amex Stadium. Manchester City have responded when the stakes and jeopardy were at their highest, particularly when they faced Liverpool at Etihad Stadium on 3 January. Liverpool knew victory would put them 10 points clear, a gap that would have surely been insurmountable. Guardiola knew defeat for City would be decisive and they secureda 2-1 victorythat became their most important of the campaign. It kept them in a race they would eventually win. City's title triumph is also of huge significance psychologically, both now and in the future. They will surely feel as if a layer of invincibility has been added to their armoury. If they have survived this sustained season-long assault Liverpool have mounted on them and prevailed, City will feel they can come out winners in any domestic circumstances. And Liverpool, whose season has been almost flawless, could be forgiven for feeling that if 97 points cannot navigate them around Manchester City, what must they do to end that 29-year wait for the trophy they crave most of all? Raheem Sterling scored 17 goals and had 10 assists this season City are built on the old reliables such as Kompany, Aguero and David Silva, but this season the full bloom of Raheem Sterling has provided an added dimension to a star-studded squad. Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson and the flawless Laporte have made key contributions and it is a title win brought back home without the services of arguably their finest player, the Belgian Kevin de Bruyne, for long periods when he suffered so many injury problems. The gifted teenager Phil Foden, a key component of City's future, made his mark with the vital winner against Spurs at Etihad Stadium. Liverpool are not going away under Klopp but City may still feel they have just seen off as big a challenge to their supremacy on home soil that they will face. This has been a golden season in the Premier League as the lead changed hands 32 times before the final day, but in the end continuity was the order of the day as the champions put back-to-back triumphs in the record books. The Premier League has provided a special season. Manchester City have proved, by leaving Liverpool in second place, that they are a very special team.

Puppy farm ban set to be confirmedNew legislation - known as Lucy's Law - will ban the sale of kittens and puppies from third partiesUK,"A new law aimed at cracking down on so-called puppy farms in England is being presented to Parliament on Monday. Known as Lucy's Law, it will ban the sale of kittens and puppies from third parties from spring 2020, making buyers deal with breeders directly. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the new rules would give animals ""the best possible start in life"". The RSPCA said it was ""absolutely thrilled"" with the legislation - but stressed it required enforcement. 'Dad said we were going to a dentist, but never came back' The meaning behind Archie and Harrison Gaga's billowing gown unravels at Met Gala The new law would require animals to be born and reared in a safe environment, with their mother, and to be sold from their place of birth. The rules, which will apply to England, are also designed to deter smugglers who abuse the Pet Travel Scheme to bring young animals into the UK to be sold. Named after Lucy, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who died in 2016 after being poorly treated on a puppy farm, the ban is scheduled to come into force on 6 April next year, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.

But Paula Boyden, veterinary director at Dogs Trust, the UK's largest dog welfare charity, urged the government to go further. She said: ""We would like to see additional measures introduced to ensure the ban is as robust as possible. ""There is time before April 2020 for the government to consider regulation of re-homing organisations and sanctuaries, ensure full traceability of all puppies sold, and strengthening of the pet travel scheme.""

"Trump defiant over China tariff hikeMr Trump's comments come after his top economic adviser said ""both sides will suffer"" from tariff hikes.Business","US President Donald Trump has denied that US consumers will pay for higher tariffs on Chinese imports and has warned China not to follow suit. The US more than doubled tariffs on $200bn (Â£153.7bn) of Chinese goods on Friday, in a sharp escalation of their trade war. But in a series of tweets, Mr Trump said China had ""taken so advantage of the US for so many years"". ""Therefore, China should not retaliate - will only get worse!"" he added. Mr Trump said US consumers could avoid the tariffs by buying the same products from other sources. ""Many tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That's why China wants to make a deal so badly!"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Mr Kudlow admitted that it was American businesses that paid the tariffs on any goods brought in from China, and that US consumers would also foot the bill if firms passed on the cost increase. Mr Kudlow said he thought the tariffs would also have an impact on China's economy, as the higher cost would reduce US demand for Chinese goods. On Friday, the US increased a 10% tariff on $200bn worth of Chinese goods - including fish, handbags, clothing and footwear - to 25%. TheOffice of the United States Trade Representative,externalhas also said it has been ordered to ""begin the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from China, which are valued at approximately $300 billion"". China has said it will retaliate but has not announced any details, including when it would take action. What you asked about US-China trade The US-China trade war in charts The next US-China battleground US-China trade war in 300 words The higher tariffs will be paid by American companies importing goods from China. Economists have said a 25% tariff will be much harder for businesses to absorb than 10%, which means they are more likely to pass on some of the cost to consumers. Asked in an interview with Fox News Sunday whether it was correct to say that it was US businesses and US consumers who pay for the tariff, Mr Kudlow said: ""Yes, to some extent. I don't disagree with that."" ""Both sides will suffer on this."" Mr Kudlow also said there was a ""strong possibility"" that Mr Trump would meet China's President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit in Japan in late June. China said on Friday it ""deeply regrets"" the US decision to hike tariffs and that it will have to retaliate with the ""necessary countermeasures."" In the past, the Chinese have introduced retaliatory tariffs almost immediately after US tariffs have gone into force. China has responded saying it will not swallow any ""bitter fruit"". The commentary is due for publication on Monday in the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily. The US argues that China's trade surplus with the US is the result of unfair practices, including state support for domestic companies.

Labour 'must back second vote',"Labour must promise another Brexit referendum to counter the electoral challenge posed by Nigel Farage, the party's deputy leader has said. Writing in the Observer,external, Tom Watson said his party could not ""sit on the fence"" about the biggest issue to face the UK for a generation. But ex-UKIP leader Mr Farage said a new referendum would be ""a total insult"" to five million Labour Leave voters. The UK has been givenan extension to the Brexit processuntil 31 October. This means the UK is likely to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May. Mr Farage launched his new Brexit Party last weekand said it had a list of 70 candidates to fight the May elections. Will Labour push for a public vote? How UK is gearing up for European elections Mr Watson warned that Labour would not defeat Mr Farage ""by being mealy-mouthed and sounding as if we half agree with him"". ""We won't beat him unless we can inspire the millions crying out for a different direction,"" he added. He said a ""confirmatory"" referendum and ""final say"" on any deal was ""the very least"" voters deserved, now they knew more about what Brexit would mean. He added: ""They deserve a Labour Party that offers clarity on this issue, as well as the radical vision for a new political economy achieved by working with our socialist allies inside the EU. ""And, above all, they deserve better than Nigel Farage's promise of a far-right Brexit that would solve nothing."" However, Mr Farage accused Mr Watson of breaking promises to the British people and said he intended to ""wholeheartedly target Labour lies and dishonesty in the weeks ahead"". Talks with the Conservatives aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock have re-opened Labour's divisions over a possible further referendum. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry wrote to cabinet colleaguesto warn that striking a deal with the prime minister that ditched the commitment to a public vote would breach party policy. A survey earlier this year found that 70% of Labour members support another referendum, but nine of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's top team are sceptical or opposed. Nigel Farage described 23 May as the ""first step"" for his party Mr Farage's Brexit Party also poses a threat to the Conservative Party,according to a survey for the Mail on Sunday,external. The Survation poll of 781 Conservative councillors found that 40% were planning to back the Brexit Party at the May European elections. Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit? Brexit: A really simple guide Just over half - 52% - said they would vote for their own party. If Brexiteer Boris Johnson was prime minister this figure would rise to 65%, the survey found. Some 15% said they believed Mr Farage would be the best leader of the Conservative Party - only Mr Johnson was ahead of him, on 19%. By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent Nigel Farage relishes the opportunity to put a cat among the pigeons - and once again the two biggest parties are questioning how to deal with his unambiguous pro-Brexit message. Tom Watson's case is that Labour needs to be different. He's not impressed with the idea of ""sounding as if we half agree"" with Mr Farage, urging his party to strengthen its message on another referendum and provide a natural home to those on the other side of the Brexit debate. The problem is that some in the Labour completely disagree. They think it would an historic mistake to ignore Labour voters who backed Leave in 2016 and believe it may actually encourage those voters to side with Mr Farage. The Conservatives are grappling with how to fight the European elections too. Today'spoll in the Mail on Sunday,externalsuggests some Conservative councillors are prepared to turn their back on the party - at least temporarily - and support Mr Farage. That will only feed into fears in the Tory leadership that these elections could be a disaster for the party - and strengthen resolve to try to stop them happening by getting a deal through Parliament. The picture isn't the same everywhere. In Scotland, for example, the pro-referendum SNP appear to be maintaining strong support. But Mr Farage will continue to argue that the main parties have failed to honour the referendum result. And his allies suspect that message will prove a powerful one for Brexit supporters if the European Parliament elections go ahead. Although Theresa May has said she still wants the UK to leave the EU as soon as possible, she is yet to get her withdrawal deal  - which has been rejected three times by MPs - approved by Parliament. Cross-party talks between the government and the Labour Party are continuing, to find a way through the impasse. Labour wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, which would allow tariff-free trade in goods. The government has repeatedly ruled out remaining in the EU's customs union, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. The EU has said the UK must hold elections to the European Parliament in May or leave on 1 June without a deal.

Baker gets ovation on stage return,"The former BBC 5 Live presenter was accused of mocking the Duchess of Sussex's racial heritage Broadcaster Danny Baker has performed his first live show since a tweet which led to accusations of racism and him being sacked by the BBC. He addressed ""the elephant in the room"" at the start, describing his tweet about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's baby as ""revolting"" and ""misjudged"". However, he again denied being racist. The show at Nottingham's Theatre Royal ended with a standing ovation and Baker describing it as ""one of the greatest nights of my career"". He had invited anyone who wanted to heckle to do so at the start of the show, but none could be heard. ""I genuinely didn't know what the atmosphere was going to be like tonight,"" the 61-year-old told the audience. ""You wouldn't believe how I was feeling 20 minutes ago but I'm so pleased so let's do this. ""When life deals you lemons, you chuck them at the people calling you a racist."" Baker fired over royal baby chimp tweet Baker 'so, so sorry' for 'disastrous' tweet Baker was sacked from presenting his Saturday morning show on BBC 5 Live last week after he was accused of mocking the duchess's racial heritage. His tweet showed an image of a couple holding hands with a chimpanzee dressed in clothes with the caption: ""Royal Baby leaves hospital"". He quickly deleted it and subsequently apologised but denied there was any racist intent behind it. Caroline Lowbridge, BBC News, Nottingham Theatre Royal The audience at the Theatre Royal was packed, despite some people admitting they had been in two minds about going. Simon Robinson, from Colston Bassett in Nottinghamshire, said: ""I think it [the tweet] was absolutely stupid and I have to say he went down in my estimation. ""I don't know why he did it. Whichever baby he did it to it's not a nice thing to do. I just didn't find it funny."" Steve Fletcher, from Nottingham, felt the photo was intended to be about ""the circus that follows around the royal family"". ""If you have followed anything about his career there probably isn't a racist bone in his body. It's just a mistake,"" he said. This video can not be played BBC ""right"" to sack Danny Baker over tweet says broadcaster Scarlette Douglas Baker told the audience the show would ""ironically"" be about the times his ""career ... had hit a brick wall"". ""Topically, here we are again,"" he said. Before leaving the stage, Baker said: ""I do want to say this and I'm not milking it but it's been one of the greatest nights of my career tonight, it really has. ""Nottingham, I love you. Thank you for coming out."" Reaction on social media was mixed, with some attendees praising the performance and others criticising it for going ahead. Allow Twitter content?

"Financial crisis 'scarred' younger workersPeople who began work between 2008 and 2011 have had lower pay and worse job prospects, says a report.Business","When Carole Farish left school 11 years ago, she thought it would be quite easy to find a job in retail or hospitality. But like many of her peer group, she found it was not so straightforward. Carole belongs to a generation that, according to a new report, has been ""left scarred"" by joining the workforce just as the financial crisis hit. The Resolution Foundation says this ""crisis cohort"" has suffered from lower pay and worse job prospects for up to a decade since the downturn. Carole's early optimism over job seeking faded when it took her five months just to get an interview, only to find she was competing against candidates with business degrees. ""It was a bit disheartening,"" she says. ""It took a lot of perseverance to keep applying. I didn't expect it to be as tough."" Since then, she has worked in a leisure centre, in catering and looking after children. Although she has in the meantime been to university, she is now working as a carer. Millennials 'wrongly relying on inheritance' How did the financial crisis affect your finances? Can't save money? Is this the answer? The Resolution Foundation says those who entered the world of work between 2008 and 2011 bore the brunt of the sharp economic decline, when compared to young people entering work before or after the downturn. ""Low-skilled workers faced a higher risk of unemployment, while graduates were more likely to trade down the types of jobs they did, with their pay and prospects stunted as a result,"" said Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation. ""These scarring effects have stayed with the crisis cohort for up to a decade, reducing their living standards at a time when they may be facing the additional financial strains of buying a home, or bringing up kids,"" he said. Policy makers should look at ways to mitigate the impact, he added. Although unemployment did not rise as sharply as in previous recessions, in 2012 it was still twice the rate for the population in general, the report says. Those who ""trade down"" to a low-paying occupation because they are struggling to find work rarely move into a higher-paying occupation, even after the economy has picked up, the report adds. The Department for Work and Pensions highlighted new jobcentre programmes which it said were examining ways to support people to change jobs and improve their pay and career progression. ""Employment is at a record high, with youth unemployment having halved since 2010. And we believe every worker should be in a job which reflects their skills and offers opportunities to progress,"" the DWP said. In 2018,analysis carried out for the BBCby the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) showed that people in their 30s were earning Â£2,100 a year less than people in the same age group in 2008.

PM to end domestic abuse 'postcode lottery'Theresa May wants to ensure support for people fleeing abuse is the same wherever they are in England.UK,"At present, support for victims in England varies depending on the area Councils in England will have a legal duty to provide secure homes for victims of domestic abuse under new plans announced by Theresa May. People seeking refuge from abuse and violence can receive varying levels of support depending on their location. But Mrs May has vowed to end the ""postcode lottery"" for victims and their children, creating a legal duty for councils to provide refuge. One victim described the move as ""absolutely momentous"" news. Charlotte Kneer, who stayed in a refuge herself and now runs one in Surrey, told the BBC she cried when she heard the news. Having a refuge space can be ""life-saving"" - but some women cannot get one, because local authorities' budgets have been ""squeezed"", she said. ""This is something Women's Aid and lots of other campaigners have been asking for, for years and years,"" she added. 'I was raped' by police officer ex-husband New app secretly tracks domestic abuse The prime minister said the ""abhorrent crime"" had ""no place"" in the UK. In a message to victims, she added: ""Whoever you are, wherever you live and whatever the abuse you face, you will have access to the services you need to be safe."" The prime minister spoke to a case worker and domestic violence survivor at a London centre on Monday Mrs May's new plans are backed by funding. Â The prime minister visited a London charity that helps women and children who have survived domestic abuse on Monday and said she hoped the bill would be of ""real benefit"" to people. One woman told her that her support for the issue ""makes a world of difference"". But while charities and councils say the government's moves are positive, they want to know how much money will be provided in the face of cuts to local authority budgets. The Domestic Abuse Bill will also introduce the first ever statutory government definition of domestic abuse to specifically include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical abuse. The legislation will establish a new Domestic Abuse Commissioner and prohibit the cross-examination of victims by their abusers in family courts. This video can not be played Charlotte Kneer on why the plan is important Ms Kneer, who runs Reigate and Banstead Women's Aid, said having a safe place to go is a human right, adding: ""For me and many other women, having a refuge is literally life-saving."" She added people fleeing domestic abuse had to seek refuge in a place outside their hometown, to avoid seeing their attacker or their acquaintances. Because they weren't services for local people, refuges had often been ""easy cuts"" for local authorities to make. ""Hopefully this is the start of securing the future for refuges,"" she said. Diana James is optimistic about the plans - but has concerns about how they will be implemented Diana James, a domestic abuse survivor who works with refuge services in south-west England, said she was ""optimistic"" about the plans but concerned about how it would be put into practice, particularly for LGBT people. ""Some refuges accept LGBT people, others say they do but filter them out, and some just don't,"" she said. ""This is a step forward, but it's about the implementation. ""I hope [the government's] heart is in the right place and that they want to make this work."" Nicki Norman, acting co-chief executive of Women's Aid, said many of her organisation's member services were providing support on a ""shoestring budget"", so a move to consistent, dedicated funding was ""desperately needed"". ""We look forward to working with the government to ensure that this important move to fund refuges is safe, sustainable and delivers the resources that services urgently require to support all women and children fleeing domestic abuse,"" she said. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, also welcomed Mrs May's announcement, which she said could secure ""life-saving services"". ""This has the potential to end the postcode lottery for refuge places and could put these life-saving services on a secure financial footing for the first time,"" Ms Horley said. Ministers have launched a consultation to determine how much funding is needed and where it should go by talking to victims and survivors, as well as organisations supporting victims and their children every day. Funding totalling Â£22m has already been made available to local authorities toÂ buy more than 2,000 beds in refuges and other safe accommodation - and to provide access to education and employment. Local government secretary James Brokenshire said it was estimated an extra Â£90m a year would be needed for local authorities to provide accommodation for victims. The details on funding would be settled through the Spending Review process, he added. Councillor Simon Blackburn of the Local Government Association welcomed extra support but said councils could not tackle the issue alone. ""Our ambition must be to reduce the number of victims, with greater investment in early intervention and prevention schemes that helps stop domestic abuse occurring in the first place,"" he said. The plans only apply to England and not councils in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, which do not currently have directly comparable systems in place.

Watson 'pleads' for European election votes,"This video can not be played Michael Gove resists calls to set a deadline for the talks A cross-party Brexit deal will not get through Parliament unless it is subject to a fresh public vote, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says. Talks between Labour and ministers over leaving the EU have been going on for a month with little sign of progress. Sir Keirtold the Guardian,externalthat without a new referendum up to 150 Labour MPs would vote against any agreement made. Environment Secretary Michael Gove suggested Labour needed more time to come to terms with the idea of a deal. ""For some in the Labour Party it will be a significant step to accept supporting Brexit and to come behind the prime minister's approach,"" he told the BBC. After talks broke up on Monday evening, a Labour spokesperson said the shadow cabinet would be updated on what had been discussed. The BBC's Iain Watson said: ""It sounds like the plug has not been pulled on these yet, but it doesn't sound as if there's substantial progress to report."" A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""In preparation for an update to cabinet tomorrow, today's meeting took stock across the range of issues discussed in talks over the last few weeks"". ""We continue to seek to agree a way forward in order to secure our orderly withdrawal from the EU."" The UK was due to leave the EU on 29 March but the deadline was pushed back to 31 October after MPs rejected Theresa May's proposed deal three times. Brexit: All you need to know What happens next? Fresh Brexit vote would put democracy at risk, says DUP's Foster Talks between the government and Labour aimed at finding a way to end the impasse resumed on Monday, with pressure growing on both sides to show progress or pull out.

No 10 said there was a ""clear desire"" to get on with the process. Asked if there was a deadline, a spokesman said: ""Let's see where we get to this evening."" If there is no agreement, Theresa May has said she will return to Parliament and ask MPs to vote again on a range of possible options. This video can not be played The deputy Labour leader urges voters to reject ""nationalism"" and ""populism"" in the EU elections Parliament failed to unite behind a way forward in a series of ""indicative votes"" in March, but the PM says the government would now be prepared to accept whatever commanded a majority, so long as Labour did too. Sir Keir said he would not be afraid to end the talks as soon as this week if the PM did not budge on her so-called red lines - positions that she feels cannot be changed in the Brexit deal. He suggested a referendum on the final deal had become a red line of its own for many Labour MPs, saying ""A significant number, probably 120 if not 150, would not back a deal if it hasn't got a confirmatory vote."" Labour's stated policy is that it supports a further referendum on Brexit under certain circumstances. It has rejected the idea of campaigning for one in any event but will demand a public vote if it cannot get changes to the government's deal or an election. On this day: Labour leader John Smith dies at 55,external Pollwatch: Euro elections European elections: What you need to know Labour agrees a Brexit referendum position Labour's Stephen Kinnock, who backs the UK leaving but retaining the closest possible economic links with the EU, said it would be a ""real shame"" if the talks were ""torpedoed"" by his party's insistence on another referendum. ""If you try to insert a second referendum into these talks they won't get through because the Conservatives will not whip their MPs to support it,"" he told Radio 4's World At One. However, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, said another public vote was the only ""way out"" of the current stalemate. This video can not be played Lord Adonis: ""The great majority of people do want a referendum - that's very clear from the polling."" Asked whether Labour wanted to leave or remain in the EU, he told Radio 4's Today: ""We are a remain and reform party,"" but ""when it comes to a deal people can form their own view."" In a speech later marking the 25th anniversary of former Labour leader John Smith's death, Mr Watson reflected on Mr Smith's pro-Europeanism and said he would have backed a ""People's Vote"". Asked if a deadline should be set for the talks, Mr Gove said the government needed time to properly ""understand and explore"" Labour's position. While another referendum would be a ""bad idea"" he said, Mr Gove declined to rule out any of Labour's main proposals, such assome form of customs union with the EU. The reality is these talks have been genuine, but very difficult. Neither side wanted to pull the plug before the local elections 10 days or so ago. But now, as time goes on, it may well be we are reaching the moment where they have to throw up their hands and say: ""We just can't do it."" Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May are both on lonely tightropes trying to get across the other side of this slow-moving crisis. I think they would both like it to be over with, maybe with a cross-party deal. But the prime minister doesn't want to put a huge compromise on the table, she doesn't want another referendum. Jeremy Corbyn doesn't want to help out the government unless he can get genuine changes. If neither of them feel they can really budge, well, the talks are not going to be able to succeed, and the government will then have to try to move on to votes in Parliament, the next part of the process.

""It's incredible, 98 points, to go back-to-back. We made the standard higher last season and Liverpool helped us. To win this title we had to win 14 (league games) in a row. We couldn't lose one point. ""It's the toughest title we have won in all my career, by far."" Liverpool 2-0 Wolves Liverpool Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport:""Congratulations to Manchester City. We tried everything to
make it as difficult as possible but not difficult enough. I couldnât be more proud of
the boys. ""Itâs incredible what they did all season and today was a strange
situation. We were really good until 1-0, what happened then was clear. You canât
tell the people to calm down. At that moment [when Liverpool fans celebrated Brighton's goal] it was a shock for everyone and
Wolves were there. We had to fight. In the end we scored two and kept a clean
sheet. Itâs nice but not how we wanted it. ""Itâs clear we had to work hard and City

Ian WrightMatch of the Day pundit Manchester City are one of the best teams we have ever seen in the Premier League, and Liverpool have run them close. Itâs been an incredible title race and both teams have done it the proper way - playing entertaining and exciting football and scoring a lot of goals. Even with the pressure that both of them have been under for the past few weeks, they have not changed the way they played. Both of them coped with that pressure extremely well, it is just City coped with it a tiny bit better. Ian joins Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker on the final Match of the Day of the season at 22:30 BST on BBC One and the BBC Sport website. Alan ShearerMatch of the Day pundit Well done Manchester City. Champions again, and what an incredible effort to retain their title. But well done to Liverpool too.

Man Utd 0-2 Cardiff Manchester United Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer:""Today was not the problem, you can have all the possession and chances you want but we concede easy goals and not score at the other. That is not where our challenge lies, we have a long and hard way to be where we want to be. ""Mason Greenwood was brilliant, he was our best player by a mile and that says a lot about the kid. He came into the team with a lack of confidence and you can see that has take a total. Not surprised by his performance, we know he is capable of that. ""It will take some time to close in on the top, we finished five or six points behind third, fourth, fifth and that has to be our aim. The top two teams have set a standard higher than before and we have to take up the next challenge. ""The work starts now, everyone has the summer off but we have to come back with a different  mentality and different attitude of being a Man United team. ""The ones who played, did well but it was not good enough."" Leicester 0-0 Chelsea Chelsea Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri speaking to Sky Sports: ""Eden [Hazard] was tired today so he was on the bench. We tried to win with him later on in the last 25 minutes. I think Eden has played here in Chelsea for seven seasons, trying in every match to do his best and now it's time to respect his decision, but I hope he will remain with us. ""The season is good. We were in trouble two or three months ago but third place is a very good result. Now we have to go to Baku for the Europa League final and we have the chance for our season to be wonderful."" On playing a friendly in the United States in midweek: ""It's a double feeling. I'm happy because we go there for a good reason. As a coach I am worried because we are tired and need to rest."" Brighton in the market for a striker? Brighton 1-4 Manchester City Brighton & Hove Albion Brighton manager Chris Hughton, speaking to Sky Sports:""All I wanted was for us to put in a performance but it's the margins and quality that make the difference for us. ""We needed to hold it at 1-0 for longer but it's difficult with the quality that they've got. I'm proud of the performance. ""Bruno is not just a great captain but it takes real dedication to the cause to get himself in shape at 38 years old. He's a fantastic person and that's why he's held in such high esteem by everyone at the club. ""The next step is to learn from the disappointment we had this season. We need to score more goals - that's the biggest and the hardest area."" Manchester City are champions Liverpool Liverpool became the first team
     in top-flight history to win as many as 30 games and 97 points in a season
     and not win the title. No side has ever previously
     lost just one game in a top-flight season and not won the title â the
     previous record was also held by Liverpool in the 2008-09 season (two
     defeats, finished 2nd). Liverpoolâs tally of 97 points
     would have been enough to win the Premier League in all but one of the
     previous 26 seasons of the competition (2017-18). Man
     Cityâs David Silva has provided 18 assists for Sergio Aguero in the Premier
     League â only three players have ever assisted another for more goals in
     the competition (Frank Lampard to Didier Drogba, Darren Anderton to Teddy
     Sheringham and Steve McManaman to Robbie Fowler). Manchester City are champions Manchester City Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling, speaking to Sky Sports:""I'm just delighted, this is exactly what I came to the club for, to win trophies and be in these moments. ""The manager here, his mentality is the best. It's always about winning. It's the way he sets us up. I'm happy to be here learning and winning. ""As a manager, he's got multiple players in each position challenging each other. No one is comfortable here but everyone is ready to take their chance - like Riyad today. He's not played much recently but I knew he was going to score today. ""It's been a lovely season after a difficult World Cup. Hopefully I can go one better next year."" Watford 1-4 West Ham West Ham United Michail Antonio speaking to Sky Sports: ""What an unbelievable goal from Mark Noble today. Heâs the slowest
man alive but he's shaped and found the bottom corner. ""We're really pleased for the fans as we wanted to finish on a high so we could take it into next season."" Burnley 1-3 Arsenal Arsenal Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang:""I share this trophy with two other guys I like, great players and African, we
are representing Africa, thatâs cool."" Aubameyang, Sadio Mane and Mo Salah all end the season with 22 Premier League goals This was the eighth time the
     Premier League title has been decided on the final day of the season, with
     Manchester City winning it on three of those occasions (2011-12, 2013-14
     and 2018-19). Tottenham 2-2 Everton Everton Everton manager Marco Silva speaking to BBC Match of the Day:""We started in a bad way, I didn't like the first 20 minutes but then we showed our quality. It was a good point but I felt we could do better. ""We reacted really good, finishing in a good spot in the first half and scored twice - unfortunately they scored a very good goal."" On closing the gap to the top-six:""To be a top-six club in this country now is really tough. Our fans deserve it but we must be realistic for our team. If they have a different budget we must work hard and do everything perfectly. We will try, our job is to work really hard every day and improve what we did the season before. ""I have no doubts we are a stronger team than at the start of the season."" Burnley 1-2 Arsenal Burnley Burnley boss Sean Dyche:""I was pleased with today's performance but the cutting edge was lacking. ""I have been proud of the players all season. The way they have taken on the second-half of the season. They were under duress around Christmas, the noise outside the camp was people saying we were finished, but the way they have seen through that concentrated and focused on the challenge in front has been magnificent. ""I knew it would be a tough season with the Europe league, coming
off the back of a good season. Itâs a restart each season and we grow again as a side,
we have done that in different ways this season."" Manchester City are champions Manchester City Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to Sky Sports:""We have to say congratulations to Liverpool and thank you so much, they pushed us to increase our standards. ""It's incredible, 98 points, to go back-to-back. We made the standard higher last season and Liverpool helped us. To win this title we had to win 14 (league games) in a row. We couldn't lose one point. ""It's the toughest title we have won in all my career, by far."" Â© 2025 BBC.
