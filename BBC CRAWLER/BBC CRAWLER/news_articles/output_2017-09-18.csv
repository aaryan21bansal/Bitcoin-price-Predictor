The winds are very, very strong, we can hear the noise on the outside. We still don't know what the impact is going to be when this is all over. But what I can say it does not look good for Dominica as we speak,"" he said. Martiniqueraised its alert status to ""violet"", the highest level, and ordered its population to seek shelter. InGuadeloupe, schools, businesses and government buildings have all been closed and severe flooding is predicted.

Man 'who saved the world' dies at 77,"This video can not be played Stanislav Petrov: ''I knew perfectly well that nobody would be able to correct my mistake if I had made one'' A former Soviet military officer credited with averting a possible nuclear disaster at the peak of the Cold War has died at the age of 77. Stanislav Petrov was on duty at a Russian nuclear early warning centre in 1983 when computers wrongly detected incoming missiles from the US. He took the decision that they were a false alarm and did not report them to his superiors. His actions, which came to light years later, possibly prevented nuclear war. Petrov died at his home in Moscow in May but his death has only now been made public. In an interview with the BBC in 2013, Petrov told how he had received computer readouts in the early hours of the morning of 26 September 1983 suggesting several US missiles had been launched. The man who may have saved the world Russia's top spin doctor in nuclear warning The German schoolboy jailed for writing to the BBC ""I had all the data [to suggest there was an ongoing missile attack]. If I had sent my report up the chain of command, nobody would have said a word against it,"" he said. ""All I had to do was to reach for the phone; to raise the direct line to our top commanders - but I couldn't move. I felt like I was sitting on a hot frying pan."" Although his training dictated he should contact the Soviet military immediately, Petrov instead called the duty officer at army headquarters and reported a system malfunction. The Soviet Union and the US had huge nuclear arsenals trained on each other during the Cold War If he had been wrong, the first nuclear blasts would have happened minutes later. ""Twenty-three minutes later I realised that nothing had happened. If there had been a real strike, then I would already know about it. It was such a relief,"" he recalled. A later investigation concluded that Soviet satellites had mistakenly identified sunlight reflecting on clouds as the engines of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Petrov, who retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel, died on 19 May but news of his passing became widely known only this month, thanks to a chance phone call. German film-maker Karl Schumacher, who first brought Petrov's story to an international audience, telephoned him to wish him a happy birthday on 7 September only to be informed by his son, Dmitry Petrov, that he had passed away. Mr Schumacher announced the death online and it was eventually picked up by media outlets.

Couple married 75 years die hours apart,"Jean and George Spear met the Duchess of Cambridge in 2011 when she visited Ottawa A British wartime bride and her Canadian veteran husband have died five hours apart - a month after celebrating their 75th wedding anniversary. George and Jean Spear met in 1941 at a dance hall near London, while he was stationed in Britain during the Second World War. The couple passed away in an Ottawa hospital on Friday after Mrs Spear, 94, was admitted for pneumonia. She was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 2006. Mrs Spear and her 95-year-old husband met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their 2011 Royal Tour. Jean and George Spear in 1942 Mr Spear was admitted to Queensway Carleton Hospital on Wednesday, a day after his wife, when he fell into a deep sleep. Hospital staff had tried to move Mr Spear to his wife's floor, but Mrs Spear died peacefully in her sleep on Friday at 04:30 local time before that could be arranged. Mr Spear followed quickly afterwards at 09:45 am, theOttawa Citizen reported,external. They leave behind two adult children, Heather and Ian. Canada's forgotten WWI victory The struggles of war babies fathered by black GIs ""We tell stories to make ourselves feel better,"" their daughter, Heather Spear,told the Ottawa Citizen,external. ""But this defies any sort of logic. We were overwhelmed by the suddenness of it."" The couple met during a dance while Mr Spear was serving as a sergeant major in the 1st Corps Field Survey Co, Royal Canadian Engineers. ""She looked down at my army boots and said, 'I don't know whether we can or not with those clodhoppers you're wearing,"" recalled Mr Spear to theOttawa Citizen,externalduring the couple's 72nd wedding anniversary.

In 1944 she sailed for Canada because her husband, who was then stationed in Italy, was to be sent back home to train others. ""If he'd come to 'lower Slovovia' [sic] I would have been dying to get to 'lower Slovovia', as long as he was there,"" she said during aCBC interview,externalwith the couple in 2014. When she arrived in Ottawa by train, she didn't know her husband would be meeting her because she thought he was still in Italy. ""It was snowing and the most amazing blizzard you'd ever seen all your life,"" she said. ""And this figure came running towards meâ¦ and he reached me and he wrapped his great coat around me. ""I can't talk about it now without reliving the absolute ecstasy of that moment."" In 2006, the Queen made her a Member of the Order of the British Empire for her work for other war brides. She founded the first club for war brides in Canada. She travelled to London for the ceremony with Mr Spear, and got to meet her hero, wartime singer Dame Vera Lynn. Almost 50,000 British women moved to Canada at the end of the war because they married Canadian soldiers. The couple were invited to a private reception with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in Ottawa during their 2011 Royal Tour.

Oldest snow patch expected to melt,"This video can not be played Scotland's oldest snow patch set to melt away Scotland's longest lasting patch of snow could melt away by the weekend. Iain Cameron, who seeks out and records snow that survives on Scotland's highest mountains, believes the patch known as the Sphinx has days left. The patch at Garbh Choire Mor on Braeriach in the Cairngorms is believed to have disappeared only six times previously in the last 300 years. According to records, the snow previously melted in 1933, 1953, 1959, 1996, 2003 and 2006. Dr Adam Watson, a biologistdubbed Mr Cairngormsbecause of his years studying the mountains, has written of the snow at Garbh Choire Mor. His research of snow lying there for years drew on information handed down by generations of stalkers and families that had worked in that area. In a post on Twitter following a visit to Garbh Choire Mor, Stirling-based Mr Cameron wrote: ""Sphinx has a matter of days left. I'm displeased."" A patch of snow clings on at Aonach Beag, but it is also expected to melt Aonach Beag's patch pictured earlier this month Aonach Beag's last snow could disappear within days The Sphinx is one of only two patches of snow surviving in Scotland's hills this year. The second patch at Aonach Beag is also expected to melt away over the next few days, said Mr Cameron, whose records of snow patches are published by the Royal Meteorological Society. In August, Mr Cameron reported that for the first time in 11 years there wasno snow on Britain's highest mountain, Ben Nevis. Snow hunter Iain Cameron's tweet on the demise of the Sphinx snow patch Garbh Choire Mor is described as Scotland's snowiest corrie because of the amount of snow it can hold even through summer months. Corries are a hollow-shaped geological features found high in Scotland's mountains. UKClimbing.com describes Garbh Choire Mor as ""remote"" and having an ""alpine feel"". It also warns that it is a place to avoid in winter because of cornices, large overhanging ledges of snow, that form above the corrie. Dr Adam Watson, known as Mr Cairngorms, has researched the snow patch on Braeriach The snow patch that has so far survived on Aonach Beag was skied on earlier this month by Helen Rennie, who has skied on natural Scottish snow every consecutive month for almost eight years.

Ryanair publishes flight cancellation list,"This video can not be played Passenger: 'Communications with Ryanair has been absolutely atrocious' Ryanair has published full details of which of its flights are being cancelled between now and 28 October. Customers whose flights have been axed will also receive an email, chief executive Michael O'Leary has said. The budget airline is cancelling 40-50 flights every day for the next six weeks, after it admittedit had ""messed up""the planning of pilot holidays. Mr O'Leary said most people would be transferred to an alternative Ryanair flight on the same day. If not, they would be moved to flights the day before or the day after, and the airline would meet its obligations over compensation. Details of all the cancelled flights are availableon the Ryanair website,external. More than 200 of the cancelled flights are either into or out of London Stansted, with a handful in Edinburgh, Manchester and Birmingham also affected. Ryanair faces up to 20 million euros in compensation claims Cancelled by text: Ryanair passengers react Ryanair: What should I do if my flight is cancelled? The airline said it was cancelling flights at airports where it ran the busiest schedules, so it would be easier to accommodate passengers on alternative flights. Rome, Milan, Brussels and Barcelona airports will also see a significant number of flights, either or in or out, cancelled. Mr O'Leary said around 400,000 passengers would be directly affected, but he said a decision had been made to disrupt the plans of 2% of travellers in order to offer a better service to the remaining customers. Changes to the way the airline organises its holiday year have left Ryanair with a backlog of staff leave, meaning there is a shortage of pilots on standby over the next six weeks. That meant any minor disruptions to flights, due to problems with air traffic control capacity, strikes, or weather disruptions were causing knock-on delays, because the airline did not have the flexibility it needed from back-up crews, said Mr O'Leary. After 1 November, when the lighter winter schedule begins, there will not be any need for cancellations, he said. He said they were also asking to buy back leave from pilots and alter the holiday schedule. Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would honour all of its obligations to compensate passengers under EU regulations but would not book passengers onto flights with rival carriers. ""We will not pay for flights on other airlines, no. It is not part of the EU261 entitlement,"" he said, referring toEuropean passenger rights legislation,external. He said the airline did not have an overall shortage of pilots, but said they had ""messed up"" the rosters for September and October. ""This is our mess-up. When we make a mess in Ryanair we come out with our hands up,"" he said. ""We try to explain why we've made the mess and we will pay compensation to those passengers who are entitled to compensation, which will be those flights that are cancelled over the next two weeks."" If passengers are given more than 14 days' notice of a cancellation, they are not entitled to compensation. The EU compensation rules for cancelled flights are as follows: Passengers are entitled to assistance and compensation, if the disruption was within an airline's control. Airlines have to offer full refunds, paid within seven days, or rebookings for a flight cancelled at short notice. In addition, passengers can also claim compensation. Cancellation amounts are: 250 euros (Â£218) for short-haul, 440 euros (Â£384) for medium-haul and 600 euros (Â£523) for long-haul. Passengers who reach their destination more than three hours late can be compensated from 200 to 600 euros, depending on the length of flights and delay.

"Sanctions won't stop us, warns N Korea","Kim Jong-un and top military officials celebrated Friday's missile launch North Korea has warned that more sanctions and pressure will only make it accelerate its nuclear programme. In a strongly worded statement, Pyongyang called a new set of UN sanctions ""the most vicious, unethical and inhumane act of hostility"". Meanwhile, the presidents of the US and China committed to ""maximising pressure"" on the North through vigorous enforcement of UN resolutions. Earlier, the US and South Korea carried out joint military exercises. North Korea fired its latest missile over Japan on Friday. It travelled 3,700km (2,299 miles), putting the US Pacific territory of Guam, whichNorth Korea says it has a plan to target, within reach. The launch followed a fresh round of UN sanctions and was unanimously condemned by the UN Security Council as ""highly provocative"". The foreign ministry statement, carried by the country's official news agency KCNA, said: ""The increased moves of the US and its vassal forces to impose sanctions and pressure on the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] will only increase our pace towards the ultimate completion of the state nuclear force."" It also said that the goal of thenew UN sanctions, approved on 11 September, was to ""physically exterminate"" the country's people, system and government. Is South Korea really planning to kill Kim Jong-un? Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? The sanctions are an attempt to starve North Korea of fuel and income for its weapons programmes, and restrict oil imports and ban textile exports. The fresh measures followed the sixth and most powerful nuclear test conducted by Pyongyang earlier this month. But some critics have raised questions over the effectiveness of the restrictions, as North Korea is still able to trade internationally. The country's commerce with China, its main ally, was partially responsible for an estimated economic growth of 3.9% last year,Bloomberg news agency reports.,external The issue of North Korea's weapons programme is expected to dominate US President Donald Trump's address at the UN General Assembly and his meetings with the leaders of South Korea and Japan. Mr Trump previously warned that ""all options"" were on the table and that North Korea would face ""fire and fury"" if it continued to threaten the US. This video can not be played Trump is to make his debut at the UN General Assembly: Will he listen or lecture? In a phone call on Monday, Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to ""maximising pressure on North Korea through vigorous enforcement"" of UN Security Council resolutions, the White House said. Washingtonhas repeatedly urgedBeijing to take more direct action to rein in Pyongyang, while Chinasays the US should refrainfrom issuing more threats. How do you defend against North Korea? Russia has also criticised what it describes as ""aggressive rhetoric"" from the US. China and Russia only agreed to the new UN sanctions after they were softened by Washington. Meeting on the sidelines of UN General Assembly, the foreign ministers of both countries reaffirmed their call that the crisis should be resolved by diplomacy, a statement from Russia's foreign ministry said.

Three minutes to shelter from a missile The US military carried out an aerial military drill on Monday with South Korea near the border between the Koreas, the defence ministry in Seoul said. The drill was to ""demonstrate the deterrence capability of the US-South Korea alliance against North Korea's nuclear and missile threats"", it added. US and South Korean jets carried out a joint military drill Defence Minister Song Young-moo told a parliamentary hearing that the exercises were being conducted ""two to three times a month these days"", Reuters news agency reports. In other developments: China and Russia began a joint naval exercise east of the Korean peninsula but it is unclear  if it is linked to current tensions in the region Spain said,externalit was expelling the North Korean ambassador. The move follows similar decisions by Peru and Mexico and comes after the US urged international action against the country. Kuwait has reportedly decided to take the same measure US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said at the Pentagon there were military options to address the North Korean crisis that would not put the South Korean capital, Seoul, at grave risk.

Fire crews tackle White Hart Lane blaze,"This video can not be played 'I've just lost everything I've worked so hard to build' A fire has destroyed large parts of an industrial estate in north London. Twenty fire engines and 140 firefighters tackled the blaze at White Hart Lane in Tottenham overnight, London Fire Brigade said. Several business, including a large self storage unit, are believed to have been destroyed. One person was taken to hospital with burns to the hand. The fire is under control but fire crews are expected to remain at the scene until Wednesday. London Fire Brigade said: ""Crews worked tirelessly through the night to bring the fire under control. ""Though the fire is now surrounded this will be a protracted incident and crews are expected to remain on scene for a considerable time dealing with deep seated pockets of fire."" This video can not be played The fire has engulfed a warehouse and has ""produced a lot of smoke"" Approximately 75% of a single storey warehouse were damaged by the fire, the London Fire Brigade said. Safehouse Self-Storage confirmed most of its warehouse, where customers and businesses store goods, was destroyed by the fire. In a statement the company said it would contact customers once its representatives had been allowed on site to assess the damage. More than Â£80,000 worth of stock has been destroyed in a mobile phone wholesalers on the estate, its business manager Saad Sid said. Mr Sid, of SID Bargain Ltd, told the BBC: ""I've just lost everything I've worked so hard to build"". It's been hours since the fire began and it's continuing to rage through the White Hart Lane industrial park, engulfing buildings - each belonging to local businesses - one by one. One firefighter I spoke to said he expected it to take a day and a half for the blaze to completely burn out. Nearby streets initially filled with anxious local residents and people trying to take photos of the flames, some of which were licking the skies 20m to 30m above the buildings. They were told to leave as they were blocking key evacuation routes for residents. Luckily so far, these have not been needed. One Twitter user described a ""crazy"" fire while another reported a helicopter flying over the White Hart Lane recreational ground. Firefighters from Tottenham, Hornsey, Edmonton and surrounding fire stations are attending. The cause of the fire is not known at this stage. Safehouse Self-Storage was one of the properties damaged in the fire Twenty fire engines and 140 firefighters were needed to tackle the fire at its peak London Fire Brigade London hospitals reintroduce mandatory face masks as flu cases soar Care home did not clean dementia patient's denture 'for several months' Minicab drives into Kilburn police crime scene where two teens stabbed Charges made in connection with death of Paralympian at Newham Leisure Centre Londonâs FTSE 250 slumps and pound weakens as UK gilt yields spike Recycle your empty Christmas chocolate tubs at Greene King Pubs in Ealing At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Police get more time to quiz Tube suspects,"Syrian-born Yahyah Farroukh is believed to be the 21-year-old suspect arrested by police Police have been granted more time to question two suspects in connection with Friday's Tube attack. On Saturday an 18-year-old man, thought to be an Iraqi orphan, was arrested in Dover port, and a 21-year-old was detained in Hounslow. A homemade bomb partially exploded in a train at Parsons Green station, injuring 30 people in rush hour. Police now have until 23 September to question the 18-year-old, and until 21 September to detain the 21-year-old. The 18-year-old is a recent foster child at a home in Sunbury-on-Thames, and the 21-year-old has links to the property, where a police cordon is in place. Police are searching the house owned by foster parents Ronald Jones, 88, and Penelope Jones, 71. Both men were arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act and were granted warrants for further detention by Westminster Magistrates' Court. They remain in custody at a south London police station. CCTV images have emerged showing a person carrying a Lidl supermarket bag 90 minutes before the bombing. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows this Lidl bag being carried before the attack BBC News has obtained CCTV footage showing a person leaving the property in Sunbury carrying a Lidl bag at 07:04 BST on Friday morning. At 08.20, a device exploded on a District Line train. The bomb was in a plastic bucket, which was transported in a Lidl bag. The 18-year-old is thought to have moved to the UK aged 15 when his parents died. Neighbours claimed the teenager, who is thought to still live at the foster home, tried to run away. Neighbours who spoke to the BBC reported police cars attending the address several times over the last few months. Resident Dave Solway said: ""If they don't come back on time the police are called, that's why there will be a police presence. ""Whether that means the lads will cause trouble per se, who's to know? That's speculation."" Police have cordoned off a street in Sunbury-on-Thames where they are searching a property thought to be connected with Friday's attack A 21-year-old man, believed to be Syrian-born Yahyah Farroukh, was also arrested on Saturday in Hounslow, west London, and his house in Stanwell, near Heathrow airport, is being searched. Mr Farroukh was a former foster child who had lived in the Jones's house in Sunbury, local council leader Ian Harvey said. Mr Farroukh posted a picture on his Instagram page in May this year with a suitcase on Cavendish Road, Sunbury, almost directly outside the Jones's house. Mr and Mrs Jones weremade MBEs for services to children in 2010,external, and friend Alison Griffiths said the couple had an 18-year-old and a 22-year-old staying with them recently. She said the couple were ""great pillars of the community"", adding: ""They do a job that not many people do."" Mr Farroukh is believed to have been in the UK for at least four years and learned English at West Thames College between 2013 and 2015. Tube staff's accounts of bomb 'pandemonium' Residents in Sunbury told to get out of homes Terror threat lowered after Tube bombing Neighbours told the BBC he was a ""friendly"" and ""chatty"" young man who had been visited by family from Scotland. Police also searched the Aladdins chicken shop in Hounslow, west London, where Mr Farroukh was arrested. A manager confirmed he had worked at the Kingsley Road shop for a number of months. Shop owner Suleman Sarwar said police searched lockers on the premises. He added: ""We didn't know him very well. ""He was quite quiet, he just worked over here and that was it. ""He was very normal. If he did do anything you would never have suspected it."" The Sunbury house is owned by foster parents Penelope and Ronald Jones, who were made MBEs in 2010 The so-called Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said while there was ""no evidence"" to confirm Islamic State's involvement, work was being done to find out how the attacker was radicalised. The UK's terror threat level was raised to critical - its highest level - immediately after the attack, but it was brought back to severe after the police arrests. Assistant Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said police had gained a ""greater understanding"" of how the bomb was prepared but said there was ""still much more to do"". Thirty people were injured - most suffering from ""flash burns"" - when a bomb was detonated on a Tube carriage at Parsons Green station. Jack Durston was on the train where the bomb went off on Friday and he said: ""There was a big sort of wall of fire, the whole width of the carriage, moving towards us very fast. ""My instinct was to just run. And I ran away from the fire and out the door."" Police have urged anyone with information to contact them and to upload pictures and video to the websitewww.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk,externalor to call the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321.

Rooney admits drink-drive charge,"This video can not be played Wayne Rooney arrives in court on drink-drive charge Former England captain Wayne Rooney has appeared in court and admitted drink-driving. He was arrested when police stopped a car in Wilmslow, Cheshire, in the early hours on 1 September. The 31-year-old was banned from driving for two years and ordered to perform 100 hours of unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order. Rooney was also ordered to pay Â£170 when he appeared at Stockport Magistrates' Court. The court heard Rooney was almost three times the legal limit when he was stopped by police at 02:00 BST. A breathalyser test showed his alcohol level was 104 microgrammes in 100 millilitres of breath. The drink-drive limit in England and Wales is 35 microgrammes per 100 millilitres of breath.

In a statement issued after the hearing, the Everton footballer said: ""I want publicly to apologise for my unforgivable lack of judgment in driving while over the legal limit. It was completely wrong. ""I have already said sorry to my family, my manager and chairman and everyone at Everton FC. Now I want to apologise to all the fans and everyone else who has followed and supported me throughout my career. ""Of course I accept the sentence of the court and hope that I can make some amends through my community service."" Wayne Rooney arriving at Stockport Magistrates' Court Wearing a blue suit with his hands in his pockets, Rooney walked into the court building accompanied by a small entourage. Kate Gaskell, prosecuting, said a police officer on patrol was on duty in Altrincham Road, Wilmslow, at 02:10 BST when they noticed the rear tail-light of a Volkswagen Beetle on the left hand side had gone out. She said the officer intended to follow the vehicle but it pulled over with Rooney seen to be at the wheel with a female in the front passenger seat. Ms Gaskell said the footballer provided a positive roadside breath test before he was taken to a police station where the reading was confirmed. The judge told Rooney: ""You placed yourself and other road users at risk"" The court heard that Rooney currently had three points on his driving licence for a speeding offence on August 24 2016. Rooney's legal team had asked District Judge John Temperley to consider not imposing a community order because of his ongoing charitable work. However, the judge said he was ""not convinced"" that imposing a large fine ""would have the same effect"". Rooney's lawyer, Mike Rainford, told the court it was likely that Everton would fine the player two weeks' wages, which the BBC understands to be about Â£300,000. Judge Temperley said: ""This is a serious matter... you placed yourself and other road users at risk as a result of your poor judgement that night. ""I accept your remorse is genuine and that you are aware of the adverse affects the events of that night have had, not least on your family."" Rooney was also told to pay Â£85 prosecution costs and a victim surcharge for the same amount. BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan has been in court following proceedings. Allow Twitter content?

Thousands of euros flushed down toilets,"The high-value euro notes are being withdrawn from production because of their links to criminality Swiss prosecutors are investigating why tens of thousands of euros were flushed down toilets in Geneva. The â¬500 (Â£440; $600) notes were cut up and found in the toilets of a branch of the bank UBS and in three nearby restaurants. Thousands of francshave reportedly been spent,externalon plumbing repairs to unclog the surrounding pipes. The high-value euro notes are due to be withdrawn in 2018 over fears they facilitate illegal activities. They will remain legal tender, but the European Central Bank will stop producing them following a European Commission inquiry into their use. Destroying notes is not an offence in Switzerland, but local prosecutors confirmed they were looking into the circumstances around the unusual find. ""We're trying to find out where the notes came from and whether a crime has been committed,"" Vincent Derouand from the Geneva prosecutor's office told the BBC. ""Clearly it's very surprising,"" he said. Mr Derouand would not comment onlocal reports,external(in French) that a lawyer had been questioned in relation to their enquiries.

Tube staff's accounts of bomb 'pandemonium',"The driver of the train targetedin Friday's terror attackat Parsons Green Tube station has revealed the ""pandemonium"" which followed the explosion, in his official account. A initial London Underground investigation into the incident, documented in a paper seen by the BBC, has given a snapshot of how staff reacted when an improvised bomb partially exploded in a train, injuring 30 people during the morning rush hour. The report also revealed initial communications between the driver and the service controller were ""hampered"", while CCTV images showed ""a scene of confusion and distress"". When he arrived at Parsons Green, he operated the train doors as normal and carried out his platform duties. As he was about to shut the doors to depart, he noticed on the in-cab CCTV that a lot of passengers were running out of the rear car. He immediately opened the cab door to find out what was happening. Some passengers were shouting ""fire"" and others were shouting ""it's an attack"". The train operator stated that he returned to the cab to raise a mayday alarm. He asked for traction current to be switched off immediately. He then returned to the platform and told passengers that were stuck on the platform due to the pandemonium and small size of the staircase to follow him. He took the customers on to the track away from the trains via the ramp. He took the customers as far as the sidings and instructed them to stay low and out of sight. At this time there were about 50-70 people on the track with the train operator and because he was not sure what type of attack was going on, he returned to the station platform to get more information. On arriving back on the platform, he was met by the station supervisor, who informed the train operator that a bomb had gone off in the last car. The train operator returned to the sidings to lead the passengers on the track back to the station, and eventually out of the station. The supervisor and his staff were at the gateline when there was a sudden stampede of passengers from platform two. Customers started jumping over the barriers to get out of the station. The supervisor plunged the gates using the emergency button to keep all gates open. He instructed his staff to continue to help people out of the station while he went to investigate the reason for the stampede. After checking the station cameras, he saw that the platform was still very busy with people trying frantically to exit and others running on the tracks, the station supervisor put on his hi-vis and went to the platform. However, the stairs were so busy and people were being trampled on by those pushing from behind to exit the platform. The supervisor called his staff and together they helped the fallen and injured out of the station. They went back and forth and kept calming the crowd, to walk orderly out of the station. The supervisor was eventually able to get to the platform. He had found out by enquiring from passengers, while helping them out of the station, that there had been an explosion and fire in the last car of the train on platform two. The supervisor saw the train operator and informed him of the situation. The service controller was informed while the train operator went back to the track to retrieve the passengers on the track with him. The station supervisor continued to evacuate the platform as some passengers kept going to the burning item on the train in order to take pictures.

'Why I took photos of Grenfell victim',"This video can not be played Omega Mwaikambo was jailed for three months Omega Mwaikambo pauses, glances to one side then blinks as he ponders the question he has asked himself every day for the last three months. ""Why did he take photographs of a dead victim of the Grenfell fire - and then post them to Facebook?"" His answer - given to BBC Newsnight in his first interview since leaving Wandsworth prison earlier this month, after being sentenced to three months for taking and sharing the pictures - should serve as a warning for all social media users Mwaikambo, a 43-year-old chef born in London to Tanzanian parents, returned from work to his home next door to Grenfell Tower at about 00:15 BST on 14 June. About 01:00 - just as he drifted off to sleep - he started to hear strange noises. ""I heard a faint sound of 'help, help'"", Mwaikambo said. ""At first I dismissed it. Then it happened again. And again. So I got out of bed to investigate."" Mwaikambo's first instinct, he said, on seeing the fire, was to run to warn his neighbours. He then joined the throng of locals gathered beneath the tower. He saw trapped residents screaming and waving for help. Others he saw jumping to their deaths. ""It was sort of like watching the 11 September World Trade Center"", he told BBC Newsnight. ""But this was real, in front of my eyes."" Mwaikambo lived next to Grenfell Tower It was about 05:00, as he returned home to his flat, that Mwaikambo spotted the body. A corpse, wrapped in plastic, apparently dumped in the enclosed courtyard area outside his flat's front door. ""God knows what I was thinking in my head,"" he explained. ""But I was holding my iPad. The body was not wrapped tightly; it was loosely wrapped. ""Inside I was just saying to myself 'does anybody know this person?' I just took the picture."" Mwaikambo started off by taking photos of the body bag from a distance. Then he went further. He lifted the plastic sheeting around the corpse's face, and took more. ""[I was] not even knowing what I was doing."" he said. ""It just happened. No explanation. But with anger. [I was] traumatised. Mesmerised as well. ""Morally I know it was wrong. But it was not morally right for a body - for its respect - to be left unattended out there."" Then came the move that pushed Mwaikambo's actions into the criminal. He uploaded seven of the pictures, plus one short video, to his Facebook page. Mwaikambo did so, he now claims, in anger and confusion. But also, he says, out of habit. Posting regular status updates to his Facebook page is, for him, just ""something he does"". His Facebook account was set to ""open"", meaning anyone with an internet connection could see his pictures if they looked. But even then the pictures didn't go viral. It took the involvement of someone else - professional photographer Jason Kay - for the police to get involved. Around 08:00 that morning, Mwaikambo met Mr Kay, who had just arrived on the scene. He offered him use of all his photographs from the previous night. Mr Kay thanked him - then informed the police. ""I felt I had to report that to the authorities given the circumstances,"" he told Newsnight. ""I did turn him into the cops. I'd do it again. Absolutely. 100%."" Omega Mwaikambo was arrested on 14 June What about the arrest? Did Mr Kay help the police arrest Mwaikambo? ""The police said 'do you know where he is now?',"" he explained. ""I said, 'I've got his mobile number - I can give him a call'. ""They were there to meet him and greet him and seize his iPad and everything else."" Mwaikambo was arrested outside Latimer Road Tube station at around 18:00 on 14 June; 17 hours after the fire took hold. He appeared in court two days later, where he pleaded guilty to two charges of breaching the 2003 Communications Act by posting offensive images to a social media network. The first of the two charges related to two photos and a video of the body bag's exterior. The second charge related to five photos of the body inside a body bag. District Judge Tanweer Ikram was unforgiving. ""The whole country, if not the whole world, has been shocked by what has taken place in the last few days in relation to the fire at Grenfell Tower,"" he told Mwaikambo. ""What you have done by uploading those photos shows absolutely no respect to this poor victim. To show his face as he lies there is beyond words."" Judge Ikram sentenced Mwaikambo - who had no criminal record - to six weeks in prison for each crime. A total of three months inside. The photographer who informed the police of Mwaikambo's actions, Mr Kay, told Newsnight he was shocked by the sentence. His objective in informing the police ""wasn't getting [Mwaikambo] sent to prison"", he said. ""When they said he had got three months, I was like 'really?' Do you not think that was the system turning around and sending a message to society?"" Mwaikambo acknowledges that he broke the law, and that he acted immorally. But he remains confused and upset by his treatment. ""It's just a picture,"" he says. ""I didn't steal. I didn't kill. I didn't commit any crime that I know is really a high risk. ""I can understand why people are angry. ""Why would anybody take a photo of a dead person, if they were in a normal state of mind? ""Why would anybody do such a thing?""

Five things that could happen next with tuition fees,"Universities are privately expecting the next fee increase to be ditched Tuition fees in England are under intense scrutiny - with a huge amount of confusion about what is going to happen next. They're meant to be increased even further - but there is a feeding frenzy of briefings suggesting that they are more likely to be reduced. It's a case of the politics of a minority government - and competing power bases - becoming more important than policy. No one wants to be left holding an unpopular policy when the music stops - and Downing Street and the Treasury, as well as education ministers, will want a fee system that is more attractive to voters. So what are the options? 1)Carry on regardless.The first decision is whether to stick with the current policy of increasing fees again to above Â£9,500 for 2018. Students are already applying for these courses, but such is the political vacuum that no one can tell them how much it will cost. Sources within higher education are less vague. They say that the planned increase is ""dead in the water"" or ""one for the birds"" and universities are working on the assumption that fees will not be raised above Â£9,250. This would be the first real climbdown on raising fees since they were introduced in the 1990s. But with no government majority in the Commons and no political appetite for a fight for higher fees, putting on the brakes could be a case of not ""if"" but ""when"". 2)Lower fees:Or this could be called ""Doing a Miliband"", which in this context would not be seen as auguring well. After a big build-up in the 2015 election, Labour leader Ed Miliband announced a policy that fees would not be scrapped but reduced to Â£6,000. This middle way pleased no one. But it seems to be one of the kites being flown again. A tuition fees protest, London 2015 The idea of fees being pitched lower than Â£9,250 has an initial political attraction in that it is a clear reduction in the headline figure. But would the government then be expected to pay universities for the lost revenue from fees? And if this includes a series of additional top-ups for particular subjects and differential pricing based on potential student earnings, it all gets complicated very quickly. Reduced income would mean fewer places, which is likely to mean fewer students from disadvantaged families. But universities are very much on the back foot at the moment, not really commanding much public sympathy and pushed into the corner over vice-chancellors' pay. They will fear a political calculation which would say that slashing university income would be a price worth paying for pushing down fees. 3)Lower the interest rates:The interest rates for repaying student debt has just gone up to 6.1%, often described in the technical language of finance as ""eye-watering"". This is based on inflation plus 3%. Quite why it has to have the 3% on top has never really been fully explained. But there has been much cross-party unhappiness with rates that seem disproportionately high. Should students on different courses pay different levels of fee? Cutting rates would be seen as popular with students and their parents. But reducing interest charges would also raise questions about another big part of the plan for student finance - that the government wants to sell off students' debts to private investors. All these factors are interlocking. 4)Raise the repayment threshold:Admittedly not the most exciting phrase in the English language. But in many ways this would be among the most quietly significant changes. Students start paying back on salaries above Â£21,000, a threshold that has not changed since 2012. Moving this upwards or linking it to inflation would mean stopping the upward creep in the slice of earnings going into repayments. But it's complicated and doesn't deliver short-term headlines for politicians wanting to calm unease about levels of debt. 5)Scrap the whole thing and start again:Labour, the Lib Dems and the Conservatives have all had their fingers burned by fees. And there have been rumblings about some kind of commission or major review to look again at whether there is a better way of funding higher education. As well as Labour's proposal to pay for fees through taxation, there have been suggestions of turning it into a graduate tax, with the political attraction of getting rid of any headline figures for fees and debts. No one sees the income tax they will pay in the future as ""debt"". Longer term, universities will be looking even harder at independent funding. Their academic autonomy sits increasingly uneasily alongside their financial dependency. Relying on rising fees means accepting each new set of hoops from incoming ministers. A year ago, universities thought they were climbing aboard a system of fees that would increase every year, giving them financial stability. Now it looks as though they might have stepped on to a trapdoor. 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees Are tuition fees really heading for scrap heap?

Is PM heading for 'Florentine fudge' in speech?,"Indulge me. Ahead of any major political intervention there are, I'm afraid, days of speculation -  much of it pointless - about what might be said or not be said. However, sometimes that speculation results in the giver of the speech saying, well, frankly not very much at all. It is this possibility that has been sketched out to me today by several people familiar with some of the conversations around the Brexit speech Theresa May is due to give in Italy on Friday. One speculated that we might be ""heading for Florentine fudge"", another that the PM might ""almost comically say nothing at all"". This scenario may, of course, not come to pass. The speech is still changing; there may be many drafts yet. But here's how the theory goes. Boris Johnson was so alarmed by what he suspected was a softening position on Brexit, on the transition and life outside, favoured by the chancellor and other ministers, that he picked up the phone to The Telegraph to make sure he and other Brexiteers' voices were heard. (This much we know,as I have written here.) Theresa May, therefore, may feel that she has to harden that softer position (keep up!) to avoid embarrassing cabinet ructions and potentially resignations if she seems to be too lily-livered about life outside. Potentially the speech is shorn, therefore, of anything tangible about our future relationship with the EU, and only has limited warm words about how we part company. Those involved in actually trying to do the deal tear their hair out, as she falls short of saying anything significant that could unblock the talks' impasse. The speech therefore fails to meet its objective and its significance is shot before she has even opened her mouth. Put simply, it was suggested to me, ""Boris has stopped her saying what she was going to say, but can't persuade her to say what he wants her to"" . Under this scenario, there is therefore a risk that she says very little of substance. Or does she make a different decision and decide she won't be bullied by any of her ministers, give the speech she wants to and risk governing without some of the Brexit big names on board? And if she is so hemmed in by the politics at home, how can she make progress abroad? Saying very little in Italy will hurt the talks; saying too much could hurt at home. When she stands up in Florence on Friday it might not just be the progress of the vital talks with the EU that are on the line, but the government's stability itself.

"Turkey's new school year: Jihad in, evolution out","There is a storm of criticism over textbooks revised for children aged six to 14 Turkey's schools have begun the new academic year with a controversial curriculum that leaves out the theory of evolution and brings in the concept of jihad. For Turkey's Islamist-rooted government, the idea is for a new ""education of values"". Critics have denounced new textbooks as ""sexist"" and ""anti-scientific"", and complain of a major blow to secular education. ""By embedding a jihadist education of values, they try to plague the brains of our little children, with the same understanding that transforms the Middle East into a bloodbath,"" said Bulent Tezcan of the secular, opposition CHP party. Parents divided over new Turkish curriculum Turkish students fear assault on secular education In depth - Erdogan's Turkey But the government has accused the opposition of creating black propaganda and trying to polarise Turkey ahead of elections in 2019. ""When we say values, they understand something else. We are proud of our conservative-democrat stand, but we don't want everyone to be like us,"" says Education Minister Ismet Yilmaz. ""Say no to conservative curriculum"" read a protester's banner in Istanbul on the eve of the new academic year Textbooks explaining the idea of jihad are being rolled out in Turkey's religious vocational schools, known widely as Imam-Hatip high schools. They will then be offered to children in secondary schools as optional courses in a year's time. What does Islam say about jihad? One book titled Life of Muhammad the Prophet has been singled out for criticism, both for alleged sexism and its explanation of jihad. Jihad is defined as ""religious war"" by the dictionary of the Institute of Turkish Language.  But education ministry officials say the concept of jihad has been exploited by jihadist groups such as so-called Islamic State (IS). Critics say the textbooks define a wife's role as that of a mother, while the man is labelled ""stronger"" The education minister says the concept should be introduced as part of Islam in the context of ""loving a nation"". ""Jihad is an element in our religion. Our duty is to teach every concept deservedly and correct things that are wrongly perceived,"" he says. The same controversial textbook defines women's ""obedience"" to men as a form of ""worship"". But government officials say that is understandable as the book is about Islam and quotes Koranic verses. ""Allah says it, not me. Should I correct him, or what?"" said Alpaslan Durmus, who chairs the Board of Education. But two big protests went ahead at the weekend, with hashtags such as #NoToSexistCurriculum, #SayNoToNonScientificCurriculum and #DefendSecularEducation trending on social media in Turkey. One union leader called for protesters to ""say No to an outdated curriculum that bans science in the 21st Century"". This textbook covering the botched July 2016 coup cites the Koran, saying ""courage means standing against the cruel"" Opponents have accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of replacing the secular foundations of the Turkish republic with Islamic and conservative values. The president's own remarks on raising a ""pious generation"" have also caused alarm. Protesters in Ankara accused the ruling AKP of undermining Turkey's secular education system The education ministry also argues that critics are ""utterly ignorant"" for claiming that evolution has been completely excluded from the curriculum. Subjects such as mutation, modification and adaptation are explained in biology textbooks, without citing evolution itself. This theory is ""above students' level"" and should be taught in universities, says the minister. This will only confuse students, says Aysel Madra from Turkey's Education Reform Initiative, who finds it odd to posit that children can understand jihad but not evolution. Christian and Muslim creationists reject the theory of evolution Teachers' unions are also divided over the jihad debate. Turkey's Egitim Sen union sees an ""ideological and deliberate"" step by the government, while a more conservative rival union accuses critics of using anti-Islamic arguments. ""According to the Turkish Language Institute, jihad's primary meaning is 'religious war',"" says Egitim Sen leader Feray Aydogan. ""What is the point of explaining second and third meanings?"" The Imam-Hatip school textbook cites Koranic verses about the Faithful (Mu'min), the Impious (Kafir) and the Hypocrite (MunafÄ±k) Are Turkeyâs schools dropping evolution and teaching jihad?

Reality Check: Boris's Â£350m a week claim,"The claim:Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson stated in an article for the Daily Telegraph on 16 September that ""once we have settled our accounts, we will take back control of roughly Â£350m per week. It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of that money went on the NHS"". Reality Check verdict:Â£350m per week is an approximate sum for what is called the UK's ""gross contribution"" to the EU and does not take into account that the UK is given a ""rebate"" before any sum is paid to Brussels. The UK has a veto over the EU long-term budget including changes to that rebate. The money never leaves the Treasury and the government can control how it is spent. It would be up to the government to decide how they want to fund the NHS after Brexit. A key phrase in Mr Johnson's article is ""take back control"". This is a change from the slogan used in the 2016 EU referendum campaign which claimed that ""we send"" Â£350m per week to the EU. But does the language Mr Johnson is now using make a difference to the debate? To use the most up to date calendar year figures,published by the Treasury,external, in 2016 the UK's gross contribution to the EU was calculated as Â£327m per week. But the whole of that sum did not leave the Treasury's coffers because before anything was paid to the EU, the UK's rebate of Â£75m per week was applied. The total sum sent worked out at Â£252m per week. The rebate is easiest to understand as a percentage discount and comes up for discussion every seven years when the EU long-term budget is negotiated by EU leaders. It was negotiated by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and came into effect in 1985. All 28 EU countries, including the UK, have a veto over that long-term budget. That makes discussions very tough but it does mean that if the UK is unhappy with anything, including the rebate, it can prevent it from being approved. What was behind Boris Johnson's Brexit article? Johnson and stats chief in Â£350m Brexit row The long-term budget sets the maximum amount that can be spent over the seven-year period. Every year the amount the UK sends to the EU will be slightly different and the UK does not have a veto on this. But it cannot exceed the payment ceiling set by the long-term budget which the UK approves. When Tony Blair was prime minister, the UK parliament voted in favour of a reduction in the rebate as a proportion of our contribution to the EU budget. This was in support of the enlargement of the EU. Mr Johnson's article is different from the 2016 referendum bus line which said 'We send the EU Â£350m a week, let's fund the NHS instead' . He asserts that ""once we have settled our accounts"" it would be a ""fine thing"" if ""a lot of that money"" was spent on the NHS. That would be up to the government to decide. Currently the Treasury receives some money back from the EU for projects in the UK. In 2016 the Treasury received Â£87m per week. This included farming subsidies and regional aid. The EU also makes some payments directly to the private sector in the UK, for example to universities, research institutions and others. In 2014 (the latest year available) the Treasury estimated they totalled around Â£19m per week. When the UK  leaves the EU the government can decide whether to continue funding those projects or not.

Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights?,"Ryanair has said it will co-operate with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to ensure passengers are aware of their rights when flights are cancelled. The CAA's chief executiveAndrew Haines said he was ""furious""that the airline had not been complying with the law - by failing to offer to re-route passengers on rival airlines. Ryanair cancelled up to 50 flights a day through to the end of October, affecting 315,000 passengers It then cancelled another 18,000 flights between November and March, affecting the travel plans of another 400,000 passengers. All of Ryanair's flights are short or medium-haul, and the vast majority are to destinations within the EU, meaning that passengers are entitled to some very specific rules on compensation. You can apply for a refund. Even if it is only the outbound portion of the flight that is cancelled, you can still get a refund for the return leg, assuming you do not want to use it. Or you can chose an alternative flight - perhaps on an earlier or later date. In most cases Ryanair will offer you another flight with them. However, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says that if Ryanair fails to offer a place on an alternative Ryanair flight within a reasonable timeframe then you have the right to be booked onto a different airline at no extra cost. You are free to do this, but you will then lose out on any right to compensation, and probably be out of pocket as the alternative flight is likely to be more expensive by now. Consumer group Which? says that it is best to make Ryanair do the legwork - rather than cancel the Ryanair flight, rebook yourself on another airline, and try to reclaim any extra cost from Ryanair if the new flight is more expensive. By doing so, you might only get a refund for the cancelled Ryanair flight. Ryanair says it has sent emails to all those affected. There is adedicated page on the Ryanair website,externalwhere there are also links to forms to fill in for alternative arrangements. If you decide to cancel or change your flight without knowing whether it will be cancelled officially, you have no special rights under theEuropean Regulations,external. For that reason, the CAA advises passengers to go through the airline. You can claim compensation - but it is based strictly on the time of your actual arrival compared to when you originally expected to arrive. It also depends on when Ryanair told you about the cancellation. In the first wave of cancellations, many passengers were given less than a week's warning, so would have been entitled to compensation under EU rules, even if they were then found a flight with another airline. If the airline gave you more than 14 days' notice, it does not have to pay any compensation at all. As more than two weeks' notice has been given for the November to March cancellations, affected passengers will not be entitled to the extra compensation. If your re-booked flight arrives more than four hours later than the flight you were originally booked on, you can claim 250 euros - around Â£220. For flights over 1,500km, known as medium-haul, that goes up to 400 euros - around Â£350. However, if the new flight re-routes you via another destination, and you end up with a longer flight as a result - you can still claim compensation, but at a lower rate. If you are flying on a short-haul flight, and the re-routed flight is at least two hours late, you can claim 125 euros - around Â£110. If a medium-haul re-routed flight is at least three hours late, you can claim 200 euros - around Â£176 - depending on the time of take-off. If you receive less than a week's notice of the cancellation, the criteria for compensation are tighter. In this case, your short-haul flight only needs to arrive more than two hours after your original scheduled arrival time for you to claim 250 euros. If flying more than 1,500km, and the flight is at least three hours late, you can claim 400 euros. If a new short-haul flight is re-routed, taking off more than one hour before your original flight, but arriving two hours after it, you can claim 125 euros. A re-routed medium-haul flight needs to arrive at least three hours late for compensation to be paid. In such a case passengers would get 200 euros. If you find yourself stranded at the airport, you might also be entitled to an extra payment to cover short-term costs. For example, if you have had to wait an extra day to take the new flight you should be given accommodation, food, drink and access to communications - such as the cost of a couple of telephone calls.

What does Alternative for Germany (AfD) want?,"An AfD election poster in Berlin says ""Stop Islamisation"" The nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) has grown rapidly since it was formed in 2013 and is now the biggest opposition party in the Bundestag (national parliament), with 89 seats. Founded in 2013 as an anti-euro party, it has shifted its focus to immigration and Islam and is increasingly seen as far-right in tone. Yes. It may not have started out as a far-right party but it soon embraced far-right policies and many of its leaders have espoused far-right rhetoric. AfD co-chairman AlexanderAlexander Gauland has talked of fighting an ""invasion of foreigners""and the party openly focuses on Islam and migration, seeing Islam as alien to German society. Some of the party's rhetoric has been tinged with Nazi overtones. The AfD sits in the same political family asFrance's far-right National Frontand Austria's far-right Freedom Party - as well as the populist, anti-Islam Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) of Geert Wilders. Nigel Farage, former leader of the UK's anti-EU party Ukip, took part in their 2017 election campaign. The party's leader in the eastern state of Thuringia, BjÃ¶rn HÃ¶cke, once described Berlin's Holocaust memorial as a ""monument of shame"" and called for a ""180-degree turnaround"" in Germany's handling of its Nazi past. Picking up the same theme, Alexander Gauland trivialised the Nazi era as ""just a speck of bird's muck in more than 1,000 years of successful Germany history"". The AfD has managed to attract voters from the centre right and even the centre left but in the words of Verena Hartmann, a moderate MP who left the party in January 2020 because it was becoming to extreme: ""Those who resist this extreme right-wing movement are mercilessly pushed out of the party."" In the words of Matthias Quent, a German expert on the far right based in Thuringia: ""Not everyone in the AfD is ideologically far right, but anyone in the party or even voting for the party is supporting a party that has a far-right objective."" Austrian far right challenges poll result The AfD has only existed for seven years and its leadership has gone through regular, turbulent changes. Its best-known figures are co-leader Alexander Gauland, parliament group leader Alice Weidel and BjÃ¶rn HÃ¶cke, the party's most significant figure in its eastern heartland. Alice Weidel and lawyer Alexander Gauland are among AfD's best-known national figures Alice Weidelis a 41-year-old economist who divides her time between Berlin and Switzerland, where she lives with a woman adopted as a child from Sri Lanka and their two children. She is one of a small number of women in prominent positions in the AfD and argues that her presence as one of its top candidates proves the party is not homophobic. Alexander Gauland, a 78-year old lawyer, has been with AfD from its Eurosceptic start and his political career began decades earlier with the centre right. As AfD moved to the right so did he, making a number of remarks condemned as racist. In 2016 he talked about footballer JÃ©rÃ´me Boateng, who was born in Berlin to a Ghanaian father. ""[Germans] like him as a football player. But they don't want to have a Boateng as their neighbour."" German fury at Holocaust memorial remark There was shock as the man elected Thuringia's state premier, Thomas Kemmerich (left), shook hands with BjÃ¶rn HÃ¶cke BjÃ¶rn HÃ¶cke,AfD's party leader in the eastern state of Thuringia, has been behind some of its biggest controversies. He is also seen as an inspiration to many of the MPs elected to the Bundestag in 2017 and heads a stridently nationalist group called FlÃ¼gel. He helped AfD in Thuringia push the centre right into third place in state elections in October 2019. When he criticised the idea of a Holocaust memorial in the heart of German capital, the party moved to expel him but apparently changed its mind. Mr HÃ¶cke helped trigger a national crisis in February 2020 by helping a liberal candidate become state premier in Thuringia. Not since World War Two had the far right played kingmaker in German politics. How far right caused earthquake in German politics JÃ¶rg Meuthen, co-leader of the party with Alexander Gauland, is seen as a relative moderate. After the election result he insisted the AfD did not accept racism or xenophobia, but in the same breath complained that ""in some German cities, I struggle to find Germans on the streets"". The AfD's big success came in challenging Angela Merkel's decision to let in around 1.3 million undocumented migrants and refugees, mainly from the Middle East, from 2015. They tapped into anxieties over the influence of Islam, calling for a commission to investigate the chancellor's ""breaches of the law"" in allowing them in. The party made the influx the focus of its party platform. There were contacts with the anti-immigration Pegida movement, which staged weekly marches against what it called ""the Islamisation of the West"". Pegida took hold mainly in eastern cities such as Dresden, and it is in the ex-communist east that the AfD has had its biggest successes, attracting more men than any other party. Odd perhaps, in that the biggest concentrations of immigrants are not in those areas. This video can not be played The moment a famous refugee meets an AfD supporter AfD adopted some of Pegida's anti-establishment rhetoric, such as the slogan ""LÃ¼genpresse"" (""lying press""), which was used by the Nazis. Germany must reintroduce permanent border controls and the EU's external borders must be ""completely shut"", the AfD says. That position contradicts Schengen - the EU's free movement zone, covering most of Europe, where border checks are generally minimal. Pegida - seen here in Leipzig - fuelled opposition to Islam and the Merkel ""open-door"" policy on migrants One of its former leaders, Frauke Petry, once said German police should ""if necessary""shoot at migrantsseeking to enter the country illegally. And she was seen as an AfD moderate. AfD adopted an explicitly anti-Islam policy in May 2016 and its 2017 election manifesto had a section on why ""Islam does not belong to Germany"".  ""Burkas? We like bikinis,"" read one of its most garish posters. This video can not be played Is Germany's AfD racist? The party would ban foreign funding of mosques in Germany, ban the burka (full-body veil) and the Muslim call to prayer, and put all imams through a state vetting procedure. ""Moderate"" Muslims who accepted integration were ""valued members of society"", its argued, while suggesting that multiculturalism did not work. An estimated three million people of Turkish origin live in Germany, most of them Muslims. AfD has also built its success on challenging taboos and flirting with racism. Alexander Gauland drew criticism for declaring that Germans should be ""proud"" of their soldiers in both world wars. While SS units were notorious for German atrocities in World War Two, the regular armed forces also committed many war crimes. Frauke Petry once tried to end the taboo on the Nazi-era termvÃ¶lkisch,which comes from the German word for people but was hijacked by the Nazis to define those they saw as belonging to the German race. German storm over 'pride in WW2' remarks German fury at Holocaust memorial remark AfD has come a long way since it was launched in early 2013 to challenge eurozone bailouts in Greece and elsewhere, and reject the EU's arguments for keeping the euro. It still promises to abandon the euro and reintroduce the Deutschmark. But its first leader, Bernd Lucke, left the party in 2015, arguing that it was becoming increasingly xenophobic. Its anti-euro policy echoes the Euroscepticism of other populist parties in Europe. If the EU fails to reform and continues centralising, the AfD says, the party will seek to pull Germany out of the EU.

Plea after man's Snowdon climb in pants,"Nathan French became ill when he reached Snowdon's summit in his pants People climbing Snowdon are being urged to wear appropriate clothing after a man who reached the summit in just his pants developed hypothermia. Nathan French, 19, took to the highest peak in England and Wales in his Superman underwear to raise money for charity. But a paramedic was called to meet the Liverpool student after his descent. Phil Benbow, of North Wales Mountain Rescue Association, said they were seeing more unprepared visitors. Mr French, of Halewood, Merseyside, decided to take on the challenge to raise money for a dementia charity after his grandmother developed the condition. He said he became unwell at the summit after completing the 1,085m (3,559ft) climb on 9 September and returned to the bottom on the Snowdon Mountain Railway. ""I keep fit and I am healthy but I was taken by surprise by how cold I got,"" he said. Mr French was raising money for charity ""I was shaking uncontrollably and they covered me in tin foil. ""On the train down I started to feel really sick and I started going deaf and my eyesight started going funny. I started getting really emotional so my dad, who was with me, decided to call an ambulance. ""The paramedic who met me checked me over and said I was showing early signs of hypothermia."" The Welsh Ambulance Service confirmed it responded to the call. ""We sent a paramedic in a rapid response vehicle and a first responder and a man was checked over at the scene, but did not require hospital treatment,"" a spokesman added. Mr Benbow, who also volunteers withLlanberis Mountain Rescue,external- the team that covers Snowdon - said while it was ""laudable""  to undertake charity treks up Snowdon, it was essential that people dressed appropriately for the conditions, planned their trip and checked the weather forecast. Mr French was taken off the mountain on the Snowdon Mountain Railway ""We have a significant number of calls every year about people on Snowdon who are not equipped properly,"" he said. ""They make an assumption that because there's a cafe at the top and a train, that it's a walk in the park. It's not - it is the highest mountain in England and Wales and people need to respect that. ""Our team has been called to 173 rescues so far this year and that will be over 200 by the end of the year - the third year in a row we will have topped 200. ""That's way too many for our volunteers who have to give up time with their family or at work. People just need to think ahead.""

Cyclist breaks around the world record,"This video can not be played Endurance athlete Mark Beaumont has smashed the record for circumnavigation of the world on a bike Mark Beaumont has broken the world record for cycling around the world - by 44 days. The 34-year-old, from Perthshire, arrived in Paris one day ahead of schedule having cycled the 18,000-mile route in 79 days. He set a new world record of 194 days in 2008. Since then it has been broken by other riders, with the previous record set at 123 days. To achieve his goal, Mark needed to cycle an average 240 miles a day. He was on his bike for more than 16 hours a day and only slept for five hours each night. Five amazing facts about Mark Beaumont's 80-day challenge Inspired by Jules Verne's classic adventure novel Around The World In Eighty Days, he began his journey in Paris on 2 July and cycled through Europe, Russia, Mongolia and China. He then cycled across Australia, up through New Zealand and across North America before the final ""sprint finish"" thorough Portugal, Spain and France. During the trip, Mark was also awarded the Guinness World Records title for the most miles cycled in a month, from Paris to Perth in Australia, verified at 7,031 miles (11,315km). This video can not be played Endurance cyclist Mark Beaumont smashed the previous record of 123 days On completing the expedition, the Edinburgh-based cyclist, said: ""This has been, without doubt, the most punishing challenge I have ever put my body and mind through. The physical and mental stamina required for each day was a challenge in itself, but I had an amazing support team around me. ""The success of cycling around the world in 80 days shows that what seemed impossible is possible and has redefined the limits of endurance sport. ""Each stage brought different challenges including different climates, which I had to adjust to quickly. Stage one through Russia and Mongolia was unknown territory, so to complete this phase and come out with a second Guinness World Records title is a real achievement."" Mark Beaumont on the last leg of his journey He added: ""I am very grateful for the support I've received from people all over the world, from fellow cyclists joining me on the road to messages and wishes online. ""The experience has been incredible, and I'm excited to share this journey for years to come."" During the trip the cyclist was exposed to sub-zero temperatures in the southern hemisphere and smog from forest fires in North America. He had two falls - one of them in Russia  requiring emergency dental treatment from his back-up team - but otherwise everything went to plan. This video can not be played Mark Beaumont's route around the world He said: ""Ultimately, the magic ingredient that you need to be able to do something like this is grit, just the ability to suffer. ""Physically, of course, I'm incredibly sore but what you learn very quickly is there's a big difference between hurting and being injured. I'm not injured, although it will take time for the body to recover. ""For one thing, I think I'd struggle to walk up and down a flight of steps at the moment because I've not really walked since 2 July."" A crowd of well-wishers was waiting for the cyclist as he pedalled up to the Arc de Triomphe, completing the 240 miles of this last leg. Mark began long-distance cycling at the age of 12 when he rode 145 miles across Scotland. He was supported by a team including a mechanic, nutritionist, physiotherapist and manager. The adventurer is raising funds for Orkidstudio, which works to benefit communities worldwide through innovative architecture and construction. 5 amazing facts about Mark Beaumont's 80 day challenge Cycling around the world in 80 days.

Germans fined over pensioner left to die,"Essen police released this photo showing the collapsed man A judge has imposed heavy fines on three people in the western German city of Essen for ignoring an elderly man who collapsed next to bank cash machines. The 83-year-old man hit his head on the tiles and died a week later. A fourth person had also ignored him, but was not ruled fit to stand trial. Medics were only alerted by the fifth customer at the scene. The customers were identified in CCTV footage, which showed them stepping round the critically ill pensioner. It took 20 minutes for the man to receive first aid. Under German law, failure to respond to a medical emergency is punishable by a fine or up to a year in jail. People are required at least to alert emergency services, if they lack first aid skills. The court imposed a â¬3,600 (Â£3,180; $4,303) fine on a woman aged 39. The other two fines were: â¬2,800 for a man aged 61 and â¬2,400 for a man aged 55 Do you have to rescue someone in danger? In similar cases a fine is often agreed out of court between defence lawyers and prosecutors, the German news website SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung reports. CCTV footage revealed four customers simply avoiding the suffering man The incident - at a Deutsche Bank branch in Essen, in the western, industrial Ruhr region - triggered anguished debate in Germany. Some argued that it symbolised a coarsening of society, with many people indifferent to their fellow citizens' welfare. The judge justified the fines by saying ""nobody wanted to help"". Prosecutor Nina Rezai was quoted as saying the fines must be heavy because ""the duty to help a fellow human being was blatantly violated"". She said the fines would send a signal that ""we're not going in the direction of a society that looks away"". A medical report into the death found that the man's head injury was so severe that he would have died even if a medic had reached him earlier. Two of the defendants told the court they had believed the pensioner to be homeless. Some homeless people did use the area with cash machines as a shelter at the time, as it was accessible without a bank card, and the 39-year-old woman who was fined said she had been harassed by them previously. However, another prosecutor was sceptical about that argument, saying the customers would have seen that the man was well dressed, lying in the middle of the room and had no bags carrying belongings or a sleeping bag. The Essen prosecutor, Birgit JÃ¼rgens, said she had ""never experienced anything like this"". She has been working in the state prosecutor's office since 1991.

Storm grows and threatens Caribbean,"This video can not be played Watch: The islanders caught between hurricanes Hurricane Maria has strengthened to a major category three hurricane, US forecasters say, as it heads towards the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean. It is due to hit on Monday night local time. Maria is moving roughly along the same path as Irma, the hurricane that devastated the region this month. The authorities fear Maria could whip up and throw the debris left behind by Hurricane Irma. Lieutenant Colonel Paul Maynard, a Royal Marine deployed to the British Virgin Islands, told the Press Association the hurricane could pick the debris up, ""spin it around, and throw it like ammunition"". ""It could cause potentially more casualties and fatalities than Irma did,"" he added. Hurricane Irma: A visual guide Damage mapped The UK's International Development Secretary, Priti Patel, said: ""British troops, police and aid experts are working relentlessly to get help to the victims of Hurricane Irma. Those same individuals will now be tasked with also preparing for the impact of Maria."" Hurricane warnings have been issued for Guadeloupe, Dominica, St Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, Martinique, St Lucia and the US and British Virgin Islands. A hurricane watch is in effect for Puerto Rico, St Martin, St Barts, Saba, St Eustatius and Anguilla. Some of these islands are still recovering after being hit by Irma - a category five hurricane which left at least 37 people dead and caused billions of dollars' worth of damage. In itslatest update on Monday,external, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that Maria had maximum sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph). They warned that heavy rainfall caused by the hurricane ""could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides"". The eye of the storm is 100 miles east of Martinique, and Maria is moving west-northwest at about 13mph. ""Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the NHC said. In the French territory of Guadeloupe, schools, businesses and government buildings have all been closed and severe flooding is predicted in low-lying parts of the islands. Preparations have also begun in Puerto Rico, where Maria is expected to bring strong winds on Tuesday. The Leeward Islands - where Maria will first strike - includes Antigua and Barbuda. The latter island was evacuated after beingdevastatedby Irma. The NHC says that Maria could produce a ""dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves"" that would raise water levels by as much as 2.7 metres (9ft). It also forecasts a maximum potential rainfall of 51cm (20in) in some areas of the central and southern Leeward Islands - including Puerto Rico and the US and British Virgin Islands - through to Wednesday night. The destruction of Barbuda Drone footage of Saint-Martin after Irma Earlier this month, Irma left more than two-thirds of homes on the Dutch side of the island of St Martin (known as Sint Maarten) uninhabitable, with no electricity, gas or drinking water. The French government has said its side of St Martin - known as Saint-Martin - sustained about â¬1.2bn ($1.44bn; Â£1.1bn) in damage, with nine deaths across Saint-Martin and nearby St Barts. This video can not be played A BBC team visited Caribbean islands that have been devastated by Hurricane Irma On the British Virgin Islands, entire neighbourhoods were flattened. After a visit to the area, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson described the damage as something ""you see in images from the First World War"". In pictures: Irma devastates British Virgin Islands Virgin boss Richard Branson, who has a home in the Virgin Islands, has been tweeting ahead of the Maria's predicted arrival, warning people to stay safe.

The Puerto Rican government has issued a statement saying it expects the hurricane to make landfall there as a category three on Tuesday. The US territory escaped the worst of the damage from Irma - although it experienced widespread power cuts - and it has been an important hub for getting relief to islands that were more badly affected. ""Puerto Rico is our lifeline,"" Judson Burdon, a resident of Anguilla, told Reuters news agency. ""We had two volunteer flights cancel because of the weather that is coming."" American military units were evacuated from the US Virgin Islands on Sunday Irma also hit the US, where several dozen deaths were linked to the hurricane. Nearly 6.9 million homes were left without power in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama. A second hurricane, Jose, is also active in the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 90mph. The centre of the storm wasabout 265 miles east-south-east of Cape Hatteras,externalin North Carolina, the NHC said in its advisory at 18:00 GMT on Monday.

Parsons Green: Tube driver's account reveals 'pandemonium',"The driver of the train targetedin Friday's terror attackat Parsons Green Tube station has revealed the ""pandemonium"" which followed the explosion, in his official account. A initial London Underground investigation into the incident, documented in a paper seen by the BBC, has given a snapshot of how staff reacted when an improvised bomb partially exploded in a train, injuring 30 people during the morning rush hour. The report also revealed initial communications between the driver and the service controller were ""hampered"", while CCTV images showed ""a scene of confusion and distress"". When he arrived at Parsons Green, he operated the train doors as normal and carried out his platform duties. As he was about to shut the doors to depart, he noticed on the in-cab CCTV that a lot of passengers were running out of the rear car. He immediately opened the cab door to find out what was happening. Some passengers were shouting ""fire"" and others were shouting ""it's an attack"". The train operator stated that he returned to the cab to raise a mayday alarm. He asked for traction current to be switched off immediately. He then returned to the platform and told passengers that were stuck on the platform due to the pandemonium and small size of the staircase to follow him. He took the customers on to the track away from the trains via the ramp. He took the customers as far as the sidings and instructed them to stay low and out of sight. At this time there were about 50-70 people on the track with the train operator and because he was not sure what type of attack was going on, he returned to the station platform to get more information. On arriving back on the platform, he was met by the station supervisor, who informed the train operator that a bomb had gone off in the last car. The train operator returned to the sidings to lead the passengers on the track back to the station, and eventually out of the station. The supervisor and his staff were at the gateline when there was a sudden stampede of passengers from platform two. Customers started jumping over the barriers to get out of the station. The supervisor plunged the gates using the emergency button to keep all gates open. He instructed his staff to continue to help people out of the station while he went to investigate the reason for the stampede. After checking the station cameras, he saw that the platform was still very busy with people trying frantically to exit and others running on the tracks, the station supervisor put on his hi-vis and went to the platform. However, the stairs were so busy and people were being trampled on by those pushing from behind to exit the platform. The supervisor called his staff and together they helped the fallen and injured out of the station. They went back and forth and kept calming the crowd, to walk orderly out of the station. The supervisor was eventually able to get to the platform. He had found out by enquiring from passengers, while helping them out of the station, that there had been an explosion and fire in the last car of the train on platform two. The supervisor saw the train operator and informed him of the situation. The service controller was informed while the train operator went back to the track to retrieve the passengers on the track with him. The station supervisor continued to evacuate the platform as some passengers kept going to the burning item on the train in order to take pictures.

Murray: Tennis women make same sacrifices as men,"Andy Murray practised against both boys and girls in his early years, and went on to play with some of the world's top female tennis players in mixed doubles. He hit the headlines recently for his comments on gender in sport, including once when he corrected a journalist's casual sexism. Here, he writes about his hopes for women in tennis. I've never set out to be a spokesperson for women's equality. My experience of working with Amelie Mauresmo gave me a small insight into attitudes to women in sport and, because it was unusual for a male tennis player to work with a female coach, I am often asked about that. Working with Amelie was, for me, because she was the right person for the job, and not a question of her sex at all. However, it became clear to me that she wasn't always treated the same as men in similar jobs, and so I felt I had to speak out about that. Murray and his former coach, Amelie Mauresmo Since then, I have been asked about women's equality and I would find it hard to look any of the top female tennis players in the eye if I did not speak my mind. This video can not be played Andy Murray corrects a journalist over gender claim People often underestimate the amount of work that it takes to become a top tennis player. And that work ethic is the same whether you are a man or a woman. There are hours spent in the gym, on court, in physio, travelling, analysing matches and opponents, talking with your team, managing your body, and of course, making plenty of sacrifices. Anyone who has spent any time with any of the top women will know that they make those same sacrifices and are as determined and committed to winning as any of the top men on the tour. Serena Williams is congratulated by her sister Venus after winning the Women's singles final at the 2017 Australian Open When I was asked by the BBC what I thought about girls and boys playing sport together until adolescence, the answer was fairly straightforward for me: I think it's a great idea. A very young Andy Murray (R) playing swing ball - he started playing tennis at the age of three In tennis we benefit, of course, from having the game of mixed doubles, so men and women, boys and girls, are used to this idea. Some of the most fun I've had on court has been when playing mixed doubles - with Heather Watson and Laura Robson at both the Hopman Cup in Australia and at the Olympics. Although they probably wouldn't say the same about playing with me! Heather Watson and Andy Murray during a mixed doubles match in the 2016 Hopman Cup As a youngster growing up in Dunblane, my mum and dad would regularly encourage me to practise against girls at Dunblane Tennis Club. I also used to practise with Svetlana Kuznetsova sometimes when I trained in Barcelona. As a young boy, Murray practised against both boys and girls Playing mixed sport has huge benefits like making friendships, building confidence and saving money for schools and clubs. So much at an early age is about ball skills, hand-eye co-ordination and generating a competitive spirit anyway, and not about strength and speed, so would it not make sense for these skills to be taught to boys and girls alike, at the same time? BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. In 2017, we're challenging them to tackle four of the biggest problems facing women today - the glass ceiling, female illiteracy, harassment in public spaces and sexism in sport. With your help, they'll be coming up with real-life solutions and we want you to get involved with your ideas. Find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,externaland Twitter and use #100Women Having a mother who was as interested and involved in sport as mine was, it has always felt very natural for me that girls should be as engaged in sport as boys. I now know that's not the case, and that many girls drop out once they become teenagers. It is something my mum is passionate about changing. She has a programme called Miss-Hits which teaches girls the basics of tennis - currently boys outnumber girls four to one in the sport. She is making progress, but there is still a need for many more female coaches in sport generally, and far more support at the top level, to make any real impact. Andy Murray with his mum, Judy Female sportswomen rarely get as much air-time as men, and there are still not enough women in the top jobs in sport, but things are improving. Tennis has come a long way in the past 35 years since the US Open first gave equal pay to men and women. And it's great that all the Slams pay their male and female champions the same. No other sport is doing as much as tennis, and it's great to be part of a sport that is leading the way. Hopefully tennis can put pressure on other sports to do the same. The London Olympics also provided a great platform for women's sport in the UK. We had some brilliant role models like Jess Ennis-Hill and Nicola Adams who were normal British girls who achieved greatness and it will be interesting to see whether that did really inspire a generation. Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill is a great role model We are seeing important strides in other traditionally male-dominated sports - the ICC has worked hard at getting girls to play cricket at an amateur level, and of course, the England ladies winning the Cricket World Cup was huge in terms of publicity for the sport. Football is also moving forwards, and it's great to see so much women's football on TV now. In rugby, it was a shame to see the RFU end contracts for the England women's team in the 15-a-side game - that seems a backward step in a sport that had obviously been growing its female playing base. But hopefully that won't put women off trying the game if they really want to. Traditionally male-dominated sports have invested significantly in raising the level of play in their top women, so that the performances are more attractive to big crowds, column inches and TV coverage. This has happened in recent years in football, hockey, cricket and rugby in particular. Now they are getting much more exposure which is great - if more girls can see women competing at a top level, it will hopefully encourage more girls into sport across the board. In general, I think the future is positive. We've got more female role models than ever before, more female commentators than ever before and more people championing the rights for women in sport than ever before. Things are moving in a positive direction and I am excited about a future in which the playing field might be level for all.

From successful musician to mortgage pioneer,"Daniel's career has been eventful Daniel Hegarty, the founder of mortgage broker app Habito, does not have the physique of a tech geek. The 35-year-old's arms are muscled and densely covered in tattoos, a legacy from his time, perhaps, as a successful guitarist. Even by the standards of tech entrepreneurs, Daniel's background is unconventional. Leaving school in London before he was 16, he says: ""I guess I was a bit of a rebel. I wanted to do what I wanted to do. ""I just took days off, and when the local guitar shop offered me extra days' work, I decided I'd cut down on my school days."" Then he got suspended. But despite departing secondary education without any qualifications, it was not the disaster it would have been for most. A talented guitarist, his punk group, Serum, got signed by the same record label as Boy George, and went on the road earning the princely sum of Â£100 a week per band member. Daniel spent a decade as a professional musician and songwriter Before he was 20-years-old, Daniel was living in Los Angeles. But he gave up on becoming famous in his own right to instead write for, and play, with headline acts such as Robbie Williams, S Club 7, Pink and the Sugababes. After some 10 years of this, he'd had enough: ""It's a strange job. To make money you have to make a certain amount of bad music. ""And I came to the conclusion I was tired of staring at the back of teenage pop stars."" So he moved back to the UK in 2007 with nothing to do, before a music industry contact came to the rescue. ""A friend of mine was an opera singer who had a pop hit as Tina B,"" he says. ""I called Tina and asked if she knew anyone who could give someone without any qualifications a job. ""She said she knew a couple of crazy tech guys who needed people."" A meeting over a cup of coffee got him in. The crazy tech guys turned out to be nucleus of the subsequently much-criticised payday loan lender Wonga. ""There were just a handful of us,"" says Daniel. ""Between us, we did whatever needed doing."" At Wonga he discovered that he did, in fact, have another string to his bow other than music. Daniel Hegarty: ""I didn't chose Wonga, Wonga chose me"" ""It quite quickly emerged I was a massive geek,"" he says. ""I'd spend my evenings reading text books on pure maths, and doing online courses from Stanford University [in California]. ""Within a couple of months I was running a lot of the tech stuff."" But after a warm welcome from borrowers, Wonga's name became increasingly toxic. In 2014 it wrote off Â£220m of debts for 330,000 struggling customers after discussions with regulators, and put in place new checks as to whether people could afford the loans they were taking out. Was Daniel embarrassed to say he'd worked at Wonga? ""I didn't choose Wonga, Wonga chose me."" But, as one of its designers, could he be accused of failing to assess the risks properly? ""My job was fundamentally building the website - how to get someone to show up and share their info, and how to get the money lent when it was wanted, and collected when it was due."" He left as Wonga mushroomed to an international business with 1,000 employees, and he was, again, spending too much time on the road. Once more at a loose end, Daniel did what rock musicians are often thought to do: ""I sat in my pants on my sofa."" The idea for Habito came from Daniel's attempt to buy his first home The spark of the idea for online mortgage brokerage Habito came from his attempt to buy his first home. Daniel nearly lost out on the property after a series of mistakes by his mortgage broker. He says they put down his wife's name, twice, alongside his own name. This held up the process for 10 days, and when the form was corrected the third, extra name that was removed was not the duplicated wife, but his own. Now it appeared his wife had sparked a clone who was also part of the loan. The seller was on the brink of pulling out. Daniel says: ""I thought deeply about what I could do for a couple of months, and this is the best I came up with. But I knew nothing about mortgages."" So he started studying the industry. He spoke to mortgage brokers, lenders, and regulators in order to understand how it all worked, and he set about building Habito. One criticism of the Habito app is that it removes the human touch. Daniel says that at Habito there is a point at which you can speak to a real human being, but critics still say such an online-based system is less likely to find the perfect type of product for the borrower. Jonathan Harris, director of independent mortgage broker Anderson Harris, says: ""There are so many additional criteria that are required nowadays in a mortgage market search. For example, the type of employment/self-employment, how income is made up, the type of contract, the type of property. ""While we welcome anything that speeds up the often torturously slow mortgage application process, face-to-face advice or over the phone will have a place for a while yet - although mortgage lenders and brokers need to improve their technological offerings."" Habito has now lent Â£250m to 50,000 borrowers, says Daniel As it stands, the world of mortgage broking is highly fragmented. The UK's biggest player, London and Country, has only 6% of the domestic market to itself, so there is plenty of scope for challengers. Daniel says there is simply ""no visible limit to Habito's growth"". The company has been going for 16 months, he says, and every month it has grown 20%, so ""every week is our busiest ever"". He says the London-based company has so far lent Â£250m to 50,000 borrowers, and employees have grown from eight to 45. Daniel adds that running a proper business, initially seemed as unreal as being a rock star. ""At first I felt like I was dreaming, going round telling people I was the 'made up' CEO of a 'made-up' business."" But he says he can still be awkward. ""I will do what I want to do"". Daniel has also been able to return an early favour. Remember the former opera-pop star? She's now working for him as his corporate lawyer. ""There are quite a few second lifers in my business,"" he says.

Cyclist detained over pedestrian death,"Alliston, now 20, was travelling on a fixed-wheel track bike with no front brakes before crashing into 44-year-old Kim Briggs A cyclist who knocked over and killed a 44-year-old woman in east London has been sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders' institution. Charlie Alliston, then 18, was travelling on a fixed-wheel track bike with no frontbrakes before crashing into Kim Briggsin February last year. He was cleared of her manslaughter, but found guilty of bodily harm by ""wanton or furious driving"". Judge Wendy Joseph described Alliston as ""an accident waiting to happen"". Sentencing at the Old Bailey, the judge said:  ""I am satisfied in some part it was this so-called thrill that motivated you to ride without a front brake shouting and swearing at pedestrians to get out of the way. ""I have no doubt you are wrong in this. You were an accident waiting to happen. ""The victim could have been any pedestrian. It was in fact Mrs Kim Briggs."" Kim Briggs died after being injured while crossing Old Street in Shoreditch last February Mother-of-two Kim Briggs was crossing Old Street during her lunch break when she was hit. She suffered serious head injuries, including a fractured skull, and died a week later in hospital. Alliston, now 20, raised his eyebrows as the judge said his sentence would be custodial. In a series of posts on social media, he described how he twice warned Mrs Briggs to get out of the way. He wrote: ""We collided pretty hard, our heads hit together, hers went into the floor and ricocheted into mine."" He complained: ""It's not my fault people either think they are invincible or have zero respect for cyclists."" Alliston said he was not aware a brake was a legal requirement to ride on the road In a statement outside court, Mrs Briggs' widower Matthew, from Lewisham, south London,called for the introduction of new laws, including causing death by dangerous cycling. He said the case demonstrated the ""gap in the law when it comes to dealing with death or serious injury by dangerous cycling."" ""To have to rely on either manslaughter at one end, or a Victorian law that doesn't even mention causing death at the other end, tells us there is a gap"", he said. ""The fact that what happened to Kim is rare is not a reason to be no remedy."" Alliston's lawyer Mark Wyeth QC told the court that his client had ""a lot of internal sense of emotional turmoil but keeps this hidden as a coping strategy."" The court heard Alliston was depressed, had broken up with his girlfriend and lost his job. Prosecutors took the unprecedented step of bringing a manslaughter charge due to the unusually grave circumstances of the case. The other offence of wanton and furious driving, under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, carries a maximum sentence of two years in jail. Alliston, from Bermondsey, south London, had denied both charges against him. âReckless cyclists must learn from deathâ Cyclist guilty over pedestrian's death Brakes 'would have made no difference' 'Why I ride a bike without a brake' HM Courts & Tribunals Service - GOV.UK At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Storm strengthens and threatens Caribbean,"This video can not be played Watch: The islanders caught between hurricanes Hurricane Maria has strengthened to a major category three hurricane, US forecasters say, as it heads towards the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean. It is due to hit on Monday night local time. Maria is moving roughly along the same path as Irma, the hurricane that devastated the region this month. The authorities fear Maria could whip up and throw the debris left behind by Hurricane Irma. Lieutenant Colonel Paul Maynard, a Royal Marine deployed to the British Virgin Islands, told the Press Association the hurricane could pick the debris up, ""spin it around, and throw it like ammunition"". ""It could cause potentially more casualties and fatalities than Irma did,"" he added. Hurricane Irma: A visual guide Damage mapped The UK's International Development Secretary, Priti Patel, said: ""British troops, police and aid experts are working relentlessly to get help to the victims of Hurricane Irma. Those same individuals will now be tasked with also preparing for the impact of Maria."" Hurricane warnings have been issued for Guadeloupe, Dominica, St Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, Martinique, St Lucia and the US and British Virgin Islands. A hurricane watch is in effect for Puerto Rico, St Martin, St Barts, Saba, St Eustatius and Anguilla. Some of these islands are still recovering after being hit by Irma - a category five hurricane which left at least 37 people dead and caused billions of dollars' worth of damage. In itslatest update on Monday,external, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that Maria had maximum sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph). They warned that heavy rainfall caused by the hurricane ""could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides"". The eye of the storm is 100 miles east of Martinique, and Maria is moving west-northwest at about 13mph. ""Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the NHC said. In the French territory of Guadeloupe, schools, businesses and government buildings have all been closed and severe flooding is predicted in low-lying parts of the islands. Preparations have also begun in Puerto Rico, where Maria is expected to bring strong winds on Tuesday. The Leeward Islands - where Maria will first strike - includes Antigua and Barbuda. The latter island was evacuated after beingdevastatedby Irma. The NHC says that Maria could produce a ""dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves"" that would raise water levels by as much as 2.7 metres (9ft). It also forecasts a maximum potential rainfall of 51cm (20in) in some areas of the central and southern Leeward Islands - including Puerto Rico and the US and British Virgin Islands - through to Wednesday night. The destruction of Barbuda Drone footage of Saint-Martin after Irma Earlier this month, Irma left more than two-thirds of homes on the Dutch side of the island of St Martin (known as Sint Maarten) uninhabitable, with no electricity, gas or drinking water. The French government has said its side of St Martin - known as Saint-Martin - sustained about â¬1.2bn ($1.44bn; Â£1.1bn) in damage, with nine deaths across Saint-Martin and nearby St Barts. This video can not be played A BBC team visited Caribbean islands that have been devastated by Hurricane Irma On the British Virgin Islands, entire neighbourhoods were flattened. After a visit to the area, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson described the damage as something ""you see in images from the First World War"".

The Puerto Rican government has issued a statement saying it expects the hurricane to make landfall there as a category three on Tuesday. The US territory escaped the worst of the damage from Irma - although it experienced widespread power cuts - and it has been an important hub for getting relief to islands that were more badly affected. ""Puerto Rico is our lifeline,"" Judson Burdon, a resident of Anguilla, told Reuters news agency. ""We had two volunteer flights cancel because of the weather that is coming."" American military units were evacuated from the US Virgin Islands on Sunday Irma also hit the US, where several dozen deaths were linked to the hurricane. Nearly 6.9 million homes were left without power in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama. A second hurricane, Jose, is also active in the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 90mph. The centre of the storm wasabout 265 miles east-south-east of Cape Hatteras,externalin North Carolina, the NHC said in its advisory at 18:00 GMT on Monday.

Ryanair to publish flight cancellation list,"This video can not be played Passenger: 'Communications with Ryanair has been absolutely atrocious' Ryanair has published full details of which of its flights are being cancelled between now and 28 October. Customers whose flights have been axed will also receive an email, chief executive Michael O'Leary has said. The budget airline is cancelling 40-50 flights every day for the next six weeks, after it admittedit had ""messed up""the planning of pilot holidays. Mr O'Leary said most people would be transferred to an alternative Ryanair flight on the same day. If not, they would be moved to flights the day before or the day after, and the airline would meet its obligations over compensation. Details of all the cancelled flights are availableon the Ryanair website,external. More than 200 of the cancelled flights are either into or out of London Stansted, with a handful in Edinburgh, Manchester and Birmingham also affected. Ryanair faces up to 20 million euros in compensation claims Cancelled by text: Ryanair passengers react Ryanair: What should I do if my flight is cancelled? The airline said it was cancelling flights at airports where it ran the busiest schedules, so it would be easier to accommodate passengers on alternative flights. Rome, Milan, Brussels and Barcelona airports will also see a significant number of flights, either or in or out, cancelled. Mr O'Leary said around 400,000 passengers would be directly affected, but he said a decision had been made to disrupt the plans of 2% of travellers in order to offer a better service to the remaining customers. Changes to the way the airline organises its holiday year have left Ryanair with a backlog of staff leave, meaning there is a shortage of pilots on standby over the next six weeks. That meant any minor disruptions to flights, due to problems with air traffic control capacity, strikes, or weather disruptions were causing knock-on delays, because the airline did not have the flexibility it needed from back-up crews, said Mr O'Leary. After 1 November, when the lighter winter schedule begins, there will not be any need for cancellations, he said. He said they were also asking to buy back leave from pilots and alter the holiday schedule. Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would honour all of its obligations to compensate passengers under EU regulations but would not book passengers onto flights with rival carriers. ""We will not pay for flights on other airlines, no. It is not part of the EU261 entitlement,"" he said, referring toEuropean passenger rights legislation,external. He said the airline did not have an overall shortage of pilots, but said they had ""messed up"" the rosters for September and October. ""This is our mess-up. When we make a mess in Ryanair we come out with our hands up,"" he said. ""We try to explain why we've made the mess and we will pay compensation to those passengers who are entitled to compensation, which will be those flights that are cancelled over the next two weeks."" If passengers are given more than 14 days' notice of a cancellation, they are not entitled to compensation. The EU compensation rules for cancelled flights are as follows: Passengers are entitled to assistance and compensation, if the disruption was within an airline's control. Airlines have to offer full refunds, paid within seven days, or rebookings for a flight cancelled at short notice. In addition, passengers can also claim compensation. Cancellation amounts are: 250 euros (Â£218) for short-haul, 440 euros (Â£384) for medium-haul and 600 euros (Â£523) for long-haul. Passengers who reach their destination more than three hours late can be compensated from 200 to 600 euros, depending on the length of flights and delay.

Dead player '66/1' to replace Redknapp,"Ugo Ehiogu was capped four times by England, scoring one international goal A bookmaker has given odds on a dead footballer replacing sacked Birmingham City manager Harry Redknapp. Paddy Power offered 66/1 on ex-Aston Villa and England defender Ugo Ehiogu taking over - a move punters have blasted as ""sick"". The player died in April at the age of 44 following a cardiac arrest. Paddy Power - which also offered odds of 2,500/1 on Brummie rocker Ozzy Osbourne replacing Redknapp - has apologised for a ""genuine error"". More updates on this story Ehiogu made more than 200 appearances for Aston Villa between 1991 and 2000 and then spent seven years at Middlesbrough. Ehiogu made more than 200 appearances for Aston Villa between 1991 and 2000 The centre-back also played for West Brom, Leeds, Rangers and Sheffield United, before retiring in 2009. He began coaching at Tottenham in 2014 and collapsed at the club's training centre on 20 April. He died in hospital the next day. In a statement, Paddy Power apologised to Ehiogu's family if they saw the tweet offering the odds, saying that no offence was meant. ""This was a genuine error, a trader re-used an old market as a template for this one, and didn't notice that Mr Ehiogu was included,"" it said. ""Obviously, that was a mistake, one which was rectified as soon as it was spotted, within minutes."" Customers were able to put money on Ehiogu for ""less than five minutes"" before the error was discovered. No-one actually took that particular bet, the company added.

Will Germany's new law kill free speech online?,"This video can not be played Lawyer Joachim Steinhoefel is one of the most vocal critics of a new German online speech law In October a new law comes into force in Germany that will impose huge fines on social networks if they don't delete illegal content including hate speech. It's touched off a huge debate over freedom of expression and has attracted an unusual collection of opponents. The law is called Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz - NetzDG for short. It obliges the biggest social networks - those with more than two million German users - to take down ""blatantly illegal"" hate speech within 24 hours of it being reported. For material that's less obviously violating the law, networks such as Facebook and Instagram will have seven days to consider and, if appropriate, delete posts. Failure to meet these deadlines could lead to fines of up to â¬50m. Critics argue the short timeframes coupled with the potentially large fines will lead social networks to be overly cautious and delete huge amounts of content - even things that are perfectly legal. But the law's supporters, and the German government, argue that it will force social media companies to proactively deal with online incitement and hate speech. The law doesn't actually change what's considered hate speech in Germany. No new offences are created. The law simply cites sections of theGerman Criminal Code,externalwhich details illegal speech online. The categories range from ""forming terrorist organisations"", to the much vaguer ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations."" In addition, German law restricts some types of speech that are allowed in many other countries. For instance, the use of Nazi symbols is banned, as are the symbols and flags of some extremist groups. An earlier draft of the NetzDG bill barred ""defamation of the President of the Federation"", but the clause was removed after criticism. The law has also been criticised for containing no legal mechanism for people whose posts are wrongly deleted to appeal to get them reinstated. Germany votes for big social media fines 'Selfie refugee' loses Facebook case Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external Opposition has come from a wide range of groups and politicians on both the left and right - and Facebook has also made its disagreement with the law clear. The United Nations has also weighed in. David Kaye, the UN's Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, has written to the German government to warn about the potential consequences of the law. ""With these 24 hour and seven day deadlines - if you are a company you are going to want avoid fines and bad public branding of your platform,"" he says. ""If there is a complaint about a post you are just going to take it down. What is in it for you to leave it up? I think the result is likely to be greater censorship."" The group Reporters without Borders says the German law has already inspired a""draconian"" new online media law,externalin Russia. Anas Modamani has been falsely linked to terror attacks in posts on social media. But there are voices in Germany who are in favour of the law and who argue that making social networks more responsible for hate speech and illegal content on their platforms is a good thing. Anas Modamani is a refugee from Syria who now lives in Berlin. In August 2015 he was catapulted to notoriety for taking a selfie with Angela Merkel while she was visiting a migrant shelter. But the picture would come back to haunt him, as it was used to accuse him of attacks in Brussels and Berlin. His famous photograph was cropped and pasted into wanted posters and false news reports. ""When I read the fake news on the internet, I really cried, it was really bad in my life, it was all untrue,"" Modamani says. He decided to take Facebook to court for not doing enough to stop the lies being shared about him, but in March 2017 helost the case. The court ruled Facebook had taken enough measures to attempt to block defamatory images of him for users in Germany. Because of his experiences, Modamani is a supporter of NetzDG. ""I think the law is a good idea because people will be a little bit afraid, they can't just write what they want,"" he says. ""I don't mind if other comments get deleted along with the bad ones."" Modamani's lawyer, Chan-Jo Jun, is also optimistic about the new law, and plans to use it immediately after it comes into effect. ""I regularly report the post that was the subject of the [earlier] trial and I keep getting the answer [from Facebook] that it does not violate community standards,"" Jun says. ""Therefore it is still online. After October I will file a complaint against Facebook under the NetzDG - with the NetzDG, the court case would not have been necessary."" This video can not be played The moment a famous refugee meets a right-wing nationalist On the other side of the legal debate is attorney Joachim Steinhoefel. While Chan-Jo Jun has taken Facebook to court to get them to remove posts, Steinhoefel has threatened the company with legal action to get a post reinstated. In May, photojournalist Markus Hibbeler wrote a Facebook post about Islam and freedom of expression. Translated from German, the post read in part: ""We shouldn't shield Muslims, and certainly not Islam, which has never been through an enlightenment or reformation, from criticism and constantly protect them."" His post was deleted by Facebook and his account was suspended for seven days. Hibbeler, with Steinhoefel's help, threatened to sue Facebook if the post wasn't put back up within a week and his account reinstated. They succeeded, and Facebook reinstated the post and apologised. It's cases like Hibbeler's, Steinhoefel says, that show how NetzDG threatens freedom of expression. He says he doesn't trust Facebook to decide what posts are legal and illegal and thinks the most likely outcome will be a mass deletion of legal posts that Facebook doesn't want to take any risks with, out of an abundance of caution. Markus Hibbeler (left) with Joachim Steinhoefel The attorney has started ablog,externalwhere he posts examples of Facebook deleting posts which he says break no laws. The blog also catalogues what Steinhoefel says are blatantly illegal posts which Facebook hasn't removed. For example, one of the latter posts reads: ""Jews to the gas chambers"". Facebook has not removed it, despite it being reported to the company. ""It goes to show how unprofessional they are in dealing with this content,"" Steinhoefel says. He is suspicious of the real motive behind the new law and says it will allow ""the media and political elite to regain control over the political debate in Germany."" ""The law is superfluous,"" he says. ""The law as it is right now in Germany makes Facebook responsible for illegal content on its site from the moment they know about it. It just takes state prosecutors and courts to implement these laws."" The German government, however, is determined to press forward with NetzDG. Gerd Billen, a State Secretary in the German Ministry of Justice, says that although existing laws oblige Facebook to delete illegal comments ""there are no rules about when they have to do it, how they have to organise and what their complaint management system should look like."" ""There is a fear of 'over-blocking' but the reality is 'under-blocking',"" Billen says. ""They don't block enough. We don't believe there will be a problem (with over-blocking) because the social networks want to keep their customers."" Gab: Free speech haven or alt-right safe space? WATCH: The moment a famous refugee meets a right-wing activist How the internet united against neo-Nazi Daily Stormer site Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external Billen downplays concerns about freedom of speech, and points out that social media companies already censor content that is perfectly legal. ""There is no obligation for any private company in Germany or somewhere else in the world to guarantee freedom of speech,"" he says. ""To guarantee freedom of speech is something a government does but not private companies. I didn't find any notice in the terms and conditions of Facebook that the company will respect freedom of speech. ""For example they delete many things that are allowed in Germany. Facebook don't accept naked people on their platform. They can decide if they don't want it, so they delete it."" Gerd Billen, a State Secretary in the German Ministry of Justice, defends the new law and says social networks won't 'over-block' because of the risk of alienating their users A Facebook spokesperson admitted to the BBC that they can't rule out the possibility of legal content being deleted. ""The law is not the right way to fight hate speech online,"" the spokesperson says. ""It provides an incentive to delete content that is not clearly illegal and would have the effect of transferring responsibility for complex legal decisions from public authorities to private companies. ""Several legal experts have assessed the draft law as being against the German constitution and non-compliant with EU law. Facebook is committed to working in partnership with governments and civil society on solutions that would have made this law unnecessary."" The BBC also learnt that although the company will soon have another 500 content moderators based in Essen, in western Germany, Facebook has not hired any new staff in response to the law. ""We are still evaluating what the law really means for us,"" the spokesperson says. You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter@BBCtrending,external, and find us onFacebook,external.

Instead of pocketing the surprise windfall, she handed it in to the nearest police station she could find and is now being feted by local media. The Londoner, who has not been named, found the money in the areas near the Rio dei Tre Ponti canal. Police told Italian media the money might be linked to criminal activity. The woman was on the last leg of a tour taking in Naples, Rome and Florence, according to local website La Nuova di Venezia, when she spotted the cash at around 21:00 (19:00 GMT) on Saturday night.

Ryanair to publish list of cancellations,"This video can not be played Passenger: 'Communications with Ryanair has been absolutely atrocious' Ryanair has published full details of which of its flights are being cancelled between now and 28 October. Customers whose flights have been axed will also receive an email, chief executive Michael O'Leary has said. The budget airline is cancelling 40-50 flights every day for the next six weeks, after it admittedit had ""messed up""the planning of pilot holidays. Mr O'Leary said most people would be transferred to an alternative Ryanair flight on the same day. If not, they would be moved to flights the day before or the day after, and the airline would meet its obligations over compensation. Details of all the cancelled flights are availableon the Ryanair website,external. More than 200 of the cancelled flights are either into or out of London Stansted, with a handful in Edinburgh, Manchester and Birmingham also affected. Ryanair faces up to 20 million euros in compensation claims Cancelled by text: Ryanair passengers react Ryanair: What should I do if my flight is cancelled? The airline said it was cancelling flights at airports where it ran the busiest schedules, so it would be easier to accommodate passengers on alternative flights. Rome, Milan, Brussels and Barcelona airports will also see a significant number of flights, either or in or out, cancelled. Mr O'Leary said around 400,000 passengers would be directly affected, but he said a decision had been made to disrupt the plans of 2% of travellers in order to offer a better service to the remaining customers. Changes to the way the airline organises its holiday year have left Ryanair with a backlog of staff leave, meaning there is a shortage of pilots on standby over the next six weeks. That meant any minor disruptions to flights, due to problems with air traffic control capacity, strikes, or weather disruptions were causing knock-on delays, because the airline did not have the flexibility it needed from back-up crews, said Mr O'Leary. After 1 November, when the lighter winter schedule begins, there will not be any need for cancellations, he said. He said they were also asking to buy back leave from pilots and alter the holiday schedule. Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would honour all of its obligations to compensate passengers under EU regulations but would not book passengers onto flights with rival carriers. ""We will not pay for flights on other airlines, no. It is not part of the EU261 entitlement,"" he said, referring toEuropean passenger rights legislation,external. He said the airline did not have an overall shortage of pilots, but said they had ""messed up"" the rosters for September and October. ""This is our mess-up. When we make a mess in Ryanair we come out with our hands up,"" he said. ""We try to explain why we've made the mess and we will pay compensation to those passengers who are entitled to compensation, which will be those flights that are cancelled over the next two weeks."" If passengers are given more than 14 days' notice of a cancellation, they are not entitled to compensation. The EU compensation rules for cancelled flights are as follows: Passengers are entitled to assistance and compensation, if the disruption was within an airline's control. Airlines have to offer full refunds, paid within seven days, or rebookings for a flight cancelled at short notice. In addition, passengers can also claim compensation. Cancellation amounts are: 250 euros (Â£218) for short-haul, 440 euros (Â£384) for medium-haul and 600 euros (Â£523) for long-haul. Passengers who reach their destination more than three hours late can be compensated from 200 to 600 euros, depending on the length of flights and delay.

May 'driving from the front' on Brexit,"Theresa May has attempted to reassert her authority after Boris Johnson set out his own vision for Brexit. Asked about the foreign secretary's newspaper article, which sparked accusations of ""backseat driving"", the PM told journalists: ""This government is driven from the front."" ""We are all going to the same destination,"" she added. Mr Johnson said he was trying to ""sketch out"" the ""incredibly exciting landscape of the destination ahead"". He said: ""What I am trying to do is set out, in advance of the prime minister's speech in Florence on Friday, because I was involved in that Brexit campaign, people want to know where we are going. ""It is a good thing to have a bit of an opening drum roll about what this country can do."" This video can not be played Mr Johnson says he wanted to ""sketch out"" the ""incredibly exciting landscape of the destination ahead"" Johnson and statistics chief at loggerheads Does Mr Johnson's Â£350m a week Brexit claim add up? Brexit official moves to Number 10 Is PM heading for 'Florentine fudge' in speech? The PM's comments were made as she flew to Canada to discuss post-Brexit trade with her counterpart Justin Trudeau. Mr Johnson's 4,000-wordDaily Telegraph article,externalcame ahead of Mrs May's major speech on Brexit in Florence on Friday. This video can not be played Theresa May is making a big Brexit speech in Florence. But why do it there? As well as saying the UK would ""take back control"" of about Â£350m a week after Brexit - and that much of this could be spent on the NHS - he said he opposed paying the EU to secure temporary access to the single market during a transitional phase after the UK's departure. Asked about the foreign secretary's intervention, the PM said all ministers had agreed to the principles she had set out in her Lancaster House speech on Brexit in January. She said: ""We are all agreed as a government about the importance of ensuring the right deal for Britain, the right withdrawal agreement but also the right deal on a special partnership between the EU and UK for the future. ""We are all optimistic about what we can be achieving for the UK for the future."" By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale After the heat of a political row comes the attempt by both sides to cool the passion. So it was today between Theresa May and Boris Johnson. The prime minister delivered a modest slap on the foreign secretary's wrist: ""Boris is Boris"", ""this government is driven from the front"". Mr Johnson allowed himself a modicum of self-abasement: ""There is only one driver in this car... and it is Theresa."" And that infamous 4,000 word article arguing against a soft Brexit? A mere ""opening drum roll"" ahead of Mrs May's big speech on Friday. But the differences of substance remain. Mr Johnson said the UK after Brexit should pay for its ""legal obligations"" to the EU but not ""extortionate sums"" for access to the single market. And he said the transition period should ""not be too long"". So for now Mr Johnson lives to fight another day, saying talk of resignation is ""barking up the wrong tree"". The test will come on Friday when we find out what Mrs May thinks about the Brexit transition, how long it should last and how much it should cost. The political world will compare and contrast Mr Johnson's article and the prime minister's words in Florence. And then we will be able to judge if the gap can be bridged. Pressed on Mr Johnson's suggestion of more cash for the NHS, she said: ""By definition we are currently paying money into the EU, and there will be a point in the future when we've left the EU [when] we won't be paying that money into the EU. ""Of course we will have to decide as a government how to spend that money. And at the time we will look to see where we think it is appropriate and best to spend that money."" The row over Mr Johnson's article - which was criticised by the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority over its use of the Â£350m figure - came as the top official in the Brexit department was moved to the Cabinet Office. In what BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said was a sign of Theresa May taking more control of Brexit negotiations, Oliver Robbins will now work more directly for the PM. He will continue to lead the team of officials working on the Brexit negotiations. Kuenssberg: What was behind article?

Ryanair faces 20m euro compensation bill,"Ryanair could face up to 20m euros (Â£18m) in compensation claims after cancelling thousands of flights due to a shortage of pilots, it has warned. The budget airline plans to cancel 40-50 flights every day for the next six weeks, after it admittedit had ""messed up""the planning of pilot holidays. An internal memo seen by the BBC suggests the pilot shortage could continue until the end of the year. There is no suggestion this means the disruption will extend beyond October. Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights? Passengers hit by Ryanair cancellations In a letter to pilots, chief operations officer Michael Hickey said the firm's crewing forecast to the end of December was ""for tighter pilot numbers"". The letter shows Ryanair pilots were only informed on 13 September of the staff shortage facing the company yet Mr Hickey outlined that it knew last year they may face a leave backlog. Pilots have been asked to work during their booked holiday to cover the gaps and their rota pattern is also likely to be disrupted. In the letter, Mr Hickey said these pilots would be ""helping protect the integrity of the operation during the remainder of the flight year"". Ryanair also faces pressure to publish a full list of the flights it plans to cancel every day amid growing anger among customers. So far it has only published a list of affected flights up until Wednesday. Consumer rights group Which? said: ""It's essential that Ryanair release a full list of flights that will be affected so that passengers have as much time as possible to make alternate arrangements."" The airline has blamed a backlog of staff leave for the disruption, which could affect up to 400,000 passengers. Ryanair is changing its holiday year, which currently runs from April to March, to run from January to December instead. This has led to large numbers of its staff taking holidays in September and October. Reports on Monday also suggested recruitment problems were affecting the airline and that it had lost pilots to rival Norwegian Air. A Norwegian spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that 140 pilots have joined us from Ryanair this year. Pilot recruitment is also underway for more pilots for our new Dublin base opening later this year."" The airline has promised affected customers alternative flights or refunds. However, many have reacted angrily to the cancellations on social media and called for a full list of affected flights to be released. Karen Higgins tweeted: ""Yet another day of constant checking to see if our flights are safe or cancelled! Cmon @Ryanair help us all out! Get the updates done!!!!"" Dee Moloney tweeted: ""Have 2 trips booked in the next couple of weeks. Excitement of trips now replaced with worry!... Won't be flying with @Ryanair again."" Shares in Ryanair were down 2% on Monday afternoon. The EU compensation rules for cancelled flights are as follows: Passengers are entitled to assistance and compensation, if the disruption was within an airline's control. Airlines have to offer full refunds, paid within seven days, or rebookings for a flight cancelled at short notice. In addition, passengers can also claim compensation. Cancellation amounts are: 250 euros (Â£218) for short-haul, 440 euros (Â£384) for medium-haul and 600 euros (Â£523) for long-haul.

Caribbean braced for major new hurricane,"This video can not be played Watch: The islanders caught between hurricanes Hurricane Maria has strengthened to a major category three hurricane, US forecasters say, as it heads towards the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean. It is due to hit on Monday night local time. Maria is moving roughly along the same path as Irma, the hurricane that devastated the region this month. The authorities fear Maria could whip up and throw the debris left behind by Hurricane Irma. Lieutenant Colonel Paul Maynard, a Royal Marine deployed to the British Virgin Islands, told the Press Association the hurricane could pick the debris up, ""spin it around, and throw it like ammunition"". ""It could cause potentially more casualties and fatalities than Irma did,"" he added. Hurricane Irma: A visual guide Damage mapped The UK's International Development Secretary, Priti Patel, said: ""British troops, police and aid experts are working relentlessly to get help to the victims of Hurricane Irma. Those same individuals will now be tasked with also preparing for the impact of Maria."" Hurricane warnings have been issued for Guadeloupe, Dominica, St Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, Martinique, St Lucia and the US and British Virgin Islands. A hurricane watch is in effect for Puerto Rico, St Martin, St Barts, Saba, St Eustatius and Anguilla. Some of these islands are still recovering after being hit by Irma - a category five hurricane which left at least 37 people dead and caused billions of dollars' worth of damage. In itslatest update on Monday,external, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that Maria had maximum sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph). They warned that heavy rainfall caused by the hurricane ""could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides"". The eye of the storm is 100 miles east of Martinique, and Maria is moving west-northwest at about 13mph. ""Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the NHC said. In the French territory of Guadeloupe, schools, businesses and government buildings have all been closed and severe flooding is predicted in low-lying parts of the islands. Preparations have also begun in Puerto Rico, where Maria is expected to bring strong winds on Tuesday. The Leeward Islands - where Maria will first strike - includes Antigua and Barbuda. The latter island was evacuated after beingdevastatedby Irma. The NHC says that Maria could produce a ""dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves"" that would raise water levels by as much as 2.7 metres (9ft). It also forecasts a maximum potential rainfall of 51cm (20in) in some areas of the central and southern Leeward Islands - including Puerto Rico and the US and British Virgin Islands - through to Wednesday night. The destruction of Barbuda Drone footage of Saint-Martin after Irma Earlier this month, Irma left more than two-thirds of homes on the Dutch side of the island of St Martin (known as Sint Maarten) uninhabitable, with no electricity, gas or drinking water. The French government has said its side of St Martin - known as Saint-Martin - sustained about â¬1.2bn ($1.44bn; Â£1.1bn) in damage, with nine deaths across Saint-Martin and nearby St Barts. This video can not be played A BBC team visited Caribbean islands that have been devastated by Hurricane Irma On the British Virgin Islands, entire neighbourhoods were flattened. After a visit to the area, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson described the damage as something ""you see in images from the First World War"". In pictures: Irma devastates British Virgin Islands Virgin boss Richard Branson, who has a home in the Virgin Islands, has been tweeting ahead of the Maria's predicted arrival, warning people to stay safe.

The Puerto Rican government has issued a statement saying it expects the hurricane to make landfall there as a category three on Tuesday. The US territory escaped the worst of the damage from Irma - although it experienced widespread power cuts - and it has been an important hub for getting relief to islands that were more badly affected. ""Puerto Rico is our lifeline,"" Judson Burdon, a resident of Anguilla, told Reuters news agency. ""We had two volunteer flights cancel because of the weather that is coming."" American military units were evacuated from the US Virgin Islands on Sunday Irma also hit the US, where several dozen deaths were linked to the hurricane. Nearly 6.9 million homes were left without power in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama. A second hurricane, Jose, is also active in the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 90mph. The centre of the storm wasabout 265 miles east-south-east of Cape Hatteras,externalin North Carolina, the NHC said in its advisory at 18:00 GMT on Monday.

Police continue to question Tube suspects,"Syrian-born Yahyah Farroukh is believed to be the 21-year-old suspect arrested by police Police have been granted more time to question two suspects in connection with Friday's Tube attack. On Saturday an 18-year-old man, thought to be an Iraqi orphan, was arrested in Dover port, and a 21-year-old was detained in Hounslow. A homemade bomb partially exploded in a train at Parsons Green station, injuring 30 people in rush hour. Police now have until 23 September to question the 18-year-old, and until 21 September to detain the 21-year-old. The 18-year-old is a recent foster child at a home in Sunbury-on-Thames, and the 21-year-old has links to the property, where a police cordon is in place. Police are searching the house owned by foster parents Ronald Jones, 88, and Penelope Jones, 71. Both men were arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act and were granted warrants for further detention by Westminster Magistrates' Court. They remain in custody at a south London police station. CCTV images have emerged showing a person carrying a Lidl supermarket bag 90 minutes before the bombing. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows this Lidl bag being carried before the attack BBC News has obtained CCTV footage showing a person leaving the property in Sunbury carrying a Lidl bag at 07:04 BST on Friday morning. At 08.20, a device exploded on a District Line train. The bomb was in a plastic bucket, which was transported in a Lidl bag. The 18-year-old is thought to have moved to the UK aged 15 when his parents died. Neighbours claimed the teenager, who is thought to still live at the foster home, tried to run away. Neighbours who spoke to the BBC reported police cars attending the address several times over the last few months. Resident Dave Solway said: ""If they don't come back on time the police are called, that's why there will be a police presence. ""Whether that means the lads will cause trouble per se, who's to know? That's speculation."" Police have cordoned off a street in Sunbury-on-Thames where they are searching a property thought to be connected with Friday's attack A 21-year-old man, believed to be Syrian-born Yahyah Farroukh, was also arrested on Saturday in Hounslow, west London, and his house in Stanwell, near Heathrow airport, is being searched. Mr Farroukh was a former foster child who had lived in the Jones's house in Sunbury, local council leader Ian Harvey said. Mr Farroukh posted a picture on his Instagram page in May this year with a suitcase on Cavendish Road, Sunbury, almost directly outside the Jones's house. Mr and Mrs Jones weremade MBEs for services to children in 2010,external, and friend Alison Griffiths said the couple had an 18-year-old and a 22-year-old staying with them recently. She said the couple were ""great pillars of the community"", adding: ""They do a job that not many people do."" Mr Farroukh is believed to have been in the UK for at least four years and learned English at West Thames College between 2013 and 2015. Tube staff's accounts of bomb 'pandemonium' Residents in Sunbury told to get out of homes Terror threat lowered after Tube bombing Neighbours told the BBC he was a ""friendly"" and ""chatty"" young man who had been visited by family from Scotland. Police also searched the Aladdins chicken shop in Hounslow, west London, where Mr Farroukh was arrested. A manager confirmed he had worked at the Kingsley Road shop for a number of months. Shop owner Suleman Sarwar said police searched lockers on the premises. He added: ""We didn't know him very well. ""He was quite quiet, he just worked over here and that was it. ""He was very normal. If he did do anything you would never have suspected it."" The Sunbury house is owned by foster parents Penelope and Ronald Jones, who were made MBEs in 2010 The so-called Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said while there was ""no evidence"" to confirm Islamic State's involvement, work was being done to find out how the attacker was radicalised. The UK's terror threat level was raised to critical - its highest level - immediately after the attack, but it was brought back to severe after the police arrests. Assistant Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said police had gained a ""greater understanding"" of how the bomb was prepared but said there was ""still much more to do"". Thirty people were injured - most suffering from ""flash burns"" - when a bomb was detonated on a Tube carriage at Parsons Green station. Jack Durston was on the train where the bomb went off on Friday and he said: ""There was a big sort of wall of fire, the whole width of the carriage, moving towards us very fast. ""My instinct was to just run. And I ran away from the fire and out the door.""

Why Cumberbatch is his own worst critic,"Cumberbatch: ""The internet's nothing compared to the self-critic in your head"" Benedict Cumberbatch has everything going for him. Yet the Sherlock star says he is his own worst critic. The actor says he's even harder on himself than the harshest online troll. Marvel's Doctor Strange is looking at his work in a new light thanks to his production company, SunnyMarch, which is behind The Child In Time. The 41-year-old not only plays the lead role in the first ever TV adaptation of an Ian McEwan novel, but is the BBC One drama's executive producer as well. Cumberbatch stars as Stephen Lewis, a children's author whose world falls apart when his four-year-old daughter goes missing in a supermarket. The Child In Time is based on Ian McEwan's 1987 novel He says getting to adapt the Whitbread Prize-winning book - which tells of how Stephen's life and that of his wife Julie diverge after the loss - was a ""huge boon"". Yet the actor admits it's ""different when you've got a producer's hat on. If you're front and centre, that's really hard. ""I'm excited about the moment when I'm not in something and I can look at it with more more distance, but it's very peculiar. ""It's always horrible - the way you look, the way you do things. It's just horrible. Kelly Macdonald plays Julie, the wife of Cumberbatch's character ""Trust me, the internet's full of hate but it's nothing compared to the self-critic in your head for brutality. I've said it all before they have."" Cumberbatch says he had a ""great experience"" making the drama, a joint production with Pinewood Television. ""I didn't choose it. It chose us, really,"" he goes on. ""It just worked - the timing was right, it was a brilliant script first of all and it's an extraordinary novel."" The actor, who has two young sons with his wife Sophie, says the situation of losing a child while looking away in a familiar environment is ""horrifically relatable"". ""It's a part that is a million miles away from all the stuff I've done - especially the more famous one on telly - and that's an appeal for me. Cumberbatch and his wife welcomed their second son earlier this year ""I'll always be shaking things up a little bit as far as expectations are concerned - not doing the usual or the unusually usual - and the extreme nature of the situation [in The Child In Time] is very unusual. ""I don't think you have to be a parent to understand,"" he continues. ""There are fantastic actors out there I've seen give extraordinary performances of parents in crisis, or just parents in fictional roles. ""It wasn't like 'oh great, I can get my teeth into something whereby I'll be emotionally raw because I'm a new dad for the second time.' It just happened that way."" Speaking of that more famous telly role, would he like to do more Sherlock? All he'll say, with an enigmatic smile, is ""maybe"". Could more Sherlock be on the cards? ""Maybe"" is all Cumberbatch will say At the time we speak,it's just been announcedthat Jodie Whittaker is taking on the lead role in Doctor Who - the first woman to do so. Cumberbatch is thrilled about this and says he can't wait to see her performance. ""It's an alien - why can't it be a woman?"" he says. ""Why can't it be any gender? I think she's an extraordinary actress and we're lucky culturally to have got her to agree to do it. Just go for it - let's see what happens."" Would he be just as up for seeing a female Sherlock? ""Why not? I don't care,"" he says, adding tongue-in-cheek: ""Sherlockina - it's coming to you soon."" SunnyMarch, he points out, has a lot of plans for improving diversity and ""giving a bolder place for women both behind and in front of the camera."" Watch this space.

Ryanair faces 20m euros compensation bill,"Ryanair could face up to 20m euros (Â£18m) in compensation claims after cancelling thousands of flights due to a shortage of pilots, it has warned. The budget airline plans to cancel 40-50 flights every day for the next six weeks, after it admittedit had ""messed up""the planning of pilot holidays. An internal memo seen by the BBC suggests the pilot shortage could continue until the end of the year. There is no suggestion this means the disruption will extend beyond October. Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights? Passengers hit by Ryanair cancellations In a letter to pilots, chief operations officer Michael Hickey said the firm's crewing forecast to the end of December was ""for tighter pilot numbers"". The letter shows Ryanair pilots were only informed on 13 September of the staff shortage facing the company yet Mr Hickey outlined that it knew last year they may face a leave backlog. Pilots have been asked to work during their booked holiday to cover the gaps and their rota pattern is also likely to be disrupted. In the letter, Mr Hickey said these pilots would be ""helping protect the integrity of the operation during the remainder of the flight year"". Ryanair also faces pressure to publish a full list of the flights it plans to cancel every day amid growing anger among customers. So far it has only published a list of affected flights up until Wednesday. Consumer rights group Which? said: ""It's essential that Ryanair release a full list of flights that will be affected so that passengers have as much time as possible to make alternate arrangements."" The airline has blamed a backlog of staff leave for the disruption, which could affect up to 400,000 passengers. Ryanair is changing its holiday year, which currently runs from April to March, to run from January to December instead. This has led to large numbers of its staff taking holidays in September and October. Reports on Monday also suggested recruitment problems were affecting the airline and that it had lost pilots to rival Norwegian Air. A Norwegian spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that 140 pilots have joined us from Ryanair this year. Pilot recruitment is also underway for more pilots for our new Dublin base opening later this year."" The airline has promised affected customers alternative flights or refunds. However, many have reacted angrily to the cancellations on social media and called for a full list of affected flights to be released. Karen Higgins tweeted: ""Yet another day of constant checking to see if our flights are safe or cancelled! Cmon @Ryanair help us all out! Get the updates done!!!!"" Dee Moloney tweeted: ""Have 2 trips booked in the next couple of weeks. Excitement of trips now replaced with worry!... Won't be flying with @Ryanair again."" Shares in Ryanair were down 2% on Monday afternoon. The EU compensation rules for cancelled flights are as follows: Passengers are entitled to assistance and compensation, if the disruption was within an airline's control. Airlines have to offer full refunds, paid within seven days, or rebookings for a flight cancelled at short notice. In addition, passengers can also claim compensation. Cancellation amounts are: 250 euros (Â£218) for short-haul, 440 euros (Â£384) for medium-haul and 600 euros (Â£523) for long-haul. Passengers who reach their destination more than three hours late can be compensated from 200 to 600 euros, depending on the length of flights and delay. Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights?

NHS trust pleads guilty over teen's death,"Connor Sparrowhawk had epilepsy and died at a Southern Health facility An NHS trust has admitted guilt over the death of a teenaged patient who drowned in the bath while in its care. Southern Health Trust pleaded guilty at Banbury Magistrates' Court earlier to breaching health and safety law in the case of Connor Sparrowhawk, 18, who died at Slade House in Oxford in 2013. His death led to the discovery the trust only properly investigated 272 unexplained deaths of 722 in its care. Sentencing is due to take place on 12 October at Oxford Crown Court. The trust was prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) under Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 following its investigation into the death of a patient under its care. Paul Spencer, defending the trust, said Mr Sparrowhawk's death was ""deeply tragic"" and should ""never have happened"". District Judge Tim Pattinson said the court expressed its ""deepest sympathy"" over the teenager's death. In a statement following the hearing, attended by Mr Sparrowhawk's mother Sara Ryan and other members of his family, Julie Dawes, the trust's interim chief executive, described his death as ""entirely preventable"". She said: ""Connor's loss continues to have a devastating impact on his family and we are truly sorry that we didn't keep him safe."" She continued: ""There have been times when our actions unintentionally added to the distress of Connor's family."" Ms Dawes said his death had led to ""significant changes and improvements"" at the trust and added she hoped ""all families and service users will now experience a more compassionate approach from Southern Health"".

Biker jailed for M6 selfie and wheelies,"This video can not be played Biker who pulled wheelies on the M6 is jailed A motorcyclist who performed wheelies and took a selfie while driving on the M6 has been jailed for eight months. Pawel Zietowski was also filmed by police standing up and rummaging through a backpack.  He reached speeds of 117mph (188kmph) before being stopped in Staffordshire on 3 June. Sentencing him, Judge David Fletcher said the footage was ""hair-raising"". The 27-year-old from Warrington, Cheshire, had previously admitted dangerous driving. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard Zietowski, of Higham Avenue, was riding an 06-plate Yamaha R6 when he was pulled over by officers near Yarnfield, between junctions 14 and 15. More updates on this story He told probation officers he had an interest in stunt riding and was ""practising"" on the motorway. Mr Fletcher said he wanted the footage to be played in court to make sure Zietowski had seen it. ""You were showing off,"" he told him. Pawel Zietowski was filmed standing up, speeding and rummaging in a bag ""It was clearly driving which was over a lengthy period of time, involving speeds of up to 117mph, involving you twice removing the backpack,"" he said. ""You were pulling wheelies on a number of occasions and at one point you were standing up with no hands on the handlebars. ""This was a piece of appalling driving. ""You say you were involved with some sort of group relating to stunt-type driving. ""If that is the case then there are places and times for that sort of stunt-riding to take place, that place is not the M6 at two o'clock in the afternoon with lots of other vehicles on the road.""

Brexit official Robbins moves to No 10,"The government's top Brexit official, Oliver Robbins, has left the Department for Exiting the European Union and is moving to the Cabinet Office to work more directly for the prime minister. It is understood there had been tension between him and Brexit Secretary David Davis, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said. She added that the move was also part of Theresa May taking more control of Brexit negotiations. Mr Robbins will continue to lead the UK officials working on the talks. The government said the appointment would ""strengthen cross-government co-ordination of the next phase of negotiations with the European Union"". It said Mr Robbins would continue to work closely with Mr Davis in his role as the leading ""Sherpa"" working on talks between UK and EU officials. Philip Rycroft, currently second permanent secretary at the Brexit department, has been made permanent secretary. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said he was surprised by Mr Robbins' move and said that the timing was ""odd"". ""It does feel a bit like rearranging the deckchairs to be honest,"" he added. Who is Oliver Robbins? He cut his teeth at Gordon Brown's Treasury, helping to co-ordinate public spending policy, before going on to serve in senior behind-the-scenes roles for both Tony Blair and Mr Brown in Downing Street. By civil service standards, his rise was meteoric - he was Mr Blair's principal private secretary by the age of 31. He gained a reputation for being a skilled mediator in the frequent disputes between No 10 and the Treasury. After a spell as director of the civil service and as David Cameron's deputy national security adviser, Robbins became the senior civil servant in charge of immigration policy at Theresa May's Home Office. When Mrs May became prime minister she drafted Robbins in as her senior EU adviser.

Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Kier Starmer said: ""Moving key individuals at this critical time adds a whole new dimension to the government's chaotic approach to Brexit. ""Deep divisions in the cabinet and a complete lack of leadership are putting the national interest at risk."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said it was a ""sign of the chaos and division at the heart of this government"". The staff changes come ahead of a major speech by Theresa May on Brexit in Florence on Friday - with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson accused of undermining her by setting out his own vision for life outside the EU in a newspaper article. Mr Johnson's article triggered a row with the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority over his use of the Â£350m figure used by the Vote Leave campaign ahead of last year's referendum.

UK reveals proposed EU security deal,"The government has revealed details of its proposed new security treaty between the UK and the EU after Brexit. Ministers hope the treaty will provide a legal basis for co-operating on law enforcement, security and criminal justice, but did not outline any costs. Whitehall officials are understood to be optimistic the plans will be agreed. Both Labour and the Lib Dems criticised a specific proposal to end the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) after the UK's departure. Thegovernment document,externaloutlining the plans said the new security treaty would need to be underpinned by a new legal agreement since the UK would leave the ECJ. But it said it should be possible for the UK to secure an agreement with Europol - the EU intelligence agency - that provides the same benefits as now. Theresa May has previously said membership of the ECJ, the EU's highest legal authority,was ""not going to happen""after Brexit. But Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee, said the paper failed to ""answer the crucial question"" of what could replace the court. ""Where are the proposals for an alternative model of dispute resolution?"" she said, adding: ""As the paper makes clear, it would be really dangerous to end up with operational gaps in law enforcement and justice."" How will Brexit affect UK security? EU 'needs stronger defence arm' Lib Dem shadow home secretary, Ed Davey, said the paper was based on ""delusion"", insisting that leaving the ECJ would be a ""major stumbling block"" to thrashing out a security agreement. ""Instead of accepting a role for the ECJ, the paper repeats Theresa May's ridiculous red line,"" he said. However, the government described the plans as a new, ""ambitious"" model of co-operation - rejecting the idea of negotiating a number of separate agreements covering each area of law enforcement. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the paper was an ""important milestone"" in tackling pan-European threats such as organised crime, child sex abuse, cyber-attacks and terrorism. In a statement, the agency said there was ""broad consensus on the need to retain our ability to share intelligence, biometrics and other data at speed"". The National Crime Agency said the proposed EU security deal was an ""important milestone"" Officials say the new treaty would aim to replicate the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant system, under which suspects can be speedily extradited between member states, but it would not necessarily mean Britain belonging to the EAW. Brexit Secretary David Davis said: ""Together with the EU we have developed some of the world's most sophisticated systems in the fight against crime, because cross-border co-operation is absolutely crucial if we're to keep our citizens safe and bring criminals to justice. ""That is why we want to build a new partnership with the EU that goes beyond any existing relationship it has with non-member states, so we can continue countering these cross-border threats together."" Other areas listed in the document that the government wishes to continue to contribute to and benefit from are: Schengen Information System II, which provides real-time alerts of suspects and vehicles European Investigation Order, which allows member states to conduct inquiries in other countries Prum agreement, which allows countries to share DNA , fingerprint and vehicle registration data Joint investigation teams to help tackle crime The UK has the largest defence budget in the EU and, along with France, is one of only two countries in the bloc with permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has previously said Europe can no longer ""completely depend"" on the US and UK following the election of President Trump and the Brexit vote, while European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker recently called on EU member states to step up their military co-operation. In her letter formally triggering Brexit in March, Prime Minister Theresa Maywarned,externalthat failure to reach a deal with Brussels would mean ""co-operation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened"".

Georgia student shot dead by police,"This video can not be played 'Why did you kill my son?' University police in the US state of Georgia have shot and killed an LGBT student activist, sparking an inquiry. Police encountered Scout Schultz, 21, outside a campus dormitory in Atlanta after a call about ""a person with a knife and a gun"" late on Saturday. Video shows Schultz refusing to obey police commands, and advancing on them. A family lawyer said Schultz was holding a closed multi-tool. The student's parents said police should not have used lethal force. ""Why did you have to shoot?"" the victim's father said at an emotional news conference on Monday. ""That's the question, I mean that's the only question that matters right now. Why did you kill my son?"" In a video filmed by a fellow student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Schultz is pictured outside the entrance to a parking garage and can be heard saying ""Shoot me!"" several times while walking towards the officers. ""Drop the knife, man, come on,"" a police officer responds. ""Nobody wants to hurt you,"" another says, before one officer eventually opens fire, hitting Schultz in the chest. Schultz did not appear to be holding a gun, investigators said, despite what had initially been reported to police. The computer engineering student from Lilburn, Georgia, was transported to the Grady Memorial Hospital, later dying from injuries sustained in the shooting,the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said,external. Schultz's mother noted that the engineering student (pictured) was very active on campus Police in the US are permitted - and often required - to use lethal force against any suspect who they believe presents an immediate danger to officers or members of the community. Officers must have a ""reasonable belief"" that an individual is capable of committing violence, in order to fire on them. Exact figures for police shootings vary widely, since police forces are not required to submit incidents to the FBI for data collection. But according to the Washington Post, which tracks civilian deaths at the hands of police,nearly 1,000 people were killed across the country in 2015. US police shootings: How many die each year? Intersex patients 'routinely lied to by doctors' Model reveals she is intersex to 'break taboo' No police officers from the Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) were injured in Saturday night's incident, the schools' police force has said. The officer who opened fire has not been named. Georgia Tech's campus police do not carry Tasers, but are equipped with pepper spray. School representatives say it was probably the first on-campus police shooting in the past 20 years, if ever. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Schultz - who identified as intersex and preferred to be referred to by the pronoun ""they"" - was the president of the Pride Alliance at Georgia Tech, and was politically active in progressive causes. ""We are all deeply saddened by what has occurred,"" the group saidin a statement,external. ""They have been the driving force behind Pride Alliance for the past two years,"" the group said. ""They pushed us to do more events and a larger variety [of] events."" Schultz's mother Lynne said Scout had numerous medical issues, suffered from depression and had attempted suicide two years ago. ""Why didn't they [police] use some nonlethal force, like pepper spray or Tasers?"" she toldthe Atlanta Journal-Constitution,external. Scout Schultz was the president of the Pride Alliance at the Georgia Institute of Technology A lawyer for Schultz's parents, Chris Stewart, said the blade on the folding multi-tool that Schultz was allegedly holding was not open, and noted that it appears in the video that Schultz never ran towards police. ""I just don't understand how they couldn't have Tasers,"" Mr Stewart said, adding that he thinks Schultz was ""having a mental breakdown and didn't know what to do"". The student's parents William and Lynne Schultz said that they were performing well in school, but suggested that their school workload may have contributed to their mental condition. Mr Stewart added: ""People just breakdown. That's doesn't mean they deserve to die."" ""The area was secured. There was no one around at risk,"" the lawyer said, questioning whether the university police had received sufficient training to deal with suspects with mental health issues.

Police 'may work with paedophile hunters',"This video can not be played A sex offender being confronted by a self-styled paedophile hunter Police admit they may have to work with ""paedophile hunters"" after figures obtained by the BBC revealed a rise in their evidence being used in court. Figures show 11% of court cases in 2014 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for the crime of meeting a child after sexual grooming used vigilante evidence, rising to 44% in 2016. The vigilantes pose online as children then film the people they meet. Police have admitted that persuading them to stop is proving difficult. Paedophile hunter Stephen Dure posed online as a 14-year-old boy when chatting to Robert Babey, who later admitted multiple breaches of his Sexual Harm Prevention Order 2014:20 out of 176 cases 2015:77 out of 256 cases 2016:114 out of 259 cases Source: BBC Freedom of Information request from 44 police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the national lead for child protection at the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: ""[These] vigilante groups are putting the lives of children at risk. ""They might not perceive it that way, but they are potentially compromising our operations."" However, Mr Bailey said: ""I'm not going to condone these groups and I would encourage them all to stop, but I recognise that I am not winning that conversation."" Chief Constable Simon Bailey said vigilante paedophile hunters were putting the lives of children at risk When asked whether police could work with vigilantes, he said: ""I think that's something we're going to have to potentially have to look at, yes, but it comes with some real complexity."" He added: ""The biggest challenge here from my perspective is there has to start to be a new approach to policing the web. ""We have to start asking the technical companies, ICT,  the software providers to police the environments and stop these offences happening in the first place."" Last week 45-year-old David Taylor from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, wasjailed for 40 monthsafter being caught by an unnamed vigilante who posed as an 11-year-old girl. Police traced Taylor from a video of the confrontation posted on Facebook. Stephen Dure, known as Stevie Trap, has seen his evidence used in three court cases this year Southampton-based paedophile hunter Stephen Dure, known as Stevie Trap, has seen his evidence, including chat logs of his online conversations with suspects, used in three court cases this year. In one case he posed as a 14-year-old boy when chatting to Robert Babey who is due to be sentenced later this month after admitting multiple breaches of his Sexual Harm Prevention Order. Mr Dure said: ""I've had policemen come up to me to shake my hand... to thank me. Whereas high-up police are trying to stop us."" He said one issue raised by officers had been him posting videos of his stings online before cases had come to court. ""If that's the way they want to go then fine I won't upload the videos."" Reacting to Mr Bailey's statement that the police would think about working with vigilantes, Mr Dure added: ""I think it's great and just the idea they're thinking about it excites me. ""I really look forward to it and hope it happens in the future, I would be very willing to work with the police.""

Cyclist jailed over pedestrian death,"Alliston, now 20, was travelling on a fixed-wheel track bike with no front brakes before crashing into 44-year-old Kim Briggs A cyclist who knocked over and killed a 44-year-old woman in east London has been sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders' institution. Charlie Alliston, then 18, was travelling on a fixed-wheel track bike with no frontbrakes before crashing into Kim Briggsin February last year. He was cleared of her manslaughter, but found guilty of bodily harm by ""wanton or furious driving"". Judge Wendy Joseph described Alliston as ""an accident waiting to happen"". Sentencing at the Old Bailey, the judge said:  ""I am satisfied in some part it was this so-called thrill that motivated you to ride without a front brake shouting and swearing at pedestrians to get out of the way. ""I have no doubt you are wrong in this. You were an accident waiting to happen. ""The victim could have been any pedestrian. It was in fact Mrs Kim Briggs."" Kim Briggs died after being injured while crossing Old Street in Shoreditch last February Mother-of-two Kim Briggs was crossing Old Street during her lunch break when she was hit. She suffered serious head injuries, including a fractured skull, and died a week later in hospital. Alliston, now 20, raised his eyebrows as the judge said his sentence would be custodial. In a series of posts on social media, he described how he twice warned Mrs Briggs to get out of the way. He wrote: ""We collided pretty hard, our heads hit together, hers went into the floor and ricocheted into mine."" He complained: ""It's not my fault people either think they are invincible or have zero respect for cyclists."" Alliston said he was not aware a brake was a legal requirement to ride on the road In a statement outside court, Mrs Briggs' widower Matthew, from Lewisham, south London,called for the introduction of new laws, including causing death by dangerous cycling. He said the case demonstrated the ""gap in the law when it comes to dealing with death or serious injury by dangerous cycling."" ""To have to rely on either manslaughter at one end, or a Victorian law that doesn't even mention causing death at the other end, tells us there is a gap"", he said. ""The fact that what happened to Kim is rare is not a reason to be no remedy."" Alliston's lawyer Mark Wyeth QC told the court that his client had ""a lot of internal sense of emotional turmoil but keeps this hidden as a coping strategy."" The court heard Alliston was depressed, had broken up with his girlfriend and lost his job. Prosecutors took the unprecedented step of bringing a manslaughter charge due to the unusually grave circumstances of the case. The other offence of wanton and furious driving, under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, carries a maximum sentence of two years in jail. Alliston, from Bermondsey, south London, had denied both charges against him. âReckless cyclists must learn from deathâ Cyclist guilty over pedestrian's death Brakes 'would have made no difference' 'Why I ride a bike without a brake' HM Courts & Tribunals Service - GOV.UK At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

The Handmaid's Tale wins top Emmy awards,"Elisabeth Moss won best actress in a drama series for The Handmaid's Tale Dystopian TV series The Handmaid's Tale has scooped the top drama honours at this year's Emmy Awards. The show won five awards including best drama series, best actress for Elisabeth Moss and best supporting actress for Ann Dowd. Big Little Lies took five prizes in the limited series categories, including wins for Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern. The British winners included Riz Ahmed, who took best lead actor in a limited series or movie for The Night Of. Riz Ahmed and Charlie Brooker were among the British winners Other British winners included Charlie Brooker, who won best writing for a limited series for his Netflix show Black Mirror. One of the episodes, San Junipero, also won the trophy for best TV movie. Brooker said it ""was a story about love, and love will defeat hate, it will win"". British comedian John Oliver and his writing team scooped two prizes for satirical show Last Week Tonight. The Handmaid's Tale's win for best drama series means Hulu has become the first streaming service to win that award, beating the likes of big hitters Netflix and Amazon. Emmy Awards: Key winners An 'incredible yearâ for women on TV Donald Glover makes history In pictures: Fashion at the Emmys Bruce Miller - who won two trophies as the show's writer and executive producer - thanked author Margaret Atwood, ""who created this world for all of us"". The show is adapted from Atwood's 1985 novel. In the limited series categories, HBO's Big Little Lies won best lead actress, (Nicole Kidman), supporting actress (Laura Dern), supporting actor (Alexander Skarsgard), director (Jean-Marc Vallee) and best limited series. Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon star in Big Little Lies Accepting the award for best limited series, Kidman, who played an abused wife, said that ""as much as the show has the entertainment value, it's about the issues"". She told the Emmys audience: ""We've shone a light on domestic abuse. It's a complicated, insidious disease. It exists far more than we allow ourselves to know."" Julia Louis-Dreyfus won best actress in a comedy series for Veep for the sixth year in a row - breaking the record for the most Emmys won by a lead actor for the same role. Veep, which was created by Armando Iannucci, also won one the prize for best comedy series. Julia Louis Dreyfus has played the lead role in Veep in all six of its seasons Sterling K Brown's win for best lead actor in a drama series marked the first time an African-American actor had won in the category in almost 20 years. Atlanta star Donald Glover scored another historic first by becoming the first black person to win an Emmy for directing a comedy show, while Master of None's Lena Waithe became the first African-American woman to win for comedy writing. Political references became a running theme during the night - with host Stephen Colbert and several winners poking fun at US President Donald Trump. ""At long last, Mr President, here is your Emmy,"" said Alec Baldwin as he collected his prize for supporting actor in a comedy series, mocking the president's frustration at never having won for The Apprentice. Baldwin regularly portrays President Trump on comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live, which won four awards including best variety sketch series and best supporting actress in a comedy series for Kate McKinnon. Spicer appeared with a podium resembling the one he used to use as press secretary And after he was named best lead actor in a comedy series, Glover said: ""I want to thank Trump for making black people number one on the most oppressed list."" Jaws also dropped when Mr Trump's former press secretary Sean Spicer came on stage to joke that the ceremony would attract ""the largest audience to witness an Emmys"" - a reference to disputed claims he made over numbers attending the president's inauguration in January. In the competition, several high-profile series failed to live up to expectations, including Westworld and Stranger Things, which both went home empty-handed. Game of Thrones, a big winner at previous Emmys, wasn't eligible this year because episodes from its last series didn't air during the Emmys eligibility window. Likewise, the new series of Twin Peaks will have to wait until next year to be considered. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

PwC pays black and Asian staff less,"Currently reporting on BAME pay isn't required under government regulations Black, Asian and minority-ethnic staff (BAME) who work at PwC in the UK earn almost 13% less than other employees, according to figures provided by the professional services firm. The firm said its BAME workers were statistically paid less because more of them worked in administrative and junior roles, rather than senior ones. PwC said it had published the data to help it speed up progress on the issue. Currently reporting on BAME pay isn't required under government regulations. PwC said it hoped that publishing the data would help the firm to tackle ""ethnicity challenges"". ""The more transparent we are with our diversity and social mobility data, the more we hold ourselves accountable to achieving real change,"" said PwC chairman Kevin Ellis. The firm has been voluntarily publishing its gender pay gap figures since 2014, a move which it said had helped ""shine a spotlight on gender issues"". ""We're hoping that BAME pay reporting can do the same for tackling ethnicity challenges,"" it said. It said that its gender pay gap for 2017 was 13.7%, down from 15.2% in 2016. The company published the new BAME figures alongside its annual results for the year to the end of June. The firm said while revenue had risen 5% to Â£3.6bn for the year, profit had slipped by 1% to Â£822m. PwC's consulting, tax and assurance business divisions all saw revenues rise, but income from its deals business fell by 1%. Mr Ellis said it was ""a solid performance"" in ""a challenging and complex market"". He said he remained optimistic about the market outlook despite continuing uncertainty over the UK's exit from the EU.

Has your Ryanair flight been cancelled recently? Are you a Ryanair pilot? Let us know about your experiences. Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk with your stories.Ryanair 'must publish cancelled flights',"Ryanair could face up to 20m euros (Â£18m) in compensation claims after cancelling thousands of flights due to a shortage of pilots, it has warned. The budget airline plans to cancel 40-50 flights every day for the next six weeks, after it admittedit had ""messed up""the planning of pilot holidays. An internal memo seen by the BBC suggests the pilot shortage could continue until the end of the year. There is no suggestion this means the disruption will extend beyond October. Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights? Passengers hit by Ryanair cancellations In a letter to pilots, chief operations officer Michael Hickey said the firm's crewing forecast to the end of December was ""for tighter pilot numbers"". The letter shows Ryanair pilots were only informed on 13 September of the staff shortage facing the company yet Mr Hickey outlined that it knew last year they may face a leave backlog. Pilots have been asked to work during their booked holiday to cover the gaps and their rota pattern is also likely to be disrupted. In the letter, Mr Hickey said these pilots would be ""helping protect the integrity of the operation during the remainder of the flight year"". Ryanair also faces pressure to publish a full list of the flights it plans to cancel every day amid growing anger among customers. So far it has only published a list of affected flights up until Wednesday. Consumer rights group Which? said: ""It's essential that Ryanair release a full list of flights that will be affected so that passengers have as much time as possible to make alternate arrangements."" The airline has blamed a backlog of staff leave for the disruption, which could affect up to 400,000 passengers. Ryanair is changing its holiday year, which currently runs from April to March, to run from January to December instead. This has led to large numbers of its staff taking holidays in September and October. Reports on Monday also suggested recruitment problems were affecting the airline and that it had lost pilots to rival Norwegian Air. A Norwegian spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that 140 pilots have joined us from Ryanair this year. Pilot recruitment is also underway for more pilots for our new Dublin base opening later this year."" The airline has promised affected customers alternative flights or refunds. However, many have reacted angrily to the cancellations on social media and called for a full list of affected flights to be released. Karen Higgins tweeted: ""Yet another day of constant checking to see if our flights are safe or cancelled! Cmon @Ryanair help us all out! Get the updates done!!!!"" Dee Moloney tweeted: ""Have 2 trips booked in the next couple of weeks. Excitement of trips now replaced with worry!... Won't be flying with @Ryanair again."" Shares in Ryanair were down 2% on Monday afternoon. The EU compensation rules for cancelled flights are as follows: Passengers are entitled to assistance and compensation, if the disruption was within an airline's control. Airlines have to offer full refunds, paid within seven days, or rebookings for a flight cancelled at short notice. In addition, passengers can also claim compensation. Cancellation amounts are: 250 euros (Â£218) for short-haul, 440 euros (Â£384) for medium-haul and 600 euros (Â£523) for long-haul. Passengers who reach their destination more than three hours late can be compensated from 200 to 600 euros, depending on the length of flights and delay. Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights?

MPs reveal scale of abuse they face,"This video can not be played MPs on the abuse they faced during the election campaign Standing for Parliament in the UK can mean facing death threats, online intimidation, verbal abuse and vandalism, according to MPs surveyed by BBC Radio 5 live. All 650 MPs were contacted by 5 live and asked for their experiences, under condition of anonymity. Of the 113 who replied, just over half - 51% - said the 2017 general election campaign had been the worst they had ever experienced. This was especially true among Conservative MPs, with 41 out of 47 saying they had been targeted. But nearly all of the MPs - 87% - said they had faced some form of abuse on the campaign trail. ""Does a man coming into my office threatening to bomb it count?"" said one female Labour MP. ""Intimidated at hustings by large crowd shouting abuse,"" a female Conservative MP reported. A male MP, belonging to one of the other parties, said he had had a ""bottle smashed on me"". 77 Male MPs and 36 women took part in the survey, which was conducted in July Party make-up of respondents: 47 Conservative, 45 Labour, 10 SNP and 11 belonging to other parties British politics has always been a rough business - election candidates are used to being heckled at meetings or harangued in the street by voters with a grievance. But the rise of social media has seen the insults take on a nastier and more personal edge. Women and ethnic minority candidates face the worst of it,according to the House of Commons authorities,who are trying to find ways to protect them. A Commons spokesman said: ""The increasing levels of abuse and threats made against Members of Parliament, their staff and families, are unacceptable. ""No one should have to endure this as 'part of the job', and we take this problem extremely seriously."" He said MPs were offered advice on keeping themselves safe and work was under way to provide personal security training. They were also given advice on safer use of social media. But responsibility for the safety of MPs away from Parliament was down to local police forces. Three-quarters of the MPs who replied reported examples of online abuse in the 2017 campaign. ""Graphics with false images of false expenses claims, death threats,"" one female SNP MP told 5 live. ""Social media campaign and co-ordinated Facebook attacks,"" said a male Labour MP. ""Misogynist comments, sexual abuse. My children saw this and were disgusted,"" said a female Conservative MP. The abuse on social media came from the public and members of rival parties, although 10 Labour MPs reported abuse from members of their own party. A majority of the MPs surveyed - 64% - said women received more abuse than men. Verbal abuse was reported by two-thirds of the MPs in the survey, with one male Labour MP saying he had been ""called an IRA terrorist in front of my wife and seven-year-old boy"". And there were several reports of death threats made to a candidate in person, with one female Conservative MP saying she had been ""threatened to be put in a coffin"". More than a third of the MPs said their campaign materials had been damaged or destroyed. Most of them were Conservatives, who reported signs being ripped and posters being defaced with obscenities. Some of these are shown below, although the worst examples are too graphic to publish. ""Signs hammered in garden at 11pm at night waking children who are sleeping,"" wrote one male Conservative MP. One female Labour MP said she had had her windows ""put in three times"". Tory MP Sheryll Murray had her billboards defaced Just over half of the MPs in the survey said they were not bothered by the abuse they received, although 9% said they had been ""extremely upset"" and 39% were ""fairly upset"". ""I'm resigned to it - what upsets me is the impact on my staff and family,"" said a female Labour MP. A male Conservative MP told the survey: ""It is very disappointing, but most importantly it has a profound effect on family and friends and undermines our democracy. Unfortunately I've got used to it."" Nineteen of the MPs in the survey said they would not recommend standing for Parliament. ""Because you might get elected and then it really starts,"" commented one Conservative man. Labour's Paula Sherriff was targeted by an abusive Facebook image Others were in two minds - ""I am seriously considering whether or not to stand next time and so am not sure if I would encourage others to stand,"" a male MP belonging to one of the smaller parties told the survey. ""Depends on the person - would have to tell them if female being called a bitch etc is normal,"" wrote a female Labour MP. But the majority of those surveyed shared the view of another female Labour MP, who said: ""Although it can be off-putting we can't let it be a barrier to our democracy and need to do more to fight abuse."" Many MPs said social media platforms like Facebook should do more to stamp out abuse, such as ending the anonymity of users, while others pointed the finger at the police for not taking it seriously enough. ""The police should not see it as a case of 'all is fair in love and war'. Useless,"" said one Conservative. Others in the survey laid the blame firmly at the door of the media, for lowering the tone of political debate, while others said the parties did not do enough. One Labour MP said: ""Lots of it is down to the leaders of political parties - who are mostly ineffective. Particularly my own leader - he thinks it's enough just to say 'I condemn all abuse!' He and his closest allies are blowing the dog whistle. It shouldn't surprise them that the dogs are barking.""

Iraqi Kurdish referendum: What is at stake?,"Iraqi Kurds have long claimed the right to their own state On 25 September, the residents of Kurdish-controlled areas inside Iraq will have the opportunity to vote in a referendum on their preference for the future of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), a semi-autonomous region within Iraq's current borders. The referendum ballot asks: ""Do you want the Kurdistan region and the Kurdistani areas outside the region's administration to become an independent state?"" Being that the majority of voters in the balloted areas are ethnic Kurds with a strong history of seeking self-determination, the result will almost certainly be a Yes. However, no matter what the residents of Kurdish-controlled areas decide, the referendum has no immediate administrative effects. There is no mechanism for a part of Iraq to secede from the country, so the referendum will not trigger a ""Kexit"" the same way that the recent UK referendum on whether to stay in or leave the European Union triggered ""Brexit"". One may well ask, why then are they holding a vote and why now? Domestic politics in Kurdistan has certainly shaped the timing of the referendum. The KRI's president Massoud Barzani has exceeded his term in office and wants to symbolically begin the process of independence before he steps down during the next KRI elections, scheduled for 1 November. This video can not be played Massoud Barzani spoke to the BBC Another reason for the referendum is to create a fresh mandate for the Kurds to get international backing for an eventual negotiated exit from Iraq and the declaration of a new UN-recognised state, probably within the next five to 10 years. The KRI was autonomous since Saddam Hussein's forces withdrew from parts of northern Iraq at the end of the 1991 Gulf War, with the Kurds developing their own parliament, ministries and armed forces. They even used a different currency from Saddam's Iraq and received 17% of Saddam's oil revenues under a UN-administered deal. Sykes-Picot: The map that spawned a century of resentment Who are the Kurds? Iraqi Kurdistan profile Looking back, most Kurds wished they had stayed in this arrangement. Instead, they agreed to provisionally rejoin Iraq in the wake of the 2003 US-led invasion, in return for US and Iraqi promises that the KRI would continue to operate semi-autonomously, receive earmarked funding from the federal oil revenues, and begin the process of negotiating permanent border changes and perhaps independence with the federal government in Baghdad. However, Baghdad began to fight over the KRI's semi-autonomous status and negotiations became deadlocked. The KRI's president Massoud Barzani recently described the decision to stay inside Iraq as ""a big mistake"". In the last 14 years the Kurds have expanded the areas that they physically control, to encompass many areas that contain oil reserves or where large numbers of non-Kurds live, such as Kirkuk province. The Kurds have also built up 600,000 barrels per day of oil exports by attracting international investors and exporting the oil through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline to Mediterranean loading terminals. This is an incredible achievement for a land-locked stateless people surrounded by suspicious nations. But the KRI still lacks many of the final characteristics of a state. The region cannot secure sovereign loans at acceptable interest rates or receive end-user certificates to purchase arms in the same manner as UN-recognised states. Kurdish oil sales are periodically threatened by Baghdad with legal challenges. Baghdad controls Kurdish airspace. KRI residents must use Iraqi passports and suffer from the same visa restrictions as Iraqis, even though the Kurdistan region is much safer than federal Iraq. The KRI leadership is likely to press ahead with the referendum because Iraq, Turkey, Iran and the international community failed to craft an effective combination of threats and promises to compel a postponement. Turkey will rhetorically condemn the referendum but will probably not close the border or Kurdistan's vital oil export pipelines. Iran, federal Iraq forces and Iranian-backed Shia militias are unlikely to seriously threaten the well-prepared Kurdish defences. Much of the bluster from Iran and Turkey seems designed to suppress a potential domino effect that could encourage Iranian, Turkish (and Syrian) Kurds to greater separatist efforts. Many senior Iraqi politicians have confided to me in private that they believe the KRI is slowly and irreversibly becoming an independent state. But no Iraqi leader can say this publicly, not least when local and national elections loom in Iraq in April or May 2018. No Iraqi prime minister wants Iraq to formally be broken up on his watch. Turkey and Iran fear a ""Yes"" vote will encourage their own Kurdish minorities This dynamic will drive Baghdad to kick the can down the road by offering new negotiations on the devolution of greater powers to the KRI. Both sides will debate the thorny issue of Kirkuk and other so-called disputed areas - mostly controlled by the Kurdish-majority KRI but inhabited by Kurds and non-Kurds and still claimed by Baghdad. These kinds of talks have been happening ever since 2003. What this all means is that the day after the referendum may look very much like the day before. On 31 December 1999, the world expected the Y2K bug to switch off all computers, but on 1 January 2000 nothing much had changed. The Kurdistan independence referendum may be similarly thrilling until the event but anti-climactic afterwards.

"How seller feedback helped build eBay, Uber and AirBnB","In Shanghai, an Uber driver logs into an online forum. He is not looking for a passenger. He is looking for someone to pretend to be a passenger. He finds a willing taker. He pretends to collect the customer and drop her at the airport. In fact, they never meet. Then he goes online and sends her the agreed fee: about $1.60 (Â£1.20). Or perhaps the driver goes a step further, making up the other person as well as the journey. He goes to the online marketplace Taobao, and buys a hacked smartphone. That lets him create multiple fake identities. He uses one to arrange a ride with himself. Uber invites customers to rate drivers, and drivers to rate customers Why? Because someone's willing to pay him to give people lifts in his car. Investors in Uber and their rivals have run up billions of dollars of losses - in China, and elsewhere - paying people to share car journeys. Naturally, they're trying to stamp out the imaginary journeys, but they're convinced subsidising genuine rides is a smart idea. This all seems bizarre, perverse, even. But everyone involved is rationally pursuing economic incentives. To see what's going on, we have to understand a phenomenon that's spawned many buzzwords: ""crowd-based capitalism"", ""collaborative consumption"", ""the sharing economy"", ""the trust economy"". 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Suppose I'm about to drive myself from downtown Shanghai to the airport. I occupy only one seat in my car. Now suppose you live a block away, and you also need to catch a flight. Why don't I give you a lift? You could pay me a modest sum, less than you'd pay for some other mode of transport. You're better off. I'm better off. There are two big reasons why this might not happen. The first, and most obvious, is if neither of us knows the other exists. Until recently, the only way you could advertise your desire for a lift would be to stand at a junction, holding up a sign saying ""airport"". It's not very practical - especially since the plane won't wait. This function of matching people who have coincidental wants is among the most powerful ways the internet is reshaping the economy. Traditional markets work perfectly well for some goods and services, but they're less useful when the goods and services are urgent or obscure. Consider the plight of Mark Fraser. It was 1995. Mark Fraser gave lots of presentations, and he really wanted a laser pointer - they were new, and cool, but also forbiddingly expensive. For the first time, eBay connected people who wanted stuff with those who wanted to sell it Fraser, however, was an electronics geek. He was confident that if he could get his hands on a broken laser pointer, he could fix it. But where on earth would he find a broken laser pointer? The answer, now, is obvious - try Taobao, or eBay, or some other online marketplace. Back then, eBay had only just started. Its very first sale: Mark Fraser bought a broken laser pointer. Mark Fraser was taking a bit of a risk. He didn't know the seller. He simply had to trust that they wouldn't simply pocket his $14.83 (Â£11.20) then disappear. For other transactions, the stakes are higher. That's the second reason I might not give you a lift to Shanghai airport. I've no idea who you are. Perhaps you're planning to attack me and steal my car? You might doubt my motives, too - perhaps I'm a serial killer. After all, hitch-hiking was a popular pursuit a few decades ago, but fell out of fashion after some well-publicised murders. Trust is an essential component of markets - so essential that we often don't even notice it, like a fish doesn't notice water. In developed economies, enablers of trust are everywhere: brands, money-back guarantees, and of course repeat transactions with a seller who can be easily located. But the new sharing economy lacks those enablers. Why should we get into a stranger's car - or buy a stranger's laser pointer? AirBnB emphasises the personal connection between hosts and guests In 1997, eBay introduced a feature that helped solve the problem: Seller Feedback. According to Jim Griffith, eBay's first customer service representative, ""no-one had ever seen anything like [it]"". The idea of both parties rating each other after a transaction has become ubiquitous. You buy something online - you rate the seller, the seller rates you. You use a lift-sharing service, like Uber - you rate the driver, the driver rates you. You stay in an AirBnB - you rate the host, the host rates you. A few positive reviews set our mind at ease about a stranger. Jim Griffith says he's ""not so sure [eBay] would have grown without [seller feedback]"". Online matching platforms would still exist, of course - eBay already did - but perhaps they'd be more like hitch-hiking today: a niche pursuit for the unusually adventurous, not a mainstream activity that's transforming whole sectors of the economy. Platforms like Uber and AirBnB, eBay and TaskRabbit create real value. TaskRabbit connects customers with so-called ""Taskers"" to help with a variety of odd jobs But there are losers. For all the touchy-feeliness of the buzzwords - ""collaborative"", ""sharing"", ""trust"" - these models aren't just heart-warming stories of neighbours coming together to borrow each other's power drills. They can easily lead to cut-throat capitalism. How the smartphone became so smart Just Google it: The student project that changed the world Money via mobile: The M-Pesa revolution The surprising ways video games have shaped the economy Established hotels and taxi companies are aghast at competition from AirBnB and Uber. Is that just an incumbent trying to suppress competition? Or are they right when they complain that the new platforms are ignoring important regulations? Many countries have rules to protect workers, like guaranteed hours or working conditions or a minimum wage. And many people on platforms like Uber aren't just monetising spare capacity. A banner reading ""No tourist flats"" hangs from a balcony to protest against holiday rental apartments for tourists in Barcelona They're trying to make a living, without the protections of a formal job - perhaps because a company liked Uber competed them out of a job. Some regulations protect customers, too - for example, from discrimination. Hotels can't legally refuse you a room if you're, say, a same-sex couple. But hosts on AirBnb can choose to turn down guests after seeing not just your feedback but your photos. AirBnb builds trust by emphasising the personal connection, and that means showing people prominent pictures of who they're dealing with. That also invites people to act on their personal prejudices, consciously or otherwise.People from ethnic minorities have been shown to suffer as a result.

How online matching platforms should be regulated is a dilemma causing lawmakers around the world to scratch their heads. It matters because it's potentially huge business, especially in emerging markets where there isn't yet a culture of owning things like cars. And it's a business with network effects: the more people use a platform, the more attractive it becomes. That's why Uber and its rivals - Didi Chuxing in China, Grab in southeast Asia, Ola in India - have invested massively in subsidising rides and giving credits to new customers: they wanted to get big first. And, naturally, some drivers have been tempted to defraud them. Remember how they did it? By using an online forum to find a willing fake customer, or an online marketplace to buy a hacked smartphone. Matching people with the particular things they want really is useful.

Rooney due in court on drink-drive charge,"This video can not be played Wayne Rooney arrives in court on drink-drive charge Former England captain Wayne Rooney has appeared in court and admitted drink-driving. He was arrested when police stopped a car in Wilmslow, Cheshire, in the early hours on 1 September. The 31-year-old was banned from driving for two years and ordered to perform 100 hours of unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order. Rooney was also ordered to pay Â£170 when he appeared at Stockport Magistrates' Court. The court heard Rooney was almost three times the legal limit when he was stopped by police at 02:00 BST. A breathalyser test showed his alcohol level was 104 microgrammes in 100 millilitres of breath. The drink-drive limit in England and Wales is 35 microgrammes per 100 millilitres of breath.

In a statement issued after the hearing, the Everton footballer said: ""I want publicly to apologise for my unforgivable lack of judgment in driving while over the legal limit. It was completely wrong. ""I have already said sorry to my family, my manager and chairman and everyone at Everton FC. Now I want to apologise to all the fans and everyone else who has followed and supported me throughout my career. ""Of course I accept the sentence of the court and hope that I can make some amends through my community service."" Wayne Rooney arriving at Stockport Magistrates' Court Wearing a blue suit with his hands in his pockets, Rooney walked into the court building accompanied by a small entourage. Kate Gaskell, prosecuting, said a police officer on patrol was on duty in Altrincham Road, Wilmslow, at 02:10 BST when they noticed the rear tail-light of a Volkswagen Beetle on the left hand side had gone out. She said the officer intended to follow the vehicle but it pulled over with Rooney seen to be at the wheel with a female in the front passenger seat. Ms Gaskell said the footballer provided a positive roadside breath test before he was taken to a police station where the reading was confirmed. The judge told Rooney: ""You placed yourself and other road users at risk"" The court heard that Rooney currently had three points on his driving licence for a speeding offence on August 24 2016. Rooney's legal team had asked District Judge John Temperley to consider not imposing a community order because of his ongoing charitable work. However, the judge said he was ""not convinced"" that imposing a large fine ""would have the same effect"". Rooney's lawyer, Mike Rainford, told the court it was likely that Everton would fine the player two weeks' wages, which the BBC understands to be about Â£300,000. Judge Temperley said: ""This is a serious matter... you placed yourself and other road users at risk as a result of your poor judgement that night. ""I accept your remorse is genuine and that you are aware of the adverse affects the events of that night have had, not least on your family."" Rooney was also told to pay Â£85 prosecution costs and a victim surcharge for the same amount. BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan has been in court following proceedings. Allow Twitter content?

Schizophrenia - have you got it wrong?,"Schizophrenia does not mean you have a split personality or automatically become violent, a mental health charity has warned. Rethink Mental Illness said a survey of 1,500 people showed that the condition is widely misunderstood. Schizophrenia commonly causes hallucinations, such as hearing voices, or delusions and can make people lose interest in life. But it should not be ""a dirty word or a term of abuse"", the charity said. The organisation warned such myths are dangerous. One in 100 people is affected by schizophrenia during their life, but 45% of those surveyed thought the illness was much more common. Half mistakenly thought the illness was defined by a split personality and a quarter believed it definitely led to violent behaviour. But the reality is very different, a new campaign by the charity claims. How schizophrenia changed my whole life It is not true that ""someone with schizophrenia can appear perfectly normal at one moment, and change into a different person the next"", the Royal College of Psychiatrists says on itswebsite,external. And although there is a higher risk of violent behaviour if you have schizophrenia, it does not necessarily make people dangerous. Comparatively, drugs and alcohol cause far more violence. People with schizophrenia are far more likely to be harmed by other people than other people are to be harmed by them, the psychiatrists say. Schizophrenia can affect the way individuals think, feel and behave. Experiencing hallucinations is common and people often hear voices, which can sound very real and be critical and abusive, although they are all in the mind. Brain scans have discovered higher activity levels in part of the brain's immune system in schizophrenia patients than in healthy volunteers Delusions can occur too, which means believing something completely and feeling like no-one else sees the world in the same way. Other symptoms can include depression, loss of concentration and feeling uncomfortable around other people. Some people also have painful feelings in their body. The Rethink Schizophrenia campaign said the illness can affect other aspects of life too - for example people with schizophrenia die 15 to 20 years earlier than the rest of the population on average. And only 8% of those with the illness who want to work are currently employed. The charity said this is because physical health problems are often missed or attributed to mental illness, and the side-effects of medication can cause complications. Brian Dow, director of external affairs at Rethink Mental Illness, said: ""It's about time we all got to grips with what schizophrenia is and what it isn't. ""Schizophrenia can be treated and managed, just like many other illnesses. It's not a dirty word or, worse, a term of abuse."" He added that myths stopped people from getting jobs, forming relationships and getting access to the healthcare they needed. ""The symptoms of schizophrenia don't fit neatly into a box, everyone will experience it differently,"" he said. ""However, we can all play a role in rethinking schizophrenia, and helping to change attitudes, by learning to separate the myths from the facts."" Prof Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said it was ""astounding"" that schizophrenia was still so widely misunderstood. ""To tackle the stigma that so many living with schizophrenia face, we have a huge task ahead of us in informing and educating the public,"" she said. ""We also need to ensure that more medical students choose psychiatry so that those living with schizophrenia have specialist doctors available to treat them.""

Farm animals dying in transit,"An exhausted bull was seen being trampled on while stalled at a Turkish border Animal welfare is being neglected on long journeys across Europe amid a booming livestock trade, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme found. Livestock hauliers were found to routinely break EU laws for the protection of animals in transit. It follows monitoring by welfare charities in Bulgaria, an EU entry point to Turkey and the Middle East. The UK government said it would ""take steps to control the export of live animals for slaughter"" post-Brexit. But some animal rights groups are sceptical, and call for a ban on journeys of more than eight hours. The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme investigated their concerns. UK exports of live cattle, sheep and pigs have tripled in value over the past five years, to more than Â£21m in 2016, according to HM Revenue and Customs. The market is fuelled by a desire among some religious communities for live animals and, in some cases, difficulties in rearing livestock and refrigerating meat. Across the EU, total exports of live cattle and sheep were worth more than â¬4bn (Â£3.5bn) last year, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistical office. Exports of cattle and sheep from Europe to non-EU countries such as Turkey, with lower animal welfare standards, have increased in value by about 50% since 2012. This video can not be played An animal investigator said the conditions sheep were transported in were ""like an oven"" Christine Hafner, an animal investigator for welfare charities, has been working on the Turkish border. She said animals die every summer at the border because of long delays while transporters wait to clear Turkish customs. The BBC saw widespread health issues among livestock being transported into Turkey, including respiratory problems, eye conditions, and animals suffering from exhaustion or dehydration. A bull was found dead on the top deck of a transporter on the Turkish border, while its driver was waiting to collect customs papers. During an incident witnessed by the BBC last month, a truck of 500 sheep became stuck between checkpoints for four days in high temperatures without access to food and water. When it was unloaded in Turkey, at least one sheep was found dead inside. Ms Hafner said: ""When sheep are forced to stand for many hours, if not days, on a truck, in more than 35-degree heat, with their heads and backs touching the ceiling, it's like an oven."" The Bulgarian border authority told the BBC ""the consignment complied with all requirements relating to animal welfare during transport"". All live animal exports from Britain and Europe are controlled by an EU regulation, which lays down rules on journey times and rest periods Transporters are required to prepare travel plans, which should be approved by the national authority in the country of departure Handlers must be properly trained, while vehicles should meet standards of safety and provide adequate space for the animals Water, feed and rest must be provided when needed. Source:EU legislation,external The requirements continue to apply up to the point of unloading at the place of destination, even if it is outside of Europe. But Ms Hafner said the laws were frequently broken, especially when transporters cross the border into Turkey. Exports of cattle and sheep from Europe to non-EU countries have increased in value by about 50% since 2012 The BBC has seen evidence that European consignments of animals entering Turkey routinely record an incorrect destination on journey logs. Once over the border, livestock is often re-routed ad hoc to slaughterhouses hundreds of miles away, in Ankara, Istanbul and the Middle East. The practice is illegal under EU laws, which require animals to be rested in stables for 48 hours first. The EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis, said: ""In my point of view we have enough laws. ""The main issues are enforcement, the level of official control, and the education of all operators involved in live animal transport."" Responding to the BBC's findings of systemic rule-breaking by European transporters of live animals, Mr Andriukaitis agreed it was ""absolutely cause for concern"". He said: ""We have sent a fact-finding mission to the Bulgarian border to try to address these problems."" A spokesman for the UK government said it would ""consider the option to limit journey times involving farm animals for slaughter once Britain has left the EU"".

Caribbean braces for major new hurricane,"This video can not be played Watch: The islanders caught between hurricanes Hurricane Maria has strengthened to a major category three hurricane, US forecasters say, as it heads towards the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean. It is due to hit on Monday night local time. Maria is moving roughly along the same path as Irma, the hurricane that devastated the region this month. The authorities fear Maria could whip up and throw the debris left behind by Hurricane Irma. Lieutenant Colonel Paul Maynard, a Royal Marine deployed to the British Virgin Islands, told the Press Association the hurricane could pick the debris up, ""spin it around, and throw it like ammunition"". ""It could cause potentially more casualties and fatalities than Irma did,"" he added. Hurricane Irma: A visual guide Damage mapped The UK's International Development Secretary, Priti Patel, said: ""British troops, police and aid experts are working relentlessly to get help to the victims of Hurricane Irma. Those same individuals will now be tasked with also preparing for the impact of Maria."" Hurricane warnings have been issued for Guadeloupe, Dominica, St Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, Martinique, St Lucia and the US and British Virgin Islands. A hurricane watch is in effect for Puerto Rico, St Martin, St Barts, Saba, St Eustatius and Anguilla. Some of these islands are still recovering after being hit by Irma - a category five hurricane which left at least 37 people dead and caused billions of dollars' worth of damage. In itslatest update on Monday,external, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that Maria had maximum sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph). They warned that heavy rainfall caused by the hurricane ""could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides"". The eye of the storm is 100 miles east of Martinique, and Maria is moving west-northwest at about 13mph. ""Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the NHC said. In the French territory of Guadeloupe, schools, businesses and government buildings have all been closed and severe flooding is predicted in low-lying parts of the islands. Preparations have also begun in Puerto Rico, where Maria is expected to bring strong winds on Tuesday. The Leeward Islands - where Maria will first strike - includes Antigua and Barbuda. The latter island was evacuated after beingdevastatedby Irma. The NHC says that Maria could produce a ""dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves"" that would raise water levels by as much as 2.7 metres (9ft). It also forecasts a maximum potential rainfall of 51cm (20in) in some areas of the central and southern Leeward Islands - including Puerto Rico and the US and British Virgin Islands - through to Wednesday night. The destruction of Barbuda Drone footage of Saint-Martin after Irma Earlier this month, Irma left more than two-thirds of homes on the Dutch side of the island of St Martin (known as Sint Maarten) uninhabitable, with no electricity, gas or drinking water. The French government has said its side of St Martin - known as Saint-Martin - sustained about â¬1.2bn ($1.44bn; Â£1.1bn) in damage, with nine deaths across Saint-Martin and nearby St Barts. This video can not be played A BBC team visited Caribbean islands that have been devastated by Hurricane Irma On the British Virgin Islands, entire neighbourhoods were flattened. After a visit to the area, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson described the damage as something ""you see in images from the First World War"". In pictures: Irma devastates British Virgin Islands Virgin boss Richard Branson, who has a home in the Virgin Islands, has been tweeting ahead of the Maria's predicted arrival, warning people to stay safe.

The Puerto Rican government has issued a statement saying it expects the hurricane to make landfall there as a category three on Tuesday. The US territory escaped the worst of the damage from Irma - although it experienced widespread power cuts - and it has been an important hub for getting relief to islands that were more badly affected. ""Puerto Rico is our lifeline,"" Judson Burdon, a resident of Anguilla, told Reuters news agency. ""We had two volunteer flights cancel because of the weather that is coming."" American military units were evacuated from the US Virgin Islands on Sunday Irma also hit the US, where several dozen deaths were linked to the hurricane. Nearly 6.9 million homes were left without power in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama. A second hurricane, Jose, is also active in the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 90mph. The centre of the storm wasabout 265 miles east-south-east of Cape Hatteras,externalin North Carolina, the NHC said in its advisory at 18:00 GMT on Monday.

LGBT student shot dead by US police,"This video can not be played 'Why did you kill my son?' University police in the US state of Georgia have shot and killed an LGBT student activist, sparking an inquiry. Police encountered Scout Schultz, 21, outside a campus dormitory in Atlanta after a call about ""a person with a knife and a gun"" late on Saturday. Video shows Schultz refusing to obey police commands, and advancing on them. A family lawyer said Schultz was holding a closed multi-tool. The student's parents said police should not have used lethal force. ""Why did you have to shoot?"" the victim's father said at an emotional news conference on Monday. ""That's the question, I mean that's the only question that matters right now. Why did you kill my son?"" In a video filmed by a fellow student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Schultz is pictured outside the entrance to a parking garage and can be heard saying ""Shoot me!"" several times while walking towards the officers. ""Drop the knife, man, come on,"" a police officer responds. ""Nobody wants to hurt you,"" another says, before one officer eventually opens fire, hitting Schultz in the chest. Schultz did not appear to be holding a gun, investigators said, despite what had initially been reported to police. The computer engineering student from Lilburn, Georgia, was transported to the Grady Memorial Hospital, later dying from injuries sustained in the shooting,the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said,external. Schultz's mother noted that the engineering student (pictured) was very active on campus Police in the US are permitted - and often required - to use lethal force against any suspect who they believe presents an immediate danger to officers or members of the community. Officers must have a ""reasonable belief"" that an individual is capable of committing violence, in order to fire on them. Exact figures for police shootings vary widely, since police forces are not required to submit incidents to the FBI for data collection. But according to the Washington Post, which tracks civilian deaths at the hands of police,nearly 1,000 people were killed across the country in 2015. US police shootings: How many die each year? Intersex patients 'routinely lied to by doctors' Model reveals she is intersex to 'break taboo' No police officers from the Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) were injured in Saturday night's incident, the schools' police force has said. The officer who opened fire has not been named. Georgia Tech's campus police do not carry Tasers, but are equipped with pepper spray. School representatives say it was probably the first on-campus police shooting in the past 20 years, if ever. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

News Daily: Tube bombing suspects questioned and LGBT activist shot,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: It's three days since the attack on a Tube train in south-west London andpolice are continuing to question two men, aged 18 and 21, on suspicion of terror offences.Searches are also taking place at two addresses in Surrey. And CCTV images have emerged showing a man carrying a Lidl supermarket bag 90 minutes before the blast. Meanwhile, the UK's terror threat level has been lowered to severe, after it was raised to critical - the highest level - following the explosion at Parsons Green station, which injured 30 people. ""This is not the same as an 'all clear',"" says BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani. ""Intelligence is only ever fragmentary."" He adds that, ""providing they make evidential progress"", detectives could hold the suspects for up to a fortnight before they have to charge or release them. Police say they may have to work with ""paedophile hunters""- vigilantes who pose online as children then film the people they meet. This comes after figures obtained by the BBC show the proportion of prosecutions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for the crime of meeting a child following sexual grooming which used such evidence quadrupled from 11% in 2014 to 44% in 2016. Police have previously urged the vigilantes to stop, but admit this is not happening.

The Handmaid's Tale wins main Emmy awards,"Elisabeth Moss won best actress in a drama series for The Handmaid's Tale Dystopian TV series The Handmaid's Tale has scooped the top drama honours at this year's Emmy Awards. The show won five awards including best drama series, best actress for Elisabeth Moss and best supporting actress for Ann Dowd. Big Little Lies took five prizes in the limited series categories, including wins for Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern. The British winners included Riz Ahmed, who took best lead actor in a limited series or movie for The Night Of. Riz Ahmed and Charlie Brooker were among the British winners Other British winners included Charlie Brooker, who won best writing for a limited series for his Netflix show Black Mirror. One of the episodes, San Junipero, also won the trophy for best TV movie. Brooker said it ""was a story about love, and love will defeat hate, it will win"". British comedian John Oliver and his writing team scooped two prizes for satirical show Last Week Tonight. The Handmaid's Tale's win for best drama series means Hulu has become the first streaming service to win that award, beating the likes of big hitters Netflix and Amazon. Emmy Awards: Key winners An 'incredible yearâ for women on TV Donald Glover makes history In pictures: Fashion at the Emmys Bruce Miller - who won two trophies as the show's writer and executive producer - thanked author Margaret Atwood, ""who created this world for all of us"". The show is adapted from Atwood's 1985 novel. In the limited series categories, HBO's Big Little Lies won best lead actress, (Nicole Kidman), supporting actress (Laura Dern), supporting actor (Alexander Skarsgard), director (Jean-Marc Vallee) and best limited series. Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon star in Big Little Lies Accepting the award for best limited series, Kidman, who played an abused wife, said that ""as much as the show has the entertainment value, it's about the issues"". She told the Emmys audience: ""We've shone a light on domestic abuse. It's a complicated, insidious disease. It exists far more than we allow ourselves to know."" Julia Louis-Dreyfus won best actress in a comedy series for Veep for the sixth year in a row - breaking the record for the most Emmys won by a lead actor for the same role. Veep, which was created by Armando Iannucci, also won one the prize for best comedy series. Julia Louis Dreyfus has played the lead role in Veep in all six of its seasons Sterling K Brown's win for best lead actor in a drama series marked the first time an African-American actor had won in the category in almost 20 years. Atlanta star Donald Glover scored another historic first by becoming the first black person to win an Emmy for directing a comedy show, while Master of None's Lena Waithe became the first African-American woman to win for comedy writing. Political references became a running theme during the night - with host Stephen Colbert and several winners poking fun at US President Donald Trump. ""At long last, Mr President, here is your Emmy,"" said Alec Baldwin as he collected his prize for supporting actor in a comedy series, mocking the president's frustration at never having won for The Apprentice. Baldwin regularly portrays President Trump on comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live, which won four awards including best variety sketch series and best supporting actress in a comedy series for Kate McKinnon. Spicer appeared with a podium resembling the one he used to use as press secretary And after he was named best lead actor in a comedy series, Glover said: ""I want to thank Trump for making black people number one on the most oppressed list."" Jaws also dropped when Mr Trump's former press secretary Sean Spicer came on stage to joke that the ceremony would attract ""the largest audience to witness an Emmys"" - a reference to disputed claims he made over numbers attending the president's inauguration in January. In the competition, several high-profile series failed to live up to expectations, including Westworld and Stranger Things, which both went home empty-handed. Game of Thrones, a big winner at previous Emmys, wasn't eligible this year because episodes from its last series didn't air during the Emmys eligibility window.

Wales since 1997 in 10 charts,"The landscape stays as beautiful as ever but how has Wales changed in 20 years since the devolution referendum? How has Wales changed since 1997? That's a big subject. But here are 10 charts giving you a snapshot of how things might be a bit different - or in some cases, pretty much the same. 1 How is the economy performing? This measure looks at how much money is generated per person per year through goods produced and services delivered. The most recent regional gross value added (GVA) figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show Wales had the lowest GVA per head of UK nations and regions at Â£18,002. Poorer areas like west Wales and Valleys - which stretch from Anglesey, down to Pembrokeshire and across to the old Gwent valleys - are even further behind. When you look at incomes, back in 1997, the gross disposable household income in Wales was 86.3% of the UK figure. The most recent figure, for 2015, shows the gap has widened slightly and it is 85.5% of the UK figure. Some experts say we also need tolook at levels of debt and personal borrowing, which suggest that people are struggling. 2: Poverty affects nearly a quarter of households Tackling poverty in Wales has been a constant theme over the last 20 years from both ministers and charities. There has been a target to eradicate child poverty by 2020 but ministershave said they do not have the powers to make enough in-roads. Latest figures show around 400,000 working-age adults in Wales are in households with less than 60% of median household income in the UK - the yardstick for measuring poverty. This chart shows that the proportion of people living in this category - after housing costs are taken into account - has dropped but remains at 23%. 3: Progress in tackling 'the biggest killer' Heart and circulatory diseases - grouped together as cardiovascular disease (CVD) - are responsible for more than 9,000 deaths in Wales a year. Within that, coronary heart disease is Wales' biggest killer - responsible for 11 deaths a day.  It is responsible for nearly three times as many deaths among women as breast cancer. A fall in the death rate from CVD since the 1960s - accompanied by the healthier lifestyle message hitting home - has included asteady declineover the last 20 years. But there are still worries about inequalities and people dying too early.  In Wales, for those under 75 there are 78.4 deaths per 100,000 from CVD - worse than any region of England, apart from the north west.A study for the British Heart Foundation,externalfound in parts of the south Wales valleys the death rate is higher than 100. The life expectancy in Wales, although still trailing that in England, has risen between three and four years. It was just under 74 for men and 79 for women in 1997; the most recent figures are just over 78.5 for men and just over 82 for women. 4: We smoke and drink a bit less The smoking ban in public placescame into force in Wales in April 2007,externala few months ahead of England - with hopes it would encourage more smokers to stub it out. The ban has changed the environment of pubs, restaurants, sports stadiums, public transport and workplaces. When it was introduced, it was claimed that 25,000 smokers in Wales wanted to quit and we can see the proportion who smoke has now fallen to less than a fifth. There are now an estimated 65,000 fewer regular smokers since the restrictions came into force. As for alcohol, it is suggested there is still anissue with binge drinking in Wales- but there has been a fall in recent years in the number of people who drink more than three or four units in one day. 5: More micro businesses Self-employed people and micro-enterprises - which employ between one and nine people - already made up a high proportion of Welsh businesses. But the numbers have swelled, rising from just under 159,000 in 2003 to 237,215 micro businesses in 2016. This is now 95% of all businesses in Wales. Merthyr has the lowest and Powys the highest proportion. The image of Wales as one of heavy industry is long gone although numbers working for large companies - those with a workforce of more than 250 - have risen by 12%.  And there was also a bigger growth in employment with foreign-owned firms than UK-owned companies. Despite cutbacks, the proportion of people working in the public sector has actually risen to 27.3%, slightly more than in 2001. 6: Serious road casualties fall There are more motorists on the roads of Wales than there were 20 years ago - but fewer serious crashes. Just over 1,000 people were badly injured on Wales' roads last year, with more than 100 killed. This is however half way towards a target of cutting serious casualties by 40% from the average between 2004 and 2008. This is also despite the numbers of cars on the roads in Wales rising by 427,000 since 1997. Traffic volume has also risen from 24.18 billion km to 28.40 billion km. There is a target of cutting serious motorcycle casualties by 25% by 2020, although little progress has been made on this. 7: GCSE results have improved If you enjoy statistics, then education in Wales has plenty. You could even take an exam in them. It offers a mixed bag. Most notably perhaps there have now been four lots ofPisa results- which compare 15-year-olds internationally in reading, maths and science, none too favourably. On the other hand, teenagers' performance in GCSE results has been one of continual improvement since 1997. Thegender gaphas been a feature of the last 20 years. Although it has narrowed a little in recent years, those in education admit it is a stubborn feature with boys taking 10 years to reach where the girls were in 1997. 8: Falling short on climate emissions Wales is responsible for 9% of carbon emissions in the UK but although emissions are lower than 20 years ago,it is expected that Wales will miss its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2020. It has currently achieved a 20% reduction, according to latest figures. The target is set to get tougher with an 80% reduction from 1990 levels by 2050. Wales is doing better in other areas of environmental policy, for exampleit met its recycling target four years early. 9: We're online, we're mobile Devolution is as old as, well, the internet. The BBC news website itself was only properly launched in December 1997,after a few trial pages like the one belowto coverthe new Labour government under Tony Blair.Future digital archaeologists will have a virtual museum to this period. How a very early BBC webpage looked before the launch of its full online service in late 1997 Technology has changed rapidly. Internet connection was little more than a man and his mouse 20 years ago. Does anyone else miss the sound of a modem dialling up?This is for you kids.Just looking at how quickly people hooked up to the web is only a snapshot of how transformative it has been to how we work, rest and play. It has not been without its challenges in rural areas but most of Wales is now pretty much online. The latest figures show 84% of households are connected to the internet. As formobile phones, they've got smaller - some would say smarter - and practically every home in Wales has someone with one. Back in 1998, only 16% of us had one. Now it's 94% who have a mobile. Keeping them turned on is another thing. According to the ONS's latest survey, 10% of us say we haven't switched our phone on in the last three months. 4G coverage is also improving, according to Ofcom,external, but Wales still lags behind the whole of the UK when you are outside, with less than half the country having a service. AndWales also comes off worst in the UK,externalwith the slower 3G networks. The peak weight was for the Six Nations opener in February 2015 10: The Welsh rugby team has bulked up Professionalism in rugby was in its infancy back in 1997. But how big has the physical change in the game been in the last 20 years? How much bigger are Welsh rugby players? The combined weight of the team that lined up against England 20 years ago was 1,383kg - that's an average of 92.2kg (14.5st). But if we take that fixture in particular to weigh up the differences, there has been a definite increase - peaking in 2015 with a total weight of 1,625 kg in the starting line-up. That combined heft is a bit more than a family-sized car or an average 108.3kg (17st). This has not been a phenomenon unique to Walesbut there is a suggestion it has reached a plateau as the game is getting faster. Last year's Six Nations starting line-up was the lightest in a decade. Rugby might have the biggest players - but which is the biggest sport in Wales?Football might stake a claim, especially after Wales' semi-final placing in Euro 2016. But it will take more than a single chart to settle that argument.

EU farm animals dying in transit,"An exhausted bull was seen being trampled on while stalled at a Turkish border Animal welfare is being neglected on long journeys across Europe amid a booming livestock trade, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme found. Livestock hauliers were found to routinely break EU laws for the protection of animals in transit. It follows monitoring by welfare charities in Bulgaria, an EU entry point to Turkey and the Middle East. The UK government said it would ""take steps to control the export of live animals for slaughter"" post-Brexit. But some animal rights groups are sceptical, and call for a ban on journeys of more than eight hours. The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme investigated their concerns. UK exports of live cattle, sheep and pigs have tripled in value over the past five years, to more than Â£21m in 2016, according to HM Revenue and Customs. The market is fuelled by a desire among some religious communities for live animals and, in some cases, difficulties in rearing livestock and refrigerating meat. Across the EU, total exports of live cattle and sheep were worth more than â¬4bn (Â£3.5bn) last year, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistical office. Exports of cattle and sheep from Europe to non-EU countries such as Turkey, with lower animal welfare standards, have increased in value by about 50% since 2012. This video can not be played An animal investigator said the conditions sheep were transported in were ""like an oven"" Christine Hafner, an animal investigator for welfare charities, has been working on the Turkish border. She said animals die every summer at the border because of long delays while transporters wait to clear Turkish customs. The BBC saw widespread health issues among livestock being transported into Turkey, including respiratory problems, eye conditions, and animals suffering from exhaustion or dehydration. A bull was found dead on the top deck of a transporter on the Turkish border, while its driver was waiting to collect customs papers. During an incident witnessed by the BBC last month, a truck of 500 sheep became stuck between checkpoints for four days in high temperatures without access to food and water. When it was unloaded in Turkey, at least one sheep was found dead inside. Ms Hafner said: ""When sheep are forced to stand for many hours, if not days, on a truck, in more than 35-degree heat, with their heads and backs touching the ceiling, it's like an oven."" The Bulgarian border authority told the BBC ""the consignment complied with all requirements relating to animal welfare during transport"". All live animal exports from Britain and Europe are controlled by an EU regulation, which lays down rules on journey times and rest periods Transporters are required to prepare travel plans, which should be approved by the national authority in the country of departure Handlers must be properly trained, while vehicles should meet standards of safety and provide adequate space for the animals Water, feed and rest must be provided when needed. Source:EU legislation,external The requirements continue to apply up to the point of unloading at the place of destination, even if it is outside of Europe. But Ms Hafner said the laws were frequently broken, especially when transporters cross the border into Turkey. Exports of cattle and sheep from Europe to non-EU countries have increased in value by about 50% since 2012 The BBC has seen evidence that European consignments of animals entering Turkey routinely record an incorrect destination on journey logs. Once over the border, livestock is often re-routed ad hoc to slaughterhouses hundreds of miles away, in Ankara, Istanbul and the Middle East. The practice is illegal under EU laws, which require animals to be rested in stables for 48 hours first. The EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis, said: ""In my point of view we have enough laws. ""The main issues are enforcement, the level of official control, and the education of all operators involved in live animal transport."" Responding to the BBC's findings of systemic rule-breaking by European transporters of live animals, Mr Andriukaitis agreed it was ""absolutely cause for concern"". He said: ""We have sent a fact-finding mission to the Bulgarian border to try to address these problems."" A spokesman for the UK government said it would ""consider the option to limit journey times involving farm animals for slaughter once Britain has left the EU"".

May in Canada for post-Brexit trade talks,"Prime Minister Theresa May has said she expects a ""seamless transition"" to a new trading relationship with Canada after the UK leaves the EU. She is in Ottawa ahead of a new trade deal between the EU and Canada coming into effect on Thursday. Mrs May's trip is also focused on a trade dispute that could threaten aerospace jobs in Northern Ireland. She has previously lobbied the US about the row involving Canadian firm Bombardier and Boeing. Boeing has complained about alleged anti-competitive practices in the sale of Bombardier's CSeries jet - and Bombardier, which employs 4,500 people in Belfast, could face significant financial penalties if the US trade authorities find against it. PM and Trudeau to discuss Bombardier row Simon Jack: Bombardier in the crossfire Mrs May hopes the upcoming trade deal between Canada and the EU, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta), will be a model for a bilateral trade deal for when the UK is excluded from Ceta after Brexit. Mrs May said: ""We have agreed today that Ceta should be swiftly transitioned to form a new bilateral arrangement between UK and Canada after Brexit... ""We want to ensure that when we leave the European Union, for businesses and people, that change is as smooth and orderly as possible. ""And working on Ceta as becoming the first of the bilateral trade relationships between the UK and Canada that means that seamless transition can take place."" Under the EU-Canada agreement,which took seven years to negotiate, Canada agreed to eliminate 98% of its import duties. Mrs May said there would be a new working group to prepare the groundwork for a separate deal. Under EU membership rules, the UK is prohibited from implementing a foreign free trade agreement until it leaves, so has instead set upworking groupsabroad, including with Japan, the US and Australia. The UK-Canada bilateral trade relationship is thought to be worth Â£15.2bn a year, while Britain is the second-biggest destination for Canadian investment abroad, with Â£1.75bn invested in the country since March.

Myanmar general blames crisis on Rohingya,"Myanmar's top general has blamed Rohingya people for the crisis that has led to hundreds of thousands crossing into Bangladesh. Gen Min Aung Hlaing said the Rohingya ""has never been an ethnic group"", and accused ""extremists"" of trying to form a stronghold in northern Rakhine state. His army is accused of targeting civilians in an offensive there, forcing Rohingya to flee. Myanmar denies this, and says it is responding to deadly militant attacks. The UN has warned that offensive against the Rohingya - most of whom are Muslims, while Myanmar is 90% Buddhist - could amount to ethnic cleansing. This video can not be played Watch: Who are the Rohingya? On Saturday UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that the country's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi had ""a last chance"" to halt the army offensive before the situation becomes ""absolutely horrible"". Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Tales of horror from Myanmar Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? Ina Facebook post,externalon Sunday, Gen Min Aung Hlaing urged people and the media in Myanmar to unite over the ""issue"" of the Rohingya. He said the military operation began after 93 clashes with ""extremist Bengalis"" - referring to Rohingya militants - that began on 25 August. The violence, he added, was an organised attempt to build a stronghold in Rakhine state. ""They have demanded recognition as Rohingya, which has never been an ethnic group in Myanmar. (The) Bengali issue is a national cause and we need to be united in establishing the truth,"" his post said. Rohingya militants did attack police posts in northern Rakhine on 25 August, killing 12 security personnel. But Rohingya who have fled Myanmar since then say the military responded with a brutal campaign, burning villages and attacking civilians in a bid to drive them out. Bangladesh plans to restrict the movement of Rohingya who have fled Myanmar The army's defence comes amid condemnation of the violence from across the world. Aung San Suu Kyi is a Nobel Peace laureate who spent years under house arrest in junta-run Myanmar (Burma) but has played a key political role since her party won democratic polls in 2015. She is now facing growing criticism over the Rohingya issue. On Sunday, UN chief Antonio Guterres urged her to stop the offensive in her address to the nation on Tuesday, warning that if she failed to so, ""I don't see how this can be reversed in the future"". Speaking to the BBC's HARDtalk programme, the secretary general said it was clear that Myanmar's military ""still have the upper hand"" in the country. This video can not be played Antonio Guterres told the BBC he feared an 'absolutely horrible' tragedy Aung San Suu Kyi will not be attending the UN General Assembly in New York, and has claimed that the crisis is being distorted by a""huge iceberg of misinformation"". She said tensions were being fanned by fake news promoting the interests of terrorists. Why is aid slow to arrive? Seeing through the official story Bangladesh recently announced it was limiting the movementof more than 400,000 Rohingyawho have fled from Myanmar. Bangladesh also announced plans to build shelters for up to 400,000 people near the city of Cox's Bazar.

The Rohingya, a stateless minority, have long experienced persecution in Myanmar, which says they are illegal immigrants.
