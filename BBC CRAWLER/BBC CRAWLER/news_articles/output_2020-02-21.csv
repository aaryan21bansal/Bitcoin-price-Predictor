Flight for virus-hit cruise Britons put back,"British passengers have begun to leave the cruise ship and were seen travelling by coaches An evacuation flight for Britons trapped on a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan has been delayed by a day, the British embassy has said. The flight is ""logistically complicated"" and will now leave on Saturday, the embassy says. It is thought about 35 UK nationals - who have been quarantined on the liner for 16 days - will be on the flight. The group are expected to land in Wiltshire before being quarantined at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral. A number of Britons began to leave the Diamond Princess around 01:30 local time (16:30 GMT) and were seen travelling away in coaches. The Britons on the evacuation flight will have passed screening tests for the virus. The Diamond Princess was carrying 78 Britons when it was quarantined in Yokohama. Some have already been evacuated over the last week on flights to Hong Kong, organised by the authorities there, a government source has told the BBC. Others are being treated for the virus in health facilities in Japan. It is also understood that some British nationals are members of the ship's crew who could be staying on board the ship. Â More than 620 people on board the Diamond Princess tested positive for the virus More than 620 people on board the cruise ship tested positive for the virus, the largest cluster of cases outside China. Two Japanese passengers - both in their 80s and with underlying health conditions - were confirmed to have died after contracting the virus on board the ship. The cruise liner was carrying 3,700 people, including 78 Britons, when it was quarantined in Yokohama on 5 February, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to have the virus.

Coronavirus: What you need to know At least four UK nationals also contracted the virus on board, but those flying home have tested negative. On Wednesday, when the two-week quarantine period on the liner expired, officials allowed passengers who had tested negative for the virus to disembark. BBC correspondent Laura Bicker says she saw one little girl ""so filled with glee as she pulled her suitcase behind her"". ""Remember they've been stuck in their cabins for 14 days, only allowed out for a couple of minutes each day. It has been both frustrating and anxious-ridden for many of them."" While citizens of other countries disembarked, the Foreign Office advised all UK nationals to stay onboard until it organised an evacuation flight for them, warning there could be administrative problems if they left the ship. Their flight home is expected to land at Boscombe Down, a Ministry of Defence base in Wiltshire. They will then spend 14 days in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital, where two groups of people travelling from China have previously stayed. ""There is no risk to the public, and the hospital will continue to run as normal,"" the Department of Health said. One of the passengers from the ship catching a taxi after being allowed to leave One of the British passengers, Alan Sandford, said he and his wife Vanessa were both ""very happy"" about the prospect of returning home to Nottinghamshire after being found not to have contracted the virus. He told BBC Breakfast the last few weeks had been ""a major inconvenience"" but that other passengers had faced ""horrific"" circumstances such as getting ill, being separated from their partners or being trapped inside cabins without windows. Alan Sandford says he and his wife have their fingers crossed they will be on the evacuation flight to the UK Another British passenger, Elaine Spencer, from Sittingbourne, in Kent, said the wait for repatriation had been ""frustrating"", and criticised the Foreign Office's ""slow"" response. ""My daughter telephoned them many weeks ago asking to find out if they had anything in place, and we were told it was going to be left in the hands of the Japanese health ministry,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She said she is ""relieved"" to be returning to her family in the UK, after living in a ""bubble"" on the ship with limited access to news. But two of the British passengers who will not be returning on the flight are David and Sally Abel. Mr Abel, who earlier this week revealed he and his wife had tested positive for the virus, posted a picture of himself in a hospital bed in Japan after they were removed from the cruise ship. David Abel and his wife Sally, from Northamptonshire, are being treated in a hospital in Japan In a Facebook post, Mr Abel said he and his wife were being treated ""in the best place"". ""Outside the hospital I came over a bit weird and nearly passed out. Every pore on my body opened and I was wheelchaired to our room. ""Full health inspection and now we know what's going on. We both contracted a cold (unaware of) and it has not yet turned into pneumonia. (we do have coronavirus). ""Tomorrow the big tests commence. chest x-rays, ECG, chest scan, urine + more. ""We are both in the best place! They do know what they are doing and our two nurses are gorgeous. Sally likes the Dr too."" Mr Abel said that following treatment, the couple will need three rounds of all-clears on coronavirus tests. British honeymooner Alan Steele, who was diagnosed with coronavirus on the cruise ship, announced on Facebook that he had left hospital and was in a hotel in Yokohama - ahead of his return to the UK. Mr Steele wrote: ""Informed we will have to do another 2weeks quarantine back in blighty although japan has set me free as all ok."" Japanhas faced criticismover its handling of the outbreak, with one health expert calling the situation onboard ""completely chaotic"". The Foreign Office is advising affected British nationals affected to call the British embassy in Tokyo on +81 3 5211 1100. Meanwhile, any British passengers on board a cruise ship docked in Cambodia amid fears of an outbreak will not be treated as being at high risk of coronavirus, Public Health England (PHE) has said. The MS Westerdam made shore in Sihanoukville on 13 February, after being rejected by five countries because one of its former passengers was found to be carrying the virus. The ship was originally carrying 2,257 people - including a reported 100 Britons - with the majority having already disembarked  - leaving 255 passengers and 747 crew members on board. PHE said any of the ship's passengers flying back to the UK will be asked to self-isolate when they return. The majority of passengers have disembarked the MS Westerdam Cambodia, pictured here at Preah Sihanouk port last week Meanwhile, NHS England has said it is piloting home-testing for coronavirus, where NHS staff, including nurses and paramedics, visit people in their own homes. The pilot, which is aimed at limiting the spread of infection, is being offered in London. This will be expanded to other areas outside of the capital in the coming weeks. Anyone who is concerned they have signs and symptoms of the virus are advised to call NHS 111. In China, Covid-19 - the illness brought on by the coronavirus - has now claimed 2,004 lives, according to the latest Chinese data released on Wednesday. There have been 74,185 confirmed infections recorded in mainland China and about 700 cases in other countries. In the UK,a total of 5,885 people have been tested for the virus,external, as of Friday 14:00 GMT. Nine people have tested positive.

Flight for virus-hit cruise Britons takes off,"The coaches with the evacuees arrived at the hospital in a convoy of vehicles British nationals evacuated from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan have arrived at a hospital where they will spend the next two weeks in quarantine. Coaches carrying 30 British and two Irish citizens arrived at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral on Saturday evening. The group had travelled from an airbase in Wiltshire after leaving Tokyo on a flight late on Friday night. They have so far tested negative for the virus. As the coaches arrived at the hospital just before 18:00, one passenger was pictured making a heart sign with her hands while another gave an OK signal through the coach windows. Arrowe Park Hospital was previously used to quarantine 83 British nationals who were flown back to the UK from Wuhan. The chief executive of Wirral Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, Janelle Holmes, said Arrowe Park was using that experience as a ""blueprint"" for treating the new group. Speaking ahead of the group's arrival, she said: ""The group of people is slightly different. ""Obviously, they have come from a cruise ship rather than from their own homes over in China, but we are working exactly the same as we did before, with the healthcare professionals and Public Health England to make sure they are safe, well managed and comfortable while they are with us."" The plane landed at Boscombe Down, a MoD base in Wiltshire The evacuation flight took off from Tokyo's Haneda Airport late on Friday evening (GMT) and landed at Boscombe Down, a Ministry of Defence base in Wiltshire, about 11:30 GMT on Saturday. In a statement issued after the plane landed, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Foreign Office had ""worked hard"" to get the passengers ""back to the UK securely"". ""Our number one priority has consistently been the health and safety of UK nationals,"" he added. The flighthad previously been delayedafter the British embassy said it was ""logistically complicated"". The plane set off from Haneda Airport, Tokyo, late on Friday evening (GMT) Meanwhile, it has emerged the NHS is working on plans to test people for coronavirus in their own homes, if the outbreak begins to spread in the UK. A pilot scheme has already been launched in London, where tests are being carried out by NHS nurses and paramedics. The health service is planning to expand the scheme to other areas outside of the capital in the coming weeks. Professor Keith Willett, the NHS strategic incident director for coronavirus, said the aim was to avoid the risk of people spreading the infection by going to their GP or A&E. Elsewhere, Italy has reported its second death from the virus - a woman living in the northern region of Lombardy - a day after a 78-year-old man died. Allow Twitter content?

Appearing alongside wife Roberta, Steve Abel said in a YouTube video late on Friday evening that his father's condition was ""very serious"", while his mother has a more mild form of pneumonia. He also said his ""really distressed"" parents - who had been on the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary - called him to say they were being moved to a different hospital.

This video can not be played Steve Abel told BBC Breakfast his father told him ""we can't take any more of this, it's like a prison"" The Foreign Office said the welfare of all British nationals is of the highest priority to the UK government. They added they are working with the Japanese authorities to ensure those British nationals who are remaining in Japan for health reasons get the best possible care.

Harry and Meghan to end use of 'SussexRoyal' brand,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are to stop using their ""SussexRoyal"" brand from spring 2020. The couple had been in discussions with aides and senior royals about using the name following their decision this year tostep back from royal duties. But a spokesperson for the couple said it was agreed the word ""royal"" could not be used due to government rules. Applications to trademark the SussexRoyal brand have also been withdrawn. The couple's popular Instagram account uses the name SussexRoyal, as does their website. How might Harry and Meghan make money? Harry arrives in Canada ahead of new chapter Wallis Simpson's hard lessons for Harry and Meghan A spokesperson for the Sussexes said they were ""focused"" on plans to establish their new organisation in the spring. But they had agreed not to name it the Sussex Royal Foundation. Royal author Robert Hardman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the decision on the brand name was a ""setback"" for the couple. ""They've spent a great deal of money registering the trademarks,"" he said. However, branding expert Rita Clifton told the programme the inability to use SussexRoyal would be an ""inconvenience"" rather than an insurmountable problem. She said any brand ""is not just a name and a logo but also what you do"". This was not what Harry and Meghan thought it would be. Their bombshell statement in early January was full of talk about ""a progressive new role"" in the Royal Family, about  ""collaboration"" with other members of the family, about ""continuing to support Her Majesty the Queen"". They thought a hybrid role, half-in, half-out, could be possible - some royal duties, some Commonwealth duties, on their terms, with private lives attached. Instead, there is now nothing royal about them other than their names, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and their private connections with their relatives. There will be no public royal role, no military commands, no royal tours and now not even use of the word ""royal"". The loss of ""SussexRoyal"" will be a blow. It is their public face, their brand, their hugely popular social media name. But ""royal"" could not survive alongside a private existence. The couple have had to bow to the logic of their desire for a new and independent life - they will be royal no more. A spokeswoman for the Sussexes said: ""While the duke and duchess are focused on plans to establish a new non-profit organisation, given the specific UK government rules surrounding use of the word royal, it has been therefore agreed that their non-profit organisation, when it is announced this spring, will not be named Sussex Royal Foundation. ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use 'SussexRoyal' in any territory post-spring 2020."" The spokeswoman said trademark applications that were filed as protective measures ""acting on advice from and following the same model for the Royal Foundation"" have been removed. In a statement on their website, the couple said: ""While there is not any jurisdiction by the monarchy or Cabinet Office over the use of the word 'Royal' overseas, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use 'Sussex Royal' or any iteration of the word 'Royal' in any territory (either within the UK or otherwise) when the transition occurs spring 2020."" It was announced this week that the couplewill formally step down as senior royals from 31 March. They will no longer carry out duties on behalf of the Queen but arrangements will be reviewed after 12 months. A spokesperson for the couple said they intended to split their time between the UK and North America, and would be in the UK ""regularly"". They will attend six events in the UK in February and March, including the Commonwealth Day Service on 9 March. The couple and their son Archie spent time in Canada over Christmas Harry is also expected to attend the London Marathon in April in his capacity as patron, while the couple will also attend the Invictus Games in the Netherlands in May. The couple have been in Canada with their son Archie for much of this year, after briefly returning to the UK in January following an extended six-week Christmas break on Vancouver Island. Before announcing their plans to step back from royal duties in January, they had spoken abouthow they had struggled under the media spotlight.

Bloomberg to release female staff from gag orders,"Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg has bowed to pressure to release former female employees from non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). He said his company was prepared to void three NDAs ""with women to address complaints about comments they said I had made"". His Democratic White House rivals have been pounding away at him on the issue. Critics of NDAs argue these legal gag orders on employees serve to cover up workplace misconduct. In a campaign statement on Friday, he said his media company Bloomberg LP had trawled through its records over the past three decades or so and identified three NDAs. ""If any of them want to be released from their NDA so that they can talk about those allegations, they should contact the company and they'll be given a release,"" he said. This video can not be played Democratic rivals attack Bloomberg in TV debate ""I've done a lot of reflecting on this issue over the past few days and I've decided that for as long as I'm running the company, we won't offer confidentiality agreements to resolve claims of sexual harassment or misconduct going forward."" He added: ""I recognize that NDAs, particularly when they are used in the context of sexual harassment and sexual assault, promote a culture of silence in the workplace and contribute to a culture of women not feeling safe or supported."" Meet the voters behind Bloomberg's surge The Democratic 2020 race - in five charts Who is Michael Bloomberg? Mr Bloomberg, 78, is one of eight contenders remaining in the race to become the Democratic party's presidential candidate who will take on President Donald Trump, a Republican, in November's election. The former New York City mayor, who is the world's ninth richest man, has reportedly splurged $500m (Â£385m) of his own money on campaigning since jumping into the race last November. During a live TV debate on Wednesday in Las Vegas, one contender, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, criticised Mr Bloomberg as ""a billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians'"". She also challenged him to release female employees from the NDAs, but he declined. Another rival, former US Vice-President Joe Biden, attacked Mr Bloomberg, too. The Democratic 2020 race - in five charts ""All the mayor has to do is say, 'you are released from the nondisclosure agreements,'"" Mr Biden said. Stepping up her attack a day later, Ms Warren, a law professor, said she had even drafted a contract for Mr Bloomberg to sign to release women from the NDAs. ""I used to teach contract law, and I thought I would make this easy,"" she told a CNN town hall event on Thursday in Las Vegas. A 1990 booklet of quotes attributed to the billionaire includes sexist remarks, such as ""if women wanted to be appreciated for their brains, they'd go to the library instead of [luxury department store] Bloomingdale's"". He also reportedly told a pregnant employee she should ""kill it"", which he has denied under oath. In a recently leaked video clip, Mr Bloomberg appears to justify his controversial stop-and-frisk policy when he was New York mayor by saying ""you want to put those cops where the crime is, which mean in minority neighbourhoods"", before adding that 95% of murderers and murder victims are male minorities. He has apologised. During a 2016 talk, the former mayor suggested that farming and factory work required less ""grey matter"" than information technology jobs. ""I could teach anybody, even the people in this room, no offence intended, to be a farmer,"" Mr Bloomberg said. Last year, Mr Bloomberg mocked Democratic candidates for championing transgender issues. ""If your conversation during a presidential election is about some guy wearing a dress and whether he, she, or it can go to the locker room with their daughter, that's not a winning formula for most people,"" he said. NDAs started out as legal contracts to ensure employees did not leak trade secrets. But the hush deals have come under intense scrutiny during the #MeToo movement against sexual assault as some companies have used NDAs in harassment settlements with female employees. The nondisclosure provision prohibits signatories from revealing details, such as allegations of misconduct, or else they could face legal consequences. Critics say NDAs silence victims, protect wrongdoers and shield employers from unfavourable publicity. But it is not just companies that have used these contracts. A porn star, Stormy Daniels, was paid $130,000 to sign an NDA to stop her talking about an alleged 2006 fling with US President Donald Trump, which he denied.

Former Love Island host Flack, 40, wasfound dead at her homein London on Saturday after taking her own life. Cipriani said he was speaking out about his own mental health issues in the hope her ""life will not go in vain"". During the18-minute clip on Instagram,external, the 32-year-old admits he tried to buy a gun to end his life 10 years ago. ""I couldn't do it because I had some fight in me,"" a tearful Cipriani said. The England international said he had been speaking to Flack over the past ""three or four months"" and she had been dealing with negative media attention ""for 20 years"". Flack was due to stand trial next month after being charged with assaulting her partner in December. ""Embarrassment and shame is not something that should make you do this,"" said Cipriani. ""I've worried my whole life what people say about me. I don't care any more. I know who I am."" Caroline Flack had presented Love Island, as well as co-hosting The X Factor and won Strictly Come Dancing in 2014 Cipriani, who played in Gloucester's Premiership defeat by Exeter last Friday, said he had shared ""everything"" with the television presenter.

Following the news of Flack's death, Cipriani said he had missed a phone call from her. ""I have to see the meaning in why she decided to call me in her last moments, when she was with her two best friends,"" he said in Friday's video. ""How much love and trust did she have for me because we had been vulnerable and shared together? She felt it was a safe space so I thank her for that because I felt safe with her."" He had also previously posted on Twitter his criticism of sections of the media - accusing them of lying, and saying Flack - who he dated last year - had been ""bullied"". In his latest post, he said: ""We can't just blame the media, we can't blame ourselves, but we can change what's happening."" He said Flack's death meant he could ""see clearly now"" and was ""strong enough to share my moments of vulnerability"". ""I am just asking that we are kind and if you have vulnerable moments, and you have people you care about and close to you,  you should share it with them,"" he added. At the end of the video, Cipriani thanks people for ""being kind"" to Flack's family and friends. ""Continue being kind,"" he said.

There will be no face off but the best bit is that these two are separated by those line dividers you see in banks. You know the ones you form an orderly queue within. Fury points a gesture in Wilderâs direction. Letâs just say it wasnât a nice one. Tyson Fury weighs in at 273lbs. Deontay Wilder, booed when he hit the stage, is tensing his muscles on the scales and hits 231lbs. Here we go. Fury on his way. Huge roars and camera lights everywhere... Wilder v Fury Mike CostelloBBC Sport boxing correspondent in Las Vegas I have been coming here 25 years and I have never seen this kind of investment into the building of hype of a pay-per-view fight. I think Deontay Wilder has learned from the first fight and will be better at closing the space this time. I don't know when he will catch up with Fury but I think he will. Wilder v Fury Luke ReddyBBC Sport in Las Vegas Iâm in Las Vegas with BBC Sportâs Alex Gulrajani and heâs captured a big fight week learning. Basically, you spend the day jumping out of your skin time and again when Wilder shouts this... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Wilder v Fury Luke ReddyBBC Sport in Las Vegas The undercard fighters have nearly been weighed in. The fighters who need to be under a set limit are done. I can get my chocolate out now and not fear one of the hungry types losing their box with me. Wilder v Fury Luke ReddyBBC Sport in Las Vegas Thereâs a gentle murmur in the arena. I actually like this. Donât go too big too early. When the big dudes hit the stage it should get insanely lively. A recap... Fury weighed in 254lbs for his last fight. His own father said it was way too light. Expect him to be bigger. Heâs had a chef living with him for the first time. Wilder was 212lb when he fought Fury last time. That was too light for him too really, so expect a bit more bulk. Those are the kind of numbers we are looking at. Wilder v Fury Luke ReddyBBC Sport in Las Vegas Allow Twitter content?

Former world champion Adrien Broner rolled in and his shining gold medal acted like a magnet for media. He was then grabbed by another former world champion Timothy Bradley, who demanded Broner start chasing bigger fights. Broner told me he knows this is a huge event purely because of the ticket prices heâs been quoted. You can go online and get one of the few left for around Â£350 and they range up to Â£10,000 for a resale ticket.

It has been truly remarkable. âHey Tyson, can I get a shout out for your fans in Australia.â âHey Deontay, what message you got for your fans in Sweden.â And so it goes on. Once this weigh in is done theyâll be relieved to know the talking stops.

Wilder v Fury Luke ReddyBBC Sport in Las Vegas Iâm currently stood next to Terence Crawford. To look at him you wouldnât think he was one of the finest pound-for-pound boxers on the planet. I wonât be telling him that of course. Wilder v Fury David Haye:I've played it over in my head so many different times. My heart and gut just sway to Wilder's punch power. I think that knockout shot will land on Fury. Carl Froch:I'd say Fury on points. I do not like the talk of him knocking Wilder out. He would have to stand in range and to do that you can get clipped on the chin. If you do with Wilder it's lights out. I think Fury's talk of taking Wilder on at his own game is a smokescreen. Sugar Ray Leonard:I know that Fury has excellent boxing abilities and a tremendous chin from the way that he got up from the two knockdowns in their previous fight. In the end, I think that Wilder is always in shape and that he will use his speed and power to get the job done. Wilder v Fury Luke ReddyBBC Sport in Las Vegas This section of seating in front of the stage is packed with only media and former fighters. Behind them sits row after row of cameras and on either side you have fans decked in colours. Things have hit a lull. We know Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury are back stage, itâs just a case of waiting. Iâd say 15 minutes tops. Wilder v Fury Luke ReddyBBC Sport in Las Vegas Iâve kept this one for a scrapbook. Weâve been lucky enough to interview promoter Bob Arum time and again but the 88 year old allows us into his office this week. He showed me his Louis Vuitton punchbag, the matching gloves and of course the pictures that fill wall after wall of a certain Muhammad Ali. This picture has the message: âTo Muhammad, the one who made it possible. All my love, Bob.â Arum, who is now with Tyson Fury, promoted close to 30 Ali fights. Now thatâs history. Wilder v Fury Luke ReddyBBC Sport in Las Vegas Kell Brook in the house. Joe Joyce in the house. Evander Holyfield in the house. Lennox Lewis in the house. Bob Arum on stage, 88 years of age, bobbing his head to R&B. Wilder v Fury Manny Pacquiao:Never bet against a puncher, particularly one like Wilder. I look at him like I do at a Mike Tyson, another puncher. I see Wilder winning this rematch by 10th-round knockout. Anthony Joshua told Pep Talk UK:I hope Fury wins. I think the man that nearly did it the first time won't get it wrong the second time. He came so close, to the point of a draw, so I think Fury will come back and win. Larry Holmes:Wilder will knock out Fury in the seventh or eighth round if he does what I know that he can do, which is stay on the outside, use his jab and throw that right hand over the jab. Wilder v Fury Luke ReddyBBC Sport in Las Vegas This gent has brought a glove and had it signed by countless fighters already. âYou run into everyone,â he says. Some Brits tell me they were with Lennox Lewis last night. I hope it wasnât a tribute act version. Wilder v Fury Steve BunceBBC Radio 5 Live boxing pundit in Las Vegas Two unbeaten men, elite versus elite. Let's not lose the fact we are seeing something we don't often see. This is a monster. I think we will see a bit more boxing from Deontay Wilder and a far more aggressive Tyson Fury. I don't think either of those changes will last. I believe Fury survives rocky moments and wins on points. And yes, it will be controversial."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Prince Charles meets Storm Dennis flood victims,"This video can not be played About 200 people gathered in the centre of Pontypridd to see Prince Charles The Prince of Wales has met flood victims and their rescuers during a visit to south Wales. Storm Dennishit more than 1,000 homesand businesses in Rhondda Cynon Taff alone after heavy rain last week. Damage to council infrastructure alone across this region could cost up to Â£30m, leader Andrew Morgan said. More warnings of heavy rain have been issued for some areas of England and Wales still cleaning up after the last floods. Met Officeyellow weather warnings,externalfor heavy and persistent rain - meaning further flooding could occur - are in place for Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday across parts of the UK. Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan (right) said the repair bill is already up to Â£30m The various warnings affect already flooded areas, including south and mid Wales, parts of the north of England and the Midlands. Natural Resources Wales said the rainfall would likely lead to flood alerts and flood warnings. Meanwhile, the Environment Agency has warned the deluges are set to continue into next week. A spokesman said ""ongoing river flooding remains probable for the River Severn on Monday and Tuesday"". Storm Dennis brings flooding to Wales More than a month's worth of rain fell in 48 hours on Saturday and Sunday when Storm Dennis hit Wales, and further heavy rain fell on Thursday. Prince Charles was in Pontypridd to meet residents and businesses affected by recent floods In Pontypridd, Charles visited business owner Emma Jamal who said people's lives had been ""turned upside down"" and the devastation needed to be seen by people such as the Prince. Her boutique store Kookoo Madame was badly damaged with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of jewellery, clothes and cosmetics, ruined after about 4ft (1.21m) of floodwater filled the premises. ""It had taken 12 years to get the business to where it was, it's hard to know where to start,"" she said. ""It's a bit surreal to have his royal highness in our tiny little business in Pontypridd. ""But he was very down to earth and his visit is good for the town, to highlight the devastation and hopefully get more help."" Ms Jamal said many independent businesses in the town were now finding out their insurance policies did not cover them for flooding, and the town needed to be safeguarded to stop it being flooded again. ""Things need to change, no-one can get insurance now, so what do we do next year, what do we do when it happens again?"" Emma Jamal said cabinets filled with charms and shelves of bath bombs were among the stock ruined by the flood water Charles also visited Prince's cafe where the bakery in the basement was badly damaged in the flood. Bragdy Twt Lol brewery, also known as the Trefforest Brewery, managed to reopen after volunteers spent days helping with the clean-up after flood water destroyed beer bottles, hops, malt and yeast. Owner Phil Thomas said while they had stock for the Six Nations and weeks ahead, it was not yet clear when they would be able to start brewing again. ""We initially thought it was about Â£10,000 of damage, but we are probably now looking at up to Â£30,000,"" he said. This video can not be played Heavy rain caused ""multiple"" floods and landslides, according to South Wales Police Rhondda Cynon Taf council said seven bridges have been seriously damaged and some could be condemned after foundations were undermined. Mr Morgan added: ""I wouldn't be surprised if the cost rises even higher [than Â£30m]. We're in the tens of millions of pounds now."" Meanwhile contractors have been brought in to stabilise a former coal tip in the Rhondda where a landslide occurred during the heavy rain. Dramatic footage of the landslide atTylorstown, emerged on social media, and the former tip has been under 24 hour surveillance ever since. Engineers were also looking to make land safe near Big Pit National Coal Museum in Blaenavon following a landslide above the site, Torfaen council said. Many of businesses on Mill Street have been cleaning up following the flooding Meanwhile volunteers say they have been overwhelmed by support, with donations of food, clothing, furniture and cleaning products to help. The Manic Street Preachers have given Â£3,000 towards those dealing with the fallout in Pontypridd, where a fundraising page has raised more than Â£20,000. Other donations to the page, set up by Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones, are listed as being from Line Of Duty star Vicky McClure and her partner Jonny Owen, and another under the name of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock. A day after it was set up another fundraiser,arranged by film star Michael Sheen, has raised more than Â£30,000. A major clean up operation has been carried out at Welsh language club Clwb y Bont Charles also visited the Aston Martin factory in St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan, where the company launched its first Wales-made car in November. He also spent time at the Marie Curie Hospice in Penarth and officially opened a train-making factory in Newport. And he visited Cardiff Airport's British Airways maintenance centre to mark the company's 100th anniversary. The Prince added Pontypridd to the previously-planned itinerary following the flooding.

"Fundraiser for boy in bullying video hits $300,000","The video of Quaden crying has been viewed millions of times online Some A$452,000 ($300,000; Â£230,000) has been raised as part of a campaign to send a nine-year-old Australian boy to Disneyland after a video of his deep distress over being bullied went viral. Yarraka Bayles posted the clip of her son, Quaden, crying after he was targeted at school for his dwarfism. ""This is what bullying does,"" she says in the video, in which her son also says he wants to end his life. Now a GoFundMe page has raised 30 times more than its $10,000 target. The page was set up by US comedian Brad Williams after the video went viral to raise money to send Quaden to Disneyland. The National Rugby League's Indigenous All Stars team have also invited Quaden to lead out the side for their match against the Maori All Stars on Saturday. Celebrities including actor Hugh Jackman and basketball player Enes Kanter have also spoken out, while parents in other countries have shared video messages from their children. Jackman told Quaden ""you are stronger than you know, mate"" and called on everyone to ""be kind"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking at a press conference, Ms Bayles said she hoped her son's experience was raising awareness over the effects of bullying. ""We are losing way too many people because of bullying, because of discrimination, because of racism. There's so many factors of bullying,"" she said. ""It's every parent's worst nightmare losing their babies and for me that's my reality every day,"" she said, adding that suicide attempts ""are very real"". ""On top of that, being an Aboriginal boy with a disability, people don't understand that's a double-edged sword. There's racism and then there's discrimination because of the disability."" In the confronting six-minute video, posted on Tuesday, Quaden's mother describes the relentless bullying experienced by her son every day. The family, who are Aboriginal Australian, live in Queensland. ""I've just picked my son up from school, witnessed a bullying episode, rang the principal, and I want people to know - parents, educators, teachers - this is the effect that bullying has,"" Ms Bayle says as her son sobs. ""Every single... day, something happens. Another episode, another bullying, another taunt, another name-calling. ""Can you please educate your children, your families, your friends?"" Gillian Martin, chairwoman of the UK charity Restricted Growth Association (RGA), says there is a long way to go in changing perceptions of dwarfism. ""This story, I'm delighted it's got outâ¦ but there is a much deeper issue here surrounding the specific bullying and prejudice around dwarfism because we, as a society, culturally and globally, are conditioned to find dwarfism amusing,"" she told the BBC's OS programme. ""We are conditioned toâ¦ objectify that person as inhuman, as a person of comedy."" Gillian Martin, seen here with her 20-year-old daughter Quinn, says society is conditioned to find dwarfism amusing US-based motivational speaker Becky Curran Kekula, who also lives with dwarfism, believes it is one of the last conditions people think is acceptable to laugh at and stare. ""A lot has to do with low numbers, since there are only 30,000 little people in the United States alone,"" she says. ""People have not seen a little person in their everyday life, so a lot of portrayals in the media affect how we're treated in society."" Warwick Davis called the video ""deeply upsetting"" Actor Warwick Davis, who co-founded Little People UK, said the video of Quaden was ""deeply upsetting to watch"". ""It's really sad to think that this sort of thing goes on in today's world. We like to think of ourselves as being a caring, passionate species when, in fact, at the heart of it, we're really not sometimes,"" he told the BBC. ""I think parents have a role to play here. Education starts at home and as parents we should all be taking responsibility for our children and for their attitudes in the world,"" he said.

Controversial golf course project is blocked,"Highland councillors approved the plan for a golf course at Coul Links in 2018 A controversial plan to build an 18-hole championship golf course in the Highlands has been refused planning permission by the Scottish government. About 32 acres of the planned course was proposed for dunes at Coul Links at Embo, near Dornoch. Highland councillors gave the project the go-ahead last June, before Scottish ministers called in the planning application for further scrutiny. Following a public inquiry, the government has refused permission. In their decision, Scottish ministers said the plan would have supported economic growth and rural development. But they agreed with government-appointed planning officials' findings that the golf course would have ""significant"" effects on rare plantlife, wintering and breeding birds and the the dunes themselves. The government said the ""likely detriment to natural heritage is not outweighed by the socio-economic benefits of the proposal"". Planning Minister Kevin Stewart said: ""This proposal does not comply with the relevant provisions of the Highland Wide Local Development Plan, and runs contrary to Scottish Planning Policy's emphasis on protecting natural heritage sites and world class environmental assets. ""The Scottish government has considered the reporter's findings carefully and agree with the recommendation that planning permission should be refused."" The plan also included a clubhouse and the renovation of existing buildings to form a maintenance facility, along with a pro shop, caddy hut, workshop, administration building and information booth. The developers behind the project argued that the golf course would improve and protect the area of land involved, and bring much-needed jobs to the area. The Scottish government said the potential harm to natural heritage out-weighed the socio-economic benefits A group of conservation charities opposed to the project, including RSPB Scotland, Butterfly Conservation Scotland and the Scottish Wildlife Trust. Anne McCall, director at RSPB Scotland, said: ""I am incredibly grateful to everyone who stood up against this application over the past few years - it's been a huge partnership effort and inspiring to see how many people raised their voice in support of this amazing place."" The Scottish Wildlife Trust said ""difficult decisions"" were necessary to address the ""urgent crisis facing nature"". Ramblers Scotland has also welcomed the government's decision. Director Brendan Paddy said: ""The decision sends out a clear signal that Scotland's finest landscapes, habitats and beauty spots aren't simply up for sale to the highest bidder.""

The North Korean prisoner who escaped with her guard," By Hyung Eun Kim An illustration of the guard and prisoner sneaking out of Onsong Detention Centre, North Korea An illustration of the guard and prisoner sneaking out of Onsong Detention Centre, North Korea Jeon had woken Kim up at midnight and taken her through the route he had planned. He had packed two backpacks the night before, containing food and spare clothes, plus a knife and poison. He wasn’t taking any chances, and was also taking a gun. Kim tried to persuade him to leave it behind but Jeon was adamant. Surviving capture wasn’t an option. A show trial in North Korea and execution would almost certainly be the punishment - particularly since the guard was absconding with a prisoner. “I knew I had only that night. If I didn’t make it that night I would be captured and killed,” says Jeon Gwang-jin, 26. Jeon Gwang-jin “If they stopped me, I was going to shoot them and run. If I couldn’t run, I was going to shoot myself.” If that didn’t work he was going to stab himself with the knife and take the poison. “Once I was prepared to die, nothing scared me,” says Jeon. Together they jumped from a window and dashed across the detention centre’s exercise yard. Ahead of them lay a high fence that they would have to scale, and the fear that the guards’ dogs, which they could hear barking, would give them away. And even if no one came, if they managed to scale the fence unseen and unheard, they would need to get past the border guards patrolling the Tumen river that separated them from freedom. But it was worth the risk. Kim’s move from the centre to a prison camp was imminent. They both knew the appalling conditions there meant she may never make it out alive.  It was an unlikely friendship - the prison guard and the prisoner. They had met just two months earlier - in May 2019. Jeon was one of several guards at Onsong Detention Centre in the far north of North Korea. He and his colleagues kept Kim and a few dozen other inmates under surveillance 24 hours a day whilst they awaited trial. Kim caught his eye with her refined clothing and demeanour. He knew she was there because of her role in helping their fellow countrymen who had already fled a life of desperation. Kim was what was known as a broker. She helped keep channels open between those who had fled and families left behind. This could mean facilitating money transfers or phone calls from the defectors. And it was lucrative work for the average North Korean. Kim was paid about 30% of the cash as commission, and an average money transfer is about 2.8m won [£1,798], research suggests. On the face of it, Kim and Jeon couldn’t have been more different. While she made her money illicitly, learning as she did about the world outside North Korea’s strict communist regime, Jeon had spent the past 10 years in the military as a conscripted soldier. He was steeped in the communist ideology of the country's dictatorship. What they didn’t realise was how much they had in common. Both were deeply frustrated by their lives and felt they had now run out of road. For Kim, the turning point was her jail sentence. This wasn’t her first prison term, and she knew that as a second-time offender she would be more harshly treated this time around. If she did make it out of prison alive, then returning to a life of brokering - and potential arrest again - would have been an extremely risky thing to do. Kim’s first arrest was for a particularly dangerous type of brokering - helping North Koreans escape over the border into China - the very route that she and Jeon would go on to take themselves. “You can never do this line of work without connections in the military,” she says. She would bribe them to look the other way, and was successful for six years, earning good money in the process - US$1,433-2,149 for each person she helped leave. That meant getting just one person across wasthe equivalent of a year’s income for the average North Korean. But eventually the very contacts in the military who had paved the way were the ones who betrayed her. She was sentenced to five years in prison. When she left she had intended to give up brokering. It was just too risky. And then she made a discovery that would force her to think again. Her husband had remarried while she was in jail, taking their two daughters with him. She needed to find a new way to survive. She decided that even if she did not dare help people escape any more, she could still use her contacts to do a different - slightly less risky - type of brokering. She would facilitate transfers of money from defectors in South Korea, and host illegal phone calls from them. North Korean mobiles are blocked from making or receiving international calls, so Kim would charge a fee for receiving calls on her smuggled Chinese phone. But she was eventually caught out again. As she took a boy from her village into the mountains to take a call from his mother, who had defected to South Korea, they were followed by the secret police. “I told them I would pay as much as they would want me to and I begged and begged. But [the official] said because the son already knew everything they could not hide my crime and cover for me.” In North Korea, activities which involve or suggest a relationship with an “enemy state” - South Korea, Japan or the US - can earn a North Korean a stiffer sentence than killing someone does. Kim realised that life as she knew it was over. When she first met Jeon she was still awaiting trial, but she knew that as a second-time offender she had a tough time ahead of her. Jeon, although not fearing for his life, was also feeling deeply frustrated. He had begun his mandatory military service - routine tasks such as guarding a statue of North Korea’s founder and growing grass for livestock - intending to eventually become a police officer, a childhood dream. But his father had now broken the truth to him about his future. “My father sat me down one day and told me that realistically speaking a person of my background would never be able to make it [into that position],” he says. Jeon’s parents, like their parents before them, are farmers. “You need money to advance in North Korea… It’s getting worse and worse... Even the test you take to graduate from university, it’s now taken for granted that you bribe professors for good results,” says Jeon. Farming families have been hit by a poor harvest recently And even for those who do make it to a top college, or graduate with the highest honours, a bright future is not guaranteed unless that person has money. “I know someone who graduated from the [prestigious] Kim Il-sung University as a top graduate, and yet has ended up selling fake meat in the market,” he says. For much of the population, simply surviving is a struggle. Living conditions may be better than they were in the early years of Jeon’s life, when the country was ravaged by a deadly four-year famine dubbed “The Arduous March”, butthey are still extremely tough. So having been told his ambition to become a policeman was impossible, Jeon had started thinking of another way to change his life. It was still just the seeds of an idea when he met Kim, but as they talked, the idea took hold. Theirs was an unusual relationship, and certainly not typical for a prisoner and a guard. Inmates are not even allowed to look directly at the guards, Jeon says. They are “like the sky and the Earth”. But he would beckon her over for whispered conversations through the iron bars of her cell door. “There is a camera, but when the electricity is out often you can’t see the footage and sometimes they move the camera a bit. “Inmates all know who’s close to whom, but the guards hold the power in prison.” He says he took extra care of her. “I felt we connected,” he says. And then, about two months after they first met, their friendship took on an extra significance. Kim was sent for trial and sentenced to four years, three months, in the feared Chongori prison camp. She knew that she may never make it out of Chongori alive. Interviews with former detainees there have shed light onthe rampant abuse in North Korean prisons. “I was in despair… I thought about killing myself a dozen times. I cried and cried,” she says. “When you go to kyohwaso [prison camp] you are deprived of your citizenship,” says Jeon. “You are not human anymore. You are no different from an animal.” Chongori prison camp One day he whispered to Kim the words that were to change their lives forever. “I want to help you sister. You may die at the prison camp. The only way I can save you is by helping you get out of here,” he said. But like many North Koreans, Kim had learned not to trust others. She thought it could be a trick. “So I confronted him, saying: ‘Are you a spy?’ What do you gain from spying on me and destroying me?’ But he kept saying he wasn’t.” Eventually Jeon told her that not only did he think she should let him help her escape to South Korea, he wanted to go with her. It transpired that his prospects were also affected by hislow caste statusas a result of having relatives in South Korea - a national fracturing created by the Korean War. But these relatives also gave him hope of a different future. He showed her photos of his relatives that he had sneaked out of his parents’ house last time he was home. There were addresses written in tiny characters on the back. Kim started to believe him. But she was also very scared. “My heart was beating like crazy,” Kim says. “Never in North Korean history have a prisoner and a guard escaped together. On 12 July 2019, Jeon knew the moment had come. Kim’s move to the labour camp was imminent, and his boss had gone home for a night. Under cover of darkness, they leapt through a window, scaled the perimeter fence, and crossed the rice paddies to the river.  “I kept falling and tripping,” says Kim, her body weakened by months of detention. But they made it safely to the river bank. And then a light came on about 50 metres away. It was coming from the border garrison’s guard post. “We thought it could be the border garrison tightening security having [already] discovered we had escaped from the detention centre,” says Jeon, “but we were hiding and watching and they were just changing guard... We could hear the guards talking as they changed shifts. “We waited it out… After 30 minutes it went quiet. “So we went into the river. I have been to the river bank several times, and the water level has always been quite low… I never knew it could be that deep. “If I had been on my own I would have just swum across. But I was wearing a backpack… I had a gun, and if the gun became wet it would be useless so I was holding it up with my hand. But the water got deeper and deeper.” Jeon began to swim. But Kim didn’t know how. Jeon gripped his gun in one hand and dragged Kim with the other. “When we got into the middle of the river, the water was above my head,” says Kim. “I was choking and unable to open my eyes.” She begged Jeon to go back. “I told her: ‘We will both die if we go back. We die here, not there.’ But I was… exhausted and thinking: ‘Is this how I die, is this where it all ends?’” Finally Jeon’s feet touched the ground. They stumbled out and across the final bit of ground to the barbed wire that marked the border with China. Even then they weren’t safe. They hid in the mountains for three days until they met a local who lent them his phone. Kim called a broker she knew for help. The broker said the North Korean authorities were on high alert and had dispatched a team to arrest them, working with the Chinese police to comb the area. But with the help of Kim’s contacts they managed to move from safehouse to safehouse until they finally made it out of China and into a third country. Before they completed the final stage of their journeys they met us in a secret location to talk about their incredible escape and its ramifications. “I kept falling and tripping,” says Kim, her body weakened by months of detention. But they made it safely to the river bank. And then a light came on about 50 metres away.

Before they completed the final stage of their journeys they met us in a secret location to talk about their incredible escape and its ramifications.  It is highly likely that Kim and Jeon’s actions will further damage their family's social standing within the North Korean caste system, and that their relatives will be questioned and monitored. But both hope that their relative independence at the time - Jeon away in the military, Kim estranged from her husband and children - will allow their families to argue they did not know of their plans. “I feel guilty that I escaped so that I could live,” says Kim. “It really breaks my heart.” Jeon feels the same. He begins to softly hum a folk song called “Spring at Home” before putting his head in his hands. And he is sad that he is now heading for a different destination than the woman who has come so far with him. He has changed his plans and wants to go to the US, not South Korea. Jeon is teaching himself English while he waits to apply for asylum in the US “Come with me to the US,” he begs Kim. She shakes her head. “I’m not confident. I don’t speak English. I’m scared.” Jeon tries to convince her, saying they can learn English as they go along. “Wherever you go, don’t forget me,” Kim says quietly. But they are both glad to have left behind North Korea’s repressive regime. “Looking back, we all lived in a prison. We were never able to go wherever we wanted, do whatever we wanted.” “North Koreans have eyes yet cannot see; ears yet cannot hear; mouths yet cannot speak,” says Jeon. The prisoner’s name has been changed to protect her identity in her new home.

'Too much emphasis' on regenerating cities,"Rhyl's beach helped make the town popular with tourists, but its fortunes were hit by the advent of foreign holidays Too much emphasis has been placed on investment in cities rather than towns, a leading expert in the regeneration of high streets has said. Prof Cathy Parker said successive governments prioritised funding for places such as Cardiff in the hope it would ""trickle out"" to surrounding towns, which ""just won't happen"". The Welsh Government saidtowns would benefit from a Â£90m fund. Ministers will also encourage public services to move into town centres. The future of towns across the UK has moved up the political agenda since the general election. SC2 was a council development on the waterfront aimed at attracting visitors and private investment Thetwo most deprived area of Walesare in Rhyl and regeneration efforts have led to the opening of a new leisure centre SC2, which has a water park and assault courses for adults and children. The council has also invested in the promenade and last year aBusiness Improvement District,external(BID) was established by retailers in the town. There are now 13 of these in Wales, set up by local firms who pay a levy to be spent in the area to make it more attractive to visitors. Chairman of Rhyl's BID, Chrome Menswear owner Nadeem Ahmad, said: ""There was a time when there wasn't enough room for people to walk [down the high street]. All the shops were thriving - it was a holiday destination. ""There were so many bed and breakfasts and hotels. That's all gone I'm afraid."" Like many seaside towns Rhyl has struggled, but regeneration efforts are under way However, he thinks there is a lot of potential in the town: ""Rhyl has a beach that is just beautiful [but] it's not connected to the high street. At the moment no-one can see it."" Prof Parker, from Manchester Metropolitan University, said: ""Business Improvement Districts are a good mechanism for focusing on a lot of basic things that need to be right in a town."" Businesses often see the benefits of working together to increase the number of people coming in, even if that means paying an extra levy on top of high rates and rents, she said. Strong leadership is the key to transforming town centres, she added, as has happened in the south Wales town of Treorchy, which last monthtook first place in Great British High Street awards. Prof Parker said strong community leadership in Treorchy was one of the reasons for its success Prof Parker said better shopping and leisure facilities were important, but in many towns the problem runs deeper. ""When you've got places like Rhyl that have entrenched deprivation... you absolutely have to look at the problems communities face. ""There's low employment, lower income, poor health, all those need addressing but your town centre is a place to do that. ""Make sure there are more opportunities for employment, education, colleges, health centres and other things that will start to address the needs of the community rather than just thinking about retail and shopping and having a nice latte.""

Most polluting household fire fuels to be banned,"Owners of wood burners, stoves and open fires will no longer be able to buy house coal or wet wood, under a ban to be rolled out from next year. Sales of the two most polluting fuels will be phased out in England to help cut air pollution, the government says. Bags of logs sold in DIY stores, garden centres and petrol stations often contain wet wood - a type of wood which produces more pollution and smoke. The public should move to ""cleaner alternatives"", the government says. Plans for the banwere first announced18 months ago, but the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has now confirmed it is going ahead. The government said wood burning stoves and coal fires are the largest source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5),small particles of air pollution,externalwhich find their way into the body's lungs and blood. Particulate matter isone of several pollutants,externalcaused by industrial, domestic and traffic sources. What does air pollution do to our bodies? UK has first coal-free week for a century ""Cosy open fires and wood-burning stoves are at the heart of many homes up and down the country,"" said Environment Secretary George Eustice. ""But the use of certain fuels means that they are also the biggest source of the most harmful pollutant that is affecting people in the UK."" The changes will mean: Sales of bagged traditional house coal will be phased out by February 2021, and the sale of loose house coal direct to customers will end by 2023 Sales of wet wood in small units (less than 2m cube) will be phased out from February 2021. Wet wood in volumes greater than 2m cube will also have to be sold with advice on how to dry it before burning Makers of solid fuels will also need to show they have a very low sulphur content and only emit a small amount of smoke. It is not banning wood or coal burning stoves. Similar proposals to reduce the burning of wood and coal are being considered in Wales and Scotland. Wood can be dried in a kiln or in the air, and then stored undercover Gillian Lloyd, from the West Midlands, told BBC News she welcomed the measures as her asthma is often triggered by smoke, and many homes in her area feature wood burners. However, she raised concerns over the impact of the changes, saying people may continue to burn wet wood. ""A lot of people collect cut trees or fallen branches for their burners,"" she said. Today's announcement has echoes of the diesel controversy. Many drivers bought diesel vehicles because they are less bad for the climate than petrol. It turned out they created more of the particulate pollution that harms people's lungs, so now diesel car values are sliding. Likewise, many people shelled out for wood-burning stoves because they don't add to climate change. Now they too are being hit by local pollution rules. Households in Clean Air zones are banned by law from emitting dense smoke (although, for some reason, bonfires are still permitted). And elsewhere people will have to burn thoroughly dried wood, which may put up the cost of the fuel. There are loopholes. It's unlikely that local councils will prioritise inspections of garage forecourts when their ranks are depleted by spending cuts. What's more, there's nothing to stop you burning tree cuttings from your home without drying them. And there are no powers to inspect homes, so any rules on the use of wet wood cannot be enforced. Rob Power, from the rural village Clarencefield in Scotland, said he feared the changes in England may have a ""knock-on effect"" by increasing the cost of his fuel supply. The 73-year-old said his woodburner heats his radiator and water during the winter months, adding that it is too expensive to convert to another system. ""We're going to find it difficult,"" he said. ""People like us in rural areas have still got to live. ""With my income I can't afford to keep up with the modern trends."" Open fires and wood-burning stoves have risen in popularity over recent years - offering an additional form of heating for many households in both urban and rural areas, and possibly the sole heat source for some. Around 1.5m homes use wood for fuel across the UK, however burning wood and coal in open fires and stoves makes up 38% of the UK's emissions of PM2.5. By comparison, 16% come from industrial combustion, 12% from road transport and 13% from the use of solvents and industrial processes. This means a wood burning stoveemits more particles per hour than a diesel truck. Wet - also known as green or unseasoned wood - is often sold in nets and is cheaper to buy. It contains moisture which, when burned, creates more smoke and harmful particles of air pollution (PM2.5) than dry wood. Wet wood can also damage chimneys much more, by allowing tar and soot to build up. Dry or seasoned wood - which has been dried out, often in a kiln - has a moisture content of 20% or less. The government set out its commitment to reducing emissions of PM2.5 alongside four other air pollutants, including ammonia and nitrogen oxides, in its2019 Clean Air Strategy.,external Officials said the phase-out will give the public and suppliers time to use up stocks and move to cleaner alternatives, such as dry wood and manufactured solid fuels. These alternatives produce less smoke and pollution, and are cheaper and more efficient to burn, the government added. Wood briquettes, made from compressed dry sawdust and/or wood chips, are one example of an alternative fuel. The government is aiming to reduce emissions of PM2.5 by 46% by 2030. According to the Clean Air Strategy,  air pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK. In Wales,a consultation is currently ongoingfor a clean air plan, which is looking at whether wet wood could be banned. The Scottish government is due to consult on a draft revised air quality strategy later this year,following a review,externalthat included recommendations on domestic wood burning stoves, a spokeswoman said. Last year,Britain had its first weekwithout using electricity from burning coal since the 1880s, according to the National Grid Electricity System Operator. The government plans to phase out the UK's last coal-fired plants by 2025 to reduce carbon emissions. UK has first coal-free week for a century Ban on petrol and diesel car sales brought forward 'Dry wood only' for wood burning stoves What does air pollution do to our bodies?

Prince Charles meets Storm Dennis flood victimsThe Prince of Wales is speaking to homeowners and businesses left devastated by flooding.Wales,"This video can not be played About 200 people gathered in the centre of Pontypridd to see Prince Charles The Prince of Wales has met flood victims and their rescuers during a visit to south Wales. Storm Dennishit more than 1,000 homesand businesses in Rhondda Cynon Taff alone after heavy rain last week. Damage to council infrastructure alone across this region could cost up to Â£30m, leader Andrew Morgan said. More warnings of heavy rain have been issued for some areas of England and Wales still cleaning up after the last floods. Met Officeyellow weather warnings,externalfor heavy and persistent rain - meaning further flooding could occur - are in place for Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday across parts of the UK. Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan (right) said the repair bill is already up to Â£30m The various warnings affect already flooded areas, including south and mid Wales, parts of the north of England and the Midlands. Natural Resources Wales said the rainfall would likely lead to flood alerts and flood warnings. Meanwhile, the Environment Agency has warned the deluges are set to continue into next week. A spokesman said ""ongoing river flooding remains probable for the River Severn on Monday and Tuesday"". Storm Dennis brings flooding to Wales More than a month's worth of rain fell in 48 hours on Saturday and Sunday when Storm Dennis hit Wales, and further heavy rain fell on Thursday. Prince Charles was in Pontypridd to meet residents and businesses affected by recent floods In Pontypridd, Charles visited business owner Emma Jamal who said people's lives had been ""turned upside down"" and the devastation needed to be seen by people such as the Prince. Her boutique store Kookoo Madame was badly damaged with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of jewellery, clothes and cosmetics, ruined after about 4ft (1.21m) of floodwater filled the premises. ""It had taken 12 years to get the business to where it was, it's hard to know where to start,"" she said. ""It's a bit surreal to have his royal highness in our tiny little business in Pontypridd. ""But he was very down to earth and his visit is good for the town, to highlight the devastation and hopefully get more help."" Ms Jamal said many independent businesses in the town were now finding out their insurance policies did not cover them for flooding, and the town needed to be safeguarded to stop it being flooded again. ""Things need to change, no-one can get insurance now, so what do we do next year, what do we do when it happens again?"" Emma Jamal said cabinets filled with charms and shelves of bath bombs were among the stock ruined by the flood water Charles also visited Prince's cafe where the bakery in the basement was badly damaged in the flood. Bragdy Twt Lol brewery, also known as the Trefforest Brewery, managed to reopen after volunteers spent days helping with the clean-up after flood water destroyed beer bottles, hops, malt and yeast. Owner Phil Thomas said while they had stock for the Six Nations and weeks ahead, it was not yet clear when they would be able to start brewing again. ""We initially thought it was about Â£10,000 of damage, but we are probably now looking at up to Â£30,000,"" he said. This video can not be played Heavy rain caused ""multiple"" floods and landslides, according to South Wales Police Rhondda Cynon Taf council said seven bridges have been seriously damaged and some could be condemned after foundations were undermined. Mr Morgan added: ""I wouldn't be surprised if the cost rises even higher [than Â£30m]. We're in the tens of millions of pounds now."" Meanwhile contractors have been brought in to stabilise a former coal tip in the Rhondda where a landslide occurred during the heavy rain. Dramatic footage of the landslide atTylorstown, emerged on social media, and the former tip has been under 24 hour surveillance ever since. Engineers were also looking to make land safe near Big Pit National Coal Museum in Blaenavon following a landslide above the site, Torfaen council said. Many of businesses on Mill Street have been cleaning up following the flooding Meanwhile volunteers say they have been overwhelmed by support, with donations of food, clothing, furniture and cleaning products to help. The Manic Street Preachers have given Â£3,000 towards those dealing with the fallout in Pontypridd, where a fundraising page has raised more than Â£20,000. Other donations to the page, set up by Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones, are listed as being from Line Of Duty star Vicky McClure and her partner Jonny Owen, and another under the name of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock. A day after it was set up another fundraiser,arranged by film star Michael Sheen, has raised more than Â£30,000. A major clean up operation has been carried out at Welsh language club Clwb y Bont Charles also visited the Aston Martin factory in St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan, where the company launched its first Wales-made car in November. He also spent time at the Marie Curie Hospice in Penarth and officially opened a train-making factory in Newport. And he visited Cardiff Airport's British Airways maintenance centre to mark the company's 100th anniversary. The Prince added Pontypridd to the previously-planned itinerary following the flooding.

"First class stamps to rise 6p to 76pThe Royal Mail is increasing the cost of postage again, with first-class stamps rising 6p to 76pBusinessComments","The Royal Mail is increasing the cost of postage, with first-class stamps rising 6p to 76p and second-class up 4p to 65p. Prices will climb from 23 March, less than a year after they were hiked to their current levels. The 65p second-class stamp is the maximum under an Ofcom price cap. ""These changes are necessary to help ensure the sustainability of the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service,"" Royal Mail said. It blamed the increases on ""a challenging business environment"". Stephen Agar, managing director of letters at Royal Mail said: ""We are operating in a tough market at present, under the threat of making a loss by 2021.

It said it understands that many companies and households are finding it hard in the current economic environment. ""As a result, we have considered any pricing changes very carefully and in doing so have sought to minimise any impact on our customers."" But the move has angered small businesses. ""When the cost of doing business is already rising across the board, this latest rise in stamp costs for letters and for parcels is just another expense that small businesses will be forced to carry, affecting small firms that rely on Royal Mail as a major part of their business,"" said Federation of Small Businesses national chair Mike Cherry. ""We should be doing all we can to support small firms to grow and succeed, price hikes like this only prevent that.

Coronavirus outbreak to cost airlines almost $30bn,"Airlines stand to lose $29.3bn (Â£23.7bn) of revenue this year due to the coronavirus outbreak, the global airline industry body has warned. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts demand for air travel will fall for the first time in more than a decade. Airlines in China and other parts of the Asia Pacific region are expected to take the vast majority of the impact. It comes as carriers around the world have been forced to reduce flights. In total, airlines in the Asia Pacific region are set to see a $27.8bn revenue loss in 2020, while those outside Asia are expected to lose $1.5bn in revenue, IATA has forecast. Of that figure, IATA predicts that carriers in China are set to lose revenue of $12.8bn in their home market alone. ""Airlines are making difficult decisions to cut capacity and in some cases routes,"" said IATA's director-general Alexandre de Juniac. ""This will be a very tough year for airlines."" Airlines warn of coronavirus earnings impact Coronavirus triggers boom in private jet inquiries Jaguar Land Rover 'shipping parts in suitcases' However, IATA cautioned it was too early to predict what this expected revenue loss would mean for airlines' profitability this year. IATA said it had based its estimates on the slump in demand that was seen during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2003. That was characterised by a six-month period that saw a sharp fall in demand followed by an equally quick recovery. That year Sars was responsible for the 5.1% fall in demand for airlines in the Asia-Pacific region. The forecast also assumes that the virus remains centred on China, but IATA warned the effect could be far worse if the infection spreads further in the region. IATA has previously forecast that the Asia Pacific region would be the biggest driver of air travel demand between 2015 and 2035, with four of the five fastest-growing markets in terms of passengers being from Asia. On Thursday, two major airline groups warned of a severe financial impact as a result of the coronavirus hitting demand for travel in Asia. Australia's Qantas said the outbreak would cost it up to 150m Australian dollars ($99m; Â£76m), while European carrier Air-France KLM put the cost at up to â¬200m ($213m; Â£168m) for the period between February and April.

Most polluting household fire fuels to be bannedOwners of wood burners and open fires in England will be discouraged from burning coal or wet wood.UK,"Owners of wood burners, stoves and open fires will no longer be able to buy house coal or wet wood, under a ban to be rolled out from next year. Sales of the two most polluting fuels will be phased out in England to help cut air pollution, the government says. Bags of logs sold in DIY stores, garden centres and petrol stations often contain wet wood - a type of wood which produces more pollution and smoke. The public should move to ""cleaner alternatives"", the government says. Plans for the banwere first announced18 months ago, but the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has now confirmed it is going ahead. The government said wood burning stoves and coal fires are the largest source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5),small particles of air pollution,externalwhich find their way into the body's lungs and blood. Particulate matter isone of several pollutants,externalcaused by industrial, domestic and traffic sources. What does air pollution do to our bodies? UK has first coal-free week for a century ""Cosy open fires and wood-burning stoves are at the heart of many homes up and down the country,"" said Environment Secretary George Eustice. ""But the use of certain fuels means that they are also the biggest source of the most harmful pollutant that is affecting people in the UK."" The changes will mean: Sales of bagged traditional house coal will be phased out by February 2021, and the sale of loose house coal direct to customers will end by 2023 Sales of wet wood in small units (less than 2m cube) will be phased out from February 2021. Wet wood in volumes greater than 2m cube will also have to be sold with advice on how to dry it before burning Makers of solid fuels will also need to show they have a very low sulphur content and only emit a small amount of smoke. It is not banning wood or coal burning stoves. Similar proposals to reduce the burning of wood and coal are being considered in Wales and Scotland. Wood can be dried in a kiln or in the air, and then stored undercover Gillian Lloyd, from the West Midlands, told BBC News she welcomed the measures as her asthma is often triggered by smoke, and many homes in her area feature wood burners. However, she raised concerns over the impact of the changes, saying people may continue to burn wet wood. ""A lot of people collect cut trees or fallen branches for their burners,"" she said. Today's announcement has echoes of the diesel controversy. Many drivers bought diesel vehicles because they are less bad for the climate than petrol. It turned out they created more of the particulate pollution that harms people's lungs, so now diesel car values are sliding. Likewise, many people shelled out for wood-burning stoves because they don't add to climate change. Now they too are being hit by local pollution rules. Households in Clean Air zones are banned by law from emitting dense smoke (although, for some reason, bonfires are still permitted). And elsewhere people will have to burn thoroughly dried wood, which may put up the cost of the fuel. There are loopholes. It's unlikely that local councils will prioritise inspections of garage forecourts when their ranks are depleted by spending cuts. What's more, there's nothing to stop you burning tree cuttings from your home without drying them. And there are no powers to inspect homes, so any rules on the use of wet wood cannot be enforced. Rob Power, from the rural village Clarencefield in Scotland, said he feared the changes in England may have a ""knock-on effect"" by increasing the cost of his fuel supply. The 73-year-old said his woodburner heats his radiator and water during the winter months, adding that it is too expensive to convert to another system. ""We're going to find it difficult,"" he said. ""People like us in rural areas have still got to live. ""With my income I can't afford to keep up with the modern trends."" Open fires and wood-burning stoves have risen in popularity over recent years - offering an additional form of heating for many households in both urban and rural areas, and possibly the sole heat source for some. Around 1.5m homes use wood for fuel across the UK, however burning wood and coal in open fires and stoves makes up 38% of the UK's emissions of PM2.5. By comparison, 16% come from industrial combustion, 12% from road transport and 13% from the use of solvents and industrial processes. This means a wood burning stoveemits more particles per hour than a diesel truck. Wet - also known as green or unseasoned wood - is often sold in nets and is cheaper to buy. It contains moisture which, when burned, creates more smoke and harmful particles of air pollution (PM2.5) than dry wood. Wet wood can also damage chimneys much more, by allowing tar and soot to build up. Dry or seasoned wood - which has been dried out, often in a kiln - has a moisture content of 20% or less. The government set out its commitment to reducing emissions of PM2.5 alongside four other air pollutants, including ammonia and nitrogen oxides, in its2019 Clean Air Strategy.,external Officials said the phase-out will give the public and suppliers time to use up stocks and move to cleaner alternatives, such as dry wood and manufactured solid fuels. These alternatives produce less smoke and pollution, and are cheaper and more efficient to burn, the government added. Wood briquettes, made from compressed dry sawdust and/or wood chips, are one example of an alternative fuel. The government is aiming to reduce emissions of PM2.5 by 46% by 2030. According to the Clean Air Strategy,  air pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK. In Wales,a consultation is currently ongoingfor a clean air plan, which is looking at whether wet wood could be banned. The Scottish government is due to consult on a draft revised air quality strategy later this year,following a review,externalthat included recommendations on domestic wood burning stoves, a spokeswoman said. Last year,Britain had its first weekwithout using electricity from burning coal since the 1880s, according to the National Grid Electricity System Operator. The government plans to phase out the UK's last coal-fired plants by 2025 to reduce carbon emissions.

Cipriani in emotional Flack tribute,"Danny Cipriani has played in 16 Tests for England - the most recent in 2018 Gloucester fly-half Danny Cipriani has released an emotional video tribute to ex-girlfriend Caroline Flack, saying ""it's OK to be vulnerable"". Former Love Island host Flack, 40, wasfound dead at her homein London on Saturday after taking her own life. Cipriani said he was speaking out about his own mental health issues in the hope her ""life will not go in vain"". During the18-minute clip on Instagram,external, the 32-year-old admits he tried to buy a gun to end his life 10 years ago. ""I couldn't do it because I had some fight in me,"" a tearful Cipriani said. The England international said he had been speaking to Flack over the past ""three or four months"" and she had been dealing with negative media attention ""for 20 years"". Flack was due to stand trial next month after being charged with assaulting her partner in December. ""Embarrassment and shame is not something that should make you do this,"" said Cipriani. ""I've worried my whole life what people say about me. I don't care any more. I know who I am."" Caroline Flack had presented Love Island, as well as co-hosting The X Factor and won Strictly Come Dancing in 2014 Cipriani, who played in Gloucester's Premiership defeat by Exeter last Friday, said he had shared ""everything"" with the television presenter. Gloucester,externalhad already announced their next home match - against Sale Sharks on 28 February - would be used to raise awareness of mental health issues. Following the news of Flack's death, Cipriani said he had missed a phone call from her. ""I have to see the meaning in why she decided to call me in her last moments, when she was with her two best friends,"" he said in Friday's video.

Pupils' exam performance falls by up to 10%,"Opposition parties have criticised the Scottish government after an official report revealed a decline in the exam performance of school pupils. The analysis,externalwas posted on the government's website at 20:00 on Thursday. It reveals that the number of students achieving passes in core Higher subjects dropped significantly in 2019, in some cases by as much as 10%. The Conservatives said there were ""clearly major problems"" in education. Education Secretary John Swinney said the government ""regularly monitors and analyses performance to inform decision-making"". He denied that the government was trying to ""sneak out the report"" and insisted it was fulfilling ""commitments we had made to parliament"". Mr Swinney told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We had a Freedom of Information request that had to be responded to. ""We felt it was appropriate (to release the exams report at the same time) because so much of that material was included in the report that I had promised we would publish."" Sturgeon agrees to wider review of education Pass rate falls for Highers but rises for National 5s The Freedom of Information request was made by a lecturer and former school teacher. The timing of its release led to ministers being accused of a ""snide and cynical"" attempt to avoid scrutiny of its record on education. Opposition parties said the figures highlighted a ""worrying decline"" in pupils' exam performance. Scottish Conservative education spokesman Jamie Greene said: ""This is a snide and cynical move by an SNP government which is increasingly in crisis across all of Scotland's public services. ""There are clearly major and systematic problems within our education system that the SNP simply refuses to acknowledge or take action on. ""John Swinney insisted there were no issues concerning the drop in pass rates, but this snuck-out report proves him wrong."" The drop in the numbers passing some key Highers begs important questions. The rate of the fall in some of the most important subjects is far greater than the headline fall in the number of Higher passes overall. But it is important not to jump to conclusions about what may be to blame. There are a number of possible contributory factors. There may be questions over how well prepared some young people are for their Higher courses. Did their education in S1-S3 and their National 5 courses provide an appropriate bedrock? Might the practice of teaching Nat 5 and Higher classes together in some schools have been a factor? Could there sometimes be issues with resourcing or specific shortages of teachers? But not all of the possible explanations are necessarily worrying. Could some schools or teachers be encouraging more borderline candidates to attempt a Higher? It is unlikely, though, that the exams system will be the reason for the drop. The SQA adjusts pass marks and grade boundaries every year to allow for exams being a little easier or harder than anticipated. The Scottish government has said it regularly analyses exam performance 1,515 fewer pupils passed their Higher English exam This was a reduction of 5.5% on the previous year and the lowest number since 2014 Passes dropped by 8.8%  (178 students) for those sitting Advanced Higher exams in the subject Higher maths saw the pass rate fall by 2.1% - the first decline since 2014 Higher history pass rates plunged by 14.6% overall and by 10% in A-C grades Advanced Higher maths saw the number of passes increase by 1.6% Passes in the sciences were up 1.6% at a Higher level Those sitting the subjects at Advanced Higher - not including human biology - saw the number of passes fall by 14.1% (there was a 13% reduction in those sitting the tests) Speaking after the publication of the report, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government regularly monitored and analysed performance to inform decision-making. ""Taken together, this analysis demonstrates good progress in a number of areas and that it is challenging to identify significant drivers of change or to draw firm conclusions about some subjects due to small numbers of entries,"" he said. ""The analysis has, however, identified areas that justify further exploration and highlight actions that have been agreed. ""My key areas of focus are to ensure that curriculum and assessment are aligned, how to better support professional learning and development, and maintaining a clear focus on enhancing learning and teaching."" Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teaching union, said it was important to look at the wider context ""including such variables as different pupil cohorts in each year"" and to ""balance dips against improvements in some qualifications and at various levels of presentation"". He added: ""Focusing solely on Higher passes alone, for example, is an unhealthy and unhelpful fixation. The EIS would like to see an evaluation of the impact of longer exams on pupil performance but overall we believe that schools and teachers deliver well for students, especially in a period of ongoing austerity and budget cuts."" In January,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon agreed to a wider inquiry into Scottish educationafter opposition MSPs demanded one. A study of the senior phase of schoolinghad already been ordered, but Holyrood voted to say this should be a ""full review"" of broader education. SNP members opposed the move in the vote, but Ms Sturgeon said she would ""abide by the decision of parliament"".

Surgeon who harmed Scots is now working in LibyaA top surgeon who harmed patients for years and can no longer work in the UK is operating again.Scotland,"Video footage shows Mr Eljamel operating in the Libyan city of Misrata A top surgeon who harmed patients in Scotland for years and can no longer work in the UK is operating again. The BBC has discovered that Sam Eljamel, who was suspended following internal and external reviews in 2013, is working as a surgeon in Libya. The former government adviser and head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside removed himself from the GMC register after restrictions were placed on him. The General Medical Council (GMC) said its remit did not extend beyond the UK. ABBC Disclosure investigation in 2018found that Mr Eljamel had harmed patients for years at NHS Tayside. He was allowed to continue operating even after an external investigation found he was injuring patients. The top surgeon who harmed patients for years In one case he removed the wrong part of a patient's body. That patient was Jules Rose. In 2013 Mr Eljamel removed her tear duct instead of her brain tumour. This video can not be played 'How can my surgeon still be operating?' Responding to the news he was working as a surgeon again, Ms Rose said she was ""absolutely devastated"". ""He has obviously gone somewhere he feels he can get away with it,"" she told the BBC. ""These poor people have no idea. They are completely oblivious to what damage and what harm this man has caused. He is just going to do it all again."" Mr Eljamel was placed under investigation and suspended by NHS Tayside in 2013. He was placed under interim conditions by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) in 2014 and then removed himself from the GMC register which means he can no longer practice in the UK. Video footage shows him operating on children and adults in the Libyan city of Misrata where he now works at a number of hospitals. Sam Eljamel was the head of the neurosurgery department in Ninewells Hospital in Dundee Ordinarily it's not too hard to find people. Normally it takes days or weeks. Many of us live our lives quite publicly on social media and online. But there are exceptions. Neurosurgeon Sam Eljamel was one. To find him has taken almost two years. Not only had he erased himself from the internet and social media but scattered around the globe we found addresses where he no longer lived. We found he'd recently paid his dues for a medical association but had given an address in Tayside where he no longer lived or worked. We found links in Australia, Africa and the Philippines. Former colleagues were convinced he was in Connecticut where he still owned a flat and had relatives. We went there to track him down but found only an empty flat and friends and relatives he had stopped contacting. And then 18 months later I got an email from Libya. Our Disclosure investigation had been translated into Arabic and several people got in touch to say they'd seen him. Not only had we found him but we'd found that he is operating again. Patrick Kelly said he wants the UK authorities to alert those in Libya Pat Kelly is in constant pain and faces the risk of paralysis after spinal surgery by Mr Eljamel. He wants the authorities in the UK to alert those in Libya. ""I think because there were no sanctions taken against him by either NHS Tayside nor the GMC,"" he said. ""I think across in Libya they probably think, 'well, if there were no actions taken there then what are we griping about'."" Mr Kelly said: ""I just simply want him stopped. I want the UK government or Scottish government to get in touch with the Libyan authorities to get this man stopped."" A spokeswoman for the GMC said: ""As our remit does not extend to outside of the UK, there is nothing stopping a doctor practising abroad if they are granted registration with the relevant regulator in that country."" She said information was shared with a variety of EU and other regulators and confirmed that Dr Eljamel's interim conditions and his voluntary removal from the register were recorded. She said: ""The circular includes regulators in the United States, but not Libya."" A number of patients have successfully sued NHS Tayside as a result of operations carried out by Mr Eljamel. There is also an ongoing police investigation looking at whether his actions warrant a criminal prosecution. Police Scotland confirmed that inquiries are ongoing and that it has recently consulted with the National Crime Agency as part of its investigation into Mr Eljamel.

Billions of Â£20 notes to be made into compost,"Spend Â£20 today and it could soon be on its journey to becoming compost. The Bank of England has begun the massive task of destroying Â£40bn-worth of paper banknotes,which will be replaced by new polymer Â£20 notes. Around two billion paper notes will be withdrawn and recycled to be used as a soil improver for agriculture. ""It's an enormous operation the general public will barely notice,"" said Mark Saunders of G4S, which handles two-thirds of Britain's banknotes. The replacement of the two billion notes will be the biggest cash replacement in UK history. The old Â£20 notes bearing the image of economist Adam Smith are being taken out of circulation. That means notes returned to banks or to cash centres by retailers will not be used again, although some stores recycle notes through their own cash machines. The process will take months, but once enough have been destroyed the Bank of England will give six months notice for the remaining notes to be handed in. Last time the Â£20 was replaced - in 2007 when the Edward Elgar note was withdrawn - it took three years before it stopped being legal tender. It could be quicker this time, but it's likely to be 2021 at the earliest before the Bank sends out its six-month deadline for the paper Adam Smith Â£20. One of the high-speed note-sorting machines separating old and new Â£20s There's a highly-secure warehouse on a back street in London. There, two huge high-speed note-sorting machines whir through thousands of pounds every minute. The mini note-sized rollercoasters on the machines can count, authenticate and sort 33 notes per second through a complex array of sensors and fast-moving belts. They're part of a nationwide network of high-security cash centres - the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS) - run by G4S, NatWest Bank, the Post Office and Vaultex UK. Last year, the NCS processed Â£93bn-worth of bank notes. ""The high-speed note sorters will be vital in identifying and sorting out the old notes,"" said Rob Perry, G4S cash solutions operations and support manager. ""The old Â£20s will be wrapped in blocks of Â£50,000,"" he revealed. ""They're tightly-packed, sealed and stored in metal cages in the cash centre's vault."" Up until 1990, the Bank of England used to take all its old notes and burn them in an incinerator to help heat its building in the City of London. Now, when the Â£50,000 blocks are returned, the Bank uses a composting treatment, similar to that used in the treatment of food waste, to create a soil improver. The work to replace the old Â£20 notes began in early 2019, with technicians steadily updating note-sorting machines so they would recognise the new polymer note and simultaneously sift out the old. The G4S Cash Business then oversaw the delivery of millions in notes to 33 strategically-chosen bank branches to coincide with Thursday's launch date. Across the UK, 38 carefully-selected ATMs were also filled with the new notes by G4S. As the new Â£20 notes are 15% smaller than the old notes, tens of thousands of cassettes in ATMs across the country have needed to be replaced or reconfigured. The planning behind this had been going on for more than a year. Within two weeks of the launch of the new note, it's expected that every bank branch supplied by G4S will stock new notes. Within about six to eight weeks, every ATM will have been converted to the new Â£20 cassettes while the NCS members will stockpile old notes in Cash Centre vaults, ready to be sent to the Bank of England to be destroyed. ""The life of a note is extraordinary,"" Mark Saunders, director of G4S's Cash Centre Operations, said. ""After we've machine-sorted the cotton notes out, they'll be parcelled, weighed and sealed - in cages in our vaults, before being securely transported back to the Bank of England for verification and destruction."" The Bank of England said: ""You will still be able to use the paper Â£20 note until we withdraw it from circulation. We will announce the withdrawal date after we have issued our new polymer Â£20 note. We will give six months' notice of this withdrawal date."" Even after the deadline passes, you will still be able to cash old notes in. The Bank of England said: ""Many banks will accept withdrawn notes as deposits from customers. The Post Office may also accept withdrawn notes as a deposit into any bank account you can access at the Post Office. And, you can always exchange withdrawn notes with us.""

School pupils' exam performance falls by up to 10%,"Opposition parties have criticised the Scottish government after an official report revealed a decline in the exam performance of school pupils. The analysis,externalwas posted on the government's website at 20:00 on Thursday. It reveals that the number of students achieving passes in core Higher subjects dropped significantly in 2019, in some cases by as much as 10%. The Conservatives said there were ""clearly major problems"" in education. Education Secretary John Swinney said the government ""regularly monitors and analyses performance to inform decision-making"". He denied that the government was trying to ""sneak out the report"" and insisted it was fulfilling ""commitments we had made to parliament"". Mr Swinney told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We had a Freedom of Information request that had to be responded to. ""We felt it was appropriate (to release the exams report at the same time) because so much of that material was included in the report that I had promised we would publish."" Sturgeon agrees to wider review of education Pass rate falls for Highers but rises for National 5s The Freedom of Information request was made by a lecturer and former school teacher. The timing of its release led to ministers being accused of a ""snide and cynical"" attempt to avoid scrutiny of its record on education. Opposition parties said the figures highlighted a ""worrying decline"" in pupils' exam performance. Scottish Conservative education spokesman Jamie Greene said: ""This is a snide and cynical move by an SNP government which is increasingly in crisis across all of Scotland's public services. ""There are clearly major and systematic problems within our education system that the SNP simply refuses to acknowledge or take action on. ""John Swinney insisted there were no issues concerning the drop in pass rates, but this snuck-out report proves him wrong."" The drop in the numbers passing some key Highers begs important questions. The rate of the fall in some of the most important subjects is far greater than the headline fall in the number of Higher passes overall. But it is important not to jump to conclusions about what may be to blame. There are a number of possible contributory factors. There may be questions over how well prepared some young people are for their Higher courses. Did their education in S1-S3 and their National 5 courses provide an appropriate bedrock? Might the practice of teaching Nat 5 and Higher classes together in some schools have been a factor? Could there sometimes be issues with resourcing or specific shortages of teachers? But not all of the possible explanations are necessarily worrying. Could some schools or teachers be encouraging more borderline candidates to attempt a Higher? It is unlikely, though, that the exams system will be the reason for the drop. The SQA adjusts pass marks and grade boundaries every year to allow for exams being a little easier or harder than anticipated. The Scottish government has said it regularly analyses exam performance 1,515 fewer pupils passed their Higher English exam This was a reduction of 5.5% on the previous year and the lowest number since 2014 Passes dropped by 8.8%  (178 students) for those sitting Advanced Higher exams in the subject Higher maths saw the pass rate fall by 2.1% - the first decline since 2014 Higher history pass rates plunged by 14.6% overall and by 10% in A-C grades Advanced Higher maths saw the number of passes increase by 1.6% Passes in the sciences were up 1.6% at a Higher level Those sitting the subjects at Advanced Higher - not including human biology - saw the number of passes fall by 14.1% (there was a 13% reduction in those sitting the tests) Speaking after the publication of the report, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government regularly monitored and analysed performance to inform decision-making. ""Taken together, this analysis demonstrates good progress in a number of areas and that it is challenging to identify significant drivers of change or to draw firm conclusions about some subjects due to small numbers of entries,"" he said. ""The analysis has, however, identified areas that justify further exploration and highlight actions that have been agreed. ""My key areas of focus are to ensure that curriculum and assessment are aligned, how to better support professional learning and development, and maintaining a clear focus on enhancing learning and teaching."" Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teaching union, said it was important to look at the wider context ""including such variables as different pupil cohorts in each year"" and to ""balance dips against improvements in some qualifications and at various levels of presentation"". He added: ""Focusing solely on Higher passes alone, for example, is an unhealthy and unhelpful fixation. The EIS would like to see an evaluation of the impact of longer exams on pupil performance but overall we believe that schools and teachers deliver well for students, especially in a period of ongoing austerity and budget cuts."" In January,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon agreed to a wider inquiry into Scottish educationafter opposition MSPs demanded one. A study of the senior phase of schoolinghad already been ordered, but Holyrood voted to say this should be a ""full review"" of broader education. SNP members opposed the move in the vote, but Ms Sturgeon said she would ""abide by the decision of parliament"". The motion passed also said there were ""key weaknesses in some key aspects of Scotland's school education"" system.
