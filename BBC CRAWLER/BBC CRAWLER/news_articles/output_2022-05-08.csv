NI secretary to meet Stormont political leaders,"This video can not be played The Democratic Unionist Party says it will not join a power-sharing government without action on the protocol The DUP will not go back into government in Northern Ireland until its concerns about post-Brexit trading arrangements are resolved, the party's leader has said. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was among the party leaders to meet NI Secretary Brandon Lewis in Belfast on Monday. Thursday's historic election saw Sinn FÃ©inbecome Stormont's largest party. Would-be first minister Michelle O'Neill said there could be no attempt by the DUP to ""punish the public"". Ms O'Neill and Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald held talks with Mr Lewis, who also met the leaders of the Alliance Party, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol? Donaldson's Brexit trading dilemma The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is resisting pressure from the UK and Irish governments, as well as Northern Ireland's other main parties, to nominate ministers after the dramatic election result. For months, the DUP has protested against the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the UK's Brexit deal with the European Union which retains free trade across the Irish border. It has angered some unionists for introducing new checks on some goods moving across the Irish Sea. They also say it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK. In his meetings on Monday, Mr Lewis urged the party leaders to respect the outcome of the election on Thursday and re-establish Stormont as soon as possible. He said the government would have to address issues relating to the protocol and ""continue to press the EU to agree the crucial changes that are urgently needed"". The NI Secretary stated that he will remain in close contact with all the party leaders over the coming days. Sinn FÃ©in, whose ultimate goal is for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and become one country with the Republic of Ireland, won the most seats - 27 out of 90 - after Thursday's vote. This means the party can nominate Northern Ireland's first minister, an unprecedented move for a nationalist party, but it is reliant on the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) taking up its position as deputy first minister. The roles form a joint office, with equal responsibility, however, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. Sir Jeffrey said his party would not nominate ministers until there had been ""decisive action"" on the protocol. Sinn FÃ©in's newly-elected assembly members gathered at Stormont on Monday morning ""They (UK government) gave a firm commitment to protect our place in the UK internal market,"" Sir Jeffrey said. ""They have not done so, they have failed over the last two-and-a-half years to honour that commitment."" But Ms O'Neill said the DUP and the UK government must respect the election's outcome, and that it was down to Boris Johnson and the EU to resolve differences over the protocol. ""Brinkmanship will not be tolerated where the north of Ireland becomes collateral damage in a game of chicken with the European Commission,"" she said. ""Make no mistake, we and our business community here will not be held to ransom."" While some assembly members (MLAs) were at Stormont on Monday, the legislative body will hold its first sitting on Friday, when members will register and designate as unionist, nationalist or other. GOVERNMENT CRISIS:What happens next? HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:What does the party want? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? On Monday, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said the DUP was wrong to place conditions on power-sharing. ""The mandate they all got was to take their assembly seats and get into the executive,"" he told broadcaster RTÃ. Mr Martin said the EU had signalled its intention to make the Northern Ireland Protocol work more effectively, but that it would not be removed. Today is a mixture of first day of school, a wedding and a wake - a lot of people all dressed up with nowhere really to go. The only meeting some would say Brandon Lewis needs to have is with the DUP. There is also an interesting leaders' meeting which will be led by Michelle O'Neill, the would-be first minister if there was anybody to be deputy first minister. But all of that will lead nowhere unless someone can persuade the DUP to set aside its difficulties on the protocol. MLAs are due to sign the Stormont register on Friday (the 13th if you're superstitious). If that goes well, they will elect the speaker and are supposed to elect the first and deputy first ministers - and that is where the first big problem happens. 462 of 462 seats counted.Counting complete. Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney is expected to meet Brandon Lewis later. Meanwhile, the EU's chief negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has urged the UK to""dial down the rhetoric""about the protocol. He said the UK needed to ""be honest"" about what it had committed to. Kellie Armstrong, from the Alliance Party, said there would be a ""zombie assembly"" if the DUP did not respect the outcome of the election. ""If they really cannot abide being deputy first minister then they have the option of opposition and then they can hold the government to account,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. ""But for goodness sake at least let the rest of us get on with doing some work."" This video can not be played Alliance leader Naomi Long said that to get a functioning executive, the DUP needed to step up to the plate Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said that if the Northern Ireland Protocol was the obstacle to a functioning executive at Stormont, then it needed to be dealt with. ""We all know what the landing zone is, no checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if they are staying in Northern Ireland. That gets rid of the border down the Irish Sea. ""The EU Commission know this, the UK government know this and all five political parties who would form the executive know this also."" On Monday, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party was now in opposition as it does ""not have a mandate for government"". The party lost four seats and returns to the assembly with eight MLAs. Mr Eastwood, the Foyle MP, said his party would not replace its deputy leader Nichola Mallon, who lost her seat, as infrastructure minister. The victory for Sinn FÃ©in in this election does not mean a vote on Irish unification - also known as a border poll - is imminent. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 - which followed the signing of the Good Friday Agreement peace deal - stated that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and ""shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll"". It also stated that the Northern Ireland secretary should agree to hold a poll if it appeared likely that a majority of people wanted a united Ireland. Successive opinion polls suggest that is not yet the case, with the most recent, published in April, putting support at about a third. Although Sinn FÃ©in's vote rose at the election, the combined vote for the main parties which support a border poll - Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, People Before Profit and AontÃº - fell. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"". After her meeting with the NI secretary on Monday, she said she expected mention ofIrish Language legislationin Tuesday's Queens Speech. It is still not clear whether the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who is currently an MP, will take his seat at Stormont, or hand it over to a party colleague and stay at Westminster. If he decides to remain as a member of parliament, it will be seen as a sign that he feels the Stormont stalemate will continue for the foreseeable future. Donaldson's DUP dilemma after assembly election How Alliance nerds turned single digits into a surge The DUP lost three seats in last week's election but fared better than some opinion polls had predicted. The only party to gain seats after the election was the cross-community Alliance Party, now Stormont's third largest, after it more than doubled its representation to 17 seats. Elsewhere, the UUP also lost a seat, finishing with nine MLAs, while the Green Party lost its two seats. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister retained his place at Stormont, as did Gerry Carroll of People Before Profit and two independent unionists, Claire Sugden and Alex Easton. Although Sinn FÃ©in is the largest party, there are still more unionists than nationalists at Stormont, 37 to 35. The new assembly is the seventh to be formed since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.

"Millions face higher winter bills, warns energy boss","The boss of Scottish Power has warned that millions of customers face an horrific winter unless there is a major government intervention in energy firms. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, told the BBC that another expected rise in energy bills in October to between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 a year could see huge losses for suppliers and many customers unable to pay their bills. He warned regulator Ofgem that setting the new price cap too low could risk suppliers collapsing or the foreign owned firms leaving the market. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: ""Where we can make a difference, particularly for those who really need our help, that's what we're going to do."" Mr Anderson has put some flesh on the bones of a plan he first mentioned in a frank exchange with a committee of MPs three weeks ago. He has called for ten million households to have their energy bills reduced by Â£1,000 this October. He said the government's plan to give each household Â£200 towards their energy bill - a sum that will need to be paid back - would not be enough. ""We need to be realistic about the gravity of the situation - around 40% of UK households, potentially 10 million homes, could be in fuel poverty this winter,"" Mr Anderson explained. The price cap is set to be increased again in October. To date, the government has said it will offer extra relief of Â£150 in April via the council tax system in England, and in October customers in England, Scotland and Wales will receive a Â£200 rebate on their energy bills. They will have to repay this at Â£40 a year for five years, starting in April 2023. However, Mr Anderson said a Â£10bn tariff reduction fund could be paid for by adding Â£40 annually to all household energy bills for the next decade. He said this would be the most effective to avoid fuel poverty for the most vulnerable. Mr Anderson said that such a fund would directly tackle the biggest cause of the cost of living crisis in a way that other measures - such as the recent 5p cut to fuel duty or a possible cut to the frequency of MOT testing - do not. Households on pre-payment meters and those in receipt of benefits would be eligible for the discount. Gerard Barwick said he was concerned about being able to afford potential energy price rises in October Gerard Barwick lives in Newcastle with his partner and their granddaughter. He's a DJ, but lost his business during the pandemic. At the moment they're relying on a single wage to pay their bills, and April has been particularly tough. ""We used to be able to afford the odd night out. Now we can't afford to do anything,"" said Mr Barwick, who is receiving help from the charity National Energy Action. ""We've cut back on putting the heating on, we're not using as much electricity, we're cutting back on meals. But there's only so much you can cut back on,"" he said. ""We're really worried about our bills right now. Come October, we might have to find another Â£1,000. ""We're already looking at an empty purse, and you can't pull any more money out of an empty purse,"" he said. Mr Anderson also said more energy companies could collapse if their customers were unable to pay their bills. Scottish Power is owned by Spanish firm Iberdrola and Mr Anderson fears that foreign owned energy suppliers - including EDF, Eon and his own - might struggle to persuade their parent companies to continue to subsidise loss-making UK subsidiaries and exit the UK market. Scottish Power is also concerned that energy companies will sustain further big losses if Ofgem sets the new energy price cap - due to take effect in October - too low. Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply since the all time records set in March. However, many energy companies bought the gas they will supply this winter at prices much higher than current levels. If Ofgem does not recognise this when it sets the new cap, some firms will have to sell at a significant loss threatening them with further distress or collapse which would further destabilise the market, according to Scottish Power. ""We need to find a way to help those that need it in time for winter in a way that doesn't exacerbate the issues we've already seen in the industry with supplier failures and very real concerns about billpayers running up unsustainable debts,"" Mr Anderson continued. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? How high could my energy bills go? Energy suppliers concede that further government support would help them as well as their customers. Meanwhile, government officials privately say that it is hard to distinguish between genuine potential financial distress for the energy companies and intense lobbying. Ofgem responded that it is ""too soon"" to predict the level of the price cap from October. However, it said that new measures earlier this year will allow it in ""exceptional circumstances"", to update the price cap more frequently than once every six months, to ""ensure that the price cap continues to reflect the true cost of supplying energy"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak said people will have to wait until the autumn for any further help with their energy bills. Speaking at an event promoting small businesses in Norwich, Mr Sunak told the BBC the government ""stands ready to do more as the situation requires it"" but said the Treasury would need to wait for ""better clarity on what energy prices will be in the autumn"". What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? How much are energy bills going up?

Nothing off table over NI protocol - Raab,"Dominic Raab said the Northern Ireland Protocol was an ""obstacle to stability"" in the country ""Nothing is off the table"" in the UK's attempt to ""fix"" the Northern Ireland Protocol, Dominic Raab has said. The deputy prime minister told the BBC the protocol was an ""obstacle to stability"" in the country. He was speaking after Sinn FÃ©insecured the most seats in the assembly election, a first for a nationalist party in Northern Ireland. The protocol - agreed between the UK and EU - is a post-Brexit deal aimed at preventing a hard border in Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, but it also creates a new trade border with the rest of the UK. The Democratic Unionist Party, who are opposed to the protocol, arguing it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the union, say they will not allow the formation of a government in Northern Ireland unless there are changes to the deal. The UK government has accused the EU of applying the protocol too rigidly, while Brussels accepts it is causing difficulties for businesses and has proposed a package of measures to reduce its practical impacts. The protocol is opposed by unionists, who argue it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning show, Mr Raab said: ""We cannot have the disruption that we've seen to trade flows between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain and the impact that has on the constitutional integrity of the UK. ""That is itself what is putting at risk the Good Friday Agreement, and we have now got to fix it."" TheGood Friday Agreement was a peace deal signed in 1998 that helped end decades of violence in Northern Ireland. It included setting up a power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly. Mr Raab refused to say whether action on the Northern Ireland Protocol would be included in Tuesday's Queen's Speech. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason understands the government will signal its willingness to change the law on the protocol in the Queen's Speech, without committing to do so immediately. Speaking on BBC Northern Ireland's Sunday Politics, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he will meet with the leaders of the Stormont parties to discuss re-establishing the assembly. Mr Lewis added: ""The UK government's position is we want to secure a deal [on the protocol] with the EU - we're very clear about that. We have worked very hard on that for over a year now across a series of conversations, we made proposals. ""The EU haven't shown any flexibility."" The deadlock could increase tensions with Brussels. Ireland's Europe minister Thomas Byrne called on the UK to ""engage in a renewed way with the European Union"" on the issue. He added that ""a decisive majority"" of assembly members elected to Stormont want to make the protocol work. Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol?

More Britons say they skip meals amid price rises,"More people in the UK are struggling to afford to eat every day as food prices rise, according to research by charity the Food Foundation. Around one in seven adults live in homes where people have skipped meals, reduced meal sizes or gone hungry, an online survey suggested. Food has become more expensive as producers push their rising energy costs on to consumers. Prices are rising by 7% a year in the UK - the highest rate for 30 years. The Bank of England has warned inflation might reach 10% within months, as the rising prices of fuel and food put pressure on household budgets. The Food Foundation also said that people had increasingly opted to take more cold food from food banks because of fears that cooking items would increase their energy costs. Why are prices rising so quickly? Shoppers could face Â£271 rise in annual food bills How high could my energy bills go? The research by YouGov saw 10,674 adults surveyed online between April 22 and 29. It found the number of people struggling to buy food has risen by 57% in three months. Nearly 14% of survey respondents said they or someone in their household had eaten smaller meals or skipped meals because they were not able to afford it during the past month. This was up from 8.8% of the survey respondents in January. Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation said the situation is ""rapidly turning from an economic crisis to a health crisis"" which food banks should not ""possibly be expected to solve"". ""The government needs to realise the boat is sinking for many families and it needs to be fixed. Bailing out with emergency food parcels is not going to work,"" she added. A government spokesman said: ""We recognise the pressures on the cost of living and we are doing what we can to help, including spending Â£22bn across the next financial year to support people with energy bills and cut fuel duty. ""For the hardest hit, we're putting an average of Â£1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families on Universal Credit, have also boosted the minimum wage by more than Â£1,000 a year for full-time workers and our Household Support Fund is there to help with the cost of everyday essentials."" Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""These are devastating findings that reveal the acute levels of hunger impacting families and children nationwide caused by the Conservative cost-of-living crisis."" Prof Sir Michael Marmot, director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity, said the survey's findings suggest society is ""failing in a fundamental way"". ""These figures on food insecurity are all the more chilling because the problem is solvable. But, far from being solved, it is getting worse,"" he added.

Morrisons and EG Group in rival bids for McColl's,"Morrisons now looks set to clinch a last ditch deal to buy the convenience store chain McColl's. The supermarket has been in a two-way battle with EG Group, the Blackburn-based petrol station empire owned by the billionaire Issa brothers. McColl's is poised to go into administration, but in what's known as a pre-pack deal the business will immediately be sold to a new owner. McColl's has more than a thousand small stores and 16,000 workers. No formal announcement has been made but it is understood that Morrisons has secured the winning bid. Morrisons is McColl's key wholesale supplier. It has also formed a tie-up with the chain to convert hundreds of McColl's shops to Morrisons Daily convenience stores. There are already more than 200 operating, and these have been performing well. It emerged last week however that the convenience chain store as a whole was in trouble and close to collapse. That led to a tit-for-tat bidding war over the weekend. Both Morrisons and EG Group filed final offers for the business on Sunday. Key to securing the winning bid has been a willingness to repay McColl's banks around Â£170m, as well as taking on responsibility for the company's pension scheme which has 2,000 members. The trustees of the McColl's pension schemes have written to the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, urging him to do whatever he can to make sure pension scheme members are protected. The convenience store sector as a whole has done relatively well during the pandemic, as people shopped closer to home. However, McColl's has run into difficulties as it attempted to update the range of food it sold, a process made harder by Covid-related supply chain problems.

New UK sanctions for Russia and Belarus,"The new import tariffs proposed by the UK will cover Â£1.4bn of goods, including platinum and palladium The UK has announced a fresh package of sanctions on Russia and Belarus in response to the invasion of Ukraine - targeting Â£1.7bn of trade. The Department for International Trade said new import tariffs will apply to goods including platinum and palladium. The metals are used to make parts for mobile phones and computers Export bans will target chemicals, plastics, rubber and machinery. It takes the value of products subject to UK sanctions to more than Â£4bn. The new import tariffs will cover Â£1.4bn of goods while the planned export bans are intended to impact products worth more than Â£250m in sectors of the Russian economy most dependent on UK goods. The announcement came after G7 leaders held a video call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and theUS and Canada also imposed new sanctions. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: ""We are determined to do our utmost to thwart Putin's aims in Ukraine and undermine his illegal invasion, which has seen barbaric acts perpetrated against the Ukrainian people. ""This far-reaching package of sanctions will inflict further damage on the Russian war machine."" Jill Biden in Ukraine as US unveils new sanctions Dozens feared dead after bomb hits Ukraine school 'Putin now faces only different kinds of defeat' Moscow readies itself for parade and turns up rhetoric Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine is causing suffering on an enormous scale. His barbaric war must be stopped."" He said the new import and export sanctions would do ""significant damage to Putin's war effort"". This third round of trade sanctions announced by the UK government - excluding gold and energy - would see more than 96% of goods imports from Russia hit by restrictions and more than 60% of goods exports to Russia under whole or partial restrictions, said the DIT. The latest move comes as Russiacelebrates Victory Day, the commemoration of the Soviet Victory over Nazi Germany in 1945, which is being marked with the annual military parade in Moscow's Red Square, despite many forces being deployed in Ukraine. The war in Ukraine also means this year's event has taken on different significance, with Vladimir Putin's speech likely to be closely analysed. The latest sanctions were announced on a public holiday in Russia, commemorating the country's victory in World War Two Western countries have introduced increasingly widespread sanctions against Russia - targeting individuals, banks, businesses and major state-owned enterprises, and exports, among others. Among the high-profile individuals to be targeted has been Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea Football Club. Chris Weafer, senior partner at Moscow-based business consultancy Macro Advisory, said sanctions were now starting to have a visible effect. ""These latest sanctions, of themselves, are relatively modest, but of course they add to previous sanctions,"" he told the BBC's Today Programme. ""It is the accumulation of sanctions that really is having the impact on the economy."" Companies are unable to import vital components and spare parts and have used up inventories during the last two months, Mr Weafer said. Some firms were warning of job losses or temporary shutdowns. ""The broader impact on people's incomes and on retail sales and across the broader economy is now starting to be felt,"" he said. ""People have been faced with high, double-digit inflation for the last couple of months. And there's a great deal of uncertainty as to what's going to happen next, particularly with regards to job security and income."" The UK has excluded key Russian banksfrom the UK financial system, frozen the assets of all Russian banks, barred Russian firms from borrowing money, and placed limits on deposits Russians can make at UK banks. Other sanctions have been implemented by the US and the EU. And more than1,000 international companies,externalhave either suspended trading in Russia, or withdrawn altogether - includingMcDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Belarus has been targeted with the UK government saying its leader Alexander Lukashenko had aided and abetted Russia's invasion. SANCTIONS:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?

Jill Biden in Ukraine as US unveils new sanctions,"Olena Zelenska, left, and Jill Biden met at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod US First Lady Jill Biden has met her Ukrainian counterpart Olena Zelenska in Ukraine as Washington announced further sanctions on Moscow. The two first ladies met at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod. It was Mrs Zelenska's first appearance in public since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. The US imposed new sanctions - including visa curbs on 2,600 Russian and Belarusian individuals - in response to the Russian invasion. Three Russian TV stations and executives from Gazprombank were also sanctioned by Washington. Meanwhile, G7 leaders said they were committed to phasing out or banning Russian oil. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" of her US counterpart to visit Ukraine The meeting between the two first ladies took place at a school which is currently being used as a temporary shelter for displaced people. Mrs Biden said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"", adding that the war - now in its third month - had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine while it was at war. She added that the visit, on Mother's Day in Ukraine and in the US, was very symbolic. ""We feel your love and support during such an important day."" The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Justin Trudeau met Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine The announcement of new sanctions came after G7 leaders held a video call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A senior US official said the new US sanctions would hit 27 Gazprombank executives. However, the measures do not freeze the firm's assets or outlaw transactions with it. It is unclear who is on the list of 2,600 Russian and Belarusian individuals to be hit with visa restrictions. How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas? EU divided over how to step away from Russian energy The US announcement came at the end of a day of diplomatic events, which included visits to Ukraine by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the speaker of the German Bundestag and Mrs Biden. Mr Trudeau announced that Canada was sending new weapons and equipment for Ukraine's army, as well as imposing its own range of new sanctions on Russian individuals and companies. ""What Putin needs to understand is that the West is absolutely determined and resolved to stand against what he is doing,"" Mr Trudeau later told Reuters in an interview. ""His illegal war, his escalations, his crossing of red lines by choosing to further invade Ukraine means that we will do as a world everything we can to make sure that he loses."" The UK also announced a fresh package of sanctionson Russia and Belarus, targeting Â£1.7bn ($2.1bn) of trade. The EU is currently finalising a sixth round of sanctions on Russia but has so far been unable to agree on the measures, including a phased ban of Russian oil. Diplomats said Hungary was still preventing progress on finalising the measures. EU countries are split on how soon they can wind down dependence on Russian energy supplies. Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia. The new US and Canadian sanctions were announced on the eve of Victory Day in Russia, which celebrates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. In a statement, the G7 denounced Russia's President Putin, saying that ""his actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people"".

UK announces new sanctions for Russia and Belarus,"The new import tariffs proposed by the UK will cover Â£1.4bn of goods, including platinum and palladium The UK has announced a fresh package of sanctions on Russia and Belarus in response to the invasion of Ukraine - targeting Â£1.7bn of trade. The Department for International Trade said new import tariffs will apply to goods including platinum and palladium. The metals are used to make parts for mobile phones and computers Export bans will target chemicals, plastics, rubber and machinery. It takes the value of products subject to UK sanctions to more than Â£4bn. The new import tariffs will cover Â£1.4bn of goods while the planned export bans are intended to impact products worth more than Â£250m in sectors of the Russian economy most dependent on UK goods. The announcement came after G7 leaders held a video call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and theUS and Canada also imposed new sanctions. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: ""We are determined to do our utmost to thwart Putin's aims in Ukraine and undermine his illegal invasion, which has seen barbaric acts perpetrated against the Ukrainian people. ""This far-reaching package of sanctions will inflict further damage on the Russian war machine."" Jill Biden in Ukraine as US unveils new sanctions Dozens feared dead after bomb hits Ukraine school 'Putin now faces only different kinds of defeat' Moscow readies itself for parade and turns up rhetoric Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine is causing suffering on an enormous scale. His barbaric war must be stopped."" He said the new import and export sanctions would do ""significant damage to Putin's war effort"". This third round of trade sanctions announced by the UK government - excluding gold and energy - would see more than 96% of goods imports from Russia hit by restrictions and more than 60% of goods exports to Russia under whole or partial restrictions, said the DIT. The latest move comes as Russiacelebrates Victory Day, the commemoration of the Soviet Victory over Nazi Germany in 1945, which is being marked with the annual military parade in Moscow's Red Square, despite many forces being deployed in Ukraine. The war in Ukraine also means this year's event has taken on different significance, with Vladimir Putin's speech likely to be closely analysed. The latest sanctions were announced on a public holiday in Russia, commemorating the country's victory in World War Two Western countries have introduced increasingly widespread sanctions against Russia - targeting individuals, banks, businesses and major state-owned enterprises, and exports, among others. Among the high-profile individuals to be targeted has been Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea Football Club. Chris Weafer, senior partner at Moscow-based business consultancy Macro Advisory, said sanctions were now starting to have a visible effect. ""These latest sanctions, of themselves, are relatively modest, but of course they add to previous sanctions,"" he told the BBC's Today Programme. ""It is the accumulation of sanctions that really is having the impact on the economy."" Companies are unable to import vital components and spare parts and have used up inventories during the last two months, Mr Weafer said. Some firms were warning of job losses or temporary shutdowns. ""The broader impact on people's incomes and on retail sales and across the broader economy is now starting to be felt,"" he said. ""People have been faced with high, double-digit inflation for the last couple of months. And there's a great deal of uncertainty as to what's going to happen next, particularly with regards to job security and income."" The UK has excluded key Russian banksfrom the UK financial system, frozen the assets of all Russian banks, barred Russian firms from borrowing money, and placed limits on deposits Russians can make at UK banks. Other sanctions have been implemented by the US and the EU. And more than1,000 international companies,externalhave either suspended trading in Russia, or withdrawn altogether - includingMcDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Belarus has been targeted with the UK government saying its leader Alexander Lukashenko had aided and abetted Russia's invasion. SANCTIONS:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?

'We tried not to watch': Terror in Russian-occupied city,"Many people in Izyum retreated to basements, to avoid bombardment and soldiers ""We thought those were our last minutes. It was extremely scary but we were lucky."" Elena is recalling the moment Russian troops started shelling, after she and a group of escapees passed through one of their checkpoints. After two months living in the basement of a kindergarten in the Russian-occupied town of Izyum in Ukraine, Elena spent two nerve-shredding days on the road to safety. She and her daughter were among 20 people in a convoy of vehicles heading away from Russian-controlled territory. They fled last Friday using a route organised by volunteers. ""All that time we were praying,"" said Elena, 52, recounting how they passed through numerous Russian checkpoints. When troops asked them where they were going, the group convinced the soldiers they were headed for Russia. At one checkpoint, Elena said, Russians looked through her daughter's phone, and became angry when they saw messages to her friends about the situation in Izyum. Finally the pair reached safety in Poltava, a city in central Ukraine. But she said she felt as though she'd lost everything and couldn't forget the horror of what she went through in her home city after the start of the war. ""Bodies were lying for weeks in the streets. We tried not to watch them in order to save our minds. We couldn't bury dead people because it equalled being killed as well. The shelling was non-stop,"" she said. Elena and others in the basement had cooked food on a fire and lived off vegetables collected from their gardens. ""Everyone brought everything they had. We all shared food,"" she said. ""It helped us not to lose hope."" She adds that Russian troops were looting everything, including people's underwear. Soldiers drove around the city in stolen cars with ""Z"" signs painted on them, she recalled. ""They were armed and often very drunk. It was very scary when an armoured personnel carrier was driving on your street and soldiers with machine guns were sitting in it. We tried to hide."" Situated south-east of Kharkiv, the city of Izyum is known as the gateway to the Donbas - Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing region, more than a third of which was seized by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014. It is surrounded by forests and rivers, which make it a natural fortress. And within the city boundaries is the Kremenets mountain, which is 218m (715ft) above sea level. ""Whoever has control of this mountain has a significant military advantage,"" said Maxym Strelnik, an official of Izyum city council. All this made the city an important prize and soon after the Kremlin's invasion, it came under heavy bombardment. On 1 April,  Russia seized control and has occupied the city since. Now, Mr Strelnik, who was told by the Ukrainian military to leave the area, estimates that 80% of the city has been destroyed. Between 10,000 and 15,000 civilians remain in Izyum, he believes. ""There is no water, electricity, gas, heating and the sewage system doesn't work,"" he said. In March, during the initial stages of the invasion, people were forced to stay in their freezing basements without heating. Those who fell ill were unable to get medical treatment. ""We cannot even estimate how many victims there are in the city. There are no medical facilities or funeral services. The dead are buried near houses and in the city parks. It's a horrible reality,"" he said. Among those still trapped in Izyum is the mother of Katerina, who escaped with her husband and two children at the beginning of March. ""She calls me from time to time - sometimes once a week,"" Katerina said. ""Even now when I'm safe, I can't feel 100% fine because my mum is left in a town that doesn't exist."" By the time Katerina got out, it was too late for her mother, who lived in a part of Izyum then already occupied by the Russians. She was forbidden to leave her house by soldiers. Katerina's own escape was a harrowing experience. The family had been sheltering together in their basement for seven days when a Russian bomb fell just 500 metres from their house. ""The ground started to fall from the ceiling,"" she told the BBC. ""I started to understand then that our basement would not withstand the bombs."" She and her family had just 15 minutes to prepare to leave. They took very little - only children's clothes. Even the family pets had to be left behind. As they left, she said, she could hear shells above her head. ""The feeling of hearing them will be impossible to get rid of."" Up to 80% of the city has been destroyed, says one official Mr Strelnik has stayed close to Izyum, albeit in a zone still under Ukrainian control, to ensure he can try to help the people still inside. But communication with them is incredibly hard. For the past seven days, there has been no mobile phone connection between the town and the outside world. The families of those still inside are desperate to hear from them, he says. The lack of mobile coverage has also made life difficult for Volodymyr Zelensky - not Ukraine's president, but an ordinary citizen of the same name who has been volunteering to help those inside the city get out. During brief spells when a signal was available, relatives informed those still inside about evacuation buses which collected residents from small villages on the outskirts of the city. ""We evacuated about 200 people,"" said Mr Zelenskyy. ""People were very emotional when they got to the evacuation points. They didn't have a hope for weeks and finally when they saw us, they thought that we were their saviours."" But he said the rescue effort was dangerous work. ""The last time our volunteers extracted people from [the nearby village of] Spyvakiva, they were shot by Russian snipers. Three people were killed and three people were wounded,"" he said. The BBC has been unable to independently verify this claim. Both Katerina and Elena count themselves lucky they were able to escape Izyum when they did. But their memories of home in peacetime are haunting. Katerina remembers the place which she says had everything she needed, including parks for children. ""It was so cute, so cosy, like a small fluffy pillow, that feels like your mother hugging you,"" she said. Elena misses the days when she would plant flowers in the garden with her granddaughter. ""We did not realise how lucky we were,"" she said. ""Now I realise I was living in a paradise."" SANCTIONS:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?

Morrisons tabling new bid for McColl's,"Morrisons now looks set to clinch a last ditch deal to buy the convenience store chain McColl's. The supermarket has been in a two-way battle with EG Group, the Blackburn-based petrol station empire owned by the billionaire Issa brothers. McColl's is poised to go into administration, but in what's known as a pre-pack deal the business will immediately be sold to a new owner. McColl's has more than a thousand small stores and 16,000 workers. No formal announcement has been made but it is understood that Morrisons has secured the winning bid. Morrisons is McColl's key wholesale supplier. It has also formed a tie-up with the chain to convert hundreds of McColl's shops to Morrisons Daily convenience stores. There are already more than 200 operating, and these have been performing well. It emerged last week however that the convenience chain store as a whole was in trouble and close to collapse. That led to a tit-for-tat bidding war over the weekend. Both Morrisons and EG Group filed final offers for the business on Sunday. Key to securing the winning bid has been a willingness to repay McColl's banks around Â£170m, as well as taking on responsibility for the company's pension scheme which has 2,000 members. The trustees of the McColl's pension schemes have written to the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, urging him to do whatever he can to make sure pension scheme members are protected. The convenience store sector as a whole has done relatively well during the pandemic, as people shopped closer to home. However, McColl's has run into difficulties as it attempted to update the range of food it sold, a process made harder by Covid-related supply chain problems.

Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on...

Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

McColl's new owners pressed to back staff pensions,"Morrisons now looks set to clinch a last ditch deal to buy the convenience store chain McColl's. The supermarket has been in a two-way battle with EG Group, the Blackburn-based petrol station empire owned by the billionaire Issa brothers. McColl's is poised to go into administration, but in what's known as a pre-pack deal the business will immediately be sold to a new owner. McColl's has more than a thousand small stores and 16,000 workers. No formal announcement has been made but it is understood that Morrisons has secured the winning bid. Morrisons is McColl's key wholesale supplier. It has also formed a tie-up with the chain to convert hundreds of McColl's shops to Morrisons Daily convenience stores. There are already more than 200 operating, and these have been performing well. It emerged last week however that the convenience chain store as a whole was in trouble and close to collapse. That led to a tit-for-tat bidding war over the weekend. Both Morrisons and EG Group filed final offers for the business on Sunday. Key to securing the winning bid has been a willingness to repay McColl's banks around Â£170m, as well as taking on responsibility for the company's pension scheme which has 2,000 members. The trustees of the McColl's pension schemes have written to the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, urging him to do whatever he can to make sure pension scheme members are protected. The convenience store sector as a whole has done relatively well during the pandemic, as people shopped closer to home. However, McColl's has run into difficulties as it attempted to update the range of food it sold, a process made harder by Covid-related supply chain problems.

New questions over Starmer event after memo leaked,"Sir Keir Starmer is facing further questions over whether he broke Covid lockdown rules at an MP's office in Durham, amid reports a leaked Labour memo suggested time was set aside for him to eat dinner with colleagues. Durham police are investigating last April's event, when the Labour leader had beer and curry with others. TheMail on Sunday published what it said was a memo,externalshowing timings for ""dinner"", before the visit would end. Sir Keir insists no rules were broken. A Labour spokesperson said he had eaten ""between work demands"". A party source added that it would be ""wrong to assume"" activities during the visit occurred at the times originally planned. Starmer investigated over alleged lockdown breach Rayner was at lockdown event with Starmer Keir Starmer's Durham drink - what were the rules? Sir Keir was filmed drinking a bottle of beer in the constituency office of Durham MP Mary Foy last year, in the run-up to a by-election in nearby Hartlepool. The Labour leader has maintained the visit was a work event, and that the food and drink was consumed in between doing work, so was within the rules. But the internal planning document for the Durham trip apparently showed how an hour and twenty minutes were scheduled for ""dinner"" - after which, the visit would conclude. The memo said a takeaway order would be placed by a member of Sir Keir's office from a nearby Indian restaurant for a meal between 20:40 and 22:00. Covid rules in place at the time meant it was illegal for people in England to socialise indoors with people from outside their household or support bubble. There was an exemption for ""work purposes"", although working from home was recommended in the guidance, but the rules did not mention socialising at work. Describing the meal earlier this week, Sir Keir said that ""at various points people went through to the kitchen, got a plate, had something to eat, and got on with their work"". He has also previously insisted he returned to work afterwards. Last week, Labour said Angela Raynerwas also at the event, after previously denying she was there. It blamed a ""mistake"" in communication. The real reason all this matters is less about what happened a year ago. And rather more about what Sir Keir Starmer has said since. He has repeatedly expressed his outrage - shared by millions - at the behaviour of the prime minister and others in government in breaking the Covid rules. And he's repeatedly called for Boris Johnson to resign. Now his critics say if you get on a moral high horse, it might turn into a bucking bronco if you've broken the rules yourself. Ministers I've spoken to are cock-a-hoop at this latest twist in this long running row about political conduct during Covid. The Labour leader finds himself in a very perilous position. Asked whether he would resign if fined, Sir Keir told reporters on Saturday: ""I was working in the office. We stopped for something to eat. There was no party"". He said he would not resign and would lead Labour into the next general election. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Sir Keir should consider his position as Labour leader if he is fined by police for breaking Covid laws. Ms Abbott told LBC radio that she didn't think he would be fined, and criticised ""hype built up by the Tory press"". But she added that if he did receive a fixed penalty notice, he would have to ""consider his position"". She insisted she was a ""loyal supporter"" of Sir Keir's, and was simply making a ""common-sense point"". This video can not be played Watch: Footage shows Sir Keir Starmer drinking beer with colleagues in Durham on 30 April 2021 Durham police hadinitially decided no offence had occurredafter reviewing footage from the gathering earlier this year. But after Thursday's local elections concluded, the force announced it would launch an investigation after receiving ""significant new information"". The force had been coming under pressure to revisit the matter after Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined for attending a birthday party for the prime minister in Downing Street in June 2020. Conservative MPs have also been calling for the force to launch a formal probe in recent days. Sir Keir has urged Mr Johnson to resign since January, when the prime minister became embroiled in accusations Covid rules were broken during gatherings held in Whitehall during lockdown. The Metropolitan Police are continuing their investigation into 12 gatherings held in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office during 2020 and 2021. Asked what Sir Keir should do if he is fined, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told Times Radio: ""We've got to let the police carry out their investigation and that's only right and responsible. ""I do think, though, that the public will be uncomfortable with the hypocrisy. ""He has tweeted himself saying that if you're under investigation, a criminal investigation, then you should resign.""

Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate.

terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

Sinn FÃ©in win: What happens now in Northern Ireland?,"Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill (centre) is hoping to be the first nationalist politician to become NI's first minister The results of the Northern Ireland Assembly election are in and, for the first time ever, Sinn FÃ©in has won the most seats. It's the first time ever that a nationalist party has been the largest at Stormont in terms of seats, 101 years after Northern Ireland came into existence. It edged out the DUP, which is now the second-largest party. Alliance also had a historic result, winning 17 seats to become the third-largest party in the assembly. So what happens next and what does it mean for the future of devolved government in Northern Ireland and for Northern Ireland itself? Not necessarily. Underthe power-sharing system of government in Northern Ireland, the largest unionist and nationalist parties must share the first minister and deputy first minister's post, while the other ministerial positions are allocated among the biggest parties based on how many seats they have in the assembly. As the largest party, the rules say that Sinn FÃ©in is the party entitled to hold the position. But the roles of first minister and deputy first minister are equal - despite their names - and one cannot hold office without the other. So in order for Sinn FÃ©in to hold the first minister position, the biggest party from the unionist bloc - the DUP - must agree to take up the deputy first minister's position. On Monday,DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would not do sountil his party's concerns about the post-Brexit trading arrangements contained in the Northern Ireland Protocol were resolved. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (centre) withdrew Paul Givan (left) as NI's first minister in February in protest against the NI Protocol Sir Jeffrey is opposed to the protocol and withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in February in protest against it. The protocol isthe part of the Brexit deal which applies to Northern Irelandand is designed to avoid a hard border between it and the Republic of Ireland. It means checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, something unionists say undermines Northern Ireland's place in the union. Even though the difference between the first minister and deputy first minister positions is in name only, Sinn FÃ©in will draw a big symbolic boost from being entitled to hold the post. For its first 50 years, Northern Ireland was ruled exclusively by unionists, and since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 a unionist politician has always been first minister. The new assembly will meet on Friday and will elect a Speaker, who will then ask the parties for their nominations for first minister and deputy first minister. If the DUP nominates a deputy first minister, then an executive can be formed and other ministers can be chosen. If it does not, then the process is more uncertain. The DUP cannot nominate Sir Jeffrey, as he has stepped away from Stormont to remain as an MP at Westminster. He said he would not return to Stormont until his concerns with the protocol had been resolved. HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:Who is Michelle O'Neill? RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland Because of new rules which were brought in earlier in the year, the assembly will continue to exist in a caretaker capacity and the other ministers who were in place before the election - such as the health and education ministers - can stay in place. This could continue for up to six months, while there would be negotiations to try to find a solution to the DUP's refusal to nominate a deputy first minister. After six months, a fresh election could be called or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis, would have to come up with an alternative solution. Sinn FÃ©in's Mary-Lou McDonald (right) says planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"" During the election campaign Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said that people were not ""waking up thinking about Irish unity"" and stressed that issues such as the cost-of-living crisis were bigger priorities. But Sinn FÃ©in remains committed to holding a referendum on Irish unification, and its manifesto called on the British and Irish governments to set a date for a border poll. On Friday party leader Mary Lou McDonald said planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"". The rules around holding a referendum are set out in the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace agreement which ended the worst of the Troubles and set up the Northern Ireland Assembly. It says the UK government's secretary of state for Northern Ireland can hold a referendum at any time. In addition it says he or she should call one if it appears a majority of voters would vote in favour of Irish unification. Sinn FÃ©in is likely to argue that things are moving in that direction, but unionists will argue that the nationalist vote share has gone down since 2017 and that shows there is no desire for a border poll. Opinion polls have also not shown a majority in favour of a united Ireland. The growth in support for the Alliance Party, which does not take a position on the topic of Irish unity, also complicates the issue. Northern Ireland's devolved administration at Stormont - known as the executive - is made up of the first minister and deputy first minister and eight other ministers. It's known as a mandatory coalition, which means the largest parties are all entitled to at least one ministry. A mathematical formula decides how many ministries they are entitled based on the number of seats they won. However for an executive to be formed it would require the DUP to fill the deputy first minister's post. You can read more about the power-sharing systemhere. The Alliance Party has won its biggest ever share of the first preference vote in a Northern Ireland Assembly election with 13.5% and also a record number of seats - 17. The party, which was founded in 1970, won just eight seats at the last election in 2017, but it had good results in the European, council and Westminster elections of 2019 and has continued the trend this year. The Alliance Party, led by Naomi Long seen in the centre here with victorious candidates, made big gains in the election The party defines itself as being neither unionist or nationalist and aims to win votes from across Northern Ireland's traditional political divides. The result is also a sign that more voters are moving away from the traditional unionist and nationalist blocs. Alliance is likely to increase its calls for changes to how the system at Stormont works. For example it wants the executive to become a voluntary coalition. This would be a major change to the Good Friday Agreement and would require lengthy negotiations with the British and Irish governments and the other Northern Ireland parties.

A shock to the system for DUP but unsurprising,"DUP leader Sir Jeffrey arrives at Meadowbank count centre Last year Northern Ireland marked its centenary. An anniversary regarded by unionists as a cause for celebration, the creation of a life raft for those intent on preserving their British identity as the rest of the island broke away from the UK. However nationalists viewed the moment as a time to deeply regret the partition of Ireland they hope will one day be reversed. Unionists wanted a memorial stone erected at Stormont, but Sinn FÃ©in said no. In their view there's already quite enough unionist statues and plaques scattered around the estate. For 100 years, the words Stormont and unionism have tripped off the tongue together. Sinn FÃ©in's rise from IRA politics to biggest party NI election in maps and charts The old unionist-dominated parliament was suspended in the early years of the Troubles and unionists had to be carried out of it loudly protesting. The newpower-sharing administrationushered in bythe Good Friday Agreementproved a very different beast. Even so, in the quarter of a century since then a unionist always occupied the first minister's position, first via the Ulster Unionist David Trimble, then courtesy of Ian Paisley and his Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) successors. Under the 1998 deal, Stormont's power couple were elected as a team. But when the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in agreed to share power in 2007, those rules were changed to enable automatic appointments to be made based on party strengths. That opened the door to Michelle O'Neill's latest potential promotion. How does power-sharing work in Northern Ireland? It's true the powers and responsibilities of the first and deputy first ministers are exactly the same, but you can point that out in vain. Northern Ireland is a place where titles and symbolism count. For the DUP, the election outcome is a shock to the system. But it's hardly surprising after all its internal bloodletting over thecontroversial post-Brexit trading arrangementswhich put a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Treating Northern Ireland as, economically, another country from the rest of the UK was always going to raise unionist hackles. The DUP were kingmakers after the 2017 General Election - but those days are long ago First Arlene Foster and then Edwin Poots fell from grace, leaving Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to pick up the pieces. The DUP's halcyon days, when its MPs held the Westminster balance of power, seem long ago, even though the choices made then sowed the seeds which Sir Jeffrey is reaping now. The DUP and unionism in general will take some time to absorb this election outcome. It may take weeks or months to find a formula which assuages unionist concerns over the Brexit protocol while keeping the election victors, Sinn FÃ©in, onside. Expect a tug-of-war between those unionists and loyalists who insist only a hard line will deliver the complete removal of the protocol, and those prepared to settle for pragmatic fixes. Edwin Poots was elected in South Belfast, Sir Jeffrey in Lagan Valley Beyond these immediate protocol concerns, unionism is struggling with a long-term picture in which demographic trends have led to a growing nationalist community. Moreover many younger voters find the DUP's stances on social, cultural and identity issues unattractive and are increasingly rejecting traditional orange and green politics altogether. Although the DUP now represents only 21% of the vote, unionism as a whole still accounts for just over 40%. But nationalism is also on roughly 40%, while the centre-ground Alliance Party makes up the vast bulk of the other 20% - potentially a key swing vote in any future referendum on Irish unity. Unionists can no longer stroll around Stormont as if they own the place, as they did in the early decades of the parliament. Michelle O'Neill (left) and Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary-Lou McDonald - it's been a historic election for the party Some who once scorned the Good Friday Agreement are now glad it incorporated minority safeguards, but annoyed they weren't applied to the protocol. Although a border poll on Irish unity remains some considerable way off, the future of unionism seems uncertain. Disputes over the first minister's job title, or whether a plaque or a memorial stone is installed somewhere, may in time be the least of their worries.

Sinn FÃ©in wins most seats in historic NI election,"Sinn FÃ©in, led by Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald, want Northern Ireland to leave the UK and reunite with the Republic of Ireland Sinn FÃ©in will be the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time, pushing the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) into second place. Sinn FÃ©in has 27 seats, compared to the DUP's 25. The result means Michelle O'Neill will be entitled to become first minister - unprecedented for a nationalist. Earlier, Ms O'Neill said it had been an election of ""real change"" and a ""defining moment for our politics and for our people"". ""Today ushers in a new era which I believe presents us all with an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality and on the basis of social justice,"" she continued. This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has described her party's performance as a ""defining moment"" ""My commitment is to work through partnership, not division,"" Ms O'Neill said after she was elected in Mid Ulster. ""We will work with those who serve all other political perspectives, we will show respect and we expect to be shown respect."" A unionist party has had the most seats at Stormont since Northern Ireland was formed in 1921. The cross-community Alliance Party has returned 17 MLAs, more than doubling its previous number in 2017. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost one MLA to return with nine, while the SDLP's seats fell from 12 to eight. Counting in the Foyle constituency continued into a third day, with the DUP's Gary Middleton the last assembly member elected in the early hours of Sunday. Thirty-two of the MLAs elected are women, compared with 27 who were returned in the last election. The Alliance Party gained a seat in Belfast South, with Kate Nicholl (left) and Paula Bradshaw (right) elected Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he would meet with the party leaders over the coming days with the aim of restoring the Stormont institutions ""at the earliest possible moment"". ""I encourage the parties to form an executive as soon as possible. The people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable local government that delivers on the issues that matter most to them,"" he said. In February, the executive collapsed when DUP assembly member Paul Givanresigned as first minister. As the first and deputy first minister roles are part of a joint office, the move also removed Michelle O'Neill from her position. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said a new power-sharing executive was ""vital for progress and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland"". ""It is now incumbent on all political parties and elected representatives to deliver on their mandate, through the nomination of a first and deputy first minister and the formation of a new executive to serve the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland."" The US State Department called for the parties ""to take the necessary steps to re-establish a power-sharing executive"". ""Critical and immediate challenges concerning the economy, health, and education are best addressed through the collective efforts of a devolved government chosen by, and accountable to, its people,"" said Ned Price. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he has not decided whether the party will nominate a deputy first minister Although Sinn FÃ©in can now nominate a first minister, they cannot take up the office unless the DUP, the biggest party from the unionist bloc, agrees to nominate a deputy first minister. Its leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has not yet made a decision on whether the party will do that. On Saturday, the DUP leader said his party would respect the result of the election, however, there needed to be changes made to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is an element of the UK's Brexit agreement with the European Union which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. Some unionists have said the protocol created a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The ultimate goal of Sinn FÃ©in is for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and become one country with the Republic of Ireland. But a victory for Sinn FÃ©in in this election does not mean a vote on Irish reunification - also known as a border poll - would be imminent. TheNorthern Ireland Act 1998,external- which followed the signing of the Good Friday Agreement - stated that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and ""shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll"". It also stated that the Northern Ireland Secretary would agree to hold a poll if it appeared likely that a majority of people wanted a united Ireland. Successive opinion polls suggest that is not yet the case, with the most recent, published in April, putting support at about a third. On Saturday, when asked about the prospect of a border poll, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary-Lou McDonald said unionists should not be ""scared"". ""The future is bright for all of us,"" she added. While Sinn FÃ©in was reluctant to promote its border poll ambitions during the election campaign, expect it to be back on the agenda now. But the party said it will be a decade-long plan at least which will only come after an island-wide conversation. The decision to hold a border poll is for the Northern Ireland secretary of state, when he or she feels there is more of an appetite for Irish unity. But you may now find talk of a border poll will slowly fade if a power-sharing executive returns and no votes are on the line.

""I'm also hugely blessed to be leading a party of the calibre of Alliance with people who are so dedicated, so committed and so selfless in their service,"" she said. UUP leader Doug Beattie, speaking after he was elected in Upper Bann, said he had no plans to change course after his party failed to grow its support. ""I will continue to promote positive, confident, optimistic unionism,"" he explained. After Sinn FÃ©in's result was confirmed, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated the party on a ""historic vote"". Allow Twitter content?

Gerry Carroll, of People Before Profit, was elected in Belfast West, while independents were elected in East Londonderry and North Down. SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon, the party's representative on the executive as infrastructure minister, lost her seat in North Belfast. Ms Mallon's party leader, Colum Eastwood, said there was nothing ""fair"" about her result and she would be a ""huge loss for us, but a bigger loss for the people of north Belfast"". There were other high profile casualties, including Roy Beggs of the UUP and former Education Minister Peter Weir, of the DUP, who were members of the first assembly in 1998. The DUP's Mervyn Storey, another former minister, failed to be elected along with the SDLP policing board member Dolores Kelly. The Green Party lost its two MLAs, including leader Clare Bailey.

Who is Michelle O'Neill?,"Michelle O'Neill says the election results represent a significant moment of change Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill is on the cusp of becoming the first nationalist to hold the role of first minister in the history of Northern Ireland. It will be a historic moment for Northern Ireland and too for Sinn FÃ©in, which has won the greatest number of seats in the assembly. It's the first time that a nationalist party will be the largest since the creation of Northern Ireland a century ago. Ms O'Neill, the party's vice-president, said the result presents ""an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality and on the basis of social justice"". Party leader Mary Lou McDonald hailed news of Sinn FÃ©in's achievement as significant - and not just because of the symbolic change. ""It's significant because it's a moment of equality,"" she said. ""It says there's no job that's beyond anybody's reach."" The young Michelle might have found that hard to believe in May 1993. As the IRA edged towards the end of its so-called ""armed struggle"", she found herself pregnant at 16 years old. In an interviewwith the Irish Times,externallast year, she said she had ""very, very negative"" experiences as a teenage single mother. ""I went to a Catholic grammar. You were nearly made to feel girls like you can't be at school,"" she said. But in the end, she said the experience made her ""a stronger woman"". She went back to school, took her A-levels, stormed ahead. Michelle O'Neill arrives to cast her vote at the Clonoe polling station on Thursday 5 May Strong women are what the new Northern Ireland is about. In this year's election, a record number of women - 87 - stood. At the first election in 1998, just 14 women were elected. Among them was Monica McWilliams from the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition. ""I felt like I had to put on body armour because there were so few women there,"" she remembered. Sometimes, when she stood up to speak, there were repeated cries of ""Moo, moo, moo"" to drown out her words. The moos have been consigned to history. Ms O'Neill grew up steeped in the history of Northern Ireland's Troubles. Born Michelle Doris on 10 January 1977, she was raised in the village of Clonoe in rural County Tyrone and hails from a family of prominent Irish republicans. Her father,Brendan Doris, was a former IRA prisoner who became a Sinn FÃ©in councillor in Dungannon. Her uncle, Paul Doris, was president of Noraid, a republican fundraising group. When the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998, she began working for the party. It brought her into direct contact with Martin McGuinness, who at that time was running for election in the Mid Ulster constituency. When her father stepped down from Dungannon Borough Council ahead of the 2005 election, Ms O'Neill won the seat he vacated. She became the first woman to hold the post of mayor in Dungannon. Her assembly career began in 2007, when she joined Martin McGuinness and Francie Molloy as a Mid Ulster MLA. She became her party's spokeswoman for health and sat on the education committee. Michelle O'Neill rose to the role of agriculture minister before becoming health minister in 2016 After four years on the back benches at Stormont, Sinn FÃ©in appointed her as minister for agriculture in 2011. In 2015, she was promoted to minister for health, one of Stormont's most high-profile and challenging portfolios. She faced mounting hospital waiting lists, a crisis in general practice and the findings of the Bengoa report into how Northern Ireland's health care is organised. Her response was a10-year plan to transform health service, saying it would improve a system that was at ""breaking point"". When Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in 2017 over the DUP's handling of theRenewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal, it led to a political stalemate at Stormont for three years. When he died soon afterwards, she was chosen to lead the party in Northern Ireland - a younger face and, significantly, a woman like her counterpart in the Republic, Mary Lou McDonald. Michelle O'Neill carries the coffin of the late Martin McGuinness in 2017 Now, the pinnacle of Northern Ireland politics, the role of first minister, is within her grasp. Michelle O'Neill (left, with her party leader Mary-Lou McDonald) says the vote has ""ushered in a new era"" The office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one, but the allocation of titles is symbolically important. Few are expecting a power-sharing devolved government to be formed in the short term. The DUP is reiterating that it plans to block the formation of a new Stormont Executive unless the Brexit trade border with the rest of the UK is scrapped. Significantly, during the election campaign, Michelle O'Neill's focus has not been on Irish unity and talk of a border poll.

Stormont vote in maps and charts,"Counting is nearing the finish line in the Northern Ireland Assembly election,with Sinn FÃ©in set to win the largest number of seats for the first time. The DUP is set for second place while the Alliance Party is on course to become the third-largest party in the assembly. Turnout (63.6%) was only slightly down on the 64.8% recorded in the last assembly election in 2017. Sinn FÃ©in saw its first preference vote share rise by 1.1% as it repeated its impressive performance from 2017. Meanwhile the DUP's vote dropped by 6.7% and Alliance's rose by 4.5%. Full results for allNorthern Ireland,externalseats are expected later on Saturday. The results reflect a growing trend for Alliance in recent years, while the DUP's rapid rise at the start of the century tailed off before experiencing a significant drop. Support for the SDLP and UUP has fallen more steadily. 462 of 462 seats counted.Counting complete. Parties - and independents - in the Northern Ireland Assembly designate as unionist, nationalist or other. Unionists want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, while nationalists want Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to unite as one country. Parties which have designated as other have held various views. Alliance does not take a position on Irish unity, while People Before Profit supports a referendum on Irish unity and would campaign for unity if one was called. At this election the proportion of seats won by other parties rose significantly, up to 18 from the 11 won at the last election - 20% of the total seats. Of those seats, 17 were won by Alliance and one by People Before Profit. Both unionism and nationalism lost seats. Unionism, dropped by three seats to 37 - 41% - while nationalism fell from 39 to 35 seats  - 39% of the total. Women are still outnumbered almost two-to-one in the assembly, but a record number were elected this time around. In total 32 female candidates were returned to sit on the blue benches at Stormont. It is a big change from the first election where more than 75% of assembly members were male. This election also sawa record number of female candidates.

What next for NI after election?,"Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill (centre) is hoping to be the first nationalist politician to become NI's first minister The results of the Northern Ireland Assembly election are in and, for the first time ever, Sinn FÃ©in has won the most seats. It's the first time ever that a nationalist party has been the largest at Stormont in terms of seats, 101 years after Northern Ireland came into existence. It edged out the DUP, which is now the second-largest party. Alliance also had a historic result, winning 17 seats to become the third-largest party in the assembly. So what happens next and what does it mean for the future of devolved government in Northern Ireland and for Northern Ireland itself? Not necessarily. Underthe power-sharing system of government in Northern Ireland, the largest unionist and nationalist parties must share the first minister and deputy first minister's post, while the other ministerial positions are allocated among the biggest parties based on how many seats they have in the assembly. As the largest party, the rules say that Sinn FÃ©in is the party entitled to hold the position. But the roles of first minister and deputy first minister are equal - despite their names - and one cannot hold office without the other. So in order for Sinn FÃ©in to hold the first minister position, the biggest party from the unionist bloc - the DUP - must agree to take up the deputy first minister's position. On Monday,DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would not do sountil his party's concerns about the post-Brexit trading arrangements contained in the Northern Ireland Protocol were resolved. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (centre) withdrew Paul Givan (left) as NI's first minister in February in protest against the NI Protocol Sir Jeffrey is opposed to the protocol and withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in February in protest against it. The protocol isthe part of the Brexit deal which applies to Northern Irelandand is designed to avoid a hard border between it and the Republic of Ireland. It means checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, something unionists say undermines Northern Ireland's place in the union. Even though the difference between the first minister and deputy first minister positions is in name only, Sinn FÃ©in will draw a big symbolic boost from being entitled to hold the post. For its first 50 years, Northern Ireland was ruled exclusively by unionists, and since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 a unionist politician has always been first minister. The new assembly will meet on Friday and will elect a Speaker, who will then ask the parties for their nominations for first minister and deputy first minister. If the DUP nominates a deputy first minister, then an executive can be formed and other ministers can be chosen. If it does not, then the process is more uncertain. The DUP cannot nominate Sir Jeffrey, as he has stepped away from Stormont to remain as an MP at Westminster. He said he would not return to Stormont until his concerns with the protocol had been resolved. HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:Who is Michelle O'Neill? RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland Because of new rules which were brought in earlier in the year, the assembly will continue to exist in a caretaker capacity and the other ministers who were in place before the election - such as the health and education ministers - can stay in place. This could continue for up to six months, while there would be negotiations to try to find a solution to the DUP's refusal to nominate a deputy first minister. After six months, a fresh election could be called or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis, would have to come up with an alternative solution. Sinn FÃ©in's Mary-Lou McDonald (right) says planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"" During the election campaign Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said that people were not ""waking up thinking about Irish unity"" and stressed that issues such as the cost-of-living crisis were bigger priorities. But Sinn FÃ©in remains committed to holding a referendum on Irish unification, and its manifesto called on the British and Irish governments to set a date for a border poll. On Friday party leader Mary Lou McDonald said planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"". The rules around holding a referendum are set out in the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace agreement which ended the worst of the Troubles and set up the Northern Ireland Assembly. It says the UK government's secretary of state for Northern Ireland can hold a referendum at any time. In addition it says he or she should call one if it appears a majority of voters would vote in favour of Irish unification. Sinn FÃ©in is likely to argue that things are moving in that direction, but unionists will argue that the nationalist vote share has gone down since 2017 and that shows there is no desire for a border poll. Opinion polls have also not shown a majority in favour of a united Ireland. The growth in support for the Alliance Party, which does not take a position on the topic of Irish unity, also complicates the issue. Northern Ireland's devolved administration at Stormont - known as the executive - is made up of the first minister and deputy first minister and eight other ministers. It's known as a mandatory coalition, which means the largest parties are all entitled to at least one ministry. A mathematical formula decides how many ministries they are entitled based on the number of seats they won. However for an executive to be formed it would require the DUP to fill the deputy first minister's post. You can read more about the power-sharing systemhere. The Alliance Party has won its biggest ever share of the first preference vote in a Northern Ireland Assembly election with 13.5% and also a record number of seats - 17. The party, which was founded in 1970, won just eight seats at the last election in 2017, but it had good results in the European, council and Westminster elections of 2019 and has continued the trend this year. The Alliance Party, led by Naomi Long seen in the centre here with victorious candidates, made big gains in the election The party defines itself as being neither unionist or nationalist and aims to win votes from across Northern Ireland's traditional political divides. The result is also a sign that more voters are moving away from the traditional unionist and nationalist blocs. Alliance is likely to increase its calls for changes to how the system at Stormont works. For example it wants the executive to become a voluntary coalition. This would be a major change to the Good Friday Agreement and would require lengthy negotiations with the British and Irish governments and the other Northern Ireland parties.

"Sinn FÃ©in wins most seats in historic NI electionThe party has won 27 seats in the Stormont assembly election, while the DUP returned with 25.","Sinn FÃ©in, led by Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald, want Northern Ireland to leave the UK and reunite with the Republic of Ireland Sinn FÃ©in will be the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time, pushing the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) into second place. Sinn FÃ©in has 27 seats, compared to the DUP's 25. The result means Michelle O'Neill will be entitled to become first minister - unprecedented for a nationalist. Earlier, Ms O'Neill said it had been an election of ""real change"" and a ""defining moment for our politics and for our people"". ""Today ushers in a new era which I believe presents us all with an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality and on the basis of social justice,"" she continued. This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has described her party's performance as a ""defining moment"" ""My commitment is to work through partnership, not division,"" Ms O'Neill said after she was elected in Mid Ulster. ""We will work with those who serve all other political perspectives, we will show respect and we expect to be shown respect."" A unionist party has had the most seats at Stormont since Northern Ireland was formed in 1921. The cross-community Alliance Party has returned 17 MLAs, more than doubling its previous number in 2017. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost one MLA to return with nine, while the SDLP's seats fell from 12 to eight. Counting in the Foyle constituency continued into a third day, with the DUP's Gary Middleton the last assembly member elected in the early hours of Sunday. Thirty-two of the MLAs elected are women, compared with 27 who were returned in the last election. The Alliance Party gained a seat in Belfast South, with Kate Nicholl (left) and Paula Bradshaw (right) elected Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he would meet with the party leaders over the coming days with the aim of restoring the Stormont institutions ""at the earliest possible moment"". ""I encourage the parties to form an executive as soon as possible. The people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable local government that delivers on the issues that matter most to them,"" he said. In February, the executive collapsed when DUP assembly member Paul Givanresigned as first minister. As the first and deputy first minister roles are part of a joint office, the move also removed Michelle O'Neill from her position. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said a new power-sharing executive was ""vital for progress and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland"". ""It is now incumbent on all political parties and elected representatives to deliver on their mandate, through the nomination of a first and deputy first minister and the formation of a new executive to serve the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland."" The US State Department called for the parties ""to take the necessary steps to re-establish a power-sharing executive"". ""Critical and immediate challenges concerning the economy, health, and education are best addressed through the collective efforts of a devolved government chosen by, and accountable to, its people,"" said Ned Price. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he has not decided whether the party will nominate a deputy first minister Although Sinn FÃ©in can now nominate a first minister, they cannot take up the office unless the DUP, the biggest party from the unionist bloc, agrees to nominate a deputy first minister. Its leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has not yet made a decision on whether the party will do that. On Saturday, the DUP leader said his party would respect the result of the election, however, there needed to be changes made to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is an element of the UK's Brexit agreement with the European Union which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. Some unionists have said the protocol created a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The ultimate goal of Sinn FÃ©in is for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and become one country with the Republic of Ireland. But a victory for Sinn FÃ©in in this election does not mean a vote on Irish reunification - also known as a border poll - would be imminent. TheNorthern Ireland Act 1998,external- which followed the signing of the Good Friday Agreement - stated that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and ""shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll"". It also stated that the Northern Ireland Secretary would agree to hold a poll if it appeared likely that a majority of people wanted a united Ireland. Successive opinion polls suggest that is not yet the case, with the most recent, published in April, putting support at about a third. On Saturday, when asked about the prospect of a border poll, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary-Lou McDonald said unionists should not be ""scared"". ""The future is bright for all of us,"" she added. While Sinn FÃ©in was reluctant to promote its border poll ambitions during the election campaign, expect it to be back on the agenda now. But the party said it will be a decade-long plan at least which will only come after an island-wide conversation. The decision to hold a border poll is for the Northern Ireland secretary of state, when he or she feels there is more of an appetite for Irish unity. But you may now find talk of a border poll will slowly fade if a power-sharing executive returns and no votes are on the line. Read more from Enda on Sinn FÃ©in's journey from political pariahs to Stormont power brokershere. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said she was ""hugely proud"" of what the party had achieved. ""I'm also hugely blessed to be leading a party of the calibre of Alliance with people who are so dedicated, so committed and so selfless in their service,"" she said. UUP leader Doug Beattie, speaking after he was elected in Upper Bann, said he had no plans to change course after his party failed to grow its support. ""I will continue to promote positive, confident, optimistic unionism,"" he explained. After Sinn FÃ©in's result was confirmed, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated the party on a ""historic vote"". Allow Twitter content?

From IRA politics to NI's biggest party The election in maps and charts Despite seeing a surge in vote share, the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) returned one MLA, its leader Jim Allister. Gerry Carroll, of People Before Profit, was elected in Belfast West, while independents were elected in East Londonderry and North Down. SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon, the party's representative on the executive as infrastructure minister, lost her seat in North Belfast. Ms Mallon's party leader, Colum Eastwood, said there was nothing ""fair"" about her result and she would be a ""huge loss for us, but a bigger loss for the people of north Belfast"". There were other high profile casualties, including Roy Beggs of the UUP and former Education Minister Peter Weir, of the DUP, who were members of the first assembly in 1998. The DUP's Mervyn Storey, another former minister, failed to be elected along with the SDLP policing board member Dolores Kelly. The Green Party lost its two MLAs, including leader Clare Bailey.

It's been a momentous election, with Sinn FÃ©in winning the largest number of seats for the first time, returning 27 candidates, the same number as the last assembly election. The DUP slipped into second place with 25, but the big gains were for Alliance, which won 17 seats - more than double the eight it won in 2017. The UUP dropped by one seat to nine, the SDLP lost four to drop to eight. TUV and People Before Profit each had one candidate elected. Two independent unionists were also elected, while the Green Party lost both its seats. What happens next is not clear. Sinn FÃ©in can nominate a first minister to lead the Northern Ireland Executive, but as it's a joint office a first minister can not exist without a deputy first minister. The DUP can nominate a deputy first minister, but party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has already said he will not nominate any ministers without changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. There will be more reaction on BBC One Northern Ireland and iPlayer from 10am with Sunday Politics, and from the same time on BBC Radio Ulster there will be an election special. You can catch up with that later on BBC Sounds as well. That's all from us, goodnight.  On the 13th count Gary Middleton of the DUP has been re-elected in Foyle. It brings to an end more than two days of counting. Mr Middleton has served as a junior minister in the executive and was first elected for Foyle in 2016, having been co-opted the year before.

Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor There was a time in Northern Ireland when Sinn FÃ©in voices were silenced. Banned from the airwaves by the government to combat IRA propaganda. The BBC even employed an actor to voice the words of the then Sinn FÃ©in President Gerry Adams. But this weekend Sinn FÃ©in voices were in high demand as broadcasters scrambled to get them on air. They all wanted to hear from the one-time political pariahs who are now the political powerbrokers at Stormont. And pose the question: Does its victory push Northern Ireland closer to a border poll and possibly Irish unity? Read more here.

From political pariahs to Stormont powerbrokersWhat next for NI after Sinn FÃ©in's election win?Who is Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill?What are the election results in my area?,"Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill (second left) with party leader Mary Lou McDonald and returning assembly members Emma Sheerin (left) and Linda Dillon (far right) There was a time in Northern Ireland when Sinn FÃ©in voices were silenced. Banned from the airwaves by the government to combat IRA propaganda. The BBC even employed an actor to voice the words of the then Sinn FÃ©in President Gerry Adams. But this weekend Sinn FÃ©in voices were in high demand as broadcasters scrambled to get them on air. They all wanted to hear from the one-time political pariahs who are now the political powerbrokers at Stormont. And pose the question: Does its victory push Northern Ireland closer to a border poll and possibly Irish unity? Sinn FÃ©in wins most seats in historic NI election NI election in maps and charts Northern Ireland constituency results Communication is no longer a problem for Sinn FÃ©in as its message struck a chord with a quarter of a million voters. But the timing was key. Sinn FÃ©in firstly played down the prospects of being the largest party, mindful of overplaying its hand too early. But the party ramped it up the week before the poll, even pushing Michelle O'Neill as a ""first minister for all"" in a presidential-style pitch. Though much of the ground work paving the way for Sinn FÃ©in's success was already laid by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The slogan - vote Jeffrey to avoid getting Michelle - worked for both parties. Jeffrey Donaldson won't say if he will rubberstamp Michelle O'Neill's appointment to the first minister role It energised some DUP voters to stick with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, despite what the polls predicted. But crucially it also stoked nationalist voters to row in behind Sinn FÃ©in like never before to push unionists off the Stormont summit for the first time. Though the swing behind Sinn FÃ©in came at a high cost to the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as it lost four seats leaving it on an all-time low of just eight. The party's deputy leader Nicola Mallon is among the casualties. SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon lost her seat A divided unionist vote also cleared the way for Sinn FÃ©in, which returned with the same number of seats it held going into the poll. The party is now entitled to the keys of the first minister's office. Though it comes with no extra power, the post has huge symbolic significance for unionists who've held it for 24 years. But Michelle O'Neill will only get the keys to her new office if the DUP agree to her nomination. Sir Jeffrey says he will respect the outcome of the poll - but he has so far refused to confirm if he will rubberstamp Michelle O'Neill's appointment by accepting the post of deputy first minister. Michelle O'Neill at the party's manifesto launch with leader Mary Lou McDonald Until he does, the Stormont stalemate will continue, with no power-sharing executive. That means the outgoing caretaker ministers will continue to run departments. But with no overarching executive, their powers will be limited. They won't be able to use a Â£300m pot to help families deal with the cost of living crisis, although the DUP insists the money can be handed out. The parties have six months to agree a new power-sharing executive and history tells us they are likely to take every minute. But if the executive returns then it will have a new look courtesy of the Alliance surge. Newly-elected Alliance assembly member EÃ³in Tennyson celebrates with party leader Naomi Long The party with 17 seats will be entitled to two ministerial posts which is likely to include the justice portfolio. It is also likely the SDLP and Ulster Unionists will end up on the opposition benches, leaving just three parties in the executive. That will change the dynamic but will it mean better delivery and fewer stand-offs? It has been a bruising election for the DUP and Ulster Unionists with a drop in their vote and seats. UUP leader Doug Beattie retained his seat - but it's been a disappointing election for his party Though the Traditional Unionist Voice party (TUV) broke new ground, increasing its vote by more than 5%, it failed to secure transfers to add to the sole seat held by party leader Jim Allister. His party's increase appears to have come from disillusioned DUP voters whose votes then transferred back to Sir Jeffrey's party. Irish unity It's a move which the DUP says played into the hands of Sinn FÃ©in and no doubt it will be used to warn unionist voters again. The DUP warning about Sinn FÃ©in using its new Stormont status to push for a border poll will also be tested before the next poll. While Sinn FÃ©in was reluctant to promote its border poll ambitions during the election campaign, expect it to be back on the agenda now. But the party says it will be a decade-long plan at least which will only come after an island-wide conversation. The decision to hold a border poll is for the Northern Ireland secretary of state, when he or she feels there is more of an appetite for Irish unity. But you may now find talk of a border poll will slowly fade if a power-sharing executive returns and no votes are on the line. Though the 2022 assembly election will be remembered for the Sinn FÃ©in breakthrough and Alliance advance, it may also mark a turning point in how Stormont functions - if and when it fully returns.

What next for NI after Sinn FÃ©in's election win?Who is Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill?What are the election results in my area?,"Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill (centre) is hoping to be the first nationalist politician to become NI's first minister The results of the Northern Ireland Assembly election are in and, for the first time ever, Sinn FÃ©in has won the most seats. It's the first time ever that a nationalist party has been the largest at Stormont in terms of seats, 101 years after Northern Ireland came into existence. It edged out the DUP, which is now the second-largest party. Alliance also had a historic result, winning 17 seats to become the third-largest party in the assembly. So what happens next and what does it mean for the future of devolved government in Northern Ireland and for Northern Ireland itself? Not necessarily. Underthe power-sharing system of government in Northern Ireland, the largest unionist and nationalist parties must share the first minister and deputy first minister's post, while the other ministerial positions are allocated among the biggest parties based on how many seats they have in the assembly. As the largest party, the rules say that Sinn FÃ©in is the party entitled to hold the position. But the roles of first minister and deputy first minister are equal - despite their names - and one cannot hold office without the other. So in order for Sinn FÃ©in to hold the first minister position, the biggest party from the unionist bloc - the DUP - must agree to take up the deputy first minister's position. On Monday,DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would not do sountil his party's concerns about the post-Brexit trading arrangements contained in the Northern Ireland Protocol were resolved. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (centre) withdrew Paul Givan (left) as NI's first minister in February in protest against the NI Protocol Sir Jeffrey is opposed to the protocol and withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in February in protest against it. The protocol isthe part of the Brexit deal which applies to Northern Irelandand is designed to avoid a hard border between it and the Republic of Ireland. It means checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, something unionists say undermines Northern Ireland's place in the union. Even though the difference between the first minister and deputy first minister positions is in name only, Sinn FÃ©in will draw a big symbolic boost from being entitled to hold the post. For its first 50 years, Northern Ireland was ruled exclusively by unionists, and since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 a unionist politician has always been first minister. The new assembly will meet on Friday and will elect a Speaker, who will then ask the parties for their nominations for first minister and deputy first minister. If the DUP nominates a deputy first minister, then an executive can be formed and other ministers can be chosen. If it does not, then the process is more uncertain. The DUP cannot nominate Sir Jeffrey, as he has stepped away from Stormont to remain as an MP at Westminster. He said he would not return to Stormont until his concerns with the protocol had been resolved. HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:Who is Michelle O'Neill? RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland Because of new rules which were brought in earlier in the year, the assembly will continue to exist in a caretaker capacity and the other ministers who were in place before the election - such as the health and education ministers - can stay in place. This could continue for up to six months, while there would be negotiations to try to find a solution to the DUP's refusal to nominate a deputy first minister. After six months, a fresh election could be called or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis, would have to come up with an alternative solution. Sinn FÃ©in's Mary-Lou McDonald (right) says planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"" During the election campaign Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said that people were not ""waking up thinking about Irish unity"" and stressed that issues such as the cost-of-living crisis were bigger priorities. But Sinn FÃ©in remains committed to holding a referendum on Irish unification, and its manifesto called on the British and Irish governments to set a date for a border poll. On Friday party leader Mary Lou McDonald said planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"". The rules around holding a referendum are set out in the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace agreement which ended the worst of the Troubles and set up the Northern Ireland Assembly. It says the UK government's secretary of state for Northern Ireland can hold a referendum at any time. In addition it says he or she should call one if it appears a majority of voters would vote in favour of Irish unification. Sinn FÃ©in is likely to argue that things are moving in that direction, but unionists will argue that the nationalist vote share has gone down since 2017 and that shows there is no desire for a border poll. Opinion polls have also not shown a majority in favour of a united Ireland. The growth in support for the Alliance Party, which does not take a position on the topic of Irish unity, also complicates the issue. Northern Ireland's devolved administration at Stormont - known as the executive - is made up of the first minister and deputy first minister and eight other ministers. It's known as a mandatory coalition, which means the largest parties are all entitled to at least one ministry. A mathematical formula decides how many ministries they are entitled based on the number of seats they won. However for an executive to be formed it would require the DUP to fill the deputy first minister's post. You can read more about the power-sharing systemhere. The Alliance Party has won its biggest ever share of the first preference vote in a Northern Ireland Assembly election with 13.5% and also a record number of seats - 17. The party, which was founded in 1970, won just eight seats at the last election in 2017, but it had good results in the European, council and Westminster elections of 2019 and has continued the trend this year. The Alliance Party, led by Naomi Long seen in the centre here with victorious candidates, made big gains in the election The party defines itself as being neither unionist or nationalist and aims to win votes from across Northern Ireland's traditional political divides. The result is also a sign that more voters are moving away from the traditional unionist and nationalist blocs. Alliance is likely to increase its calls for changes to how the system at Stormont works. For example it wants the executive to become a voluntary coalition. This would be a major change to the Good Friday Agreement and would require lengthy negotiations with the British and Irish governments and the other Northern Ireland parties.

Who is Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill?What are the election results in my area?,"Michelle O'Neill says the election results represent a significant moment of change Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill is on the cusp of becoming the first nationalist to hold the role of first minister in the history of Northern Ireland. It will be a historic moment for Northern Ireland and too for Sinn FÃ©in, which has won the greatest number of seats in the assembly. It's the first time that a nationalist party will be the largest since the creation of Northern Ireland a century ago. Ms O'Neill, the party's vice-president, said the result presents ""an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality and on the basis of social justice"". Party leader Mary Lou McDonald hailed news of Sinn FÃ©in's achievement as significant - and not just because of the symbolic change. ""It's significant because it's a moment of equality,"" she said. ""It says there's no job that's beyond anybody's reach."" The young Michelle might have found that hard to believe in May 1993. As the IRA edged towards the end of its so-called ""armed struggle"", she found herself pregnant at 16 years old. In an interviewwith the Irish Times,externallast year, she said she had ""very, very negative"" experiences as a teenage single mother. ""I went to a Catholic grammar. You were nearly made to feel girls like you can't be at school,"" she said. But in the end, she said the experience made her ""a stronger woman"". She went back to school, took her A-levels, stormed ahead. Michelle O'Neill arrives to cast her vote at the Clonoe polling station on Thursday 5 May Strong women are what the new Northern Ireland is about. In this year's election, a record number of women - 87 - stood. At the first election in 1998, just 14 women were elected. Among them was Monica McWilliams from the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition. ""I felt like I had to put on body armour because there were so few women there,"" she remembered. Sometimes, when she stood up to speak, there were repeated cries of ""Moo, moo, moo"" to drown out her words. The moos have been consigned to history. Ms O'Neill grew up steeped in the history of Northern Ireland's Troubles. Born Michelle Doris on 10 January 1977, she was raised in the village of Clonoe in rural County Tyrone and hails from a family of prominent Irish republicans. Her father,Brendan Doris, was a former IRA prisoner who became a Sinn FÃ©in councillor in Dungannon. Her uncle, Paul Doris, was president of Noraid, a republican fundraising group. When the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998, she began working for the party. It brought her into direct contact with Martin McGuinness, who at that time was running for election in the Mid Ulster constituency. When her father stepped down from Dungannon Borough Council ahead of the 2005 election, Ms O'Neill won the seat he vacated. She became the first woman to hold the post of mayor in Dungannon. Her assembly career began in 2007, when she joined Martin McGuinness and Francie Molloy as a Mid Ulster MLA. She became her party's spokeswoman for health and sat on the education committee. Michelle O'Neill rose to the role of agriculture minister before becoming health minister in 2016 After four years on the back benches at Stormont, Sinn FÃ©in appointed her as minister for agriculture in 2011. In 2015, she was promoted to minister for health, one of Stormont's most high-profile and challenging portfolios. She faced mounting hospital waiting lists, a crisis in general practice and the findings of the Bengoa report into how Northern Ireland's health care is organised. Her response was a10-year plan to transform health service, saying it would improve a system that was at ""breaking point"". When Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in 2017 over the DUP's handling of theRenewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal, it led to a political stalemate at Stormont for three years. When he died soon afterwards, she was chosen to lead the party in Northern Ireland - a younger face and, significantly, a woman like her counterpart in the Republic, Mary Lou McDonald. Michelle O'Neill carries the coffin of the late Martin McGuinness in 2017 Now, the pinnacle of Northern Ireland politics, the role of first minister, is within her grasp. Michelle O'Neill (left, with her party leader Mary-Lou McDonald) says the vote has ""ushered in a new era"" The office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one, but the allocation of titles is symbolically important. Few are expecting a power-sharing devolved government to be formed in the short term. The DUP is reiterating that it plans to block the formation of a new Stormont Executive unless the Brexit trade border with the rest of the UK is scrapped. Significantly, during the election campaign, Michelle O'Neill's focus has not been on Irish unity and talk of a border poll. She argued that people were not waking up thinking about Irish unity, but instead were worried about the cost of living crisis. What she wants to do, she added, was to ""work for everybody"".
