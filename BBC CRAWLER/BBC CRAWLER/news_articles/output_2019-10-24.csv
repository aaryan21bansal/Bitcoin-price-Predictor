"QuickQuid, UK's biggest payday lender, to closeThousands of its customers had unresolved complaints about unaffordable payday loans.Business","The UK's biggest remaining payday loan provider is to close, with thousands of complaints about its lending still unresolved. QuickQuid's owner, US-based Enova, says it will leave the UK market ""due to regulatory uncertainty"". Compensation claims have been made from customers who said they were given loans they could not afford to repay. It is the latest firm offering short-term, high-interest loans to close after regulations were tightened. QuickQuid has been the biggest payday lender in the UK for the past few years. It was bigger than household name Wonga even before the latter folded in August last year. The Money Shop closed earlier this year. Kenneth Barker took out 11 consecutive loans in less than a year when he was a barman in Essex in 2012. ""The initial one was for Â£100. I paid back Â£160, but then needed a Â£150 loan to tide me over for the next month. It gradually worsened,"" said the 28-year-old, who now lives in Leeds. ""To be honest, I knew what I was getting myself into, but sometimes you don't have any other choice."" He submitted a complaint nine months ago, claiming he was given unaffordable loans, and was offered Â£50 in compensation by the company. He said: ""I then went to the financial ombudsman. That was accepted and I was offered Â£2,000. I was told I'd get it within 28 days. I'm hoping I will still get that money! ""I have no idea how this is going to proceed or whether I will receive this money."" Despite waiting for his compensation, he said he was pleased that a business such as QuickQuid would be closing. QuickQuid is one of the brand names of CashEuroNet UK, which also runs On Stride - a provider of longer-term, larger loans and previously known as Pounds to Pocket. ""Over the past several months, we worked with our UK regulator to agree upon a sustainable solution to the elevated complaints to the UK Financial Ombudsman, which would enable us to continue providing access to credit,"" said Enova boss David Fisher. ""While we are disappointed that we could not ultimately find a path forward, the decision to exit the UK market is the right one for Enova and our shareholders."" New rules brought in five years ago limited the interest rates and fees payday lenders can charge and introduced enhanced affordability checks. Since then there has been a wave of complaints from customers who say they were mis-sold loans they could not afford. QuickQuid has been facing as many as 10,000 or more outstanding complaints from borrowers. Such legacy loan complaints, many of which came via claims management companies, were the key reason for the demise of Wonga last year. The closure of QuickQuid might lead some to think their loan is invalid - but it is not. ""While you may be tempted to stop your repayments, it is crucial to keep to your regular schedule, because if you have entered into a loan agreement you must fulfil it,"" said Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service. ""If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating."" Those who are owed money in compensation must wait to see what the next move is for the business. The Money Advice Service website hasa guide on alternatives to payday loans,external. As well as historic complaints, QuickQuid was also the subject of compensation claims for more recent loans. The UK's Financial Ombudsman Service said that it had received 3,165 cases against CashEuroNet in the first half of the year. It was the second most-complained about company in the banking and credit sector during that six months. The ombudsman upheld 59% of cases against the company during the same period, but a backlog of cases is thought to have built up.

Pence criticises NBA as 'wholly-owned' by China,"This video can not be played Mr Pence lashed out at US companies and accused China of ""exporting censorship"" US Vice-President Mike Pence has criticised the US National Basketball Association (NBA) in a speech attacking Chinese diplomatic and trade policies. He accused both the NBA and the sports firm Nike of ""kowtowing"" to Beijing and ""muzzling"" criticism of China. Hours later, Beijing hit back at Mr Pence, saying the US should ""cease expressing irresponsible opinions"". It comes in the wake of a diplomatic row over an NBA team manager's support for anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong. NBA facing 'substantial' losses over China dispute How one tweet derailed the NBA's China game plan In the speech in Washington DC late on Thursday, Mr Pence also said Chinese policy was growing ""more aggressive and destabilising"". ""In siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly-owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,"" the vice-president said. But on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying accused Mr Pence of ""arrogance and hypocrisy"", according to news agency AFP. Ms Hua added the US should ""cease actions that harm the relations and mutual trust between the two countries"". The China-NBA row began early this month with a tweet - since deleted - by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey expressing support for the Hong Kong protesters. It sparked furious reactions in China, where the NBA has a mass following that provides substantial revenue. NBA products were taken off shelves and games were boycotted by Chinese state TV. The NBA released two statements on the tweet - the first one distancing itself from Mr Morey - turning a Chinese backlash into an American backlash as well. In his remarks, Mr Pence accused the Chinese government of trying to ""influence the public debate here in America"" by ""trying to export censorship"". He also accused Beijing of ""exploiting corporate greed"" of American companies hoping to do business in China. ""Nike promotes itself as a so called 'social-justice champion,' but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,"" he said. ""Nike stores in China actually removed their Houston Rockets merchandise from their shelves to join the Chinese government in protest against the Rockets general manager's seven-word tweet: 'Fight for Freedom, stand with Hong Kong.'"" Some of the NBA's biggest players and owners who routinely exercise their freedom to criticise the US are silent on other people's rights, he said. President Donald Trump and his administration have previously criticised Nike over its decision to support Colin Kaepernick, an American football player who controversially knelt as the US national anthem was played ahead of NFL games. Trump weighs in over Kaepernick advert Trump condemns NFL anthem protest Mr Pence also called on China to show more respect for the rights of its minority citizens. The speech came after Congress voted on laws to support Hong Kong protesters. Beijing has indicated ""strong countermeasures"" if the White House allows the bill to become law. The latest row between Washington and Beijing also comes amid efforts by the US and China to end their trade war. In his speech, Mr Pence said the US was ""not seeking to contain China's development"". ""We want a constructive relationship with China's leaders,"" he added. Yao Ming played for the Houston Rockets between 2002 and 2011 boosting the team's popularity in China Basketball is the most popular sport in China with 300 million people playing the game, according to the NBA. The NBA has had a presence in China since 1992 when it opened its first office in Hong Kong.

"Boy, 10, scrambles 300ft down mountain to help mum","This video can not be played The boy's mother was airlifted off the mountain A 10-year-old boy climbed down a 328ft (100m) ravine to reach his mother who had fallen during a mountain climb. The family, which also included two girls, aged five and nine, ended up on very steep ground after taking a wrong turn on Ben Cruachan near Dalmally. The mother fell and landed on a ledge with a ""large drop"" below, resulting in her suffering serious injuries. An Oban Mountain Rescue Facebook post said the boy rang emergency services with his mother's phone. He also stayed with her and kept talking to her to prevent her losing consciousness. Meanwhile, his father, whose phone is understood to have been out of charge, was looking after his two sisters. The mountain rescue team were called out at about 19:50 on Monday. The accident had happened as the family descended the 3,694ft (1,126m) mountain. The family were descending Ben Cruachan when the woman fell The boy had managed to give police a description of the location and luckily the family had a torch so were reached by mountain rescue in about 30 minutes and a rescue helicopter was called in. The mountain rescue post said: ""It takes a while to deal with this sort of situation and the lady was very lucky she stopped where she did as a large drop awaited below. After her injuries were treated the best we could in the situation, she was ready to winch. All the while the lad was with his mum talking to her."" The woman was airlifted to hospital at about 23:00 while the mountain rescue team helped the rest of the family off the mountain. The mountain rescue spokesman added: ""This was a superb effort by all the Oban MRT team members and Rescue 199 in dealing with a technical rescue on steep ground in the dark. It was challenging to access, difficult medically and a challenging lift for the helicopter."" He said the boy was a ""brave lad who should get an award for his actions"". ""Just getting to his mum was hard, then looking after his mother in an extreme situation, talking to the police and keeping calm  - he was amazing,"" the spokesman added. The woman is said to be ""out of danger and comfortable"" in hospital.

Dunn family to take Foreign Office to court,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo The family of Harry Dunn is to begin legal action against the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Harry, 19, died outside RAF Croughton in a crash with a car owned by US citizen Anne Sacoolas, who later left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity. Earlier the Dunn family held a meeting with human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC. Family spokesperson Radd Seiger told Sky News: ""The first action we will be taking is against the FCO."" An FCO spokeswoman said: ""We have done everything we can properly to clear a path so that justice can be done for Harry's family. ""As the foreign secretary set out in Parliament, the individual involved had diplomatic immunity whilst in the country under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."" The FCO said it would respond to any legal action in due course. Radd Seiger (centre) said Harry Dunn's parents have met lawyers in London Mr Seiger said: ""We will be shortly issuing a letter of claim which is a prelude to a judicial review. ""We are absolutely clear that the Foreign Office's decision to advise Northamptonshire Police that Mrs Sacoolas had the benefit of diplomatic immunity was unlawful and we will be seeking a judicial review of that decision to have it quashed."" He also appealed for Mrs Sacoolas ""to come back to this country and face the music"". The family has also referred Northamptonshire Police to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). A Northamptonshire Police spokeswoman said the force would be happy to support the IOPC with any concerns raised by the family. On Tuesday, Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley said Mrs Sacoolas would beinterviewed under cautionin the US. Officers are waiting for the necessary visas. Harry Dunn crash: What is diplomatic immunity? Dunn crash death suspect 'expected to be charged' Dunn crash suspect to be quizzed under caution Mr Seiger said the force had ""not disclosed all the information this family are entitled to"". ""We have deep concerns about the manner in which this investigation was conducted, and simply adding insult to injury to this family at their darkest hour,"" he added. Mr Adderley had previously said Northamptonshire Police had at all times ""acted with the utmost integrity and transparency"". Mr Seiger said: ""This family have a steely determination about them to ensure that Harry has not died in vain. ""I think the whole nation, the whole world now, is looking at this set of circumstances and it isn't right."" Mr Dunn's motorbike was in a collision outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. He later died in hospital. Mrs Sacoolas' husband Jonathan is a US intelligence official who was working at the base at the time of the crash. Both the British and US governments agree that by returning to the US Mrs Sacoolas forfeited the right to diplomatic immunity.

"Supercuts picks administrators risking 1,200 jobs","The owner of the Supercuts and Regis hairdressing chains, Regis UK, has appointed administrators, putting 1,200 jobs at risk. Accountants Deloitte have been called in to look for options for the 220-salon business. The salons will remain open while a buyer is sought for the business. Deloitte said changes in consumer behaviour had led to lower footfall in shopping centres where many of the salons are located. ""The retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging and Regis UK Limited had been seeking to address this through a restructuring of its business,"" said Rob Harding, joint administrator. Last year, Regis UK negotiated a cut in the rent it paid through a legal process known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), but landlords challenged the proposals in court. High Street woes mount as 85,000 jobs feared lost High Street: How many UK shops have closed? BonmarchÃ© appoints administrators Increasing numbers of retailers have sought CVAs in an attempt to spread the impact of the downturn, as consumers shift from the High Street to online shopping. CVAs allow companies to seek rent reductions and new debt repayment terms, but are meeting increasing opposition from landlords. Regis said at the time that a ""perfect storm"" of factors, including falling customer numbers and higher wages, had hurt the business. Deloitte said the chains would continue trading while options for the business were explored. ""The group operates two very strong brands and we are working with all key stakeholders to stabilise the situation and provide the best solution possible,"" said Mr Harding.

Coldplay reveal new album tracks in local paper,"Everyday Life appeared on page 31 of Wednesday's Daily Post Coldplay have apparently revealed the tracks of their latest album in the classified adverts of a local newspaper. An advert for Everyday Life sat alongside ones for a fridge-freezer, bales of hay and a divan bed in north Wales'Daily Post,external. On Mondaythe band announced their latest album in a letter to a fan. Lead guitarist Jonny Buckland, who grew up in Flintshire, tweeted he once had a holiday job at the newspaper. Similar adverts have appeared in newspapers in England - inExeter's Express and Echo,external, which is lead singer Chris Martin's hometown, andSouthampton's Daily Echo,external, where drummer Will Champion is from.

""To be honest, it's a brilliant bit of marketing by Coldplay, to get everyone talking about their new album and the track listing. ""Maybe someone from the record company, maybe Jonny Buckland himself phoned up the adverts team and placed the advert."" Coldplay are the biggest-selling British band of the 21st Century, with three of the top 20 best-selling albums since 2000, according to the Official Charts Company.

Smart motorways to be reviewed over safety fears,"Some smart motorways use the hard shoulder at all times while others use it during busy times Smart motorways are to be reviewed following concerns over driver safety, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shapps told MPs: ""We know people are dying on smart motorways"". He said recommendations are expected ""in a matter of weeks"" to ensure all motorways are ""as safe as they possibly can be"". Earlier this week, Highways England boss Jim O'Sullivanwarned""dynamic"" smart motorways are ""too complicated"" for drivers. Mr O'Sullivan said he did not think he would build any more dynamic smart motorways because too many motorists do not understand them. Smart motorways 'too confusing for drivers' 'Stop smart motorway rollout', say MPs Hard shoulder warning after smart motorway death How smart are smart motorways? There are two types of smart motorway in the UK: The first is where the hard shoulder is opened to traffic when it is busy, and the second is where the hard shoulder is open all the time. Theyalready account for about 400 miles of England's roads, including sections of major motorways like the M1, M6, and M62. They were created to ease congestion, using computers to monitor the roads and change speed limits. Critics have called for smart motorways to be scrapped over safety concerns and several deaths. Eight-year-old Dev Naranwas killed on the M6 last Maywhen a lorry struck his grandfather's Toyota while it was pulled up on the hard shoulder, which was in use. Dev Naran sustained a fatal head injury in the crash Speaking to MPs on the Commons Transport Select Committee, Mr Shapps said: ""I have asked my department to carry out at pace an evidence stock-take to gather the facts quickly and make recommendations."" He said his department would lead the review ""because some of the statistics have been difficult to understand, and we know people are dying on smart motorways"". He added: ""Understanding whether they are less safe, the same or safer - it turns out not to be as straightforward as members might imagine - I want all of those facts and recommendations that can be put into place to ensure that all of our motorways are as safe as they possibly can be. ""I will get this done in a matter of weeks."" Derek Jacobs, 83, was killed when his car was hit after it stopped on a smart motorway section of the M1 in Derbyshire. His death came six months after another woman was killed after a breakdown on the same section of road. Jason Mercer, 44, died on the M1 near Sheffield, where the hard shoulder is an active lane. He was involved in a minor collision but when he got out his car to exchange details he and the other driver were hit by a lorry. Both died at the scene.

39 found dead in lorry were Chinese nationals,"This video can not be played Thirty nine bodies were found in the trailer container The 39 people found dead in a refrigerated trailer in Essex were Chinese nationals. Police have been granted an extra 24 hours to question lorry driver Mo Robinson, 25, on suspicion of murdering the eight women and 31 men. Three properties in Northern Ireland have been raided and the National Crime Agency is working to establish if ""organised crime groups"" were involved. The trailer arrived in Purfleet on the River Thames from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Ambulance staff discovered the bodies in the container at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays just after 01:30 BST on Wednesday. The lorry and trailer left the port at Purfleet shortly after 01:05. Police said the tractor unit - the front part of the lorry - entered the country via Holyhead in Wales on Sunday, having travelled from Dublin. Speaking after a magistrate granted Essex Police more time to question Mr Robinson on Thursday, Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said her priority was ""preserving the dignity of the 39 people who have died and ensuring that we get answers for their loved ones"". The lorry driver has been named locally as Mo Robinson, from County Armagh Councillor Paul Berry said the village of Laurelvale in County Armagh, where the Robinson family live, was in ""complete shock"". He said he had been in contact with Mr Robinson's father, who had learned of his son's arrest on Wednesday through social media. ""The local community is hoping that he [Mo Robinson] has been caught up innocently in this matter but that's in the hands of Essex Police, and we will leave it in their professional hands to try to catch the perpetrators of this,"" he said. The lorry has been moved to a secure site at Tilbury Docks and police are due to begin the process of moving the bodies to a mortuary at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. They will be taken by private ambulance so that post-mortem examinations can take place, with the force expecting all the bodies to have been moved by the weekend. Global Trailer Rentals Ltd confirmed to RTE News,externalthat it owned the trailer and said it had leased it on 15 October. The firm said it had given Essex Police the details of the person and company they had leased it to. This video can not be played ""I've seen people running out of a lorry"" Essex Police said it was the largest murder investigation in the force's history and the victims were all ""believed to be Chinese nationals"". It said formal identification of the 39 people, one of whom is a young adult woman, ""could be a lengthy process"". China's ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaomingtweeted that the embassy had read the reports of the deaths,external""with heavy hearts"" and was in close contact with British police. Lucy Moreton, from the Immigration Services Union, said the sheer number of containers coming into the UK every day made it impossible to look inside them all. ""We don't have the facility to check the vast majority of freight which arrives in the UK, whether it moves or not,"" she said. She said disconnected freight containers were less likely to be searched unless there was ""intelligence to the contrary that suggests we need to do that"". A book of condolences has been opened at Thurrock Council Police initially suggested the lorry could be from Bulgaria, but later said officers believed it entered the UK from Belgium. A spokesman for the Bulgarian foreign affairs ministry said the truck was registered in the country under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen. The Belgian Federal Public Prosecutor's Office said the container arrived in Zeebrugge at 14:29 on Tuesday and left the port later that afternoon. It was not clear when the victims were placed in the container or if this happened in Belgium, a spokesman said. Essex lorry deaths: What we know How are lorries checked for concealed migrants? 'I almost suffocated in the back of a lorry' A spokesman for C.RO Ports, which operates terminals at Purfleet and Zeebrugge, said they would ""fully assist"" the police investigation. Shaun Sawyer, the National Police Chiefs Council lead for modern slavery and human trafficking, said while forces had prevented thousands of deaths, ""tragically, for 39 people that didn't work yesterday"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programmeeven if there were routes perceived as easier to get through, organised criminals would still exploit people who could not access those. This video can not be played CCTV shows the lorry arriving at the industrial park By Celia Hatton, BBC Asia Pacific Regional Editor When China makes the news headlines, it's often painted as wealthy global power. However, its boom has also fostered extreme inequality, with the top one percent of Chinese citizens holding one-third of the country's riches. That gap is widening: a continuing trade war with the United States has forced many factories to close, disproportionately punishing some of China's poorest workers. Surveys have repeatedly found that China's upper and middle class citizens are eager to leave the mainland, citing worries about the lack of high-quality schooling and health care, and lingering pollution and food safety problems. Poor people in China have the same concerns but they have less opportunity to emigrate overseas. The Chinese government controls who can get a passport and who qualifies for an exit permit. Ever-tightening controls allow people smugglers and human traffickers to prey on those who are desperate to find work. We don't yet know the story behind why the people found on the Essex lorry had taken that journey. A UK government report on modern slavery published one year ago found that China was the third most common foreign country of origin for victims of human trafficking. Police officers and councillors have signed a book of condolences which was opened at Thurrock Council's chambers. A vigil was held at 18:00 outside the Home Office to ""call for urgent action to ensure safe passage"" for people fleeing war and poverty. A candlelit vigil was held in memory of the 39 victims Thurrock's Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price said there needed to be an international response. ""We have partnerships in place but those efforts need to be rebooted, this is an international criminal world where many gangs are making lots of money and until states act collectively to tackle that it is going to continue,"" she said.

First of the 39 bodies removed from Essex lorry,"This video can not be played Thirty nine bodies were found in the trailer container Police have begun the process of moving the bodies of 39 people found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex. Eleven of the victims - believed to be Chinese nationals - were taken by ambulance from the Port of Tilbury to Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford. Police have been granted extra time to question lorry driver Mo Robinson, 25, on suspicion of murdering the eight women and 31 men. Post-mortem examinations will be the next step in the investigation. The ambulance carrying the bodies left the port at 19:41 BST under police escort.

Twitter shares plunge as profit falls short,"Twitter shares tumbled 17% in early trading as quarterly profits came in at less than a quarter of what analysts had predicted. The company said it made $37m (Â£28.7m) profit in the third quarter. Product bugs and unusually low demand over the summer hampered advertising sales. Revenues were 9% higher than the previous year at $824m, but still at the lower end of Wall Street forecasts. The micro-blogging site said revenue had been predicted to fall from the first two quarters, but that unexpected problems had weighed on sales, including bugs which had an impact on its ability to target ads and share data. Twitter has also lowered fourth-quarter revenue predictions. The firm now expects to earn between $940m and $1.02bn in the fourth quarter, down from a previously forecast $1.06bn. The social media platform did boost the number of daily users who see ads on the site, known as monetisable daily active users (mDAU), which reached 145 million, beating analyst estimates for 141 million, up 17% year-on-year. Facebook will not fact-check politicians Twitter tweaks rules after calls to ban Trump New algorithms aim to stamp out abuse on Twitter Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey said the company was making improvements to the platform's algorithm. ""We also continue to make progress on health, improving our ability to proactively identify and remove abusive content, with more than 50% of the Tweets removed for abusive content in Q3 taken down without a bystander or first-person report,"" he said. This crackdown on abusive behaviour is something analysts say separates Twitter from Facebook, whichadmitted on Thursday to being unable to confirm if hate speech from political candidates would be taken off the platform. ""Twitter has focused on the core experience for their users instead of politics,"" said Wendy Johansson of digital consultancy Publicis Sapient.  ""They're not out fighting a political war like Facebook - they're focused on building the best tech and getting users addicted to the tech."" Anthony Macro, head of social advertising at Croud, said the social media platform's attempts to root out bad activity would appeal to advertisers, but that their record was not flawless. ""It might be even harder to convince more people to join the platform afterTwitter admitted in August it may have shared users' data with advertising platforms without consent,external,"" he said. ""With privacy so top of mind for users, across all social media platforms, it's absolutely critical for Twitter to sort these issues out if they want to make serious headway with future results,"" he added. Mr Macro said the big question for Twitter was whether it could monetise its profile and turn its political influence into advertising revenue.

C4 show postponed after lorry deaths,"Channel 4's Smuggled followed members of the public as they tried to evade border checks Channel 4 has postponed the broadcast of a new documentary after 39 bodies were discovered in a lorry in Essex. Smuggled was set to follow eight members of the public as they tried to enter the UK from Europe by evading border checks. A spokeswoman said: ""In light of the tragic events today we have postponed the transmission of the series."" The 39 people found dead in the refrigerated trailerwere Chinese nationals, it is understood. In promotional material, Channel 4 said it had commissioned the show at a time when the UK was preparing to ""take back control"" with Brexit and described the programme as an ""unprecedented national security experiment"". This video can not be played Aerial footage shows police activity around the lorry where the bodies were found A press screening of Smuggled had been planned for Thursday but was cancelled after the discovery of the bodies in the early hours of Wednesday. Essex Police initially suggested the lorry could be from Bulgaria, but later said officers believed it entered the UK from Belgium. The lorry was found at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex and police said 38 adults and one teenager were pronounced dead at the scene. This is far from the first time a TV network or film studio has pulled the broadcast or release of certain projects after a real-life tragedy has hit the headlines. A movie or TV series which unintentionally reflects a recent horrific event can feel insensitive or distasteful - and they often end up being reshot or rescheduled as a result. A trailer for a film starring Betty Gilpin (left) and Hilary Swank was pulled after the El Paso shooting In August, Universal Picturescancelled the release of horror movie The Hunt, which was set to star double Oscar winner Hilary Swank and Glow's Betty Gilpin. The satirical and gory film told the story of liberals who hunt Trump supporters and kill them for sport, a storyline intended to reflect the divided nature of politics at the moment. But after theshootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, the trailers were taken off air - including one which opened with the sound resembling an emergency broadcast signal - before the film was pulled altogether. A statement from Universal at the time said: ""We stand by our filmmakers and will continue to distribute films in partnership with bold and visionary creators, like those associated with this satirical social thriller, but we understand that now is not the right time to release this film."" Bastille Day, Shooter and Gone Baby Gone have all faced delays because of real-life events Other films to have been affected by real-life tragedies include Bastille Day, which starred Idris Elba. But the film, which was about civilians killed by a bomb explosion in Paris, waspulled from cinemasin France the day after it was released because ofthe 2016 terror attack in Nice. StudioCanal stopped adverts for the film immediately after the attack and soon cancelled its release altogether,commenting,externalthat it was ""not in line with the national mood"". ""Studios, like many major corporations, are risk averse,"" says Andreas Wiseman, international editor at Deadline. ""The performance over its opening weekend can often make or break a film, so distributors spend a long time strategising over an optimum release date. ""If there is a chance a social or political context might turn media or audiences against a film, studios will reroute."" An episode of Friends was reshot after the 9/11 attacks The studio's request to pull Bastille Day out of French cinemas was supported by the film's lead actor.Elba told The Sun,externalthat the producers probably thought the film was ""insensitive"" and did not ""feel right to have out there"". Yet some French film fans were disappointed with the studio's decision. Onetold Reuters,externalhe ""didn't make the connection with Nice"". ""There are so many differences,"" said the cinemagoer. ""I think it's a coincidence and I find it a shame for the people who made the film."" Producing a film or TV series is a long and laborious process - the whole operation can often take years. So when a project is thrown into uncertainty as a result of reality, studios often try to just delay (rather than cancel) its release. In 2017, a remake ofDeath Wish was pushed back,externalby several months after a mass shooting in Las Vegas. And TV series Shooter - a drama about a sniper - was postponed after unrest prompted by the shooting of black men by police. Ryan Phillippe starred in Shooter, which was also postponed USA Network initially delayed the show's debut by a week - and""after further consideration"",external, it was subsequently postponed until the autumn. Paris-based film journalist Lisa Nesselson, who saw Bastille Day in a French cinema after the Nice attack, says she is unsure whether TV networks and film studios should react in the same way. ""I don't know if films are delayed or pulled out of respect for terror victims, or because it's assumed that nobody will be in the mood to see that topic or a little of both,"" she says. ""I might be in favour of changing television programming in deference to a violent national event,"" she continues. ""But I find it much harder to grasp why a movie that requires an individual to make the decision to pay to get in should be punished for being about the 'wrong' thing at a particular moment in time."" Perhaps the biggest single event of recent times to affect the film and TV industry was the9/11 attack,externalin 2001. A 2017 remake of Death Wish starring Bruce Willis was postponed A scene in Spider-Man featuring the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center was deleted from the film and the trailers in light of the sombre national mood, and the location was also edited out of Men In Black II and Zoolander. Friends - one of the most successful TV sitcoms of all time - cut an entire storyline from one episode which saw Chandler detained at an airport after making a joke about a bomb. It was replaced by a new storyline involving Monica and Chandler, and the already-filmed footage was only released years later as part of a box set. In the UK, one of the longest delays to a major film came in 2007 when Gone Baby Gone was due to be released. It came out in the US in October and was set for a UK release in December - but was halted by thedisappearance of Madeleine McCannas the producers felt the plot, which dealt with a young girl going missing, was distasteful. Ben Affleck directed Gone Baby Gone, whose release was postponed in the UK Wiseman says that while audiences like to identify with characters and storylines, a story which appears to reflect a real-life horror can be difficult to watch. ""Hollywood studios want and need audience identification in their films, but too much identification can become uncomfortable for some unsuspecting viewers who find material too close to real-life tragedy."" He adds that once promotion has begun, films can be more difficult to change or postpone than TV shows.

EU Brexit extension decision expected on Friday,"EU leaders are set to decide on Friday whether to grant the UK a three-month Brexit extension, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. Most EU nations back it but France ""is digging its heels in"", she adds. So there could be an emergency summit in Brussels on Monday to allow leaders to reach agreement face-to-face. Boris Johnson insists the UK will leave the EU next week with or without a deal and he will seek a snap election if the EU grants an extension to January. The prime minister was forced to send a letter to the EU requesting an extension, under legislation passed by MPs last month. But he said he had told EU leaders his policy was still to leave on 31 October. 'Minimal' checks needed on NI-GB trade movements EU eyes Brexit flextension (again) PM postpones grilling by senior MPs Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs the government ""does not want an extension"" and was ""making every preparation to leave on 31 October"". Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's chief adviser, is reported to be urging ministers to abandon attempts to get the prime minister's Brexit deal through Parliament and go for a December election instead. But some ministers - such as Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith - are understood to be urging the prime minister to make another attempt to get his deal through Parliament first. Cabinet ministers are meeting and are expected to discuss the way forward. Julian Smith says there are 'differing views' around the cabinet table Arriving in Downing Street for the meeting, the Northern Ireland Secretary said: ""Let's just get Brexit sorted and get this bill over the line."" He said there were ""differing views"" on Brexit among ministers but the aim was to ""make sure we've got everyone on board"". ""Obviously, in Northern Ireland we've been trying to avoid no-deal,"" he added. ""We seem to have succeeded with that. Let's try and get this stage done."" French President Emmanuel Macron is concerned that a long extension could lead to more UK indecisiveness or an inconclusive general election, the BBC understands. But if the EU approves the UK's request for a three-month extension, Mr Johnson would have to accept it, under the terms of the so-called Benn Act. He would also have to accept any alternative duration suggested by EU leaders, unless MPs decide not to agree with it within two days. Neither a motion for an early election nor another attempt to get the Brexit deal through has so far been scheduled for next week's business in Parliament. President Macron favours a short, sharp Brexit delay, encouraging MPs and the UK government to concentrate on ratifying the newly negotiated Brexit deal. Mr Macron is fed up with the more-than-three-year EU focus on Brexit and the ever-present threat of a no-deal scenario. He would rather shift attention to reforming the EU itself, to the benefit (he believes) of the countries remaining in it. Of course, the French president knows Brexit won't be over if and when the UK leaves. Brexit Chapter Two - the negotiations on a comprehensive EU-UK trade deal - will likely be lengthy and complex, but they will largely be the competence of the European Commission, landing far more rarely on EU leaders' in-trays. Read the full article If Mr Johnson had got his way in a Commons vote on Tuesday, MPs would now be debating the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which would put his Brexit deal into law. Instead, they are debating the Queen's Speech, the government's proposed programme for the next session of Parliament, if there is not an early general election. Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? How soon could there be a general election? MPs are due to vote at about 17:00 BST on whether to approve the Queen's Speech, a formality when the government has a majority, but the result is expected to be close. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour was ready for a general election ""whenever it comes"", but he refused to be drawn on whether his party would back one if Mr Johnson held a vote on it next week. ""We will see what happens. We are trying to take this in stages,"" he said. Mr McDonnell said Labour remained open to a ""compromise"" with the government, which could allow Mr Johnson to get his Brexit deal through Parliament. A ""dialogue"" with ministers was continuing, he added, after inconclusive talks on Wednesday between Jeremy Corbyn and the PM. Boris Johnson believes there should be a general election this winter to break the Brexit deadlock. There's not much point, he believes, in talking to Labour because they are never going to help him out. But are we now arriving at ""think-again Thursday""? A growing number of influential Tories are saying: ""Hang on, winter election, not such a good idea."" It's not even clear Mr Johnson could trigger one. There are more and more Tories saying: ""Perhaps we should have another go at bringing the bill back and trying to get it through the Commons."" That's because Mr Johnson did get a majority on the broad principles of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. And perhaps, some say, if you love-bombed Labour MPs who might be tempted to vote for it, you would get it through.

RBS pulls Samsung Galaxy S10 app over security flaw,"A graphic symbol on the Galaxy S10 tells users where they need to press to provide a fingerprint RBS and its sister bank Natwest have pulled their apps for the Samsung Galaxy S10 after a security flaw was found on the phone. Last week, users found the device could be unlocked by anyone via its fingerprint authentication system when used with certain screen protectors. S10 owners will be unable to download RBS apps until the issue is fixed. The bank is also encouraging those with the app already downloaded ""to disable biometrics on their device"". However, it would not confirm whether it had warned all 200,000 of its customers who use the Galaxy S10. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nationwide Building Society and HSBC have issued similar warnings to customers, along with banks in Israel and South Korea, according to reports. Meanwhile, Wechat and Alipay, who together dominate China's mobile payments market, have reportedly disabled the fingerprint payment option on their apps for the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10. So far there have been no reports of people using the glitch to commit fraud - but banks are urging customers to be vigilant. An HSBC UK spokeswoman said: ""We have been in direct contact with customers who may be affected by the potential Samsung security issue, and have recommended that they disable their phone's fingerprint authentication until a fix is confirmed and they've updated their device."" Samsung: Anyone's thumbprint can unlock S10 phone The flaw was spotted last week by a British woman, whose husband was able to unlock her Galaxy S10 with his thumbprint when it was stored in a cheap case. After buying a Â£2.70 gel screen protector, Lisa Neilson registered her right thumbprint and then found her left thumbprint, which was not registered, could also unlock the phone. She then asked her husband to try and both his thumbs also unlocked it. When the screen protector was added to another relative's phone, the same thing happened. The couple told the Sun newspaper it was a ""real concern"". When the S10 was launched, in March, Samsung described the fingerprint authentication system as ""revolutionary"". Unlike other ID systems, a scanner sends ultrasounds to detect 3D ridges of fingerprints in order to recognise users. However, reports have suggested some screen protectors are incompatible with the reader because they leave a small air gap that interferes with the scanning. Samsung has said it is ""aware of the case of S10's malfunctioning fingerprint recognition and will soon issue a software patch"". Banks understand a fix will be rolled out this week, but on Thursday the South Korean firm was unable to confirm when that might happen.

Trump confirms US will leave Paris climate accord,"This video can not be played Watch Trump explain why he is pulling the US out of Paris climate accord The US will definitely withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, President Trump has confirmed. He made the announcement at an energy conference in Pittsburgh on a stage flanked by men in hard hats. He described the accord as a bad deal and said his pro fossil fuel policies had made the US an energy superpower. The earliest he can formally start the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris accord is 4 November. The pull-out will take effect a year later - the day after the 2020 US presidential election. The Paris agreement brought together 195 nations in the battle to combat climate change. What is in the Paris climate agreement? Paris climate pullout: The worst is yet to come 'Trump effect' threatens Paris pact It committed the US to cutting greenhouse gases up to 28% by 2025 based on 2005 levels. President Trump said if he couldnât improve that deal heâd pull out, but diplomatic sources said thereâs been no major effort at renegotiation. In the meantime, the presidentâs staff have conducted what critics call a seek-and-destroy mission through US environmental legislation. Mr Trump promised that heâd turn the US into an energy superpower, and heâs attempting to sweep away a raft of pollution legislation to reduce the cost of producing gas, oil and coal. He categorised former US President Barack Obamaâs environmental clean-up plans as a war on American energy. Trump, speaking here at a conference in Pittsburgh, has vowed to deregulate the oil and gas industry The gas and oil industries are indeed thriving, but Mr Trumpâs pledge to resurrect the coal industry has proved much more challenging. Coal can't compete on price with gas - or, for that matter, with renewables whose costs have plummeted. Firms are also reluctant to invest billions in coal-fired plants which could have a limited life if the next administration rejoins the rest of the world on climate change. As coal is the dirtiest fuel, the industryâs woes have held down US emissions, despite the Presidentâs policies. President Trump made support for the coal industry a key election promise Whatâs more, many US states, cities and businesses remain committed to the Paris Agreement, whatever Mr Trump does. Campaigners say these now represent nearly 70% of US GDP and nearly 65% of the US population. If they were a country, this group would be the worldâs second largest economy. The rebels are led by California, which is locked in a battle with the president over his plans to repeal their powers to impose clean air standards. So far the biggest negative effect of Mr Trumpâs stance has arguably been to relax pressure on countries like Brazil and Saudi Arabia to take action of their own. Environmentalists say Mr Obama would have acted quickly to press Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro to tackle forest fires in the Amazon, for instance. Mr Obama agreed in Paris that the US should take a lead on climate change because itâs contributed far more than any other nation to the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere. A truck is loaded with coal at a mine near Cumberland, Kentucky China - the current top emitter - and India still have relatively low per capita emissions, but Mr Trump said they shouldnât be allowed to phase out fossil fuels more slowly than the US. He said: ""The Paris accord would have been shutting down American producers with excessive regulatory restrictions like you would not believe, while allowing foreign producers to pollute with impunity. ""What we won't do is punish the American people while enriching foreign polluters,"" he said, adding: ""I'm proud to say it - it's called America First."" This video can not be played Watch the moment Greta Thunberg saw US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit His opponents warn the president is weakening US global leadership on the clean economy with technologies to boost wind and solar power, advanced batteries and energy conservation. Neera Tanden, from the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, said: ""Instead of projecting strength, this action weakens America on the world stage and cedes leadership on climate change and other challenges of our time to countries like Russia and China."" In fact, Chinese leadership on the issue has been muted recently as politicians there focus on avoiding a recession. The Beijing government is having difficulty persuading provincial leaders to abandon coal plants for which they have taken heavy loans. Itâs also committed to a massive airport-building programme to stimulate economic growth. Critics say this is incompatible with concern for the climate. As extreme weather events alarm the worldâs scientists, diplomats will meet in a few weeks in Chile to figure out the path ahead. Andrew Light, a former State Department official during the Obama administration that helped broker the Paris agreement, said the formal withdrawal would make it difficult for the US to be part of the global conversation. ""It will take some time to recover from this train wreck of US diplomacy,"" he said. Follow Roger on Twitter:@RHarrabin,external Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?

No 10 denies government division over Brexit plans,"Downing Street has denied the government is split over how to move forward with the Brexit process. The prime minister has said he will seek a snap general election if the EU decides to delay Brexit until January. But some ministers are understood to be urging him to make another attempt to get his deal through Parliament first. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the EU will decide on Friday whether to grant an extension and, if so, for how long. ""France is digging its heels in, while Germany and most other EU countries support idea of granting the three-month extension,"" adds our correspondent. Johnson and Corbyn meet amid Brexit uncertainty 'Minimal' checks needed on NI-GB trade movements EU eyes Brexit flextension (again) PM postpones grilling by senior MPs French President Emmanuel Macon is thought to be concerned that a long extension could lead to more UK indecisiveness or an inconclusive general election. If France remains opposed to a three-month extension, there could be an emergency summit in Brussels on Monday so leaders reach agreement face-to-face, says Katya Adler. On Tuesday, MPs backed the prime minister's Brexit deal at its first parliamentary hurdlebut rejected his plans to fast-track the legislation. That defeat effectively ended any realistic prospect of the UK leaving the bloc with a deal by the government's 31 October deadline. On Saturday, the prime minister was forced by law to send a letter to Brussels requesting a three-month extension. Neither a motion for an early election nor another attempt to get the Brexit deal through has so far been scheduled for next week's business in Parliament. Outlining the agenda, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government ""does not want an extension"" and is ""making every preparation to leave on 31 October"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was unlikely the government would decide on either option before the EU responded to the extension request. After Tuesday's Commons defeat on the timetable, Mr Johnson said he would pause the progress of hisWithdrawal Agreement Billwhile he waited to hear from the EU. But he insists the UK will still leave in a week's time, with or without a deal - and he says he has told EU leaders that. If the EU approves the UK's request for a three-month extension, Mr Johnson would have to accept it under legislation passed by MPs last month. Dominic Cummings is reported to be pushing for a general election before Christmas He would also have to accept any alternative duration suggested by EU leaders, unless MPs decide not to agree with it within two days. Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's chief adviser, isreported by the Sun,externalto be urging ministers to abandon attempts to get the prime minister's deal through Parliament and go for a December election instead. But the newspaper says a series of ministers think getting the Brexit deal through Parliament should be the priority. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith suggested the government's top priority, after Tuesday's Commons votes, may not be securing an early general election. He told the Northern Ireland select committee: ""What I want to do is listen to Northern Irish MPs, get a programme motion that is to the satisfaction of a majority of people in this House and resolve this situation. ""That is where I feel our responsibility lies, and we can work together to address many of these issues and ensure this bill is completed. ""I think the prime minister had a big success [on Tuesday], and I hope we can build on that in the coming days and weeks."" Julian Smith wants to get the Brexit bill through Parliament On Wednesday, Mr Johnson met Jeremy Corbyn to discuss how to break the Brexit impasse. The Labour leader was keen to discuss a different timetable for the Brexit bill, while the prime minister wanted to know what Mr Corbyn would do if the EU refused to grant an extension. But nothing was agreed between the pair and no further talks have been planned. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told Radio 4's Today programme that Labour would vote for an early election if Mr Johnson pushes for one as soon as an extension is granted by the EU. ""That's our position. But we also want the prime minister to look at the compromise that's been offered that a lot of MPs support, and that's the ability to be able to properly scrutinise the bill,"" she added. James Cleverly, Conservative Party chairman, told theTodayprogramme the government was still preparing for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. ""The EU has not agreed an extension and therefore it is absolutely essential that we prepare to leave,"" he said. However, Labour MP Lisa Nandy said keeping to next week's deadline was ""very unlikely"". The Wigan MP told the Today programme the ""general consensus"" in her party was that if the government wanted to propose a new schedule for the Commons to debate the bill, ""five or six days"" would be ""sufficient"". Even if Mr Johnson does decide to press for an early election there is no guarantee he will succeed. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the prime minister needs to have the backing of two-thirds of MPs to hold a snap poll. This has been rejected twice by MPs. Another way would be for the Conservatives to vote for a no-confidence motion in their own government - which Mr Johnson could even call himself - which would only require a simple majority of one. But Parliamentary rules state that if it passes, the Commons has 14 days to form an alternative administration, so he would run the risk of being forced out of Downing Street if opposition parties can unite around a different leader. Another route to an election is a one-line bill, that requires only a simple majority, but any such bill is likely to incur a host of amendments, for example, giving 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote. Traditionally, UK elections are held on a Thursday. So, if an election were triggered in the week beginning 28 October, the earliest date the poll could take place is Thursday, 5 December. That's because the law requires Parliament to dissolve 25 working days before the election. Read more What will happen with Brexit in the next few days? How soon could there be a general election?

RBS slumps to loss after Â£900m hit from PPI,"Royal Bank of Scotland has swung to a loss in the third quarter after taking a hit from the cost of payment protection insurance. The Edinburgh-based bank, in which the government owns a 62% stake, added its investment bank had a ""particularly challenging"" three months. It reported a pre-tax loss of Â£8m for the July-to-September period after it took a Â£900m charge for PPI. These are the last results before chief executive Ross McEwan departs. The New Zealander is being replaced by Alison Rose next month, when she becomes the first woman to lead one of the UK's big four banks. She joined the bank 27 years ago as a graduate trainee. The bank had reported a Â£961m profit in the same three months a year ago. But Katie Murray, the finance director, said the results ""demonstrate our solid underlying performance in a tough operating environment"". ""The core retail and commercial bank continues to perform well and we are making good progress against our targets for the year,"" she said. RBS faces up to Â£900m in new PPI charges RBS is first UK big four bank to be led by a woman But its investment banking arm, known as NatWest Markets, reported a Â£193m loss for the quarter as it felt the impact of a ""deterioration in economic sentiment for the global economy and a fall in bond yields"". RBS had warned last month that, like other lenders, it faced a bill for further compensation for mis-sold PPI, but its Â£900m hit was at the top end of expectations. PPI was designed to cover loan repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost their job, but many were sold to people who did not want or need them. The industry says there has been surge in claims for compensation ahead of a 29 August deadline set by the Financial Conduct Authority. Alison Rose takes the helm after a return to a quarterly loss at the government-backed bank The return to a quarterly loss - the first since the last quarter of 2017 - presents a fresh challenge for Ms Rose, who takes over as the UK prepares to leave the EU and when the bank's revenues are under pressure. The bank has been trying to demonstrate that it can consistently return to profit. It reported about Â£60bn of losses in the nine years after its 2008 bailoutbefore reporting its first full-year profit since that government-backed rescue in 2018. On a nine-month measure, the bank remained in profit, reporting Â£2.7bn of profits. John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: ""The last set of results for RBS were a watershed moment for the bank, confirming it is on the road to redemption. ""Whilst this remains the case, today's statement highlights the legacy issues that the bank, and many of its peers, still face - in particular, PPI claims have pushed RBS back to a loss. ""Despite these bumps on the road, RBS is a very different bank to what it once was and continues to make good progress on a path to recovery."" On another measure, the bottom line or attributable to shareholders, the bank's quarterly losses reached Â£315m, compared with a Â£448m profit a year earlier.

Lizzo credits writer of 'DNA test' tweet after row,"""I just took a DNA Test, turns out I'm a credited writer for the number one song on Billboard."" That's what British singer Mina Lioness tweeted after officially being credited as a writer on Lizzo's song Truth Hurts. The row started after Lizzo wanted to trademark the phrase ""I just took a DNA test turns out I'm 100% that..."". Mina tweeted a similar phrase in 2017, but Lizzo claimed not to have seen it. It's the opening lyric to Truth Hurts, which reached number one on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. ""In 2017, while working on a demo, I saw a meme that resonated with me... I later used the line in Truth Hurts... I later learned that a tweet inspired the meme"", Lizzo said on Twitter. ""The creator of the tweet is the person I am sharing my success with..."" While she didn't name her, Mina responded shortly after with a tweet thanking Lizzo and her team. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scots NHS facing Â£1.8bn 'shortfall' without reform,"The health service in Scotland could face a Â£1.8bn shortfall in less than five years if it is not reformed, the public spending watchdog has said. Audit Scotland's annual report,externalsaid the NHS was ""seriously struggling to become financially sustainable"". Auditor General Caroline Gardner said the integration of health and social care was too slow and staff were under intense pressure. The Scottish government said reform was progressing but must happen faster.  Â£13.4bnNHS budget 2018/19 42%of Scottish government's total budget 140,881full-time equivalent staff Â£6.9bnstaff costs in 2018/19 Â£1.8bndrug costs in 2017/18 The annual report on the health and social care system in Scotland said it faced increasing pressure from rising demand and costs, and it is having difficulty meeting key waiting times standards. It said there needed to be large-scale ""system-wide reform"" that led to less reliance on hospitals and more care delivered through GP practices or community-based organisations. The watchdog said the Scottish government had set out its plans to move to this model of care a decade ago but it was not happening quickly enough and needed to go much further. ""We can't keep delivering services the way we do at the moment,"" the auditor general said. Ms Gardner said ""some basic foundations"" were in place but called for an increasing focus on services being provided away from hospitals, which are better suited to an ageing population's care needs. Without reform the Scottish government predicts there will be an increase in spending across health and social care in Scotland to about Â£20.6bn by 2023/24. However, the report said there could be a Â£1.8bn shortfall in the projected funding. ""We can't just buy our way out of this,"" the auditor general said. ""The pressures are getting more and more severe every year. That puts a lot of pressure on people working in the health service and it also damages confidence."" It was the Scottish government that described ""integration"" as the most significant change to health and social care since the NHS was formed. The idea is a good one: better care in the community means fewer people end up in hospital when they don't need to be. It is better for their wellbeing, takes the pressure off hospitals, and crucially, is cheaper. And for the health service to be financially sustainable that shift in emphasis needs to happen much faster. That means making sure there are enough specialist staff to fill gaps, working out which initiatives are successful and implementing them across the country. It also means setting out clear priorities on where the money should be spent. The auditor general says large-scale reform is needed and it must happen now or the prognosis for the NHS is not good. More people were seen and treated on time in the last year and patient safety improved. But just two out of eight key waiting time standards were met The NHS achieved Â£390m in savings last year but remains reliant on one-off savings, such as delaying recruitment, which are not sustainable. The capital budget has reduced by 63% over the past decade and there is a near Â£1bn maintenance backlog Five boards are receiving external support because they are struggling to meet financial and performance targets (NHS Ayrshire and Arran, NHS Lothian, NHS Borders, NHS Highland and NHS Tayside) It is increasingly challenging to recruit enough people with the right skills, particularly in some rural areas. BMA Scotland chair Dr Lewis Morrison said that despite some minor improvements the overall report ""paints a stark picture of the parlous state of our NHS"". He said there was a ""lack of a clear plan"" to address the potential funding gap or set out reforms to prevent it. Dr Morrison said health boards were relying on one-off, high risk savings to balance the books. Auditor General Caroline Gardner said there were questions about the long-term financial sustainability of the NHS ""This cannot go on - if we want to continue to provide comprehensive free-at-the-point-of-delivery care for the people of Scotland, something must be done urgently,"" he said. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the report noted the ""positive steps"" taken by the Scottish government as well as the challenges the NHS faced. She said work to ensure people get access to health and social care services was progressing but needed to happen faster. ""As recognised by Audit Scotland, investment in our health services has grown by 6% above inflation over the last 10 years, and now exceeds Â£14bn this year,"" the health secretary said. ""This is all part of our twin approach of investment and reform to meet increasing demand and to deliver balanced and sustainable services.""

'Tiger poacher who ate bear penises' arrested,"Bear gallbladders can fetch a high price in illegal international markets Indian police have hailed the arrest of a notorious suspected poacher who they say killed sloth bears and ate their penises as a ""very important catch"". The man, known as Yarlen, had been on the run for years. Authorities were first alerted when they found sloth bear carcasses without genitals in a national park. The nomadic Pardhi-Behelia tribe he is part of believe the animal's penis is an aphrodisiac, said Ritesh Sirothia of the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department. But Yarlen, who was arrested on 19 October in the state of Gujarat, was also a major figure in the tiger poaching trade in central India, he said. He was a suspect in several cases involving the poaching and trading of endangered wild animals, including tigers, in central and western India. He is alleged to have used several different identities to evade capture. Yarlen is yet to be charged and neither he nor a lawyer have commented on the allegations. He was produced in court on Wednesday and remanded in custody. Can Calvin Klein scent catch a 'killer' tiger? India's first anti-poaching tiger force begins work ""We created a special cell to track him down and arrest him. It was our longest chase, it went on for six years,"" said Mr Sirothia, who heads the forest department's special task force. Found in the southern parts of Madhya Pradesh, the Pardhi-Behelia tribe has traditionally lived in forests and depended on hunting for survival. Yarlen is alleged to have hunted sloth bears and tigers, among other endangered animals Hunting of wild animals is illegal in India, including for tribal communities, though ritual forest hunting continues. The Indian government says it is working to provide alternative livelihoods to tribespeople but many continue to live on the fringes of society. Yarlen was first arrested in 2013 after police found two sloth bear carcasses from the Kanha national park missing genitalia and gall bladders. He spent a year in jail before being freed on bail and going on the run, police said. Bear bile, which is produced in the liver and stored in the gall bladder, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years and fetches a high price in the illegal international market. Anger over China's bear bile farms Salman Khan: Bollywood superstar jailed for poaching India's tiger killings: A success story gone wrong? Mr Sirothia said there were six cases registered against Yarlen in the states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh under Cites (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).

Expert wins Â£2m decades after diabetes inventionProf Ian Shanks used his daughter's toy microscope to build a prototype for the device in the 1980s.UK,"Prof Shanks said he was relieved his 13-year legal battle to get compensation was over A scientist has been awarded Â£2m compensation by the UK's highest court for his invention of pioneering technology to test blood sugar levels nearly 40 years ago. Professor Ian Shanks developed the system, used by many diabetics, while working for Unilever in the 1980s. The rights to his invention belonged to the company and until now he was not entitled to a share of the benefits. Prof Shanks said he wasrelieved by the result,external, after a 13-year legal battle. While working for a subsidiary of multinational giant Unilever in Bedfordshire in 1982, Prof Shanks developed new technology to measure the concentration of glucose in blood and other liquids. Using plastic film and glass slides from his daughter's toy microscope kit and bulldog clips to hold it together, he built the first prototype of what is now known as the electrochemical capillary fill device (ECFD). His ECFD technology eventually appeared in most glucose testing products, which are used by diabetics to monitor their condition. Prof Shanks first applied for compensation in 2006 but lost every step in his legal battle until it reached the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, the court unanimously ruled that Prof Shanks's invention had provided his former employer with an ""outstanding benefit"" for which he should receive compensation. Judge Lord Kitchin said the rewards Unilever enjoyed ""were substantial and significant"" and Prof Shanks was entitled to a ""fair share"" of the company's net benefit of around Â£24m from the patents. Speaking after the ruling, Prof Shanks, who lives near Dundee, said he was pleased his ""13-year slog"" to get compensation was over. However, the 72-year-old told the BBC the legal battle was not ""without its costs"" and had caused him a great deal of stress. ""In 2007 I had a heart attack - which wasn't at all helped by the strain I was under,"" he added. A finger-prick blood test is one way someone with diabetes can check their blood sugar levels However, he said his persistence was driven by a desire to help future inventors, rather than for his own financial reward, adding that most of the compensation would go towards his legal costs. ""I would much prefer that employee inventors believe that if they do something that turns out to be really profitable and significant, they may actually stand a chance of getting an award,"" he said. When he first applied for compensation, he said not one employee inventor had benefitted from the provisions of the Patents Act, introduced 30 years earlier. The Act entitles workers who invent something from which their employer gains an ""outstanding benefit"" to a ""fair share"" of these benefits. Why are so few women inventors named on patents? This little-known inventor has probably saved your life Prof Shanks added that he felt great pride for his invention which he said had probably helped several hundred million people living with diabetes. Outlining the background to the case, Lord Kitchin said Prof Shanks accepted that the rights to his inventions belonged to Unilever, but argued that he was still entitled to compensation. The judge said Prof Shanks' ECFD technology became something most significant companies in the field were willing to pay millions of pounds to use. Prof Shanks had argued at an earlier hearing that, while Unilever ultimately received around Â£24m from the patents, the company could have earned royalties for ""as much as one billion US dollars"" had his invention been ""fully exploited"". A spokesperson for Unilever said the company was ""disappointed"" with the decision to award Dr Shanks ""a share of the licence revenue obtained by Unilever in addition to the salary, bonuses and benefits he was compensated with while employed to develop new products for the business.""

Lizzo credits writer of 'DNA test' tweet after rowA woman from London is now a credited writer on Lizzo's Hot 100 song Truth Hurts.,"""I just took a DNA Test, turns out I'm a credited writer for the number one song on Billboard."" That's what British singer Mina Lioness tweeted after officially being credited as a writer on Lizzo's song Truth Hurts. The row started after Lizzo wanted to trademark the phrase ""I just took a DNA test turns out I'm 100% that..."". Mina tweeted a similar phrase in 2017, but Lizzo claimed not to have seen it. It's the opening lyric to Truth Hurts, which reached number one on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. ""In 2017, while working on a demo, I saw a meme that resonated with me... I later used the line in Truth Hurts... I later learned that a tweet inspired the meme"", Lizzo said on Twitter. ""The creator of the tweet is the person I am sharing my success with..."" While she didn't name her, Mina responded shortly after with a tweet thanking Lizzo and her team. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"High Street woes mount as 85,000 jobs feared lost","The government is facing calls to overhaul its High Street policies after estimates were made of 85,000 retail sector job losses on a year ago. The British Retail Consortium made the calculation after finding that the number of retail employees in the third quarter fell by 2.8% on a year earlier. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of year-on-year decline, the BRC said. Helen Dickinson, BRC boss, said it was time to overhaul business rates and the apprenticeship levy. ""Weak consumer demand and Brexit uncertainty continue to put pressure on retailers already focused on delivering the transformation taking place in the industry. ""While MPs rail against job losses in manufacturing, their response to larger losses in retail has remained muted,"" she said. She said reforms to business rates and the apprenticeship levy would allow retailers to focus on enhancing their online presence and adapt to changes on the High Street. The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Have you lost your high street job? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Why the UK's shops are closing down ""The government should enact policies that enable retailers to invest more in the millions of people who choose to build their careers in retail,"" Ms Dickinson said. The figures are released at time when shops are closing on the High Street with clothing retailer Karen Millen and Coast among the recent outlets to shut. In July the proportion of all shops that are empty reached 10.3%, its highest level since January 2015, according to a BRC and Springboard survey. The BRC used data from the Office for National Statistics to calculate that a 2.8% fall in jobs in the third quarter was the equivalent of 85,000 jobs being lost in a year. The largest impact was on full-time jobs with a 4.5% fall year-on-year and a 1.5% fall in part-time roles. The figures were released ahead of the all-important Christmas season and while the BRC said the retailers it surveyed were not planning on cutting more jobs - unlike a year ago - it was only a temporary seasonal pick-up. ""We expect the long-term decline in employment to continue due to a combined effect of the on-going structural change, weak consumer spending and fierce competition in the industry,"" the BRC said. It said 62% of retailers had plans to increase staff in the coming quarter, higher than the 43% last year. The lobby group contrasted the state of the job market in the retail sector with the broader  economy where it said ONS data showed employment increased 0.3% on the year.

""While MPs rail against job losses in manufacturing, their response to larger losses in retail has remained muted,"" she said. She said reforms to business rates and the apprenticeship levy would allow retailers to focus on enhancing their online presence and adapt to changes on the High Street. The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Have you lost your high street job? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Why the UK's shops are closing down ""The government should enact policies that enable retailers to invest more in the millions of people who choose to build their careers in retail,"" Ms Dickinson said. The figures are released at time when shops are closing on the High Street with clothing retailer Karen Millen and Coast among the recent outlets to shut. In July the proportion of all shops that are empty reached 10.3%, its highest level since January 2015, according to a BRC and Springboard survey. The BRC used data from the Office for National Statistics to calculate that a 2.8% fall in jobs in the third quarter was the equivalent of 85,000 jobs being lost in a year. The largest impact was on full-time jobs with a 4.5% fall year-on-year and a 1.5% fall in part-time roles. The figures were released ahead of the all-important Christmas season and while the BRC said the retailers it surveyed were not planning on cutting more jobs - unlike a year ago - it was only a temporary seasonal pick-up. ""We expect the long-term decline in employment to continue due to a combined effect of the on-going structural change, weak consumer spending and fierce competition in the industry,"" the BRC said. It said 62% of retailers had plans to increase staff in the coming quarter, higher than the 43% last year. The lobby group contrasted the state of the job market in the retail sector with the broader  economy where it said ONS data showed employment increased 0.3% on the year.

"Scots NHS facing Â£1.8bn 'shortfall' without reformAudit Scotland's report said the NHS was ""seriously struggling to become financially sustainable"".Scotland","The health service in Scotland could face a Â£1.8bn shortfall in less than five years if it is not reformed, the public spending watchdog has said. Audit Scotland's annual report,externalsaid the NHS was ""seriously struggling to become financially sustainable"". Auditor General Caroline Gardner said the integration of health and social care was too slow and staff were under intense pressure. The Scottish government said reform was progressing but must happen faster.  Â£13.4bnNHS budget 2018/19 42%of Scottish government's total budget 140,881full-time equivalent staff Â£6.9bnstaff costs in 2018/19 Â£1.8bndrug costs in 2017/18 The annual report on the health and social care system in Scotland said it faced increasing pressure from rising demand and costs, and it is having difficulty meeting key waiting times standards. It said there needed to be large-scale ""system-wide reform"" that led to less reliance on hospitals and more care delivered through GP practices or community-based organisations. The watchdog said the Scottish government had set out its plans to move to this model of care a decade ago but it was not happening quickly enough and needed to go much further. ""We can't keep delivering services the way we do at the moment,"" the auditor general said. Ms Gardner said ""some basic foundations"" were in place but called for an increasing focus on services being provided away from hospitals, which are better suited to an ageing population's care needs. Without reform the Scottish government predicts there will be an increase in spending across health and social care in Scotland to about Â£20.6bn by 2023/24. However, the report said there could be a Â£1.8bn shortfall in the projected funding. ""We can't just buy our way out of this,"" the auditor general said. ""The pressures are getting more and more severe every year. That puts a lot of pressure on people working in the health service and it also damages confidence."" It was the Scottish government that described ""integration"" as the most significant change to health and social care since the NHS was formed. The idea is a good one: better care in the community means fewer people end up in hospital when they don't need to be. It is better for their wellbeing, takes the pressure off hospitals, and crucially, is cheaper. And for the health service to be financially sustainable that shift in emphasis needs to happen much faster. That means making sure there are enough specialist staff to fill gaps, working out which initiatives are successful and implementing them across the country. It also means setting out clear priorities on where the money should be spent. The auditor general says large-scale reform is needed and it must happen now or the prognosis for the NHS is not good. More people were seen and treated on time in the last year and patient safety improved. But just two out of eight key waiting time standards were met The NHS achieved Â£390m in savings last year but remains reliant on one-off savings, such as delaying recruitment, which are not sustainable. The capital budget has reduced by 63% over the past decade and there is a near Â£1bn maintenance backlog Five boards are receiving external support because they are struggling to meet financial and performance targets (NHS Ayrshire and Arran, NHS Lothian, NHS Borders, NHS Highland and NHS Tayside) It is increasingly challenging to recruit enough people with the right skills, particularly in some rural areas. BMA Scotland chair Dr Lewis Morrison said that despite some minor improvements the overall report ""paints a stark picture of the parlous state of our NHS"". He said there was a ""lack of a clear plan"" to address the potential funding gap or set out reforms to prevent it. Dr Morrison said health boards were relying on one-off, high risk savings to balance the books. Auditor General Caroline Gardner said there were questions about the long-term financial sustainability of the NHS ""This cannot go on - if we want to continue to provide comprehensive free-at-the-point-of-delivery care for the people of Scotland, something must be done urgently,"" he said. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the report noted the ""positive steps"" taken by the Scottish government as well as the challenges the NHS faced. She said work to ensure people get access to health and social care services was progressing but needed to happen faster. ""As recognised by Audit Scotland, investment in our health services has grown by 6% above inflation over the last 10 years, and now exceeds Â£14bn this year,"" the health secretary said. ""This is all part of our twin approach of investment and reform to meet increasing demand and to deliver balanced and sustainable services.""

'Tiger poacher who ate bear penises' arrestedIndian police hail the arrest of a man wanted for tiger and bear poaching after a years-long chase.India,"Bear gallbladders can fetch a high price in illegal international markets Indian police have hailed the arrest of a notorious suspected poacher who they say killed sloth bears and ate their penises as a ""very important catch"". The man, known as Yarlen, had been on the run for years. Authorities were first alerted when they found sloth bear carcasses without genitals in a national park. The nomadic Pardhi-Behelia tribe he is part of believe the animal's penis is an aphrodisiac, said Ritesh Sirothia of the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department. But Yarlen, who was arrested on 19 October in the state of Gujarat, was also a major figure in the tiger poaching trade in central India, he said. He was a suspect in several cases involving the poaching and trading of endangered wild animals, including tigers, in central and western India. He is alleged to have used several different identities to evade capture. Yarlen is yet to be charged and neither he nor a lawyer have commented on the allegations. He was produced in court on Wednesday and remanded in custody. Can Calvin Klein scent catch a 'killer' tiger? India's first anti-poaching tiger force begins work ""We created a special cell to track him down and arrest him. It was our longest chase, it went on for six years,"" said Mr Sirothia, who heads the forest department's special task force. Found in the southern parts of Madhya Pradesh, the Pardhi-Behelia tribe has traditionally lived in forests and depended on hunting for survival. Yarlen is alleged to have hunted sloth bears and tigers, among other endangered animals Hunting of wild animals is illegal in India, including for tribal communities, though ritual forest hunting continues. The Indian government says it is working to provide alternative livelihoods to tribespeople but many continue to live on the fringes of society. Yarlen was first arrested in 2013 after police found two sloth bear carcasses from the Kanha national park missing genitalia and gall bladders. He spent a year in jail before being freed on bail and going on the run, police said.

Police continue to hold man over 39 trailer deaths,"This video can not be played Thirty nine bodies were found in the trailer container The 39 people found dead in a refrigerated trailer in Essex were Chinese nationals. Police have been granted an extra 24 hours to question lorry driver Mo Robinson, 25, on suspicion of murdering the eight women and 31 men. Three properties in Northern Ireland have been raided and the National Crime Agency is working to establish if ""organised crime groups"" were involved. The trailer arrived in Purfleet on the River Thames from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Ambulance staff discovered the bodies in the container at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays just after 01:30 BST on Wednesday. The lorry and trailer left the port at Purfleet shortly after 01:05. Police said the tractor unit - the front part of the lorry - entered the country via Holyhead in Wales on Sunday, having travelled from Dublin. Speaking after a magistrate granted Essex Police more time to question Mr Robinson on Thursday, Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said her priority was ""preserving the dignity of the 39 people who have died and ensuring that we get answers for their loved ones"". The lorry driver has been named locally as Mo Robinson, from County Armagh Councillor Paul Berry said the village of Laurelvale in County Armagh, where the Robinson family live, was in ""complete shock"". He said he had been in contact with Mr Robinson's father, who had learned of his son's arrest on Wednesday through social media. ""The local community is hoping that he [Mo Robinson] has been caught up innocently in this matter but that's in the hands of Essex Police, and we will leave it in their professional hands to try to catch the perpetrators of this,"" he said. The lorry has been moved to a secure site at Tilbury Docks and police are due to begin the process of moving the bodies to a mortuary at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. They will be taken by private ambulance so that post-mortem examinations can take place, with the force expecting all the bodies to have been moved by the weekend. Global Trailer Rentals Ltd confirmed to RTE News,externalthat it owned the trailer and said it had leased it on 15 October. The firm said it had given Essex Police the details of the person and company they had leased it to. This video can not be played ""I've seen people running out of a lorry"" Essex Police said it was the largest murder investigation in the force's history and the victims were all ""believed to be Chinese nationals"". It said formal identification of the 39 people, one of whom is a young adult woman, ""could be a lengthy process"". China's ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaomingtweeted that the embassy had read the reports of the deaths,external""with heavy hearts"" and was in close contact with British police. Lucy Moreton, from the Immigration Services Union, said the sheer number of containers coming into the UK every day made it impossible to look inside them all. ""We don't have the facility to check the vast majority of freight which arrives in the UK, whether it moves or not,"" she said. She said disconnected freight containers were less likely to be searched unless there was ""intelligence to the contrary that suggests we need to do that"". A book of condolences has been opened at Thurrock Council Police initially suggested the lorry could be from Bulgaria, but later said officers believed it entered the UK from Belgium. A spokesman for the Bulgarian foreign affairs ministry said the truck was registered in the country under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen. The Belgian Federal Public Prosecutor's Office said the container arrived in Zeebrugge at 14:29 on Tuesday and left the port later that afternoon. It was not clear when the victims were placed in the container or if this happened in Belgium, a spokesman said. Essex lorry deaths: What we know How are lorries checked for concealed migrants? 'I almost suffocated in the back of a lorry' A spokesman for C.RO Ports, which operates terminals at Purfleet and Zeebrugge, said they would ""fully assist"" the police investigation. Shaun Sawyer, the National Police Chiefs Council lead for modern slavery and human trafficking, said while forces had prevented thousands of deaths, ""tragically, for 39 people that didn't work yesterday"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programmeeven if there were routes perceived as easier to get through, organised criminals would still exploit people who could not access those. This video can not be played CCTV shows the lorry arriving at the industrial park By Celia Hatton, BBC Asia Pacific Regional Editor When China makes the news headlines, it's often painted as wealthy global power. However, its boom has also fostered extreme inequality, with the top one percent of Chinese citizens holding one-third of the country's riches. That gap is widening: a continuing trade war with the United States has forced many factories to close, disproportionately punishing some of China's poorest workers. Surveys have repeatedly found that China's upper and middle class citizens are eager to leave the mainland, citing worries about the lack of high-quality schooling and health care, and lingering pollution and food safety problems. Poor people in China have the same concerns but they have less opportunity to emigrate overseas. The Chinese government controls who can get a passport and who qualifies for an exit permit. Ever-tightening controls allow people smugglers and human traffickers to prey on those who are desperate to find work. We don't yet know the story behind why the people found on the Essex lorry had taken that journey. A UK government report on modern slavery published one year ago found that China was the third most common foreign country of origin for victims of human trafficking. Police officers and councillors have signed a book of condolences which was opened at Thurrock Council's chambers. A vigil was held at 18:00 outside the Home Office to ""call for urgent action to ensure safe passage"" for people fleeing war and poverty. A candlelit vigil was held in memory of the 39 victims Thurrock's Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price said there needed to be an international response. ""We have partnerships in place but those efforts need to be rebooted, this is an international criminal world where many gangs are making lots of money and until states act collectively to tackle that it is going to continue,"" she said.

No 10 denies government division over Brexit plansThere are reports of splits over whether to call for an election or focus on getting a deal approved.UK Politics,"Downing Street has denied the government is split over how to move forward with the Brexit process. The prime minister has said he will seek a snap general election if the EU decides to delay Brexit until January. But some ministers are understood to be urging him to make another attempt to get his deal through Parliament first. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the EU will decide on Friday whether to grant an extension and, if so, for how long. ""France is digging its heels in, while Germany and most other EU countries support idea of granting the three-month extension,"" adds our correspondent. Johnson and Corbyn meet amid Brexit uncertainty 'Minimal' checks needed on NI-GB trade movements EU eyes Brexit flextension (again) PM postpones grilling by senior MPs French President Emmanuel Macon is thought to be concerned that a long extension could lead to more UK indecisiveness or an inconclusive general election. If France remains opposed to a three-month extension, there could be an emergency summit in Brussels on Monday so leaders reach agreement face-to-face, says Katya Adler. On Tuesday, MPs backed the prime minister's Brexit deal at its first parliamentary hurdlebut rejected his plans to fast-track the legislation. That defeat effectively ended any realistic prospect of the UK leaving the bloc with a deal by the government's 31 October deadline. On Saturday, the prime minister was forced by law to send a letter to Brussels requesting a three-month extension. Neither a motion for an early election nor another attempt to get the Brexit deal through has so far been scheduled for next week's business in Parliament. Outlining the agenda, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government ""does not want an extension"" and is ""making every preparation to leave on 31 October"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was unlikely the government would decide on either option before the EU responded to the extension request. After Tuesday's Commons defeat on the timetable, Mr Johnson said he would pause the progress of hisWithdrawal Agreement Billwhile he waited to hear from the EU. But he insists the UK will still leave in a week's time, with or without a deal - and he says he has told EU leaders that. If the EU approves the UK's request for a three-month extension, Mr Johnson would have to accept it under legislation passed by MPs last month. Dominic Cummings is reported to be pushing for a general election before Christmas He would also have to accept any alternative duration suggested by EU leaders, unless MPs decide not to agree with it within two days. Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's chief adviser, isreported by the Sun,externalto be urging ministers to abandon attempts to get the prime minister's deal through Parliament and go for a December election instead. But the newspaper says a series of ministers think getting the Brexit deal through Parliament should be the priority. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith suggested the government's top priority, after Tuesday's Commons votes, may not be securing an early general election. He told the Northern Ireland select committee: ""What I want to do is listen to Northern Irish MPs, get a programme motion that is to the satisfaction of a majority of people in this House and resolve this situation. ""That is where I feel our responsibility lies, and we can work together to address many of these issues and ensure this bill is completed. ""I think the prime minister had a big success [on Tuesday], and I hope we can build on that in the coming days and weeks."" Julian Smith wants to get the Brexit bill through Parliament On Wednesday, Mr Johnson met Jeremy Corbyn to discuss how to break the Brexit impasse. The Labour leader was keen to discuss a different timetable for the Brexit bill, while the prime minister wanted to know what Mr Corbyn would do if the EU refused to grant an extension. But nothing was agreed between the pair and no further talks have been planned. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told Radio 4's Today programme that Labour would vote for an early election if Mr Johnson pushes for one as soon as an extension is granted by the EU. ""That's our position. But we also want the prime minister to look at the compromise that's been offered that a lot of MPs support, and that's the ability to be able to properly scrutinise the bill,"" she added. James Cleverly, Conservative Party chairman, told theTodayprogramme the government was still preparing for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. ""The EU has not agreed an extension and therefore it is absolutely essential that we prepare to leave,"" he said. However, Labour MP Lisa Nandy said keeping to next week's deadline was ""very unlikely"". The Wigan MP told the Today programme the ""general consensus"" in her party was that if the government wanted to propose a new schedule for the Commons to debate the bill, ""five or six days"" would be ""sufficient"". Even if Mr Johnson does decide to press for an early election there is no guarantee he will succeed. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the prime minister needs to have the backing of two-thirds of MPs to hold a snap poll. This has been rejected twice by MPs. Another way would be for the Conservatives to vote for a no-confidence motion in their own government - which Mr Johnson could even call himself - which would only require a simple majority of one. But Parliamentary rules state that if it passes, the Commons has 14 days to form an alternative administration, so he would run the risk of being forced out of Downing Street if opposition parties can unite around a different leader. Another route to an election is a one-line bill, that requires only a simple majority, but any such bill is likely to incur a host of amendments, for example, giving 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote. Traditionally, UK elections are held on a Thursday. So, if an election were triggered in the week beginning 28 October, the earliest date the poll could take place is Thursday, 5 December. That's because the law requires Parliament to dissolve 25 working days before the election. Read more What will happen with Brexit in the next few days? How soon could there be a general election?

But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.

Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.
