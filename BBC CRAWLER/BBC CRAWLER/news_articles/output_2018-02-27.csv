Shelling and strikes despite Syria 'pause',"Russian media said not a single civilian left the besieged Eastern Ghouta on Tuesday Fighting continued in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area of Syria during the first daily five-hour ""pause"" ordered by the government's ally Russia. Activists said there were government air and artillery strikes, while Russia said rebels had shelled a ""humanitarian corridor"" meant to let civilians leave. As a result, there were no UN aid deliveries or medical evacuations. Some 393,000 people are trapped in the enclave near Damascus, which has been besieged by the government since 2013. Medics say more than 500 people have been killed since the government intensified its bombardment nine days ago in an attempt to retake the enclave. At least six civilians were killed on Tuesday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said - two of them during the five-hour ceasefire window.

Russia's defence ministry, meanwhile, said rebels in the Eastern Ghouta ""went on the offensive"" during the pause, including attacking government positions in two settlements. As the truce broke down, France and Britain urged Russia to use its influence over Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to secure a 30-day ceasefire covering the whole country, as demanded by the UN Security Council on Saturday. ""Russia is one of the only actors that can get the regime to implement the resolution,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow. UK Minister of State for Europe and the Americas Sir Alan Duncan gave a similar message to the Russian ambassador in London. Fighting was reported by monitors including the UN after the Russian-ordered pause began at 09:00 (07:00 GMT) on Tuesday. The situation meant that humanitarian convoys could not go in, and medical evacuees could not come out, UN officials said. The World Health Organization said it had a list of more than 1,000 critically sick and wounded people who urgently needed to be evacuated. The situation in the Eastern Ghouta was comparatively calm early on Tuesday. However, a man was killed by shellfire in the rebel-held town of Douma before the pause started, according to SOHR. The monitoring group also reported a number of violations in the five hours that followed, including air strikes by government planes and helicopters, and artillery shelling in the town of Jisrin that killed two people, including a child. Another child was reported to have been killed in Misraba after the truce ended. The Syrian state news agency, Sana, reported that ""terrorists"" had shelled the route of the humanitarian corridor leading to the government-controlled al-Wafideen checkpoint, which is north-east of Douma, and were using ""human shields"". This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes Russian media said not a single civilian had left the besieged area as a result. The accusations of firing mortars was denied by the two Islamist rebel groups that dominate the Eastern Ghouta, Jaysh al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman, while the Syrian military said it had not carried out air strikes. Rebel factions also reiterated that jihadists from the al-Qaeda-linked alliance Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who have a small presence in the Eastern Ghouta, had offered to be evacuated in exchange for a truce. The government and Russia say their bombing campaign is targeting HTS members in the enclave. Russia said Syrian government forces would ""cease strikes on terrorists"" from 09:00 until 14:00 local time (07:00-12:00 GMT) daily from Tuesday ""with the aim of immediately saving the peaceful population"". Ambulances were seen waiting at the government-controlled al-Wafideen checkpoint One ""humanitarian corridor"" to al-Wafideen had been prepared, with help from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, to allow civilians to leave and the sick and wounded to be evacuated, it said. Residents would be informed via leaflets, text messages and videos, it added. Whether the daily ""pause"" is extended will ""depend on how the terrorist groups behave,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. Syrian women 'made to trade sex for aid' Boris Johnson's warning to Assad regime Who are Russia's shadowy mercenaries fighting in Syria? France's foreign minister said it was vital that humanitarian aid was delivered, but aid organisations - including the International Committee of the Red Cross - argue the time provided by the Russian initiative is not nearly enough. A tightening of the government's siege since November has led to the exhaustion of food supplies and extremely inflated prices inside the Eastern Ghouta. Almost 12% of children under five years old are acutely malnourished - a level the UN says is unprecedented in Syria. This video can not be played Rawaa has been living in a basement with around 75 others for months There are also severe shortages of medical supplies, with doctors forced to treat severely injured patients without general anaesthetic drugs, intravenous antibiotics, blood bags and clean bandages. Humanitarian organisations say they need to be sure any truces are taking effect on the ground before sending in aid workers and vehicles. Dr Mohamad Katoub, a Turkey-based doctor with the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which supports hospitals in the Eastern Ghouta and other rebel-held areas, told the BBC: ""We don't believe that this truce will bring any benefits for the civilians inside Eastern Ghouta. Five hours is not enough to do anything."" Firas Abdullah, a journalist for the pro-opposition Ghouta Media Center who lives in Douma, told the BBC on Tuesday that it was far too dangerous to venture outside, let alone try to reach the al-Wafideen checkpoint. ""I went outside but only for a while,"" Firas Abdullah said. ""After half a minute of this ceasefire, shells were dropped. Even if anyone tries to leave, he will be shot by the snipers of the regime checkpoint."" Al-Wafideen has long been the formal point for people to enter and exit Eastern Ghouta. However, only a small proportion of the population - public sector employees and males over 40 - were permitted to leave before the government siege was tightened, according to Reach Initiative, which is monitoring the humanitarian situation there. Women and children were reportedly forbidden by rebel groups from leaving for security reasons. Reach said risks included sniper fire, landmines, shelling, verbal and physical harassment, detention and, in the case of women, sexual harassment, humiliating inspections and beatings.

UK summons Russian ambassador over Syria,"The UN has accused the Syrian government of a ""monstrous campaign of annihilation"" The UK has urged Russia to put pressure on the Syrian regime to observe a UN-backed ceasefire in Eastern Ghouta and allow humanitarian access to the area. The Foreign Office summoned Russia's ambassador to express its ""deep concern"" over the siege of the city and the reported use of chemical weapons. It said all sides must strive for a political solution to the conflict. Boris Johnson has said force may be needed if there was ""incontrovertible"" evidence of use of chemical weapons. Speaking to the BBC earlier on Tuesday, the foreign secretary said he believed the use of illegal weapons should not go unpunished. Fighting continued in rebel-held Eastern Ghouta, an enclave near Damascus, despite the first daily five-hour ""pause"" ordered by the government's ally Russia. Syria conflict: Shelling as Eastern Ghouta 'pause' begins Why is there a war in Syria? Activists said there were government air and artillery strikes, while Russia said rebels had shelled a ""humanitarian corridor"" meant to let civilians leave. More than 500 people have been killed since last week in Eastern Ghouta, where activists on Sunday reported a suspected poison gas attack. After meeting Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko, Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan said brief humanitarian pauses were ""no substitute for a sustained ceasefire"". The Foreign Office said Mr Duncan had urged Moscow to use its influence to ensure the Syrian regime adheres to the ceasefire and allows ""rapid, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access and non-conditional medical evacuations which are urgently needed across Syria"". Earlier, the foreign secretary said while the West could not intervene to change the odds in favour of the rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime, he believed the use of illegal weapons had to be addressed. ""It's very important to recognise there's no military solution that we in the West can now impose,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The people listening to us in Eastern Ghouta cannot get the idea that the West is going to intervene to change the odds dramatically in their favour. ""But what I think we need to ask ourselves as a country - and I think what we in the West need to ask ourselves - is can we allow the use of chemical weapons, the use of these illegal weapons to go unreprieved, unchecked, unpunished? And I don't think we can."" He stressed: ""If there is incontrovertible evidence of the use of chemical weapons, verified by the Office of the Prevention of Chemical Weapons - if we know that it's happened and we can demonstrate it, and if there is a proposal for action where the UK could be useful, then I think we should seriously consider it."" On Saturday, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution calling for a 30-day ceasefire, but it did not set a specific start date. Russia said the five-hour pause in bombardment would run from 09:00 until 14:00 local time (07:00-12:00 GMT) daily. The Syrian Red Crescent would help set up the humanitarian corridor and residents would be informed about how to leave via leaflets, text messages and videos, it added.

NI 'may be part of EU customs territory',"The text will allude to a single regulatory space on the island of Ireland with no internal barriers, RTE says. Northern Ireland may be considered part of European Union customs territory post-Brexit,Irish national broadcaster RTE is reporting,external. It is part of a draft legal text to be published by the European Commission on Wednesday, RTE reports. The text will allude to a single regulatory space on the island of Ireland with no internal barriers, adds the broadcaster. The report cites ""a well-placed EU source"". The scenario would reflect the so-called ""default"" or ""backstop"" optioncontained in the December agreement between the EU and the UKon how to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. On Wednesday, the EU is expected to publish a text which will translate the political pledges made by both sides at the end of 2017 into legally-binding treaty language. It will concern only divorce-related issues - not the future relationship. No hard border in Ireland, No 10 insists Brexit: All you need to know Full text of the EU-UK statement,external Johnson's Irish border remarks lampooned Three separate well-placed sources have confirmed the general content of the draft to RTE News. According to RTE's sources, the draft text will also state that, under the backstop option, joint EU-UK customs teams will be required to apply checks on goods coming from the UK into the new regulatory space, but will not specify where those checks will take place. The text will also say that the two other options preferred by the UK to avoid a hard border are also available, and that if agreement is reached on those options, the above scenario would not apply. Those options include avoiding a hard border through a future EU-UK free trade agreement, or through specific proposals made by the UK government. It is understood that the draft will not spell out that Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market. However, that will be implied by a series of annexes which will say that individual pieces of EU single market legislation ""will be applicable"". The text will have considerable detail on how the movement of goods, north and south, will be facilitated without any border checks, RTE also reports. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has made clear if the Irish Sea became a de facto trade border, it would withdraw its support for the Conservative government. ""It would represent a break-up of the United Kingdom,"" the party's Sammy Wilson said. ""For the Irish government, which prattles on all of the time about the importance of the Belfast Agreement, - part of the Belfast Agreement was that there can be no change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. ""Yet here we now have the EU, prompted by the Irish government, seeking to bring about that constitutional change."" The DUP's 10 MPs are helping to keep Prime Minister Theresa May in power as part of a confidence and supply deal. Sinn FÃ©in's Chris Hazzard said he did not want to speculate what was in the document and the party would study it on Wednesday. ""But if reports are true that it has something around the north remaining within the customs union, this of course is to be welcomed. But it's only a start,"" he said. ""We need to have membership, not just of the customs union, but of the single market and we need to ensure our human rights are protected under the European courts of justice."" EU negotiator Michel Barnier said earlier that there would be ""no surprises"" in Wednesday's 120-page document. He said it was the EU's responsibility to include the ""backstop"" option of Northern Ireland maintaining full regulatory alignment with the Republic in areas of existing North-South co-operation if no other solutions could be made to work. While all three options would be mentioned in the 120-page document, he said it would be the backstop one which would be ""operationalised"" into legally binding text. The other options would be worked on as soon as the UK provided more details, he said. The paper would also set out the EU's position on the post-Brexit transition period, and would cover citizens' rights and financial issues too, he said. Meanwhile, the prime minister's office hascategorically dismissed any prospect of a return to a ""hard border"" in Ireland as a consequence of Brexit. The statement followed the leak of a letter to the prime minister from Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, in which he appeared to contemplate the possibility of future customs border checks, after the UK, including Northern Ireland leaves the EU customs union. A spokesman said: ""We have made it clear on numerous occasions we will not contemplate a hard border on the island of Ireland"". The leaked letter, obtained by Sky News, quoted Mr Johnson telling the prime minister the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland would continue to leave 95% of traffic to pass unchecked. Earlier,Mr Johnson was criticised after he likened the challenge of avoiding a hard border in Northern Irelandto the boundaries between different boroughs of London - implying a system similar to London's congestion charge could operate along the border. The foreign secretary said it was a ""very relevant comparison"" because money was ""invisibly"" taken from people travelling between Camden and Westminster when he was London mayor.

"No hard border in Ireland, No 10 insists","Wednesday's draft withdrawal treaty will set out the options for supporting cross-border trade and traffic Downing Street has dismissed any prospect of a return to a ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland after Brexit. It followed the leak of a letter from Boris Johnson in which he appeared to contemplate future customs border checks after the UK leaves the EU. In the letter, obtainedby Sky News,external, the foreign secretary tells Theresa May 95% of traffic would still pass unchecked if there was a hard border. It comes as the EU is set to publish a draft of its Brexit withdrawal treaty. The 120-page document, to be unveiled on Wednesday, will refer to three possible options for avoiding physical infrastructure on the Irish border but the only one to be fleshed out will be the government's least-favourite: Northern Ireland staying aligned with European rules and regulations. NI 'to be part of EU customs territory' Barnier: No open-ended Brexit transition Brexit: All you need to know The document, marking another major milestone on the UK's road to Brexit, will encapsulate in legally binding text agreements already reached on Ireland, citizens' rights and the UK's so-called ""divorce bill"". The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said it would form the basis of further negotiations with the UK in areas like the transition and could still be tweaked by the 27 remaining member states. According to reports by Irish broadcaster RTE, the text - which EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said will not contain any surprises - will say that Northern Ireland may be considered part of European Union customs territory after Brexit, alluding to a single regulatory space on the island of Ireland with no internal barriers. Earlier on Tuesday, the foreign secretary was criticised by opponents for suggesting in a BBC interview the issue of the border could be managed as easily as London's congestion charging zone. In his letter to the prime minister, Mr Johnson seeks to play down the ""exaggerated impression"" of ""how important checks are"" at EU external borders. He also appears to contemplate a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, writing: ""Even if a hard border is reintroduced, we would expect to see 95% + of goods pass the border [without] checks."" He may have thought he was being helpful. Boris Johnson was offering his views on how to deal with the thorny issue of the Irish border. But today he seemed to put both feet in it. First foot. He seemed to trivialise centuries of Irish history by suggesting the status of the Irish border was no more important than a borough boundary in London, where the congestion charge is policed electronically. Second, while his paper didn't contemplate new infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic he used the potentially toxic phrase ""if"" in connection with a hard border. This allowed opponents to suggest he - maybe even the government - was contemplating a regime of border checks that would be anathema to republicans and nationalists - and why No 10 moved so quickly to confirm the policy hadn't changed. As the old wartime adage goes ""Loose Lips Sink Ships"". Mr Johnson's loose language is unlikely to cost lives but could erode much needed goodwill just as the EU draws up a legal text on the post-Brexit Irish border which will also prove controversial. Following the letter's emergence, Labour called for Mr Johnson - one of the leading Brexiteers in the cabinet - to be dismissed ""before he can do any more damage"". ""This man's ego, and his Brexit at any cost strategy cannot be allowed to jeopardise peace,"" said shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith. A spokesman for Mr Johnson said the letter was ""designed to outline how a highly facilitated border would work and help to make a successful Brexit"". ""The letter points out there is a border now, and the task the (cabinet Brexit) committee face is stopping this becoming significantly harder,"" he said. ""It shows how we could manage a border without infrastructure or related checks and controls while protecting UK, Northern Ireland, Irish and EU interests."" He added: ""We will not accept any physical infrastructure at the border, and will instead seek alternatives that allow us to leave the customs union and take back control of our money, borders, laws and trading policy."" No 10 said it had made it clear ""on numerous occasions"" the UK government will not contemplate a hard border after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.

Mother and two sons 'among blast dead',"Mary Ragoobar and sons Sean Ragoobeer (left) and Shane Ragoobeer (right) are believed to be among the five victims A mother and two of her sons are believed to be among the five people who died in an explosion in Leicester. Mary Ragoobar, 46, and sons Shane, 18, and Sean, 17, lived in the flat above the shop in Hinckley Road which was destroyed in the blast on Sunday. Police said they are missing along with Shane's girlfriend Leah Beth Reek, 18, and Viktorija Ijevleva, 22, who was working in the shop at the time. Remains belonging to five people have been recovered from the wreckage. Leicestershire Police said given the ""devastation caused by the blast and fire"", it may be some ""considerable time"" before the bodies are formally identified. Live updates from the East Midlands Mrs Ragoobar's husband, Jose Ragoobeer, was working at the time of the explosion and received a phone call to say his youngest son had been taken to hospital. His employer, Lola Ojomo, said he was ""adored"" by his clients, who know him as ""Joe"". She described him as a ""very devoted"" father. Jose Ragoobeer's employer described him as ""very much a family man"" ""I don't know how he will recover from this,"" said Miss Ojomo, who is director of Pure HomeCare. ""He's very much a family man. I think his work and family were just it for him, that was his life. ""His remaining son is still critical. We don't even know if he's going to make it."" Mr Ragoobeer was with a client when he received the phone call about his son. ""He made sure the client was OK; that's the kind of person he is; then went off and communicated with us to say he was at the A&E with his son,"" said Miss Ojomo. ""He at the time didn't know what had happened to the other members of the family. I think he assumed they weren't in."" His colleagues are raising money for him through a crowd-funding page. Miss Ojomo said he was ""really humble and grateful that anybody is thinking about him"". A full search of the scene in Hinckley Road will take days, the emergency services have said Stanislav Stosiek, who went to English Martyrs Catholic School with Sean Ragoobeer, said he was a ""wonderful person"" who was ""smiling all the time"". He added: ""The fact he's just 17, not 18 - so young. He had so much ahead of him, so much. It really breaks my heart. ""He really liked spending time with friends at English Martyrs for sure. He had many close friends there that are mourning right now and I think they're all going to be devastated to hear he's dead."" Mr Stosiek said he was ""truly devastated"" for Sean's younger brother ""who miraculously survived"". ""I hope his brother recovers. And I hope for the sake of his father, who I don't know how he's going to deal with this, but I hope [he and his surviving son] recover and I hope the very best for them."" Leah Reek was Shane Ragoobeer's girlfriend and is believed to have been at the flat Five people were also taken to hospital after the blast, one of whom remains in hospital with life-threatening injuries. Specialist teams with experience of searching earthquake-hit buildings are being used in the search operation. This includes the use of dogs, cameras and listening equipment. But police said they did not expect to find any survivors and the operation had moved into the ""recovery"" phase. Buildings either side have also suffered structural damage Supt Shane O'Neill said: ""Tragically, all we are now looking for is any further human remains. ""This is vital work that is being done, on behalf of the victims and their families, and it will take some time to complete. ""People lost their lives on Sunday in the most horrific way. We need to understand why the building exploded."" The building consisted of a shop premises on the ground level and a two-storey flat above. The shop had gone through many owners but most recently was a Polish supermarket called Zabka. It is believed to have been trading since January. Flowers have been laid at the cordon on Hinckley Road A section of Hinckley Road is expected to remain closed throughout Tuesday. A public meeting held on Monday night was attended by residents and businesses. Matt Cane, group manager for Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service, said he could not rule out the possibility more bodies could be recovered from the scene. ""While we have no intelligence to suggest this is the case, we cannot rule out that possibility until the search is over,"" he said. Residents and businesses attended a public meeting at a primary school nearby Support is being provided by police family liaison officers to the families of the five people known to be missing, Leicestershire Police added. Leicester City Council has asked for flowers to be left near the front steps of the Westcotes United Reform Church in Hinckley Road. A rest centre, which was opened at St Anne's Church in Letchworth Road to support residents who had to leave their homes after the blast, has now been converted into a support and information centre.

Trump son-in-law's security clearance downgraded,"Mr Kushner will no longer receive a daily secret intelligence report President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has had his White House security clearance downgraded, US media are reporting. Mr Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, had been receiving top-level security briefings. However, background checks into Mr Kushner had still not been completed, so he had interim clearance only. He and other White House aides who have yet to receive permanent clearance will not now get top-level briefings. Mr Kushner, who is married to Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, had access to the President's Daily Brief, a secret intelligence report. The moves were confirmed by Mr Kushner's lawyer to Politico, and by two unnamed officials to the Reuters news agency. Politico reported that the 37-year-old was informed of the decision on Friday. Politico quoted Mr Kushner's lawyer Abbe Lowell,externalas saying that it would ""not affect Mr Kushner's ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the president"". A spokesperson for Mr Kushner told the BBC in a statement: ""Those involved in the process again have confirmed that there are dozens of people at Mr Kushner's level whose process is delayed, that it is not uncommon for these clearance reviews to take this long in a new administration, and that the current backlogs are now being addressed."" It comes as the White House moves to impose greater discipline on access to secrets. General John Kelly, Mr Trump's chief of staff, said earlier this month that he would be limiting the number of people with top-level security clearance. It emerged that the president's former staff secretary, Rob Porter, had been able to work with interim security clearance despite allegations of domestic abuse. The son-in-law with Donald Trump's ear The news of the change in Mr Kushner's status followed the announcement hours earlier that his spokesman Josh Raffel was to leave the White House. Meanwhile,the Washington Post reported,externalthat Mr Kushner's contacts with certain foreign government officials have raised concerns with the White House. The newspaper, citing current and former US officials familiar with intelligence reports on the matter, reported that officials in the United Arab Emirates, China, Israel and Mexico have privately discussed ways in which they could take advantage of Mr Kushner and his business arrangements. Mr Kushner was given a wide brief in his role as a White House adviser despite a lack of political experience. He was tasked with brokering a Middle East peace deal and liaising with Mexico. But he had faced problems with his background checks as he sought to obtain permanent security clearance. Who are the people around the president? The wealthy New York real estate developer had to refile the national security questionnaire required of all prospective White House employees after making a number of omissions. Last October, the head of the National Background Investigations Bureau told Congress he has ""never seen that level of mistakes"" on any security clearance application. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Jared Kushner, who according to the Washington Post had requested more information from the intelligence community,externalthan any White House employee not on the National Security Council, has had his wings clipped - at least for now. The administration may insist that Mr Kushner can continue to work on his sweeping portfolio of duties unhindered. His lawyer, Abbe Lowell, may say that this is a normal process and there are no concerns. The reality, however, is that this is an embarrassing development for the presidential son-in-law. He no longer has access to the presidential daily briefing. And, when dealing with foreign officials, he won't have the most sensitive information about their interests and actions. The problem for the White House could extend beyond just Mr Kushner, however. According to an NBC News report, as of November more than 130 administration employees were working under temporary security clearances, including Ivanka Trump and White House counsel Don McGahn. Mr Kushner may be the first, and one of the most influential, individuals to be revealed to have had a security downgrade - but he may not be the last. This video can not be played Jared Kushner has a long list of things to do And last week, it was reported that a senior Justice Department official had told the White House that their investigations would further delay Mr Kushner's security clearance. The information was reportedly passed on to the White House by Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who is overseeing the special counsel investigating possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Two weeks ago, US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said that presidential aides with interim security clearances should have only ""limited"" access to secret information.

Lewinsky: Clinton affair an abuse of power,"Ms Lewinsky and President Clinton had a sporadic affair which began in 1995 Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern who had an affair with former president Bill Clinton, has said their relationship constituted a ""gross abuse of power"" on his part. Ms Lewinsky was 22 when she became romantically involved with the then president, who was 27 years her senior. She has written an article for Vanity Fair magazine,external, reflecting on events after the #MeToo movement. She also revealed that she was diagnosed with PTSD after the scandal. The condition was caused by being ""publicly outed and ostracised"" as the affair unravelled in the press and courts, she says. News of their relationship dominated the US news agenda in 1998 and 1999, after the president initially denied it before admitting to ""inappropriate intimate physical contact"" with the former White House intern. Gillibrand: Bill Clinton should have resigned 1998 BBC archive report: Sex, lies and impeachment,external How #MeToo is exposing scale of abuse House Republicans impeached the president, arguing he had lied to federal investigators, but Mr Clinton was acquitted in the Senate. He remained in power until 2001. The scandal was triggered after a friend of Ms Lewinsky recorded their conversations detailing the affair In the magazine piece, Ms Lewinsky, now 44, says she stands by her 2014 comments that their relationship was consensual, but muses about the ""vast power differentials"" that existed between the two. Ms Lewinsky says she had ""limited understanding of the consequences"" at the time, and regrets the affair daily. ""The dictionary definition of ""consent""? To give permission for something to happen,"" she wrote. ""And yet what did the 'something' mean in this instance, given the power dynamics, his position, and my age?...He was my boss. He was the most powerful man on the planet. He was 27 years my senior, with enough life experience to know better."" Special prosecutor Kenneth Star tried to force Ms Lewinsky to testify against Mr Clinton Since re-emerging into the public eye in 2014,Ms Lewinsky has regularly spoken out publicly against cyberbullying, calling herself ""patient zero"" of the internet trend. In the Vanity Fair essay, she also discusses the growing movement of women publicly speaking out against sexual harassment and assault. She writes that she was moved to tears after being contacted by one of the leaders of the #MeToo movement, who expressed sympathy that Ms Lewinsky was ""so alone"" during the affair.

"Evidence not being disclosed, lawyers say","William's case, described below, was dismissed with no case the answer at the magistrates' court. More than 1,000 criminal lawyers in England and Wales have experienced disclosure of evidence failings in the last year, according to a BBC survey. Of the 1,282 who responded, almost a third said they believed such failings had led to possible wrongful convictions or miscarriages of justice. A number of recent rape trials have collapsed after it emerged evidence had not been shared with defence lawyers. The Crown Prosecution Service said the survey provided a ""skewed view"". In the lead-up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence. But more than half of lawyers surveyed said they saw disclosure failures on a daily or weekly basis. Hundreds of cases dropped over evidence disclosure failings All current rape cases 'urgently' reviewed 'I won't get 13 months spent in jail back' Police and prosecutors must also list relevant undisclosed or 'un-used' material which is not being cited as evidence, but which may undermine their case or strengthen the defence case. Last month, anurgent reviewinto all recent rape cases was announced by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders. William's case was dismissed at magistrates' court, with the CCTV footage cited as the reason. William works as a teacher and is married with grown up children. Last year, he was charged with sexual assault following a complaint from a 17-year-old girl. She claimed he touched her inappropriately in a local shop and the allegation was backed up by a friend. Her friend said she saw him approaching the teenager, his hand stretching forward to grope her. William denied the allegation. In police interview, William was told the CCTV taken in the shop was of poor quality and too far away to pick him out, but his defence solicitor, Abu Kibla, said seeing the evidence was crucial. He made six requests to the CPS to disclose the evidence, before receiving the footage three weeks before the trial. Mr Kibla described finally reviewing the CCTV as a ""eureka moment"". ""You can see he's standing there selecting a sandwich; nothing untoward happened, so clearly a massive piece of evidence, integral to the whole case."" At magistrates' court, the case was dismissed with no case to answer, citing the footage as the reason. Thames Valley Police said officers carried out a full investigation into the incident, and followed standard procedure throughout. The CPS said it was ""satisfied"" the case was dealt with correctly. ""The prosecution put their case, the defence make their arguments and the court makes their decision. That's the criminal justice system in action,"" it said. But William says the impact on his life has been huge. He is still suspended from teaching pending an internal investigation by his employer. ""I'm still nowhere near justice. It should never have made it to court. There was never any case to answer. ""Had I been found guilty, I would be permanently on a paedophile register. It's a life-changing allegation."" To date, most of the publicity has surrounded cases in the crown court. But half of those surveyed reported such failings in the magistrates' court - where the majority of crimes are dealt with. Bill Waddington of the Criminal Law Solicitors Association described the results as ""shocking"". ""It kills the rumour of these problems only happening in the occasional big case that happens to reach the headlines as we've seen recently. ""Rather than that the reality is that it's an every day, every week, every year problem"", he said. This video can not be played Liam Allan talks about what it is like being falsely accused of rape The criminal solicitors and barristers responded to the survey conducted by the BBC's File on 4 programme, in conjunction with three bodies who represent lawyers; the Criminal Law Solicitors' Association, The Criminal Bar Association and the London Criminal Courts Solicitors' Association. The BBC asked respondents for their experiences of the whole process - from initial collection of evidence through to court hearings. The CPS said the survey results were likely to provide a ""skewed view of what is happening"" given that respondents were likely to apply their own interpretation to what constitutes a ""disclosure failing"". It added that a conviction rate of 85% in the magistrates' courts is indicative of a system that is ""producing strong results"". Director of Legal Services Greg McGill said: ""I do accept that in some cases we do probably have to improve the timeliness in which we deal with some disclosure. ""Disclosure is a problem facing the whole of the criminal justice system. It's a criminal justice problem, and it requires a criminal justice system response"", he added.

"Transgender model to be Labour's LGBT adviserMunroe Bergdorf, who was sacked by L'Oreal over racism claims, says she's thrilled by the role.5h5 hours agoNewsbeat","Transgender model Munroe Bergdorf has become an LGBT adviser to Labour's women and equality minister Dawn Butler. Ms Butler said she was ""proud to stand with those challenging discrimination"". But Tory MP Helen Grant says language used by the model - who was sacked by L'Oreal over racism claims - ""damages the campaign to promote equality"". Munroe, who said she's ""thrilled"" to join Ms Butler's team, has since defended old comments made on Twitter. It was after Ms Grant urged the Labour MP to reconsider the appointment.

Munroe was the first transgender model to front a campaign for L'Orealbut was droppedin September after claims she posted racist comments online. She wrote a lengthy Facebook post which it's claimed included the comment: ""Honestly I don't have energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more. Yes ALL white people. ""Because most of ya'll don't even realise or refuse to acknowledge that your existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour. ""Your entire existence is drenched in racism."" The comments were later deleted. L'Oreal said her comments were ""at odds"" with their values and it ended its partnership with her.

Conservative MP Ms Grant has written to the Labour MP urging her to reconsider Munroe's appointment in light of the racism claims. Helen Grant has criticised the appointment In the letter, she also points out other posts by the model which she says are ""abhorrent slurs"". The posts, all from the past year, criticise suffragettes, gay male Conservatives and also make comments about racial issues. ""The kind of language Bergdorf has used has no place in public life, and ought to be condemned by all those who are serious about promoting equality,"" says Ms Grant. ""I urge you to reconsider your appointment of Munroe Bergdorf in light of these comments."" Munroe has since used Twitter to ""clarify"" her previous posts.

Gillibrand: Bill Clinton should have resigned 1998 BBC archive report: Sex, lies and impeachment,external How #MeToo is exposing scale of abuse House Republicans impeached the president, arguing he had lied to federal investigators, but Mr Clinton was acquitted in the Senate. He remained in power until 2001. The scandal was triggered after a friend of Ms Lewinsky recorded their conversations detailing the affair In the magazine piece, Ms Lewinsky, now 44, says she stands by her 2014 comments that their relationship was consensual, but muses about the ""vast power differentials"" that existed between the two. Ms Lewinsky says she had ""limited understanding of the consequences"" at the time, and regrets the affair daily. ""The dictionary definition of ""consent""? To give permission for something to happen,"" she wrote. ""And yet what did the 'something' mean in this instance, given the power dynamics, his position, and my age?...He was my boss. He was the most powerful man on the planet. He was 27 years my senior, with enough life experience to know better."" Special prosecutor Kenneth Star tried to force Ms Lewinsky to testify against Mr Clinton Since re-emerging into the public eye in 2014,Ms Lewinsky has regularly spoken out publicly against cyberbullying, calling herself ""patient zero"" of the internet trend. In the Vanity Fair essay, she also discusses the growing movement of women publicly speaking out against sexual harassment and assault. She writes that she was moved to tears after being contacted by one of the leaders of the #MeToo movement, who expressed sympathy that Ms Lewinsky was ""so alone"" during the affair.

Diesel car ban approved for German cities,"The ruling sets a precedent for all German cities German cities will be allowed to ban older diesel vehicles from some areas following a landmark court ruling. The Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig said the cities of Stuttgart and Duesseldorf could legally ban older, more polluting diesel cars from zones worst affected by pollution. The ruling sets a precedent for other cities and analysts said it could lead to similar action across Europe. The government, which had opposed the bans, said they could still be avoided. The ruling by a top federal court came after German states had appealed against bans imposed by local courts in Stuttgart and Duesseldorf. The environmental group DUH brought the cases after about 70 German cities exceeded European Union limits for nitrogen oxides (NOx) last year. Diesel emissions containing nitrogen oxides can cause respiratory disease. The likelihood now is that the German government will rush to introduce some sort of national policy, to ensure at least some level of consistency across the country. It's not just about Germany either - cities across Europe are struggling to meet EU air quality standards, and may well see the German ruling as setting a precedent. New diesel cars won't be affected, but that's not really the point. Consumers are already moving away from the technology - and the prospect of city bans will only accelerate that process. So diesel's decline is likely to gather momentum. That's a problem for the industry, because while diesels produce high levels of nitrogen oxide - a major urban pollutant - they emit relatively low levels of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. So moves to control one environmental problem may end up undermining efforts to combat another - unless we all start driving electric cars very soon. Diesel vehicles have faced greater scrutiny since VW's ""dieselgate"" scandal. In September 2015, the car maker admitted it had used illegal softwareto cheat US emissions tests. Some 11 million cars worldwide ended up being affected by the scandal. DUH said it hoped the bans in German cities would end the industry's ""resistance"" to refitting older, more-polluting cars to meet the latest EU standards. ClientEarth, an environmental law firm that worked on the case, said the win was ""a tremendous result for people's health in Germany and may have an impact even further afield"". Lead clean air lawyer Ugo Taddei said: ""This ruling gives long-awaited legal clarity that diesel restrictions are legally permissible and will unavoidably start a domino effect across the country, with implications for our other legal cases."" Diesel vehicles have faced greater scrutiny since VW's ""dieselgate"" scandal Refit costs The impact on German drivers could be marked, with millions being forced to leave their cars at home on days when harmful emissions are particularly high. It could also depress the value of diesel cars affected by the ban. Of the 15 million diesel cars on Germany's roads, only 2.7 million meet the latest Euro-6 standards, according to data from Germany's automotive watchdog. Car companies could also incur huge costs to refit vehicles at a time when consumer interest in diesel is falling. The market share for diesel vehicles in Germany fell from 48% in 2015 to around 39% last year. Seeking to reassure car owners, the government insisted that nothing would change right away and stressed that bans were not inevitable. ""The court has not issued any driving bans but created clarity about the law,"" said Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks. ""Driving bans can be avoided, and my goal is and will remain that they do not come into force,"" she added. Chancelor Angela Merkel also weighed in, saying the ruling concerned only ""individual cities"". ""It's really not about the entire country and all car owners,"" she said. Seeking to avert bans, German car makers have pledged software improvements for millions of diesel cars and offered trade-in incentives for older models. The German government meanwhile has floated alternatives, such as making public transport free in cities suffering from poor air quality. Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have all pledged to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025, while the mayor of Copenhagen wants to ban new diesel cars from entering the city as soon as next year. Carmakers including VW-owned Porsche and Toyota have also signalled they will move away from diesel technology. Analysts at Evercore ISI said the latest German ruling had ""set a strong precedent for similar action across Europe"". ""Note, the judge previously commented that the EU has clear rules on emissions and cities have a 'duty' to meet pollution targets.""

"Evidence not being disclosed, lawyers sayFailings may have led to wrongful convictions or miscarriages of justice, they say in a survey.","William's case, described below, was dismissed with no case the answer at the magistrates' court. More than 1,000 criminal lawyers in England and Wales have experienced disclosure of evidence failings in the last year, according to a BBC survey. Of the 1,282 who responded, almost a third said they believed such failings had led to possible wrongful convictions or miscarriages of justice. A number of recent rape trials have collapsed after it emerged evidence had not been shared with defence lawyers. The Crown Prosecution Service said the survey provided a ""skewed view"". In the lead-up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence. But more than half of lawyers surveyed said they saw disclosure failures on a daily or weekly basis. Hundreds of cases dropped over evidence disclosure failings All current rape cases 'urgently' reviewed 'I won't get 13 months spent in jail back' Police and prosecutors must also list relevant undisclosed or 'un-used' material which is not being cited as evidence, but which may undermine their case or strengthen the defence case. Last month, anurgent reviewinto all recent rape cases was announced by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders. William's case was dismissed at magistrates' court, with the CCTV footage cited as the reason. William works as a teacher and is married with grown up children. Last year, he was charged with sexual assault following a complaint from a 17-year-old girl. She claimed he touched her inappropriately in a local shop and the allegation was backed up by a friend. Her friend said she saw him approaching the teenager, his hand stretching forward to grope her. William denied the allegation. In police interview, William was told the CCTV taken in the shop was of poor quality and too far away to pick him out, but his defence solicitor, Abu Kibla, said seeing the evidence was crucial. He made six requests to the CPS to disclose the evidence, before receiving the footage three weeks before the trial. Mr Kibla described finally reviewing the CCTV as a ""eureka moment"". ""You can see he's standing there selecting a sandwich; nothing untoward happened, so clearly a massive piece of evidence, integral to the whole case."" At magistrates' court, the case was dismissed with no case to answer, citing the footage as the reason. Thames Valley Police said officers carried out a full investigation into the incident, and followed standard procedure throughout. The CPS said it was ""satisfied"" the case was dealt with correctly. ""The prosecution put their case, the defence make their arguments and the court makes their decision. That's the criminal justice system in action,"" it said. But William says the impact on his life has been huge. He is still suspended from teaching pending an internal investigation by his employer. ""I'm still nowhere near justice. It should never have made it to court. There was never any case to answer. ""Had I been found guilty, I would be permanently on a paedophile register. It's a life-changing allegation."" To date, most of the publicity has surrounded cases in the crown court. But half of those surveyed reported such failings in the magistrates' court - where the majority of crimes are dealt with. Bill Waddington of the Criminal Law Solicitors Association described the results as ""shocking"". ""It kills the rumour of these problems only happening in the occasional big case that happens to reach the headlines as we've seen recently. ""Rather than that the reality is that it's an every day, every week, every year problem"", he said. This video can not be played Liam Allan talks about what it is like being falsely accused of rape The criminal solicitors and barristers responded to the survey conducted by the BBC's File on 4 programme, in conjunction with three bodies who represent lawyers; the Criminal Law Solicitors' Association, The Criminal Bar Association and the London Criminal Courts Solicitors' Association. The BBC asked respondents for their experiences of the whole process - from initial collection of evidence through to court hearings. The CPS said the survey results were likely to provide a ""skewed view of what is happening"" given that respondents were likely to apply their own interpretation to what constitutes a ""disclosure failing"". It added that a conviction rate of 85% in the magistrates' courts is indicative of a system that is ""producing strong results"". Director of Legal Services Greg McGill said: ""I do accept that in some cases we do probably have to improve the timeliness in which we deal with some disclosure. ""Disclosure is a problem facing the whole of the criminal justice system. It's a criminal justice problem, and it requires a criminal justice system response"", he added.

NI 'to be part of EU customs territory',"The text will allude to a single regulatory space on the island of Ireland with no internal barriers, RTE says. Northern Ireland may be considered part of European Union customs territory post-Brexit,Irish national broadcaster RTE is reporting,external. It is part of a draft legal text to be published by the European Commission on Wednesday, RTE reports. The text will allude to a single regulatory space on the island of Ireland with no internal barriers, adds the broadcaster. The report cites ""a well-placed EU source"". The scenario would reflect the so-called ""default"" or ""backstop"" optioncontained in the December agreement between the EU and the UKon how to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. On Wednesday, the EU is expected to publish a text which will translate the political pledges made by both sides at the end of 2017 into legally-binding treaty language. It will concern only divorce-related issues - not the future relationship. No hard border in Ireland, No 10 insists Brexit: All you need to know Full text of the EU-UK statement,external Johnson's Irish border remarks lampooned Three separate well-placed sources have confirmed the general content of the draft to RTE News. According to RTE's sources, the draft text will also state that, under the backstop option, joint EU-UK customs teams will be required to apply checks on goods coming from the UK into the new regulatory space, but will not specify where those checks will take place. The text will also say that the two other options preferred by the UK to avoid a hard border are also available, and that if agreement is reached on those options, the above scenario would not apply. Those options include avoiding a hard border through a future EU-UK free trade agreement, or through specific proposals made by the UK government. It is understood that the draft will not spell out that Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market. However, that will be implied by a series of annexes which will say that individual pieces of EU single market legislation ""will be applicable"". The text will have considerable detail on how the movement of goods, north and south, will be facilitated without any border checks, RTE also reports. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has made clear if the Irish Sea became a de facto trade border, it would withdraw its support for the Conservative government. ""It would represent a break-up of the United Kingdom,"" the party's Sammy Wilson said. ""For the Irish government, which prattles on all of the time about the importance of the Belfast Agreement, - part of the Belfast Agreement was that there can be no change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. ""Yet here we now have the EU, prompted by the Irish government, seeking to bring about that constitutional change."" The DUP's 10 MPs are helping to keep Prime Minister Theresa May in power as part of a confidence and supply deal. Sinn FÃ©in's Chris Hazzard said he did not want to speculate what was in the document and the party would study it on Wednesday. ""But if reports are true that it has something around the north remaining within the customs union, this of course is to be welcomed. But it's only a start,"" he said. ""We need to have membership, not just of the customs union, but of the single market and we need to ensure our human rights are protected under the European courts of justice."" EU negotiator Michel Barnier said earlier that there would be ""no surprises"" in Wednesday's 120-page document. He said it was the EU's responsibility to include the ""backstop"" option of Northern Ireland maintaining full regulatory alignment with the Republic in areas of existing North-South co-operation if no other solutions could be made to work. While all three options would be mentioned in the 120-page document, he said it would be the backstop one which would be ""operationalised"" into legally binding text. The other options would be worked on as soon as the UK provided more details, he said. The paper would also set out the EU's position on the post-Brexit transition period, and would cover citizens' rights and financial issues too, he said. Meanwhile, the prime minister's office hascategorically dismissed any prospect of a return to a ""hard border"" in Ireland as a consequence of Brexit. The statement followed the leak of a letter to the prime minister from Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, in which he appeared to contemplate the possibility of future customs border checks, after the UK, including Northern Ireland leaves the EU customs union. A spokesman said: ""We have made it clear on numerous occasions we will not contemplate a hard border on the island of Ireland"". The leaked letter, obtained by Sky News, quoted Mr Johnson telling the prime minister the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland would continue to leave 95% of traffic to pass unchecked. Earlier,Mr Johnson was criticised after he likened the challenge of avoiding a hard border in Northern Irelandto the boundaries between different boroughs of London - implying a system similar to London's congestion charge could operate along the border. The foreign secretary said it was a ""very relevant comparison"" because money was ""invisibly"" taken from people travelling between Camden and Westminster when he was London mayor.

Fox warning of customs union 'sellout',"This video can not be played Liam Fox: UK doesn't need a fairy godmother Any form of customs union with the EU after Brexit would be a ""complete sellout"" for the UK, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has said. The UK would find itself in a ""worse position"" than it is now, he said, if it left the existing arrangement but negotiated a similar new one. Having to accept EU rules and limits on doing other deals would make the UK ""less attractive"", he said. But his former top official has criticised the government's strategy. Sir Martin Donnelly, who was permanent secretary in the Department for International Trade until last year, said any deals done after Brexit would not compensate for leaving the single market and the customs union. Giving up access to the EU market and its existing trade agreements was ""rather like rejecting a three course meal now in favour of the promise of a packet of crisps later"", he said. Congestion charge 'shows way for NI border' Corbyn backs customs union membership Reality Check: How much of the UK's trade is with the EU? Sir Martin, who has previously warned about leaving the single market and has worked for the European Commission in the past, said that negotiating full access to the single market without accepting EU rules would require a ""fairy godmother specialised in trade law"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he did ""not agree for a moment"" with Sir Martin's verdict, because the ""real growth opportunities"" were outside the EU. Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a long-term customs union, as Labour has proposed, would lead to ""colony status for the UK"", which would not get a say in trade policy. The customs union means there are no internal tariffs And Mr Fox hit back at Sir Martin as he took questions after his speech, saying it was ""unsurprising that those who spend a lifetime working in the European Union see moving away from the European Union as being threatening"". He added: ""The UK Brexit process is, as we've all discovered, a little more complex than a packet of Walkers."" The government has said it wants a customs agreement with the EU - which is the UK's single largest trading partner accounting for 43% of exports - but one that does not stop it from doing free trade deals with other countries. Mr Fox, one of the most prominent Brexiteers in the cabinet, is the latest minister to set out his stall as part of the government's attempt to map out ""the road to Brexit"", which is due to happen in March 2019. His speech came the day after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn set out his approach to Brexit, saying he backed the UK being in a ""new and comprehensive"" customs union with the EU. Laura Kuenssberg on Labour's position Coveney of 'one mind' with EU negotiators Brexit: All you need to know Mr Corbyn says a new customs union will help protect existing jobs and supply chains while giving the UK a say in future deals negotiated by the EU. But Mr Fox rejected this, saying the UK would have to cede ""considerable control"" of its trade policy to Brussels in any customs union. In his speech, at Bloomberg in London, Mr Fox said that changing economic and trade patterns meant the EU was a less significant partner than 15 years ago and the UK must have the freedom to exploit the ""opportunities of the future"", particularly in services and digital industries. ""As rule takers, without any say in how the rules were made, we would be in a worse position than we are today,"" he said. ""It would be a complete sellout of Britain's national interests."" Citing Turkey's experience of being outside the EU but joined in a customs union with it, he  said that if the UK found itself unable to set its own rules in key sectors of the economy, this would ""remove the bulk of incentives"" for other countries to enter into comprehensive free trade agreements. ""The inevitable price of trying to negotiate with one arm tied behind our back is that we would become less attractive to potential trade partners and forfeit many of the opportunities that would otherwise be available."" UK 'could join Pacific free trade zone' Brexit UK 'won't be Mad Max-style world' Japan warns on Brexit 'high stakes' Flexibility, he said, must be the basis of the UK's trade policy if it is to support the fledgling industries that will provide much of the employment and income of the future. ""There is a growing awareness that a full-blown gold-plated free trade agreement may not be the only solution in a fast-changing global economy,"" he said. There is a ""global trade toolbox"" of different options, including ""multi-country alliances of the like-minded"", he said. ""All of these options are available. But only to countries with independent trade policies."" Labour said it made more sense for the UK to be negotiating new trade deals alongside the EU, adding: ""Liam Fox is divorced from reality and isolated from British businesses and workers."" But Conservative MP Nigel Evans told BBC 2's Daily Politics: ""When you're doing trade deals between one country and another country, it's a lot easier than when you're doing it with somebody representing 28 countries."" Meanwhile former World Trade Organisation chief Pascal Lamy argued that whatever Brexit option was chosen ""will necessitate a border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic. ""There will have to be a border"", he told the Commons Brexit committee, because checks will have to be carried out on goods and people. He suggested a ""Macau option"" for Northern Ireland. ""You should think about giving to Northern Ireland the same autonomous trade capacity that China has given to Macau, which doesn't mean that Macau doesn't belong to China,"" he said. The European Commission will publish the first draft of its proposed withdrawal treaty on Wednesday, which it wants both sides to agree to by the autumn to allow for an orderly departure.

Driver 'hit woman in anti-Muslim attack',"Paul Moore is also accused of deliberately driving his car at a 12-year-old Somali girl in Butterwick Drive A motorist deliberately drove into a Somali woman twice in an anti-Muslim attack days after a bomb blast in London, a court heard. Zaynab Hussein was hit by Paul Moore's car in Leicester, moments before he tried to drive at a Somali girl, 12, Nottingham Crown Court was told. Mr Moore, 21, set out to kill five days after the Parsons Green Tube attack last September, prosecutors said. Mr Moore denies attempted murder but does not deny being the driver. Live updates from the East Midlands Prosecutor Jonathan Straw said the defendant, of Letchworth Road, Leicester, struck Ms Hussein, who was wearing a hijab, in Acer Close, and subsequently drove over again seconds later. The attack, on 20 September last year, was ""purely because of the colour of her skin"" and her ""perceived Islamic faith"", Mr Straw said. ""It is no coincidence, we say, that there had been a bomb at Parsons Green Tube station in London, said to have been carried out by sympathisers of Islamic State,"" he told the court. Mr Moore also denies attempted grievous bodily harm with intent, dangerous driving and driving above the legal alcohol limit. He told friends in the car he wanted to run someone over and laughed after hitting Ms Hussein, the jury heard. In a statement to police, Ms Hussein described how she was thrown into the wall of a nearby house by the impact of the crash. ""When I hit the floor, I saw blood coming from my forehead,"" the court heard. ""I remember shouting for help but nobody was around, I tried to get up, but could not.  I didn't have any feeling in my right arm and I thought it might have been broken. ""So, I tried to reach for my mobile with my left hand, but could not find any feeling in my left arm."" Ms Hussein was taken to hospital with severe fractures to her pelvis, spine and breaks to her limbs. After months of specialist treatment, she remains confined to bed. The jury was told, after targeting Ms Hussein, Mr Moore went on to try to hit the Somali girl on her way to school, in nearby Butterwick Drive.

Judge Overbury added both had a ""darker side"" and were involved in ""systematic abuse of a teenage boy"". Danielle Perrett was in her 20s at the time of the assaults, according to police According to her website, Perrett has performed across the globe in North America, South East Asia, and the Middle East Her recordings have featured on The Today Programme and Women's Hour She taught at the London College of Music and for 25 years taught musicianship and harp at the Royal College of Music junior department She won ""several"" awards from the Arts Council of Great Britain During a four-week trial, the court heard that Barton-Wood was a substitute teacher at the school the boy, now an adult, attended in his early teens.

Man arrested over house fire deaths,"Two fire engines from Lisnaskea and one from Enniskillen helped put out the fire A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after three people died in a house fire in Derrylin, County Fermanagh. The 27-year-old man was brought to hospital for treatment prior to his arrest. The victims are believed to have been members of the same family and it's understood that at least one of those who died was a child. Police officers were called to the house on Molly Road at about 07:20 GMT. Police believe the fire was started deliberately, said Supt Jane Humphries. She appealed for anyone travelling through Derrylin between midnight and 07:20 on Tuesday to get in touch. Earlier, police said the emergency services were carrying out an ""extensive examination"" of the whitewashed rural bungalow to establish the cause of the blaze and determine if anyone else was involved. At the scene:  BBC News NI's Louise Cullen The roof of the house has caved in and smoke is still rising from the property. The emergency services are at the scene as investigations continue to establish the cause of the fire. I understand the family who rented the property have only been in the area for the past 12 to 18 months. Firefighters said they were called to a ""well-developed fire in a detached bungalow"" near the border with the Irish Republic before 07:15 on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content?

Two fire engines from Lisnaskea and one from Enniskillen attended the incident. The fire has now been put out. It's thought that the people who lived in the house were originally from England. Firefighters at the scene of the blaze Fermanagh Sinn FÃ©in councillor Barry Doherty said it's understood those who died were generations of the one family. Mr Doherty said a neighbour raised the alarm and had tried to break down the door with a sledgehammer. Pictures of the scene show the roof of the house had been destroyed by the blaze, leaving a shell of the bungalow, which is surrounded by farm buildings and machinery. Fire engines and police cars have been coming and going from the scene for most of the day. Michelle Gildernew, Sinn FÃ©in MP for the area, said the neighbours who made rescue attempts had undergone a horrendous ordeal. ""They are badly shaken. They weren't able to get into the house,"" she said. ""As somebody who goes to a house in good faith to try and help people and people die, that is horrendous. It's hard to take."" Asked about their efforts, she said she understood they tried to use a sledgehammer ""and tried to break a window to gain access but weren't able to do that."" Mrs Gildernew added: I just feel that there are people who are going to need support after this tragedy in how they deal with it."" The road leading to the scene of the blaze has been closed to traffic Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster, the MLA for Fermanagh South Tyrone, said: ""Horrific news coming from Derrylin, County Fermanagh, this morning. ""My thoughts and prayers are with the family and local community."" Ulster Unionist MLA Rosemary Barton said: ""This is a close-knit community and there will be a huge sense of loss felt within the community, but particularly to the family concerned.

Trump unveils re-election campaign chief,"Brad Parscale was digital director during the Trump campaign US President Donald Trump has picked one of his political strategists as campaign manager for his 2020 re-election campaign. The Trump Organization hired Brad Parscale in 2011 as a digital guru. He was asked in 2015 to create a website for Mr Trump's exploratory White House bid and a year later became the campaign's digital director. This is thought to be the earliest any incumbent US president has officially declared his re-election campaign. There are 979 days to go until the 2020 election. President Barack Obama announced his re-election plans 582 days before his 2012 bid for a second term. How much has Trump achieved so far? The president's son, Eric Trump, said in a press release on Tuesday: ""Brad is an amazing talent and was pivotal to our success in 2016. ""He has our family's complete trust and is the perfect person to be at the helm of the campaign."" The president's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, said in a statement: ""Brad was essential in bringing a disciplined technology and data-driven approach to how the 2016 campaign was run. ""His leadership and expertise will be help [sic] build a best-in-class campaign."" Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter He's a man eager to tell his story. That was the impression that Brad Parscale made in December 2016 when he walked through the Trump Tower lobby in New York. When I asked what he knew about the new administration, he joked: ""I know everything."" He explained how he'd helped win the election (they knocked on a lot of doors) and yet had gone virtually unnoticed at the Republican National Convention: ""No one knew I existed."" He came across as a bit of a show off, a fatal flaw in Trumpian politics (the president doesn't like it when someone steals thunder). Later I saw Mr Parscale on 60 Minutes, explaining how he'd used Facebook to help Trump win. Mr Parscale likes attention, and he's got it now: the president - and many others - will be watching his next move closely. Mr Parscale, 42, of San Antonio, Texas, has been targeted by Democrats investigating alleged Russian meddling in the US election. He was interviewed behind closed doors last year by the House Intelligence Committee inquiry into the matter. Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia story - in 199 words Mr Parscale said he had told lawmakers he had no knowledge of the alleged Kremlin plot to influence the campaign in favour of Mr Trump. Last July, he tweeted: ""I am unaware of any Russian involvement in the digital and data operations of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign."" Mr Parscale told a CBS 60 Minutes programme last year that his 100-strong digital team created up to 60,000 ads on Facebook to reach Trump supporters every day. But he said Mr Trump had rebuked him because he was sceptical about digital ad spending. Mr Parscale said Mr Trump shouted at him: ""I don't believe in this mumbo-jumbo digital stuff."" This video can not be played What the world thinks of Trump The digital guru's firm, Giles-Parscale, billed the Trump campaign $94m for its work on the election, according to US media. Mr Parscale told 60 Minutes he projected Mr Trump's eventual path to victory in the US Midwest. ""I took every nickel and dime I could out of anywhere else,"" he said. ""And I moved it to Michigan and Wisconsin."" Mr Parscale hired the British data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica to work for the Trump campaign. On Tuesday,the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica was grilled by British MPsover its role in the US election and Brexit. The firm - which claims to have up to 5,000 data points on every adult in the US - is credited by some with helping Mr Trump win the presidency. The Republican president quietly filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission shortly after his inauguration last year to form a committee for a re-election bid. Has Trump kept his promises? The campaign fundraising has been ongoing, gathering $22m (Â£16m) by the end of 2017. It is little surprise that an incumbent US president would run for a second term. ""Of course he's running for re-election,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in June 2017 during a press briefing.

Ryanair to axe Glasgow Airport base,"Ryanair will add 11 new routes to its Edinburgh schedule Ryanair is to close its base at Glasgow Airport, warning that 300 jobs could go as a result. The airline, which also operates out of Prestwick, Edinburgh and Aberdeen, will cut the number of routes out of Glasgow from 23 to just three. Chief commercial officer David O'Brien blamed the change on the cost of air passenger duty and said Glasgow ""simply could not bear the burden"". Glasgow Airport said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" by Ryanair's decision. A spokesman for the airport said there was ""no doubt"" that the failure to replace air passenger duty (APD) with a cheaper air departure tax (ADT) in Scotland was behind the move. Scottish air passenger duty changes hit snag Military help Prestwick reduce losses Ryanair to begin flying from Glasgow The Scottish government said it remained committed to reducing APD by 50%, but that there were still issues to be resolved before this could be introduced. Ryanair made the announcement as it unveiled its schedule for winter 2018, confirming that only its services to Dublin, Wroclaw and Krakow would continue from Glasgow. The company said 11 new routes would be added to its Edinburgh schedule. Edinburgh will benefit from Ryanair's decision to close its Glasgow Airport base Ryanair has had to be nicer about its passengers of late. Addressing them as suckers for low fares could only get the airline so far. But it remains ruthless in its treatment of airports. For many - Prestwick included - it's the only passenger airline, and it's not afraid to use that leverage. So why abandon Glasgow as a base? Chief commercial officer David O'Brien talked a lot about Air Departure Tax (the Holyrood-controlled rebrand of Air Passenger Duty). He also said it had to do with Brexit. It's not immediately obvious why either should be the reason, when Edinburgh and Glasgow are equally affected. Ryanair's view is that Glasgow's market sustains lower prices and delivers tighter margins, so the impact of flat-rate ADT is proportionately larger than in Edinburgh. But the removal of Glasgow as a base for one aircraft is more of a signal of what could follow if there's no movement on air tax, and if there's no deal on ""open skies""' across Europe post-Brexit. It's a message to governments in Holyrood, Westminster and (if it reconvenes) in Stormont. There's no pledge to boost flights if the tax is cut or removed, but Ryanair is experienced across Europe at using carrot and stick to get its way. There are other factors, which have come to the fore since Edinburgh and Glasgow were forced apart by the competition regulator and under different ownership from 2012 they began to compete. The capital's airport has better ground transport, having quick links not only to the city, but to the M8 and M9. Edinburgh travel time for Lanarkshire and east Glasgow can rival Glasgow Airport, to the west, particularly around traffic peaks. And as Ryanair has pivoted from offering cheap flights to the sun to become a major inbound carrier of tourism and business flyers, it has found that the Edinburgh brand is significantly stronger with foreign visitors. Mr O'Brien said: ""Sadly the weaker Scottish market is even weaker still in Glasgow, which simply can't bear the burden of APD at Â£13. ""This should not come as a surprise to the government, we did say that our growth in Glasgow was based on their promise to abolish APD, which morphed into a promise to half APD, which suddenly has disappeared into the ether and quite frankly we don't have any more patience. ""There are other markets in the UK and Europe which offer a more compelling proposition."" Mr O'Brien added: ""Passengers mean jobs and around 500,000 passengers will be lost at Glasgow, pressurising around 300 jobs which will probably be lost. ""The flipside is that you're looking at around 700 jobs being introduced to Edinburgh."" Glasgow International Airport will see a reduction in the number of routes operated by Ryanair Mr O'Brien also said that Brexit was a threat to Scottish tourism and the airline industry in general. The Scottish government unveiled plans to replace air passenger duty with a cheaper air departure tax in 2017. However, the plans have yet to be implemented andrequire EU approval under state aid rules. A spokesman for Glasgow Airport said: ""We are bitterly disappointed at this decision by Ryanair which is not only damaging for Glasgow and wider Scottish connectivity, it will impact approximately 100 jobs locally. ""This is a result of the airline's review of its single aircraft bases. However, we have been left in no doubt it is also a consequence of the Scottish government's inability to introduce its proposed 50% cut in air departure tax. ""Despite clear and repeated warnings from both airports and airlines about the potential impact of this policy not being implemented, we are now faced with a stark scenario that includes the loss of 20 services and a significant number of jobs."" Usain Bolt to finally make Old Trafford debut Addicted to selfies: I take 200 snaps a dayRyanair to axe Glasgow Airport base Rare photographs that changed lives Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay described the news as ""very disappointing"" and said uncertainly around Brexit was having a ""negative impact"" on route development in Scotland. ""We will continue to work  to work in partnership with Ryanair and other airlines, and to support all Scottish airports, to do everything possible to grow the number of international routes to and from Scotland,"" he said. ""The Scottish government continues to be committed to reducing ADT by 50% by the end of this parliament and we want to get on and deliver this. ""But this has been deferred until the issues raised in relation to the Highlands and Islands exemption have been resolved to ensure that the devolved powers are not compromised."" In future Ryanair will host 45 routes from Edinburgh, including the 11 new routes. The airline's summer schedule will operate as planned out of Glasgow. Ryanair opened its base at Glasgow Airport in autumn 2014, one of several new bases opened across Europe that year. At the time it said it remained committed to Prestwick Airport and would continue to offer flights from there.

Merkel enters 'Germans only' food row,"Police are trying to find out who sprayed ""Nazis"" graffiti on the vans German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the latest politician to criticise a major food bank's decision to bar foreigners from receiving free food. The charity Essener Tafel called it a temporary restriction necessary because the share of foreigners using the food bank had soared to 75% in recent years. The charity says it helps about 16,000 poor people in Essen, a city in the western industrial Ruhr region. Vandals have sprayed ""Nazis"" on the charity's delivery vans. Foreigners registered for the handouts before Essener Tafel's new rule took effect last month can still use the food bank. Mrs Merkel spoke out against the requirement to show a German passport in order to receive food. ""One shouldn't run services on the basis of such categorisations. That's not good. But it also shows the amount of pressure there is, and how many people are needy. That's why I hope they can find good solutions which do not exclude groups,"" Mrs Merkel told the broadcaster RTL. An estimated 1.2 million asylum seekers entered Germany during the migrant crisis of 2015-2016, more than half from war-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. The record influx boosted support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Essener Tafel is part of a national food bank group called Tafel. Essen is part of Germany's old coal-and-steel hub in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) state. The far-right AfD defended the charity's policy on Facebook (in German),external, saying ""if you fight back, you're a Nazi"". Essener Tafel's centre - it has smaller outlets across the city Like hundreds of other German food banks, Essener Tafel collects tonnes of surplus food at or past its sell-by date, which would otherwise be thrown away. The charity's managers are holding an emergency meeting to tackle the row over its new policy, which took effect last month.

Golden Dawn delivers 'Greeks only' food Essener Tafel head JÃ¶rg Sartor spoke angrily about the criticism. ""A load of politicians are laying into us now - but they are ill-informed. They ought to reciprocate and help out here - after that they can voice an opinion, by all means."" He defended his staff and said he was ""sick and tired"" of the criticism. ""I'm almost ready to quit,"" he said. Earlier, he said the restriction had nothing to do with xenophobia; he said it was all about fairness, because large numbers of elderly women and single mothers had stopped coming to Essener Tafel. Data from Germany's national migration agency BAMF shows that NRW has the highest number of asylum claims,externalamong the German states. In January NRW handled 19.9% of claims, followed by Bavaria (15.1%). Asylum claims in Germany soared to a record 745,545 in 2016, but fell back to 222,683 in 2017. A new EU border agreement with Turkey, and new border fences, drastically cut the numbers of migrants heading to Central Europe via the Balkan route.

Village votes to keep 'Hitler bell',"Some residents are now worried that the bell could draw neo-Nazi groups to the village A village in Germany has voted to keep a controversial church bell embossed with a swastika and the words ""All for the Fatherland - Adolf Hitler"". The parish council of Herxheim argued that the Nazi-era bronze bell acted as a reminder for the nation's dark past. The 10-3 vote on Monday rejected an offer to remove and replace the bell by the Protestant Church of St James. Some parishioners were alarmed to find they had been married or had baptised their children under the ""Hitler bell"". The local parish council said the Nazi-era relic, which has hung in the church since 1934, should stay as ""an impetus for reconciliation and a memorial against violence and injustice"", AFP news agency reports. Row over 'tasteless' auction of Nazi items Is it OK to collect Nazi memorabilia?,external A Nazi in the family A memorial pointing to the controversial 240 kg (530 pounds) bell's history will now be fixed on the 1,000-year-old heritage-listed church, the Jakobskirche. Herxheim am Berg, in southwest Germany, has repeatedly found itself in the media spotlight since a former church organist complained about the bell's inscription. Until then its history had been largely unknown, and the bell had rung out every quarter of an hour. Roland Becker argued in 2017 that removing the swastika and words would alter the bell's sound The latest news from the village of just 700 people has reignited the debate on how Germany should handle Nazi imagery and symbols in the 21st Century. The former mayor, Roland Becker, resigned last year over comments that appeared to defend not just the bell but Nazi-era Germany. Some residents are now worried that the bell could damage the church's reputation or draw neo-Nazi groups to the village. Others have contended that disposing of the bronze relic would whitewash the town's history. German military orders Nazi material hunt Pub's 'Nazi-theme' German night ad banned Jewish heirs sue Germany over Nazi art The bell was silenced last September and an alternative was used pending a decision by the local parish council. At Monday's vote, the decision to keep the ""Hitler bell"" was met with applause from many community members, German news agency DPA reports.

Transgender model to be Labour's LGBT adviser,"Transgender model Munroe Bergdorf has become an LGBT adviser to Labour's women and equality minister Dawn Butler. Ms Butler said she was ""proud to stand with those challenging discrimination"". But Tory MP Helen Grant says language used by the model - who was sacked by L'Oreal over racism claims - ""damages the campaign to promote equality"". Munroe, who said she's ""thrilled"" to join Ms Butler's team, has since defended old comments made on Twitter. It was after Ms Grant urged the Labour MP to reconsider the appointment.

Munroe was the first transgender model to front a campaign for L'Orealbut was droppedin September after claims she posted racist comments online. She wrote a lengthy Facebook post which it's claimed included the comment: ""Honestly I don't have energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more. Yes ALL white people. ""Because most of ya'll don't even realise or refuse to acknowledge that your existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour. ""Your entire existence is drenched in racism."" The comments were later deleted. L'Oreal said her comments were ""at odds"" with their values and it ended its partnership with her. The 29-year-old will work with Labour's shadow minister for women and equalities, Dawn Butler, who held an event at Parliament on Monday to announce the LGBT advisory panel. Allow Twitter content?

Conservative MP Ms Grant has written to the Labour MP urging her to reconsider Munroe's appointment in light of the racism claims. Helen Grant has criticised the appointment In the letter, she also points out other posts by the model which she says are ""abhorrent slurs"". The posts, all from the past year, criticise suffragettes, gay male Conservatives and also make comments about racial issues. ""The kind of language Bergdorf has used has no place in public life, and ought to be condemned by all those who are serious about promoting equality,"" says Ms Grant. ""I urge you to reconsider your appointment of Munroe Bergdorf in light of these comments."" Munroe has since used Twitter to ""clarify"" her previous posts. She said she's still ""confused"" by gay men who support a Conservative party that has historically ""worked to oppress"" LGBT people. Allow Twitter content?

Syrian women 'made to trade sex for aid',"This video can not be played Aid worker Danielle Spencer: ""They were withholding the aid... then using these women for sex"" Women in Syria have been sexually exploited by men delivering aid on behalf of the UN and international charities, the BBC has learned. Aid workers said the men would trade food and lifts for sexual favours. Despite warnings about the abuse three years ago, a new report shows it is continuing in the south of the country. UN agencies and charities said they had zero tolerance of exploitation and were not aware of any cases of abuse by partner organisations in the region. Aid workers told the BBC that the exploitation is so widespread that some Syrian women are refusing to go to distribution centres because people would assume they had offered their bodies for the aid they brought home. One worker claimed that some humanitarian agencies were turning a blind eye to the exploitation because using third parties and local officials was the only way of getting aid into dangerous parts of Syria that international staff could not access. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) conducted an assessment of gender based violence in the region last year and concluded that humanitarian assistance was being exchanged for sex in various governorates in Syria. The report, entitled ""Voices from Syria 2018,external"", said: ""Examples were given of women or girls marrying officials for a short period of time for 'sexual services' in order to receive meals; distributors asking for telephone numbers of women and girls; giving them lifts to their houses 'to take something in return' or obtaining distributions 'in exchange for a visit to her home' or 'in exchange for services, such as spending a night with them'."" Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? It added: ""Women and girls 'without male protectors', such as widows and divorcees as well as female IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons), were regarded as particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation."" Yet this exploitation was first reported three years ago. Danielle Spencer, a humanitarian adviser working for a charity, heard about the allegations from a group of Syrian women in a refugee camp in Jordan in March 2015. She conducted a focus group with some of these women who told her how men from local councils in areas such as Dara'a and Quneitra had offered them aid for sex. ""They were withholding aid that had been delivered and then using these women for sex,"" Ms Spencer said. Millions of Syrians have been displaced by the civil war and require international aid ""Some had experienced it themselves, some were very distraught. ""I remember one woman crying in the room and she was very upset about what she had experienced. Women and girls need to be protected when they are trying to receive food and soap and basic items to live. The last thing you need is a man who you're supposed to trust and supposed to be receiving aid from, then asking you to have sex with him and withholding aid from you."" She continued: ""It was so endemic that they couldn't actually go without being stigmatised. It was assumed that if you go to these distributions, that you will have performed some kind of sexual act in return for aid."" A few months later, in June 2015, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) surveyed 190 women and girls in Dara'a and Quneitra. Its report suggested about 40% had said sexual violence took place when they were accessing services, including humanitarian aid. An IRC spokesman said: ""The assessment concluded that sexual violence was a widespread concern, including when seeking access to various types of services across southern Syria. These services included the distribution of humanitarian aid."" The reports - both of which have been seen by the BBC - were presented at a meeting of UN agencies and international charities hosted by the UNPFA in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on 15 July 2015. As a result of this meeting, some aid agencies tightened up their procedures. The IRC said: ""Within our own operations, we launched new programmes and systems to better protect women and girls in southern Syria. Those programmes continue to be funded by a range of donors, including DfID (the UK's Department for International Development)."" The charity Care expanded its monitoring team in Syria, set up a complaints mechanism and no longer hands over aid to local councils. It also asked various UN agencies, including the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to investigate further and set up new reporting mechanisms. But Care was refused permission to carry out studies in Jordanian refugee camps. Ms Spencer claims the aid sector turned a blind eye to ensure that aid still got into southern Syria. ""Sexual exploitation and abuse of women and girls has been ignored, it's been known about and ignored for seven years,"" she said. ""The UN and the system as it currently stands have chosen for women's bodies to be sacrificed. ""Somewhere there has been a decision made that it is OK for women's bodies to continue to be used, abused, violated in order for aid to be delivered for a larger group of people."" Another source who attended the July 2015 meeting on behalf of one of the UN agencies told the BBC: ""There were credible reports of sexual exploitation and abuse going on during the cross-border aid delivery and the UN didn't make any serious moves to address it or end it."" Years of conflict have ravaged Syrian society A spokesman for UNFPA said it had heard of possible cases of exploitation and abuse of Syrian women in southern Syria from Care. It said it had not received any allegations of abuse or exploitation from the two NGOs it works with in southern Syria. The spokesman also made clear that UNFPA does not work with local councils as implementing partners. A spokesman for the children's charity Unicef confirmed it was present at the July 2015 meeting. The charity said it carried out a review of its local partners and contractors in southern Syria and is not aware of any allegations against them at this point. But it accepted that sexual exploitation was a serious risk in Syria and said it was introducing a community-based complaints mechanism and more training for its partners. A DfID spokesman said it was not aware of any cases like this involving UK aid. ""There are mechanisms already in place to raise issues of abuse and exploitation,"" the department said. ""DfID partners in Syria use third party monitors to verify UK aid distributed in Syria."" The spokesman added that any systematic abuse should be picked up by those monitors and reported to DfID. An Oxfam spokeswoman said it had not been working with local councils delivering aid in the south of Syria in the run up to 2015 and was not doing so today. ""Our work inside Syria has been largely focused on providing large-scale hardware for supplying water to Syrian communities rather than targeting aid at individuals or specific households,"" she said. ""We did not receive reports about sexual exploitation around aid delivery in 2015, but have a zero tolerance policy on such abuse."" A spokesman for the UNHCR, Andrej Mahecic, said it was ""important to understand that in any aid emergency there is a risk of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation, and to abuse somebody who is in need of assistance is despicable"". He added that while the allegations relating to 2015 were ""incomplete, fragmented and unsubstantiated"" the UN nevertheless had taken some action when they first surfaced. He said the UN refugee agency had no access to the area of southern Syria where the abuse was alleged to have taken place, but that the agency did seek to bring local partners to Jordan for training. He continued: ""The mere suggestion that the UN can somehow control the situation in a war zone is rather simplistic and disconnected from the reality of what an aid operation looks like in an open and fierce conflict.""

"Fox warning of customs union 'sellout'The UK must not give up ""control"" of its trade policy to the EU after Brexit, Liam Fox says.3m3 minutes agoUK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Liam Fox: UK doesn't need a fairy godmother Any form of customs union with the EU after Brexit would be a ""complete sellout"" for the UK, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has said. The UK would find itself in a ""worse position"" than it is now, he said, if it left the existing arrangement but negotiated a similar new one. Having to accept EU rules and limits on doing other deals would make the UK ""less attractive"", he said. But his former top official has criticised the government's strategy. Sir Martin Donnelly, who was permanent secretary in the Department for International Trade until last year, said any deals done after Brexit would not compensate for leaving the single market and the customs union. Giving up access to the EU market and its existing trade agreements was ""rather like rejecting a three course meal now in favour of the promise of a packet of crisps later"", he said. Congestion charge 'shows way for NI border' Corbyn backs customs union membership Reality Check: How much of the UK's trade is with the EU? Sir Martin, who has previously warned about leaving the single market and has worked for the European Commission in the past, said that negotiating full access to the single market without accepting EU rules would require a ""fairy godmother specialised in trade law"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he did ""not agree for a moment"" with Sir Martin's verdict, because the ""real growth opportunities"" were outside the EU. Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a long-term customs union, as Labour has proposed, would lead to ""colony status for the UK"", which would not get a say in trade policy. The customs union means there are no internal tariffs And Mr Fox hit back at Sir Martin as he took questions after his speech, saying it was ""unsurprising that those who spend a lifetime working in the European Union see moving away from the European Union as being threatening"". He added: ""The UK Brexit process is, as we've all discovered, a little more complex than a packet of Walkers."" The government has said it wants a customs agreement with the EU - which is the UK's single largest trading partner accounting for 43% of exports - but one that does not stop it from doing free trade deals with other countries. Mr Fox, one of the most prominent Brexiteers in the cabinet, is the latest minister to set out his stall as part of the government's attempt to map out ""the road to Brexit"", which is due to happen in March 2019. His speech came the day after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn set out his approach to Brexit, saying he backed the UK being in a ""new and comprehensive"" customs union with the EU. Laura Kuenssberg on Labour's position Coveney of 'one mind' with EU negotiators Brexit: All you need to know Mr Corbyn says a new customs union will help protect existing jobs and supply chains while giving the UK a say in future deals negotiated by the EU. But Mr Fox rejected this, saying the UK would have to cede ""considerable control"" of its trade policy to Brussels in any customs union. In his speech, at Bloomberg in London, Mr Fox said that changing economic and trade patterns meant the EU was a less significant partner than 15 years ago and the UK must have the freedom to exploit the ""opportunities of the future"", particularly in services and digital industries. ""As rule takers, without any say in how the rules were made, we would be in a worse position than we are today,"" he said. ""It would be a complete sellout of Britain's national interests."" Citing Turkey's experience of being outside the EU but joined in a customs union with it, he  said that if the UK found itself unable to set its own rules in key sectors of the economy, this would ""remove the bulk of incentives"" for other countries to enter into comprehensive free trade agreements. ""The inevitable price of trying to negotiate with one arm tied behind our back is that we would become less attractive to potential trade partners and forfeit many of the opportunities that would otherwise be available."" UK 'could join Pacific free trade zone' Brexit UK 'won't be Mad Max-style world' Japan warns on Brexit 'high stakes' Flexibility, he said, must be the basis of the UK's trade policy if it is to support the fledgling industries that will provide much of the employment and income of the future. ""There is a growing awareness that a full-blown gold-plated free trade agreement may not be the only solution in a fast-changing global economy,"" he said. There is a ""global trade toolbox"" of different options, including ""multi-country alliances of the like-minded"", he said. ""All of these options are available. But only to countries with independent trade policies."" Labour said it made more sense for the UK to be negotiating new trade deals alongside the EU, adding: ""Liam Fox is divorced from reality and isolated from British businesses and workers."" But Conservative MP Nigel Evans told BBC 2's Daily Politics: ""When you're doing trade deals between one country and another country, it's a lot easier than when you're doing it with somebody representing 28 countries."" Meanwhile former World Trade Organisation chief Pascal Lamy argued that whatever Brexit option was chosen ""will necessitate a border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic. ""There will have to be a border"", he told the Commons Brexit committee, because checks will have to be carried out on goods and people. He suggested a ""Macau option"" for Northern Ireland. ""You should think about giving to Northern Ireland the same autonomous trade capacity that China has given to Macau, which doesn't mean that Macau doesn't belong to China,"" he said. The European Commission will publish the first draft of its proposed withdrawal treaty on Wednesday, which it wants both sides to agree to by the autumn to allow for an orderly departure.

Three dead in Fermanagh house fire,"Two fire engines from Lisnaskea and one from Enniskillen helped put out the fire A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after three people died in a house fire in Derrylin, County Fermanagh. The 27-year-old man was brought to hospital for treatment prior to his arrest. The victims are believed to have been members of the same family and it's understood that at least one of those who died was a child. Police officers were called to the house on Molly Road at about 07:20 GMT. Police believe the fire was started deliberately, said Supt Jane Humphries. She appealed for anyone travelling through Derrylin between midnight and 07:20 on Tuesday to get in touch. Earlier, police said the emergency services were carrying out an ""extensive examination"" of the whitewashed rural bungalow to establish the cause of the blaze and determine if anyone else was involved. At the scene:  BBC News NI's Louise Cullen The roof of the house has caved in and smoke is still rising from the property. The emergency services are at the scene as investigations continue to establish the cause of the fire. I understand the family who rented the property have only been in the area for the past 12 to 18 months. Firefighters said they were called to a ""well-developed fire in a detached bungalow"" near the border with the Irish Republic before 07:15 on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content?

Two fire engines from Lisnaskea and one from Enniskillen attended the incident. The fire has now been put out. It's thought that the people who lived in the house were originally from England. Firefighters at the scene of the blaze Fermanagh Sinn FÃ©in councillor Barry Doherty said it's understood those who died were generations of the one family. Mr Doherty said a neighbour raised the alarm and had tried to break down the door with a sledgehammer. Pictures of the scene show the roof of the house had been destroyed by the blaze, leaving a shell of the bungalow, which is surrounded by farm buildings and machinery. Fire engines and police cars have been coming and going from the scene for most of the day. Michelle Gildernew, Sinn FÃ©in MP for the area, said the neighbours who made rescue attempts had undergone a horrendous ordeal. ""They are badly shaken. They weren't able to get into the house,"" she said. ""As somebody who goes to a house in good faith to try and help people and people die, that is horrendous. It's hard to take."" Asked about their efforts, she said she understood they tried to use a sledgehammer ""and tried to break a window to gain access but weren't able to do that."" Mrs Gildernew added: I just feel that there are people who are going to need support after this tragedy in how they deal with it."" The road leading to the scene of the blaze has been closed to traffic Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster, the MLA for Fermanagh South Tyrone, said: ""Horrific news coming from Derrylin, County Fermanagh, this morning. ""My thoughts and prayers are with the family and local community."" Ulster Unionist MLA Rosemary Barton said: ""This is a close-knit community and there will be a huge sense of loss felt within the community, but particularly to the family concerned.

Florida school officer defends his actions,"Scot Peterson resigned after being suspended The armed school officer branded a coward by President Donald Trump has defended his actions during the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Scot Peterson was outside the school when a gunman killed 17 people, but did not go inside as shots rang out. His attorney, Joseph DiRuzzo, said his client believed the gunfire was coming from outside the school. He followed his training by taking cover and prompting a lockdown, the lawyer said. Mr DiRuzzo said it was ""patently untrue"" that Mr Peterson was a coward on the day. Mr Peterson, a veteran officer who had been assigned to guard the high school, resigned last week after his boss, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, suspended him without pay. Sheriff Israel said that footage from the scene had left him ""devastated"" and ""sick to my stomach"". School to close over church rifle event America's gun culture in 10 charts But Mr DiRuzzo accused the sheriff of ""at best, gross oversimplification"", saying he ""jumped to a conclusion"" about Mr Peterson's behaviour. Mr Peterson said he had originally ""received a call of firecrackers"". Only when he ran towards the sound, he said, did he realise it was gunshots. Broward Sheriff's Office had trained him to seek cover and assess the situation in the event of outdoor gunfire, his lawyer said. Mr Peterson did so, and then told the sheriff's office he had heard shots, prompting a ""Code Red"" lockdown of the school campus. Where US protest movements might go from here Six radical ways to stop US school shootings When police arrived, he told them he thought the gunman was outside - a belief backed up by ""radio transmissions [which] indicated that there was a gunshot victim in the area of the football field,"" Mr Peterson said, according to his lawyer. His attorney said in a statement: ""Let there be no mistake, Mr Peterson wishes that he could have prevented the untimely passing of the 17 victims on that day, and his heart goes out to the families of the victims in their time of need. ""However, the allegations that Mr Peterson was a coward and that his performance, under the circumstances, failed to meet the standards of police officers are patently untrue."" Meanwhile, Georgia Republicans are threatening Delta Air Lines after it joined a host of companies that have ended discounts for National Rifle Association (NRA) members in the wake of the Florida school shooting. The US state's Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle vowed to block legislation containing a lucrative jet fuel tax exemption that would benefit the carrier. ""I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA,"" Mr Cagle wrote on Twitter. ""Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back."" On Saturday, Delta and United Airlines stopped offering special rates to the more than five million NRA members. Car rental firms, banks, insurance firms and hoteliers have also withdrawn deals for the gun lobby group since the 14 February attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. On Monday, the president asserted that he would have run into the Florida high school if he had been there, even if he had not been armed. ""I really believe I'd run in there even if I didn't have a weapon,"" Mr Trump told a group of state governors at the White House on Monday. This video can not be played Trump: 'I would have run in even if I didn't have weapon' Mr Trump also said it was ""frankly, disgusting"" that officers apparently did not confront the suspect on 14 February. Broward County Sheriff's Office is reportedly also investigating why three of its deputies appeared to remain outside the building with their guns drawn as the attack unfolded. Mr Trump criticised those officers as well, saying they ""weren't exactly medal of honour winners""- a reference to the US military award for valour. Students, including activist Emma Gonzalez (L), returned to school on Sunday for the afternoon In Florida, students are preparing to return full-time to their classrooms on Wednesday after some attended a volunteer ""orientation"" on Sunday. ""It's like the first day of school,"" a 16-year-old girl in attendance told the New York Times. ""But it's not normal at all."" Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? 'Arm me with books' - the teachers saying no to guns The massacre was the second-deadliest ever shooting at a US school. Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former student at the school, has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. Police have said he admitted the shooting. In the aftermath of the attack, students from the school have founded a movement campaigning for gun control, which has seen them march on their state capitol.

"NI border compared to congestion chargeBoris Johnson suggests London's automatic car charge payments are a ""very relevant comparison"".1h31 minutes agoUK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Boris Johnson compares Irish border with London boroughs Boris Johnson has likened the challenge of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland to the boundaries between different boroughs of London. The foreign secretary said it was a ""very relevant comparison"" because money was ""invisibly"" taken from people travelling between Camden and Westminster when he was London mayor. London's congestion zone charge does not involve manual checks. Labour said his comments were ""typically facile and tactless"". The Irish opposition Fianna Fail party said it was ""extraordinary"" to suggest the two borders were the same, while the SDLP said: ""Trivialising the very serious concerns relating to Ireland displays a dangerous ignorance that must be challenged."" Barnier: No open-ended Brexit transition Hard border will happen, says Lamy Boris Johnson's Irish border remarks lampooned The future of the Irish border after Brexit has been a key sticking point in talks so far. The UK plans to leave the EU's customs union but wants to avoid border posts and physical checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Mr Johnson, a former London mayor, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there were ""all sorts of things you can do"" to achieve this. ""We think that we can have very efficient facilitation systems to make sure that there's no need for a hard border, excessive checks at the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic,"" he said. ""There's no border between Islington or Camden and Westminster... but when I was mayor of London we anaesthetically and invisibly took hundreds of millions of pounds from the accounts of people travelling between those two boroughs without any need for border checks whatever."" He added: ""It's a very relevant comparison because there's all sorts of scope for pre-booking, electronic checks, all sorts of things that you can do to obviate the need for a hard border to allow us to come out of the customs union, take back control of our trade policy and do trade deals."" Analysis by the BBC's Mark Devenport How literally should we take the Foreign Secretary's analogy? The collection of the London congestion charge relies on a network of automatic number plate recognition cameras which identifies motorists moving around the city. However back in August last year, when the UK released a position paper on Northern Ireland after Brexit, government officials briefed journalists that a pledge to ""avoid any physical border infrastructure in either the United Kingdom or Ireland, for any purpose (including customs or agri-food checks)"" effectively ruled out plans for the installation of cameras near the border, or set back from it. Instead the clear suggestion was that any technological fix would be more likely to involve firms becoming ""authorised economic operators"" and filling out customs forms from the comfort of the desks in their office HQs. The BBC has asked for clarification of whether government policy has shifted on this point. But in the absence of a more detailed response we may note that Downing Street has told lobby correspondents that Mr Johnson ""was not offering a technical solution"" to the border issue. Instead, the prime minister's spokesman clarified, ""the foreign secretary was making a comparison to demonstrate our overall approach that the 110 million people crossing the border will continue living their lives as before, travelling freely just as Londoners cross boroughs every day"". That defence is not likely to appease Mr Johnson's critics, but it seems fair to say he was trying to get out of a tight spot during a wide ranging Today programme interview, rather than seeking to unveil a wholly new approach to the one set out in last year's position paper. Labour's shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith dismissed the comments as ""ludicrous"". And he accused Mr Johnson of ""glibly dismissing the concerns of thousand of families and businesses who live and work along the border"", adding that his remark ""insults the intelligence of all who are worrying about how to resolve the border question after Brexit"". Irish MEP Mairead McGuinness, vice president of the European Parliament, also questioned the analogy. ""The UK is a different country than the Republic of Ireland ... and therefore the comparison doesn't quite fit,"" she told BBC2's Daily Politics.

Fox to warn of customs union 'sellout',"This video can not be played Liam Fox: UK doesn't need a fairy godmother Any form of customs union with the EU after Brexit would be a ""complete sellout"" for the UK, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has said. The UK would find itself in a ""worse position"" than it is now, he said, if it left the existing arrangement but negotiated a similar new one. Having to accept EU rules and limits on doing other deals would make the UK ""less attractive"", he said. But his former top official has criticised the government's strategy. Sir Martin Donnelly, who was permanent secretary in the Department for International Trade until last year, said any deals done after Brexit would not compensate for leaving the single market and the customs union. Giving up access to the EU market and its existing trade agreements was ""rather like rejecting a three course meal now in favour of the promise of a packet of crisps later"", he said. Congestion charge 'shows way for NI border' Corbyn backs customs union membership Reality Check: How much of the UK's trade is with the EU? Sir Martin, who has previously warned about leaving the single market and has worked for the European Commission in the past, said that negotiating full access to the single market without accepting EU rules would require a ""fairy godmother specialised in trade law"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he did ""not agree for a moment"" with Sir Martin's verdict, because the ""real growth opportunities"" were outside the EU. Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a long-term customs union, as Labour has proposed, would lead to ""colony status for the UK"", which would not get a say in trade policy. The customs union means there are no internal tariffs And Mr Fox hit back at Sir Martin as he took questions after his speech, saying it was ""unsurprising that those who spend a lifetime working in the European Union see moving away from the European Union as being threatening"". He added: ""The UK Brexit process is, as we've all discovered, a little more complex than a packet of Walkers."" The government has said it wants a customs agreement with the EU - which is the UK's single largest trading partner accounting for 43% of exports - but one that does not stop it from doing free trade deals with other countries. Mr Fox, one of the most prominent Brexiteers in the cabinet, is the latest minister to set out his stall as part of the government's attempt to map out ""the road to Brexit"", which is due to happen in March 2019. His speech came the day after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn set out his approach to Brexit, saying he backed the UK being in a ""new and comprehensive"" customs union with the EU. Laura Kuenssberg on Labour's position Coveney of 'one mind' with EU negotiators Brexit: All you need to know Mr Corbyn says a new customs union will help protect existing jobs and supply chains while giving the UK a say in future deals negotiated by the EU. But Mr Fox rejected this, saying the UK would have to cede ""considerable control"" of its trade policy to Brussels in any customs union. In his speech, at Bloomberg in London, Mr Fox said that changing economic and trade patterns meant the EU was a less significant partner than 15 years ago and the UK must have the freedom to exploit the ""opportunities of the future"", particularly in services and digital industries. ""As rule takers, without any say in how the rules were made, we would be in a worse position than we are today,"" he said. ""It would be a complete sellout of Britain's national interests."" Citing Turkey's experience of being outside the EU but joined in a customs union with it, he  said that if the UK found itself unable to set its own rules in key sectors of the economy, this would ""remove the bulk of incentives"" for other countries to enter into comprehensive free trade agreements. ""The inevitable price of trying to negotiate with one arm tied behind our back is that we would become less attractive to potential trade partners and forfeit many of the opportunities that would otherwise be available."" UK 'could join Pacific free trade zone' Brexit UK 'won't be Mad Max-style world' Japan warns on Brexit 'high stakes' Flexibility, he said, must be the basis of the UK's trade policy if it is to support the fledgling industries that will provide much of the employment and income of the future. ""There is a growing awareness that a full-blown gold-plated free trade agreement may not be the only solution in a fast-changing global economy,"" he said. There is a ""global trade toolbox"" of different options, including ""multi-country alliances of the like-minded"", he said. ""All of these options are available. But only to countries with independent trade policies."" Labour said it made more sense for the UK to be negotiating new trade deals alongside the EU, adding: ""Liam Fox is divorced from reality and isolated from British businesses and workers."" But Conservative MP Nigel Evans told BBC 2's Daily Politics: ""When you're doing trade deals between one country and another country, it's a lot easier than when you're doing it with somebody representing 28 countries."" Meanwhile former World Trade Organisation chief Pascal Lamy argued that whatever Brexit option was chosen ""will necessitate a border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic. ""There will have to be a border"", he told the Commons Brexit committee, because checks will have to be carried out on goods and people. He suggested a ""Macau option"" for Northern Ireland. ""You should think about giving to Northern Ireland the same autonomous trade capacity that China has given to Macau, which doesn't mean that Macau doesn't belong to China,"" he said. The European Commission will publish the first draft of its proposed withdrawal treaty on Wednesday, which it wants both sides to agree to by the autumn to allow for an orderly departure.

Murdoch bid for Sky challenged by US giant,"US cable TV giant Comcast has made a Â£22.1bn bid for Sky, challenging an existing offer from 21st Century Fox. Rupert Murdochâs 21st Century Fox had already agreed an Â£18.5bn deal to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own. Comcast is the biggest US cable TV firm. It also owns the broadcast TV network NBC and Universal Pictures. Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts called Sky ""an outstanding company"" and said he was ""confident"" the offer would be cleared by regulators. Mr Roberts added: ""We would like to own the whole of Sky and we will be looking to acquire over 50% of the Sky shares"". Comcast said its bid of Â£12.50 a share was 16% higher than the 21st Century Fox offer. Sky's shares were up more than 21% at above Â£13 in afternoon trading on the London Stock Exchange. Comcast is a US multinational media and telecommunications giant. Its cable TV business is one of the largest in the US, and Comcast Cable also sells internet and phone services. It owns NBCUniversal, which has news, entertainment and sports cable networks such as NBC and CNBC, as well as film giant Universal Pictures. Dreamworks Animation, which has made films including Shrek, Madagascar and Kung Fu Panda, is a subsidiary of Universal Pictures. Analysts from Liberum say there is ""a strong rationale"" for Comcast to buy Sky as it would give it immediate leading positions in pay-TV markets in the UK, Germany and Italy, as well as a presence in Spain. Comcast already has NBC Universal film and TV assets, but the deal ""would give it a very powerful distribution pan-European network,"" Liberum said. Earlier this month, Sky won the lion's share of Premier League TV rights for the football seasons between 2019 and 2022. Comcast chief financial officer Michael Cavanagh said the Premier League auction was a factor, but not the driving force behind the offer. Liberum said the lower price for the Premier League TV rights contract had taken out the risks of price inflation. Fox's Sky bid has not been viewed favourably by the UK's competition authority, which in January provisionallyfound that it would not be in the public interest. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is concerned that if the deal went through, the Murdoch Family Trust would have too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda. However, Fox has been trying to mollify competition concerns. Last week, Fox said it would keep Sky News running for at least 10 years, with a fully independent board for the channel, to try to make the proposed deal more attractive to regulators. The CMA will send a final report to Culture Secretary Matt Hancock by 1 May, and he will then have 30 working days to make the final decision about whether the deal will go ahead. Comcast owns Dreamworks Animation, which has made films including Shrek In December last year, Walt Disney agreed to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox's business, including its 39% Sky stake. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital said that after Comcast's own bid for Fox was rejected in favour of the Disney deal, there was every chance ""Comcast would spoil Mickey's party"". ""By making a play for Sky now it can get what it wants before Disney gets close - timing is everything and Comcast seems to have played its hand very well so far,"" he said. Stewart Purvis, a board member at Channel 4, said: ""We knew Comcast were interested in gate-crashing the [Sky] deal in some form."" ""This simple deal will be attractive to regulators, it will be very attractive to shareholders, it'll force the price up they'll be prepared to pay... but it also potentially derails this whole deal between the Murdochs and Disney, which would be in Comcast's interests. ""They may be in love with Sky, and they may be prepared to pay a lot of money for Sky, but they've also got their eye on 'How can we disrupt our competitors?',"" Mr Purvis said. Analysts at Liberum said that if Fox wanted to counterbid for Sky, it would ""presumably need approval from Disney"" to fund the bid. If Disney refused, then Fox would have to find the money itself, ""which means it is then looking at a loss if Disney did end up acquiring 100% of Sky"". Mr Roberts said Comcast was prepared to co-own Sky with either Fox or Disney, as long as Comcast held a majority stake. However, Comcast has said it would like to own the whole of Sky. BBC media editor Amol Rajan says Comcast's bid looks unlikely to face the same regulatory hurdles as Fox's push for full control, ""since media plurality, commitment to broadcasting standards, and the political heat around the name Murdoch do not arise"". In making its offer, Comcast said Sky News was ""an invaluable part of the UK news landscape"", and it intended to ""maintain Sky News' existing brand and culture"". The Liberum analysts said there was a ""very good chance"" that Comcast's bid would succeed. Neither Fox nor Disney will want to get into a bidding war, ""especially given the [regulatory] complications surrounding Sky News"", they said. The UK government may also be looking for a way to defuse the political risks from the Fox bid, they added. What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal?

"Mother and two sons 'among blast dead'The cause of the explosion at a shop in Leicester, which killed five people, is not yet known.6m7 minutes agoLeicester","Mary Ragoobar and sons Sean Ragoobeer (left) and Shane Ragoobeer (right) are believed to be among the five victims A mother and two of her sons are believed to be among the five people who died in an explosion in Leicester. Mary Ragoobar, 46, and sons Shane, 18, and Sean, 17, lived in the flat above the shop in Hinckley Road which was destroyed in the blast on Sunday. Police said they are missing along with Shane's girlfriend Leah Beth Reek, 18, and Viktorija Ijevleva, 22, who was working in the shop at the time. Remains belonging to five people have been recovered from the wreckage. Leicestershire Police said given the ""devastation caused by the blast and fire"", it may be some ""considerable time"" before the bodies are formally identified. Live updates from the East Midlands Mrs Ragoobar's husband, Jose Ragoobeer, was working at the time of the explosion and received a phone call to say his youngest son had been taken to hospital. His employer, Lola Ojomo, said he was ""adored"" by his clients, who know him as ""Joe"". She described him as a ""very devoted"" father. Jose Ragoobeer's employer described him as ""very much a family man"" ""I don't know how he will recover from this,"" said Miss Ojomo, who is director of Pure HomeCare. ""He's very much a family man. I think his work and family were just it for him, that was his life. ""His remaining son is still critical. We don't even know if he's going to make it."" Mr Ragoobeer was with a client when he received the phone call about his son. ""He made sure the client was OK; that's the kind of person he is; then went off and communicated with us to say he was at the A&E with his son,"" said Miss Ojomo. ""He at the time didn't know what had happened to the other members of the family. I think he assumed they weren't in."" His colleagues are raising money for him through a crowd-funding page. Miss Ojomo said he was ""really humble and grateful that anybody is thinking about him"". A full search of the scene in Hinckley Road will take days, the emergency services have said Stanislav Stosiek, who went to English Martyrs Catholic School with Sean Ragoobeer, said he was a ""wonderful person"" who was ""smiling all the time"". He added: ""The fact he's just 17, not 18 - so young. He had so much ahead of him, so much. It really breaks my heart. ""He really liked spending time with friends at English Martyrs for sure. He had many close friends there that are mourning right now and I think they're all going to be devastated to hear he's dead."" Mr Stosiek said he was ""truly devastated"" for Sean's younger brother ""who miraculously survived"". ""I hope his brother recovers. And I hope for the sake of his father, who I don't know how he's going to deal with this, but I hope [he and his surviving son] recover and I hope the very best for them."" Leah Reek was Shane Ragoobeer's girlfriend and is believed to have been at the flat Five people were also taken to hospital after the blast, one of whom remains in hospital with life-threatening injuries. Specialist teams with experience of searching earthquake-hit buildings are being used in the search operation. This includes the use of dogs, cameras and listening equipment. But police said they did not expect to find any survivors and the operation had moved into the ""recovery"" phase. Buildings either side have also suffered structural damage Supt Shane O'Neill said: ""Tragically, all we are now looking for is any further human remains. ""This is vital work that is being done, on behalf of the victims and their families, and it will take some time to complete. ""People lost their lives on Sunday in the most horrific way. We need to understand why the building exploded."" The building consisted of a shop premises on the ground level and a two-storey flat above. The shop had gone through many owners but most recently was a Polish supermarket called Zabka. It is believed to have been trading since January. Flowers have been laid at the cordon on Hinckley Road A section of Hinckley Road is expected to remain closed throughout Tuesday. A public meeting held on Monday night was attended by residents and businesses. Matt Cane, group manager for Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service, said he could not rule out the possibility more bodies could be recovered from the scene. ""While we have no intelligence to suggest this is the case, we cannot rule out that possibility until the search is over,"" he said. Residents and businesses attended a public meeting at a primary school nearby Support is being provided by police family liaison officers to the families of the five people known to be missing, Leicestershire Police added. Leicester City Council has asked for flowers to be left near the front steps of the Westcotes United Reform Church in Hinckley Road. A rest centre, which was opened at St Anne's Church in Letchworth Road to support residents who had to leave their homes after the blast, has now been converted into a support and information centre.

Doctor backs 'false mental illness' caseEx-officer says he was forced to leave Army after raising concerns about alleged shoot-to-kill policy.5h5 hours agoNorthern Ireland,"This video can not be played Who is Fred Holroyd? A former military surgeon is backing legal action by an ex-intelligence officer who says he was forced to leave the Army because he raised concerns about an alleged shoot-to-kill policy. Fred Holroyd said he was falsely diagnosed with a psychiatric illness for political reasons. These allegations have now been backed by Dr Hugh Thomas, who was working in a hospital where Mr Holroyd was admitted. The Ministry of Defence is expected to robustly contest the claim. Fred Holroyd is suing the Ministry of Defence Mr Holroyd, a former Army captain who served in County Armagh in the 1970s, is suing the Ministry of Defence. Who is Fred Holroyd? He has said he was unlawfully detained in the military wing of Musgrave Park Hospital in south Belfast and an Army hospital near Southampton in May 1975. ""I have evidence, through the recent disclosure of my British Army medical file, of a tortuous malicious conspiracy to unlawfully detain me in a military psychiatric institution and to force me to resign from the British Army,"" he said. He has said he was targeted because he made allegations about collusion between Army units and loyalist and republican paramilitaries, and alleged some soldiers were operating a shoot-to-kill policy. Former Military Surgeon Dr Hugh Thomas will give evidence in the case Dr Thomas, a major with the Royal Army Medical Corp who was based at Musgrave Park, said he believes the Army ordered doctors to diagnose a mental health condition. ""I think it (the Army) had made its mind up to have a diagnosis that they wanted,"" he told the BBC. He remembered the day Mr Holroyd was admitted because a consultant with no psychiatric qualifications complained that he had been ordered to diagnose a psychiatric condition. ""The first I knew about it was when a senior physician colleague of mine came into the theatre and sought sanctuary, and he sought sanctuary because he had been ordered to section Fred, and had found that an abhorrent request, which it was,"" he said. The retired consultant believes military law and medical ethics were breached and he said he was willing to go to court to give evidence on Mr Holroyd's behalf. ""It was an appalling thing to ask someone to section someone for a political reason, and I believe this was a political reason,"" he said. Captain Fred Holroyd pictured in 1974 Mr Holroyd resigned from the Army in 1976. He has claimed on many occasions that he was victim of an internal war between elements of the British intelligence services. Lawyers representing Mr Holroyd in his writ against the MoD say his claims are supported by military medical records released in 2016, which state he ""presented without any material psychiatric symptoms and remained entirely rational at all times"". When asked why be believed the military authorities would act in the way he has alleged, he said they wanted to get rid of him. ""To keep me quiet about my complaints about what had been going on in Ireland,"" he added. ""I was in the way and I think the policy was eased in over me and I had to be got rid of."" Mr Holroyd is claiming damages from the MoD for unlawful detention, and is also seeking compensation for loss of pay and military pension. His lawyers claim that no one with any qualifications in psychiatry assessed his mental condition. ""I have always said that there was nothing wrong with me and that I was not mentally ill,"" Mr Holroyd told the BBC. He is also seeking an apology. ""All I've ever said is just say 'we made a mistake, we're sorry, and what can we do to make it right'. They've never said that."" In a statement the MoD said that ""as legal proceedings are ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment at this stage"". Who is Fred Holroyd?

Shelling as Syria 'pause' gets under way,"Russian media said not a single civilian left the besieged Eastern Ghouta on Tuesday Fighting continued in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area of Syria during the first daily five-hour ""pause"" ordered by the government's ally Russia. Activists said there were government air and artillery strikes, while Russia said rebels had shelled a ""humanitarian corridor"" meant to let civilians leave. As a result, there were no UN aid deliveries or medical evacuations. Some 393,000 people are trapped in the enclave near Damascus, which has been besieged by the government since 2013. Medics say more than 500 people have been killed since the government intensified its bombardment nine days ago in an attempt to retake the enclave. At least six civilians were killed on Tuesday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said - two of them during the five-hour ceasefire window. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? Russia's defence ministry, meanwhile, said rebels in the Eastern Ghouta ""went on the offensive"" during the pause, including attacking government positions in two settlements. As the truce broke down, France and Britain urged Russia to use its influence over Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to secure a 30-day ceasefire covering the whole country, as demanded by the UN Security Council on Saturday. ""Russia is one of the only actors that can get the regime to implement the resolution,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow. UK Minister of State for Europe and the Americas Sir Alan Duncan gave a similar message to the Russian ambassador in London. Fighting was reported by monitors including the UN after the Russian-ordered pause began at 09:00 (07:00 GMT) on Tuesday. The situation meant that humanitarian convoys could not go in, and medical evacuees could not come out, UN officials said. The World Health Organization said it had a list of more than 1,000 critically sick and wounded people who urgently needed to be evacuated. The situation in the Eastern Ghouta was comparatively calm early on Tuesday. However, a man was killed by shellfire in the rebel-held town of Douma before the pause started, according to SOHR. The monitoring group also reported a number of violations in the five hours that followed, including air strikes by government planes and helicopters, and artillery shelling in the town of Jisrin that killed two people, including a child. Another child was reported to have been killed in Misraba after the truce ended. The Syrian state news agency, Sana, reported that ""terrorists"" had shelled the route of the humanitarian corridor leading to the government-controlled al-Wafideen checkpoint, which is north-east of Douma, and were using ""human shields"". This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes Russian media said not a single civilian had left the besieged area as a result. The accusations of firing mortars was denied by the two Islamist rebel groups that dominate the Eastern Ghouta, Jaysh al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman, while the Syrian military said it had not carried out air strikes. Rebel factions also reiterated that jihadists from the al-Qaeda-linked alliance Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who have a small presence in the Eastern Ghouta, had offered to be evacuated in exchange for a truce. The government and Russia say their bombing campaign is targeting HTS members in the enclave. Russia said Syrian government forces would ""cease strikes on terrorists"" from 09:00 until 14:00 local time (07:00-12:00 GMT) daily from Tuesday ""with the aim of immediately saving the peaceful population"". Ambulances were seen waiting at the government-controlled al-Wafideen checkpoint One ""humanitarian corridor"" to al-Wafideen had been prepared, with help from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, to allow civilians to leave and the sick and wounded to be evacuated, it said. Residents would be informed via leaflets, text messages and videos, it added. Whether the daily ""pause"" is extended will ""depend on how the terrorist groups behave,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. Syrian women 'made to trade sex for aid' Boris Johnson's warning to Assad regime Who are Russia's shadowy mercenaries fighting in Syria? France's foreign minister said it was vital that humanitarian aid was delivered, but aid organisations - including the International Committee of the Red Cross - argue the time provided by the Russian initiative is not nearly enough. A tightening of the government's siege since November has led to the exhaustion of food supplies and extremely inflated prices inside the Eastern Ghouta. Almost 12% of children under five years old are acutely malnourished - a level the UN says is unprecedented in Syria. This video can not be played Rawaa has been living in a basement with around 75 others for months There are also severe shortages of medical supplies, with doctors forced to treat severely injured patients without general anaesthetic drugs, intravenous antibiotics, blood bags and clean bandages. Humanitarian organisations say they need to be sure any truces are taking effect on the ground before sending in aid workers and vehicles. Dr Mohamad Katoub, a Turkey-based doctor with the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which supports hospitals in the Eastern Ghouta and other rebel-held areas, told the BBC: ""We don't believe that this truce will bring any benefits for the civilians inside Eastern Ghouta. Five hours is not enough to do anything."" Firas Abdullah, a journalist for the pro-opposition Ghouta Media Center who lives in Douma, told the BBC on Tuesday that it was far too dangerous to venture outside, let alone try to reach the al-Wafideen checkpoint. ""I went outside but only for a while,"" Firas Abdullah said. ""After half a minute of this ceasefire, shells were dropped. Even if anyone tries to leave, he will be shot by the snipers of the regime checkpoint."" Al-Wafideen has long been the formal point for people to enter and exit Eastern Ghouta. However, only a small proportion of the population - public sector employees and males over 40 - were permitted to leave before the government siege was tightened, according to Reach Initiative, which is monitoring the humanitarian situation there. Women and children were reportedly forbidden by rebel groups from leaving for security reasons. Reach said risks included sniper fire, landmines, shelling, verbal and physical harassment, detention and, in the case of women, sexual harassment, humiliating inspections and beatings.

Congestion charge 'shows way for NI border',"This video can not be played Boris Johnson compares Irish border with London boroughs Boris Johnson has likened the challenge of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland to the boundaries between different boroughs of London. The foreign secretary said it was a ""very relevant comparison"" because money was ""invisibly"" taken from people travelling between Camden and Westminster when he was London mayor. London's congestion zone charge does not involve manual checks. Labour said his comments were ""typically facile and tactless"". The Irish opposition Fianna Fail party said it was ""extraordinary"" to suggest the two borders were the same, while the SDLP said: ""Trivialising the very serious concerns relating to Ireland displays a dangerous ignorance that must be challenged."" Barnier: No open-ended Brexit transition Hard border will happen, says Lamy Boris Johnson's Irish border remarks lampooned The future of the Irish border after Brexit has been a key sticking point in talks so far. The UK plans to leave the EU's customs union but wants to avoid border posts and physical checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Mr Johnson, a former London mayor, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there were ""all sorts of things you can do"" to achieve this. ""We think that we can have very efficient facilitation systems to make sure that there's no need for a hard border, excessive checks at the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic,"" he said. ""There's no border between Islington or Camden and Westminster... but when I was mayor of London we anaesthetically and invisibly took hundreds of millions of pounds from the accounts of people travelling between those two boroughs without any need for border checks whatever."" He added: ""It's a very relevant comparison because there's all sorts of scope for pre-booking, electronic checks, all sorts of things that you can do to obviate the need for a hard border to allow us to come out of the customs union, take back control of our trade policy and do trade deals."" Analysis by the BBC's Mark Devenport How literally should we take the Foreign Secretary's analogy? The collection of the London congestion charge relies on a network of automatic number plate recognition cameras which identifies motorists moving around the city. However back in August last year, when the UK released a position paper on Northern Ireland after Brexit, government officials briefed journalists that a pledge to ""avoid any physical border infrastructure in either the United Kingdom or Ireland, for any purpose (including customs or agri-food checks)"" effectively ruled out plans for the installation of cameras near the border, or set back from it. Instead the clear suggestion was that any technological fix would be more likely to involve firms becoming ""authorised economic operators"" and filling out customs forms from the comfort of the desks in their office HQs. The BBC has asked for clarification of whether government policy has shifted on this point. But in the absence of a more detailed response we may note that Downing Street has told lobby correspondents that Mr Johnson ""was not offering a technical solution"" to the border issue. Instead, the prime minister's spokesman clarified, ""the foreign secretary was making a comparison to demonstrate our overall approach that the 110 million people crossing the border will continue living their lives as before, travelling freely just as Londoners cross boroughs every day"". That defence is not likely to appease Mr Johnson's critics, but it seems fair to say he was trying to get out of a tight spot during a wide ranging Today programme interview, rather than seeking to unveil a wholly new approach to the one set out in last year's position paper. Labour's shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith dismissed the comments as ""ludicrous"". And he accused Mr Johnson of ""glibly dismissing the concerns of thousand of families and businesses who live and work along the border"", adding that his remark ""insults the intelligence of all who are worrying about how to resolve the border question after Brexit"". Irish MEP Mairead McGuinness, vice president of the European Parliament, also questioned the analogy. ""The UK is a different country than the Republic of Ireland ... and therefore the comparison doesn't quite fit,"" she told BBC2's Daily Politics. The foreign secretary's comments have also sparked a wave of reaction on Twitter: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith backed Mr Johnson. ""What Boris was saying was there are various ways in which you can manage things, like money transfers, checks on cars, checks on lorries - the technology now exists and is being used and is being developed around the world,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. And DUP MP Sammy Wilson said a virtual border already exists. ""There's a different tax regime in Northern Ireland than the Irish Republic - VAT, excise duty is different - yet billions of pounds worth of goods cross that border, taxes are paid and not a lorry is stopped to check the goods because through virtual methods, through IT, through electronic invoicing, those taxes are collected by both the Irish government and the British government,"" he said. Iain Duncan Smith says UK ports are already scanning non-EU goods in 'a matter of minutes' The first draft of a legally-binding agreement between the UK and the EU, due to be published on Wednesday, is expected to address the issue of Northern Ireland. The Dublin government says the option of Northern Ireland staying in full regulatory alignment with the European Union after Brexit should be included as a ""backstop"" - but this is opposed by some Conservative MPs and the Democratic Unionist Party. Meanwhile former World Trade Organisation chief Pascal Lamy argued that whatever Brexit option was chosen ""will necessitate a border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic, because checks will have to be carried out on goods and people. Instead he suggested to the Commons Brexit committee a ""Macau option"" for Northern Ireland. ""You should think about giving to Northern Ireland the same autonomous trade capacity that China has given to Macau, which doesn't mean that Macau doesn't belong to China,"" he said.

Search of fatal explosion site continues,"Mary Ragoobar and sons Sean Ragoobeer (left) and Shane Ragoobeer (right) are believed to be among the five victims A mother and two of her sons are believed to be among the five people who died in an explosion in Leicester. Mary Ragoobar, 46, and sons Shane, 18, and Sean, 17, lived in the flat above the shop in Hinckley Road which was destroyed in the blast on Sunday. Police said they are missing along with Shane's girlfriend Leah Beth Reek, 18, and Viktorija Ijevleva, 22, who was working in the shop at the time. Remains belonging to five people have been recovered from the wreckage. Leicestershire Police said given the ""devastation caused by the blast and fire"", it may be some ""considerable time"" before the bodies are formally identified. Live updates from the East Midlands Mrs Ragoobar's husband, Jose Ragoobeer, was working at the time of the explosion and received a phone call to say his youngest son had been taken to hospital. His employer, Lola Ojomo, said he was ""adored"" by his clients, who know him as ""Joe"". She described him as a ""very devoted"" father. Jose Ragoobeer's employer described him as ""very much a family man"" ""I don't know how he will recover from this,"" said Miss Ojomo, who is director of Pure HomeCare. ""He's very much a family man. I think his work and family were just it for him, that was his life. ""His remaining son is still critical. We don't even know if he's going to make it."" Mr Ragoobeer was with a client when he received the phone call about his son. ""He made sure the client was OK; that's the kind of person he is; then went off and communicated with us to say he was at the A&E with his son,"" said Miss Ojomo.

He added: ""The fact he's just 17, not 18 - so young. He had so much ahead of him, so much. It really breaks my heart. ""He really liked spending time with friends at English Martyrs for sure. He had many close friends there that are mourning right now and I think they're all going to be devastated to hear he's dead."" Mr Stosiek said he was ""truly devastated"" for Sean's younger brother ""who miraculously survived"". ""I hope his brother recovers.

""I have evidence, through the recent disclosure of my British Army medical file, of a tortuous malicious conspiracy to unlawfully detain me in a military psychiatric institution and to force me to resign from the British Army,"" he said. He has said he was targeted because he made allegations about collusion between Army units and loyalist and republican paramilitaries, and alleged some soldiers were operating a shoot-to-kill policy. Former Military Surgeon Dr Hugh Thomas will give evidence in the case Dr Thomas, a major with the Royal Army Medical Corp who was based at Musgrave Park, said he believes the Army ordered doctors to diagnose a mental health condition. ""I think it (the Army) had made its mind up to have a diagnosis that they wanted,"" he told the BBC. He remembered the day Mr Holroyd was admitted because a consultant with no psychiatric qualifications complained that he had been ordered to diagnose a psychiatric condition. ""The first I knew about it was when a senior physician colleague of mine came into the theatre and sought sanctuary, and he sought sanctuary because he had been ordered to section Fred, and had found that an abhorrent request, which it was,"" he said. The retired consultant believes military law and medical ethics were breached and he said he was willing to go to court to give evidence on Mr Holroyd's behalf. ""It was an appalling thing to ask someone to section someone for a political reason, and I believe this was a political reason,"" he said. Captain Fred Holroyd pictured in 1974 Mr Holroyd resigned from the Army in 1976. He has claimed on many occasions that he was victim of an internal war between elements of the British intelligence services. Lawyers representing Mr Holroyd in his writ against the MoD say his claims are supported by military medical records released in 2016, which state he ""presented without any material psychiatric symptoms and remained entirely rational at all times"". When asked why be believed the military authorities would act in the way he has alleged, he said they wanted to get rid of him. ""To keep me quiet about my complaints about what had been going on in Ireland,"" he added. ""I was in the way and I think the policy was eased in over me and I had to be got rid of."" Mr Holroyd is claiming damages from the MoD for unlawful detention, and is also seeking compensation for loss of pay and military pension. His lawyers claim that no one with any qualifications in psychiatry assessed his mental condition. ""I have always said that there was nothing wrong with me and that I was not mentally ill,"" Mr Holroyd told the BBC. He is also seeking an apology. ""All I've ever said is just say 'we made a mistake, we're sorry, and what can we do to make it right'. They've never said that."" In a statement the MoD said that ""as legal proceedings are ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment at this stage"". Who is Fred Holroyd?

Do commuter students lose out?,"Anjum James-Francis commutes to university from his family home in Birmingham ""It couldn't have worked out any better for me,"" says Anjum James-Francis. The 20-year-old is in his third year of being a commuter student atNewman University in Birmingham.,external The university has one of the highest rates of students studying for a degree while living at home. Research published on Tuesday byThe Sutton Trust charity,externalwarns that cost could be putting off some students from leaving home to study. But for Anjum, being a commuter student has allowed him to save money, study hard and still have the social life he wants. He's in his final year of studying fora degree in sport and exercise,,externalbefore training to be a PE teacher. ""Sometimes you might feel a bit detached, but that's not always a bad thing,"" he says. ""I can leave uni and go home to plan what I need to do, rather than being in a big house with mates where you might just want to have a laugh and a joke."" Instead of spending his maintenance loan mainly on accommodation, Anjum says he's had a bit more financial leeway to take up other opportunities. These include a sport coaching trip to Gambia and going to the United States to work on a summer camp. Anjum had a choice of universities within a short travel distance because he lives in Birmingham. At Newman his experience is not unusual, as 76% of its students travel only a short distance from their family homes. The research is based on data from all students in the UK. It says around a quarter of all undergraduates are commuter students. British Pakistani and British Bangladeshi students are over six times more likely than white students to live at home and study nearby. The cost of going to university further away is identified as one of the main reasons for choosing to be a commuter student. At Newman University in Birmingham most students commute Students from the poorest families are three times more likely to live at home than those from the richest families. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: ""In the modern economy it is often those who are most mobile who are most likely to find success. ""Moving away to university can be an important first step. Moving to London, or other large cities in the UK, can be an 'escalator' for social mobility. ""But too often, the opportunity to move away to attend university is restricted to those from better off homes."" Education Secretary Damian Hinds has suggested that increasing the number of commuter degrees could help cut the cost of going to university. A review of post-18 education in England, announced last week,will look at how different ways of studying for a degree could be encouraged. The Sutton Trust says it should look at greater financial support for living costs for poorer students by restoring maintenance grants. But the charity also says universities could do more to support existing commuter students through simple steps such as scheduling lectures to avoid expensive peak travel times. A Department for Education spokesperson said record rates of 18-year-olds, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds, were entering full-time university. ""The government's review of post-18 education and funding will consider how we can encourage and support learning that is more flexible for students - for example, part-time, distance learning and commuter study options.""

Sturgeon rejects offer in devolution row,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon was speaking to Radio 4's Today programme Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has rejected the UK government's latest proposal in a row over who should exercise certain powers after Brexit. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the ""vast majority"" of returning EU powers will start in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. He said Westminster would only be involved where a ""pause"" was needed to draw up a UK-wide framework. But Ms Sturgeon said this would still restrict the devolved administrations. It amounts to a veto over how the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies can exercise their powers, she told the BBC. Ms Sturgeon said it was ""very likely"" the Scottish Parliament will not give consent for the EU Withdrawal Bill unless the UK government changes its mind. The move would not veto or block Brexit, but would make things extremely difficult politically for the prime minister. Brian Taylor: No, Holyrood cannot 'veto' Brexit Scots-UK Brexit powers talks to be 'intensified' The two governments have been at loggerheads over how powers which are currently not reserved to Westminster, but which are exercised from Brussels, are distributed after the UK leaves the EU. Ms Sturgeon said she accepted that in some cases there would need to be common systems of regulation, but she insisted that they needed to be agreed between the UK government and the devolved administrations - and cannot be imposed by Westminster. She said: ""We are simply trying to protect the powers that the Scottish Parliament already has - things like agriculture, fishing, environmental policy, food standards, justice, health. ""These are all currently responsibilities of the Scottish Parliament. At the moment we have to exercise those powers within the confines of European law. ""But after Brexit, in terms of the devolution settlement, those powers should return to the Scottish Parliament and it should be up to us how we exercise them."" This video can not be played David Lidington said the ""vast majority"" of EU powers would start off in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast On Monday, Mr Lidington said the UK's ""common market"" must be maintained post-Brexit, saying the UK works better in ""unity"". Food labelling and hygiene rules were one area where powers could be retained within a UK-wide framework, Mr Lidington suggested. He added that the government had made a ""considerable offer"" to the devolved administrations. Let's be clear - the devolved administrations cannot veto Brexit, they cannot block, they cannot thwart. The talk of there being a requirement for consent from the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly is purely a convention, and hasn't got weight in law. Westminster is sovereign, and Westminster can legislate in this matter. If Westminster wants, it can say: ""If we can get this EU Withdrawal Bill through the House of Commons and through the House of Lords, then that's good enough for us and the rest of you can go swing."" But Westminster will not do that. Why? Because they want to proceed by consensus. The UK government is in enough trouble over Brexit without adding a fight with Holyrood into the mix as well. Ms Sturgeon said her government had always accepted there were issues where it makes sense to have common standards and regulations in all parts of the UK. But she said the UK government proposals meant Holyrood would have no say over any attempt by Westminster to lower environmental standards in Scotland - despite the powers being devolved. Brexit: All you need to know The first minister added: ""I will not sign up to something that effectively undermines the whole foundation on which devolution is built and no first minister, no Scottish government worth its salt, should do so."" She denied she was using the row as an excuse to push for independence, and insisted that the Scottish government was trying to reach agreement. But she said that, as things currently stand, it was ""very likely"" that both the Scottish and Welsh governments would ask their respective parliaments to not recommend approval of the EU Withdrawal Bill. Talks are continuing as the EU Withdrawal Bill makes its way through the House of Lords. The bill aims to ensure the rules currently set by European law still apply in the UK after Brexit, while giving the UK Parliament power to change them. The Scottish government is expected to introduce its own EU Continuity Bill at Holyrood this week.

Cruise ship cocaine pair plead guilty,"Melina Roberge (left) with Isabelle LagacÃ©, who was jailed last year Two Canadians have pleaded guilty to smuggling cocaine into Sydney, Australia on a cruise ship. Melina Roberge, 23, and Andre Tamine, 64, had initially denied their roles in the import of 95kg (210lb) of drugs on the MS Sea Princess in 2016. But they changed their pleas ahead of a trial that was due to start this week, Australian media reported. A third Canadian, 29-year-oldIsabelle LagacÃ©, was sentenced to jail in Novemberover her part in the crime. According to authorities, the cocaine had an estimated street value of A$21m (Â£12m; $17m), making it the largest seizure of its kind on a passenger boat in Australia. On social media, Roberge and LagacÃ© had posted images of themselves enjoying what appeared to be a seven-week holiday on a cruise from Southampton. But when the ship docked in Sydney, police sniffer dogs found 35kg of cocaine inside their shared cabin. A further 60kg was discovered in Tamine's cabin. It was unclear how the women and Tamine were connected, local media reported. Authorities have linked them to a ""well-organised syndicate"". All three were charged with importing a commercial quantity of cocaine, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of life in jail. LagacÃ© was given a sentence of seven and a half years in jail.The Sydney Morning Herald reported,externalshe had been trying to clear an A$20,000 debt. ""It pains me to know my most defining years of womanhood will be spent in jailâ¦ I feel remorse and anger at myself about being involved with people who are part of a dirty, dirty drug trade,"" LagacÃ© said in an affidavit, according to the newspaper. Roberge and Tamine will be sentenced later this year.

Syria 'humanitarian pause' under way,"Russian media said not a single civilian left the besieged Eastern Ghouta on Tuesday Fighting continued in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area of Syria during the first daily five-hour ""pause"" ordered by the government's ally Russia. Activists said there were government air and artillery strikes, while Russia said rebels had shelled a ""humanitarian corridor"" meant to let civilians leave. As a result, there were no UN aid deliveries or medical evacuations. Some 393,000 people are trapped in the enclave near Damascus, which has been besieged by the government since 2013. Medics say more than 500 people have been killed since the government intensified its bombardment nine days ago in an attempt to retake the enclave. At least six civilians were killed on Tuesday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said - two of them during the five-hour ceasefire window. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? Russia's defence ministry, meanwhile, said rebels in the Eastern Ghouta ""went on the offensive"" during the pause, including attacking government positions in two settlements. As the truce broke down, France and Britain urged Russia to use its influence over Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to secure a 30-day ceasefire covering the whole country, as demanded by the UN Security Council on Saturday. ""Russia is one of the only actors that can get the regime to implement the resolution,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow. UK Minister of State for Europe and the Americas Sir Alan Duncan gave a similar message to the Russian ambassador in London. Fighting was reported by monitors including the UN after the Russian-ordered pause began at 09:00 (07:00 GMT) on Tuesday. The situation meant that humanitarian convoys could not go in, and medical evacuees could not come out, UN officials said. The World Health Organization said it had a list of more than 1,000 critically sick and wounded people who urgently needed to be evacuated. The situation in the Eastern Ghouta was comparatively calm early on Tuesday. However, a man was killed by shellfire in the rebel-held town of Douma before the pause started, according to SOHR. The monitoring group also reported a number of violations in the five hours that followed, including air strikes by government planes and helicopters, and artillery shelling in the town of Jisrin that killed two people, including a child. Another child was reported to have been killed in Misraba after the truce ended. The Syrian state news agency, Sana, reported that ""terrorists"" had shelled the route of the humanitarian corridor leading to the government-controlled al-Wafideen checkpoint, which is north-east of Douma, and were using ""human shields"". This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes Russian media said not a single civilian had left the besieged area as a result. The accusations of firing mortars was denied by the two Islamist rebel groups that dominate the Eastern Ghouta, Jaysh al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman, while the Syrian military said it had not carried out air strikes. Rebel factions also reiterated that jihadists from the al-Qaeda-linked alliance Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who have a small presence in the Eastern Ghouta, had offered to be evacuated in exchange for a truce. The government and Russia say their bombing campaign is targeting HTS members in the enclave. Russia said Syrian government forces would ""cease strikes on terrorists"" from 09:00 until 14:00 local time (07:00-12:00 GMT) daily from Tuesday ""with the aim of immediately saving the peaceful population"". Ambulances were seen waiting at the government-controlled al-Wafideen checkpoint One ""humanitarian corridor"" to al-Wafideen had been prepared, with help from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, to allow civilians to leave and the sick and wounded to be evacuated, it said. Residents would be informed via leaflets, text messages and videos, it added. Whether the daily ""pause"" is extended will ""depend on how the terrorist groups behave,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. Syrian women 'made to trade sex for aid' Boris Johnson's warning to Assad regime Who are Russia's shadowy mercenaries fighting in Syria? France's foreign minister said it was vital that humanitarian aid was delivered, but aid organisations - including the International Committee of the Red Cross - argue the time provided by the Russian initiative is not nearly enough. A tightening of the government's siege since November has led to the exhaustion of food supplies and extremely inflated prices inside the Eastern Ghouta. Almost 12% of children under five years old are acutely malnourished - a level the UN says is unprecedented in Syria. This video can not be played Rawaa has been living in a basement with around 75 others for months There are also severe shortages of medical supplies, with doctors forced to treat severely injured patients without general anaesthetic drugs, intravenous antibiotics, blood bags and clean bandages. Humanitarian organisations say they need to be sure any truces are taking effect on the ground before sending in aid workers and vehicles. Dr Mohamad Katoub, a Turkey-based doctor with the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which supports hospitals in the Eastern Ghouta and other rebel-held areas, told the BBC: ""We don't believe that this truce will bring any benefits for the civilians inside Eastern Ghouta. Five hours is not enough to do anything."" Firas Abdullah, a journalist for the pro-opposition Ghouta Media Center who lives in Douma, told the BBC on Tuesday that it was far too dangerous to venture outside, let alone try to reach the al-Wafideen checkpoint. ""I went outside but only for a while,"" Firas Abdullah said. ""After half a minute of this ceasefire, shells were dropped. Even if anyone tries to leave, he will be shot by the snipers of the regime checkpoint."" Al-Wafideen has long been the formal point for people to enter and exit Eastern Ghouta. However, only a small proportion of the population - public sector employees and males over 40 - were permitted to leave before the government siege was tightened, according to Reach Initiative, which is monitoring the humanitarian situation there. Women and children were reportedly forbidden by rebel groups from leaving for security reasons. Reach said risks included sniper fire, landmines, shelling, verbal and physical harassment, detention and, in the case of women, sexual harassment, humiliating inspections and beatings.

"Farm subsidies 'to help environment'Farmers will receive money for ""public goods"", such as investment in sustainable food production.7h7 hours agoScience & Environment","Environment Secretary Michael Gove wants to end direct payments based on the amount of land farmed Up to Â£150m in support payments could be shifted from the richest farmers to environmental schemes after Brexit, under government plans. Environment Secretary Michael Gove wants to end direct payments based on the amount of land farmed. Instead, farmers will receive money for ""public goods"", such as investment in sustainable food production. But the National Farmers Union said it should not all be about the environment. Farmers currently get paid about Â£3bn a year under the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), largely linked to the amount of land that farmers own. Post-Brexit farming funding set out by Michael Gove Farm subsidies 'must be earned' Five times food fights have had an impact on trade talks Gove backing Brexit farm workers support The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has said there would be a transition period between the two systems, during which time either a cap would be placed on the largest payments, or they would be gradually reduced, with higher earners facing larger reductions. This would see more than Â£150m going towards funding environmental schemes, rewarding farmers who encourage biodiversity and improve soil health or air quality. In a consultation paper published on Tuesday, Defra gives examples of how the caps in subsidies could work, including: A Â£100,000 cap on payments, affecting about 2,100 farmers; or A progressive reduction in payments affecting about 19,000 farmers. Of these 13,500 would face a payment reduction of less than Â£5,000 and about 300 - all with claims worth over Â£200,000 - would lose more than Â£75,000 Speaking to the BBC's Environment Correspondent Claire Marshall, Mr Gove said: ""It's been the case in the past that we have put too much emphasis on trying to generate a form of farming that is neglectful of the environment. ""Now the balance has shifted... and this command paper today backs farmers who want to do the right thing. ""We're not going to give you money simply on the basis that you've already got a big estate. ""We'll only give you money if you are contributing to the environment, making sure we have fewer floods, making sure that there are habits for the wildlife that we value, making sure that our water, our rivers are cleaner, and that our air is purer."" Farmers will receive money for ""public goods"", such as investment in sustainable food production Farmers in the Cotswold Hills, where Mr Gove visited ahead of the consultation, were concerned about the deals that have yet to be struck. Organic farmer Rob Richmond, from Manor Farm in Chedworth, Gloucestershire, said: ""It's more important that we've got the trade deals are right, and that the core business is profitable."" Another farmer, Jeannie Hamilton, said: ""To keep the trade deals is more important - because we've got to have somewhere to sell our product."" National Farmers Union president Minette Batters told the BBC: ""Michael Gove has committed now to launching a national food plan, we've been lobbying for that for a long time. ""We feel that food has been taken for granted for far too long, and now is the time to take it seriously."" As well as environmental benefits, farmers would be given incentives to pilot schemes to improve animal welfare, or to trial new technology. Additionally, strong regulation of pesticides would be encouraged. Mr Gove has said that farmers will be given five years from the date that the UK leaves the EU to prepare for the change. The consultation on the Agriculture Bill runs for ten weeks, until the end of May.

"Search of fatal explosion site continuesThe cause of the blast in Leicester, which killed five people, is not yet known.1m2 minutes agoLeicester","Mary Ragoobar and sons Sean Ragoobeer (left) and Shane Ragoobeer (right) are believed to be among the five victims A mother and two of her sons are believed to be among the five people who died in an explosion in Leicester. Mary Ragoobar, 46, and sons Shane, 18, and Sean, 17, lived in the flat above the shop in Hinckley Road which was destroyed in the blast on Sunday. Police said they are missing along with Shane's girlfriend Leah Beth Reek, 18, and Viktorija Ijevleva, 22, who was working in the shop at the time. Remains belonging to five people have been recovered from the wreckage. Leicestershire Police said given the ""devastation caused by the blast and fire"", it may be some ""considerable time"" before the bodies are formally identified. Live updates from the East Midlands Mrs Ragoobar's husband, Jose Ragoobeer, was working at the time of the explosion and received a phone call to say his youngest son had been taken to hospital. His employer, Lola Ojomo, said he was ""adored"" by his clients, who know him as ""Joe"". She described him as a ""very devoted"" father. Jose Ragoobeer's employer described him as ""very much a family man"" ""I don't know how he will recover from this,"" said Miss Ojomo, who is director of Pure HomeCare. ""He's very much a family man. I think his work and family were just it for him, that was his life. ""His remaining son is still critical. We don't even know if he's going to make it."" Mr Ragoobeer was with a client when he received the phone call about his son. ""He made sure the client was OK; that's the kind of person he is; then went off and communicated with us to say he was at the A&E with his son,"" said Miss Ojomo. ""He at the time didn't know what had happened to the other members of the family. I think he assumed they weren't in."" His colleagues are raising money for him through a crowd-funding page. Miss Ojomo said he was ""really humble and grateful that anybody is thinking about him"". A full search of the scene in Hinckley Road will take days, the emergency services have said Stanislav Stosiek, who went to English Martyrs Catholic School with Sean Ragoobeer, said he was a ""wonderful person"" who was ""smiling all the time"". He added: ""The fact he's just 17, not 18 - so young. He had so much ahead of him, so much. It really breaks my heart. ""He really liked spending time with friends at English Martyrs for sure. He had many close friends there that are mourning right now and I think they're all going to be devastated to hear he's dead."" Mr Stosiek said he was ""truly devastated"" for Sean's younger brother ""who miraculously survived"". ""I hope his brother recovers. And I hope for the sake of his father, who I don't know how he's going to deal with this, but I hope [he and his surviving son] recover and I hope the very best for them."" Leah Reek was Shane Ragoobeer's girlfriend and is believed to have been at the flat Five people were also taken to hospital after the blast, one of whom remains in hospital with life-threatening injuries. Specialist teams with experience of searching earthquake-hit buildings are being used in the search operation. This includes the use of dogs, cameras and listening equipment. But police said they did not expect to find any survivors and the operation had moved into the ""recovery"" phase. Buildings either side have also suffered structural damage Supt Shane O'Neill said: ""Tragically, all we are now looking for is any further human remains. ""This is vital work that is being done, on behalf of the victims and their families, and it will take some time to complete. ""People lost their lives on Sunday in the most horrific way. We need to understand why the building exploded."" The building consisted of a shop premises on the ground level and a two-storey flat above. The shop had gone through many owners but most recently was a Polish supermarket called Zabka. It is believed to have been trading since January. Flowers have been laid at the cordon on Hinckley Road A section of Hinckley Road is expected to remain closed throughout Tuesday. A public meeting held on Monday night was attended by residents and businesses. Matt Cane, group manager for Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service, said he could not rule out the possibility more bodies could be recovered from the scene. ""While we have no intelligence to suggest this is the case, we cannot rule out that possibility until the search is over,"" he said. Residents and businesses attended a public meeting at a primary school nearby Support is being provided by police family liaison officers to the families of the five people known to be missing, Leicestershire Police added. Leicester City Council has asked for flowers to be left near the front steps of the Westcotes United Reform Church in Hinckley Road. A rest centre, which was opened at St Anne's Church in Letchworth Road to support residents who had to leave their homes after the blast, has now been converted into a support and information centre.

"Suicide after 'paedophile hunter' stingDavid Baker, 43, was found dead three days after being accused of trying to meet a 14-year-old.13h13 hours agoHampshire & Isle of Wight","David Baker killed himself after being arrested and released while inquiries continued A man killed himself three days after being confronted by a ""paedophile hunter"" group, an inquest has heard. David Baker, 43, was arrested after the Southampton Trap group, which posts footage of its ""stings"" on Facebook, accused him of trying to meet a 14-year-old at a supermarket car park. He was released while inquiries continued before taking an overdose of prescription drugs in October 2017, Winchester Coroner's Court was told. A verdict of suicide was recorded. Mr Baker, a gardener, was found dead at his home in Wickham, Hampshire, on 7 October after being held by police on 4 October on suspicion of arranging to meet a child aged under 16. His fiancÃ©e Kelly Davies told the inquest she found out about the ""sting"" through friends and posts on Facebook. She said: ""None of us knew anything. We just thought it was someone being sick. We didn't really believe it."" Ms Davies's daughter, Cherelle Stares, told the court her family's address had been posted on social media following the arrest. ""I didn't feel safe as there are idiots out there, and I didn't want a brick being put through the window with my mum and daughter there,"" she said. Coroner Grahame Short said: ""It's not for me to judge David's actions on 4 October or indeed the actions of Southampton Trap which led to his arrest. ""However I believe in this particular case the postings on social media after his arrest contributed to the stress on David, and to him being alone and isolated in his own home where he made his decision to end his own life. ""This was therefore a causative factor to what led to his death, at least in part.""

Family 'disgusted' at meningitis refusal,"Faye Burdett was taken to an accident and emergency unit with a rash on her forehead but died days later A long-awaitedreport,externalinto how the government makes decisions about which vaccines to fund has been published. It follows calls for greater transparency about why a vaccine to protect children against meningitis B was not made more widely available. Two-year-old Faye Burdett died in 2016 - she was too old to have the vaccine. An 820,000-signaturepetition,externalcalling for all children to be vaccinated was then submitted, - but the idea was rejected as ""not cost effective"". One of the recommendations in the report is lowering the cost-effectiveness threshold for immunisation, potentially making it harder for new vaccines to be approved at current prices. Health Minister Steven Brine was due to face questions from MPs on Tuesday over why the report into the cost-effectiveness of immunisations - promised by the end of 2016 - still had not been published. The concern is that the proposals could put some current campaigns into question and make it harder for new ones to be set up. That is certainly not what more than 800,000 people signed the Men B petition for. Lowering the cost effectiveness threshold (economic speak for wanting more bang for your buck) will make it harder to justify paying for some expensive vaccines. But other measures will make it easier. At the moment the health benefits of vaccines, which are seen years later, are not given the same economic weight as drugs (such as in cancer) that deliver results immediately. Moves to cut this ""discounting"" of the benefits of vaccines would make it easier to fund them. As would changing the rules to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine over the lifetime of a patient. What the sum total of all these recommendations would mean is far from clear. Commenting on the publication, Helen Jones, who chairs the Petitions Committee, said: ""Since 2016, the Petitions and Health Committees have been urging the government to publish this report - so we are pleased that it has finally done so. ""It is, however, regrettable that the government has taken so long to act, when decisions about vaccines could save children's lives. ""Charities and campaigners, including families who have lost children to meningitis, have been left waiting for this report for far too long."" Aconsultation,externalwill now run until 21 May 2018. Ms Jones said: ""The government must now listen to the voices of survivors and bereaved families."" Meningitis B vaccine: Hearts v heads Q&A: Meningitis B vaccine Faye's parents, Jenny and Neil Burdett, have said they ""remain disappointed and frustrated that the government deemed the protection of vulnerable children as 'not cost effective'. ""We had hoped our collective voices would be heard and changes made,"" they said. ""We are disgusted with the health department for the way they have treated one of the biggest petitions to date."" Faye Burdett died on Valentine's Day 2016, after fighting the bacterial infection for 11 days They made public photos of Faye in hospital to raise awareness of the bacterial infection. And the petition the images featured in became the most popular petition in parliamentary history. It is now the third largest. Meningitis Research Foundation chief executive Vinny Smith, said: ""Two years is too long, but we are pleased to see a public consultation on the report which has finally been published. ""We are taking time to review the report in full but are concerned that some recommendations would be detrimental to future vaccines and could reduce our chances of preventing serious and fatal illnesses."" Meningitis B is a bacterial infection that most often affects children younger than one Since 2015, children under 12 months have been offered the vaccination There are about 1,200 meningitis B cases each year in the UK Symptoms include a high fever with cold hands and feet, confusion, vomiting and headaches But a recent study warns fever might not be present and to look out for poor feeding, lethargy and irritability too With early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, most people will make a full recovery It is fatal in one in 10 cases About one in four of those who survive is left with long-term problems, such as amputation, deafness, epilepsy and learning difficulties Meningitis B vaccine extension rejected Q&A: Meningitis B vaccine Meningitis B vaccine: Hearts v heads Cost effectiveness methodology for vaccination programmes Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

King penguins face warming challenge,"King penguins breed on many of the sub-Antarctic islands between 45 and 55 degrees South King penguins are in deep trouble if nothing is done to constrain climate change, researchers say. The scientists have assessed the birds' fragmented population in the Southern Ocean and concluded that some island strongholds will become unsustainable. The problem is the continued movement away from key nesting sites of the penguins' favoured foraging grounds. And as the climate warms further, food will simply become too distant for many birds to fetch for their chicks. ""Our work shows that almost 70% of king penguins - about 1.1 million breeding pairs - will have to relocate or disappear before the end of the century because of greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Dr CÃ©line Le Bohec from the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the University of Strasbourg. Her team has justpublished its findings in the journal Nature Climate Change,external. Counting South Georgia's whales Poo sediments record 'penguin Pompeii' Penguin waddle put to the test The group has looked at the particular requirements of the king penguin and how shifts in the environment might affect the species' breeding success in the coming decades. It is a mixture of climate modelling but also uses genetics to understand population history, as well. The second largest of the 17 penguin species,Aptenodytes patagonicusare finicky about where they base themselves, preferring sub-antarctic islands that are free of sea-ice and that have smooth sandy or pebble beaches on which to rear chicks. In the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, the birds were hunted for their oil, flesh, eggs and skins But they also need a good supply of fish and squid, and in the Southern Ocean this is to be found along a feature known as the Antarctic Polar Front (APF). It is a nutrient-rich upwelling that supports abundant prey for the hungry predator. The issue is that the APF is heading poleward, and if global temperatures continue to rise as expected, the front is likely eventually to move out of the range of many foraging king penguins, the research suggests. Seven hundred kilometres is about the limit at which the birds can travel and not expose their chicks to starvation back at the nest. ""Marion and Prince Edward islands, and Crozet island will have the biggest difficulty in the next 50 years, I would say. These are major population centres,"" Dr Le Bohec told BBC News. ""But if we continue with the addition of greenhouse gases then Kerguelen, Falkland and Tierra del Fuego islands will also have difficulty."" By analysing the genetics of the birds, the scientists can see that king penguins have suffered population crashes in the past, most notably about 20,000 years ago when colder conditions extended the sea-ice much further to the north than it is today. So there is evidence that the birds can bounce back, and the team's modelling indicates that they will very probably try to adapt to their changing circumstances by colonisation Bouvet Island, and by increasing their numbers on Heard and South Georgia islands, which should benefit from improved foraging conditions as the APF edges ever poleward. ""The problem is the pace of change. It is really very fast, and that will make it hard for the penguins to adapt,"" said Dr Le Bohec. 700km is about the limit the birds can forage before exposing their chicks to starvation Commenting on the study, Dr Norman Ratcliffe from the British Antarctic Survey confirmed that shifts in the APF were a very important factor for king penguins. Independent tracking and breeding success data from Crozet and Kerguelen showed that the birds failed to breed in those years when the front temporarily moved too far south, he told BBC News. ""Long-term projections of the type presented here are always crude caricatures but I like this study because it does take a more mechanistic approach based on the known habitat requirements of the species rather than using a more traditional and simplistic thermal envelope model,"" he said. ""For the time-being we know king penguin populations are still increasing across their range, probably due to them recovering from hunting pressure during the sealing era. ""So while it is possible that reduced accessibility of foraging habitat might cause loss of northern colonies in the future, there is no evidence that we have yet reached a tipping point at which this occurs.""

Fifth Briton dies after helicopter crash,"Jonathan and Eleanor Udall were on honeymoon when the crash happened A fifth British tourist has died following a helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon that also killed her new husband. Eleanor Udall, nee Milward, 29, was on her honeymoon with Jonathan Udall, when the accident happened on 10 February. Mr Udall, who was in his 30s and from Brighton, died four days ago. Mrs Udall's family said it was ""with great sadness"" that they announced their daughter had died in a Las Vegas hospital as a result of her injuries. ""The family are exceedingly grateful for everything done by rescue services and volunteers in the Canyon, and throughout the last two weeks by the exceptional staff at UMC (University Medical Centre, Las Vegas),"" their statement said. Stuart Hill, 30, and his girlfriend Becky Dobson, 27, and brother Jason, 32, from Worthing, West Sussex, died in the crash. Another Briton, Jennifer Barham, 39, and the pilot Scott Booth, 42, were injured when the aircraft crashed in the remote Quartermaster Canyon. A message posted on Monday on a crowdfunding page set up to help Mr and Mrs Udall said: ""It deeply saddens me once more to update this page. ""Yesterday Ellie lost her battle to her injuries, the only consolidation I can muster is that she is no longer in pain and is, I hope, with Jon. ""The continued support to this page is heart-warming during this tragic time. ""May we never forget this wonderful couple."" Parents' tribute to 'wonderful' sons Grand Canyon helicopter crash victims 'life and soul of party' Mr and Mrs Udall, who both worked at Yorkshire Building Society, were friends with the other Britons in the helicopter. Stuart (left) and Jason Hill also died in the crash The Eurocopter (now Airbus) EC130 helicopter had spun out of control as it came in to land before crashing and catching fire. The crash is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board but an initial report indicates possible causes could include a mechanical problem and gusty winds. The chief of the Hualapai Police, Francis Bradley, had described the terrain as ""extremely rugged"". He said the rescue efforts had been hampered by severe weather conditions and gusts of up to 50mph (80 km/h). Jason and Stuart Hill and Ms Dobson, who had been in the US for Stuart's 30th birthday, died at the scene. Becky Dobson was on holiday to celebrate her boyfriend's 30th birthday Jason Hill worked as a corporate lawyer for Shoosmiths in its Milton Keynes office. Stuart Hill was a salesman at a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Brighton, East Sussex, while his girlfriend Ms Dobson, worked as a veterinary receptionist for Vets 4 Pets in Worthing. High winds delayed emergency services from getting the injured to hospital The helicopter company involved - Papillon Airways - calls itself ""the world's largest aerial sightseeing company"" and says it flies more than 600,000 people a year. The Grand Canyon, which is more than one mile (1.6km) deep, is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the US.

Suicide after 'paedophile hunter' sting,"David Baker killed himself after being arrested and released while inquiries continued A man killed himself three days after being confronted by a ""paedophile hunter"" group, an inquest has heard. David Baker, 43, was arrested after the Southampton Trap group, which posts footage of its ""stings"" on Facebook, accused him of trying to meet a 14-year-old at a supermarket car park. He was released while inquiries continued before taking an overdose of prescription drugs in October 2017, Winchester Coroner's Court was told. A verdict of suicide was recorded. Mr Baker, a gardener, was found dead at his home in Wickham, Hampshire, on 7 October after being held by police on 4 October on suspicion of arranging to meet a child aged under 16. His fiancÃ©e Kelly Davies told the inquest she found out about the ""sting"" through friends and posts on Facebook. She said: ""None of us knew anything. We just thought it was someone being sick. We didn't really believe it."" Ms Davies's daughter, Cherelle Stares, told the court her family's address had been posted on social media following the arrest. ""I didn't feel safe as there are idiots out there, and I didn't want a brick being put through the window with my mum and daughter there,"" she said. Coroner Grahame Short said: ""It's not for me to judge David's actions on 4 October or indeed the actions of Southampton Trap which led to his arrest. ""However I believe in this particular case the postings on social media after his arrest contributed to the stress on David, and to him being alone and isolated in his own home where he made his decision to end his own life. ""This was therefore a causative factor to what led to his death, at least in part.""

Farm subsidies 'to help environment',"Environment Secretary Michael Gove wants to end direct payments based on the amount of land farmed Up to Â£150m in support payments could be shifted from the richest farmers to environmental schemes after Brexit, under government plans. Environment Secretary Michael Gove wants to end direct payments based on the amount of land farmed. Instead, farmers will receive money for ""public goods"", such as investment in sustainable food production. But the National Farmers Union said it should not all be about the environment. Farmers currently get paid about Â£3bn a year under the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), largely linked to the amount of land that farmers own. Post-Brexit farming funding set out by Michael Gove Farm subsidies 'must be earned' Five times food fights have had an impact on trade talks Gove backing Brexit farm workers support The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has said there would be a transition period between the two systems, during which time either a cap would be placed on the largest payments, or they would be gradually reduced, with higher earners facing larger reductions. This would see more than Â£150m going towards funding environmental schemes, rewarding farmers who encourage biodiversity and improve soil health or air quality. In a consultation paper published on Tuesday, Defra gives examples of how the caps in subsidies could work, including: A Â£100,000 cap on payments, affecting about 2,100 farmers; or A progressive reduction in payments affecting about 19,000 farmers. Of these 13,500 would face a payment reduction of less than Â£5,000 and about 300 - all with claims worth over Â£200,000 - would lose more than Â£75,000 Speaking to the BBC's Environment Correspondent Claire Marshall, Mr Gove said: ""It's been the case in the past that we have put too much emphasis on trying to generate a form of farming that is neglectful of the environment. ""Now the balance has shifted... and this command paper today backs farmers who want to do the right thing. ""We're not going to give you money simply on the basis that you've already got a big estate. ""We'll only give you money if you are contributing to the environment, making sure we have fewer floods, making sure that there are habits for the wildlife that we value, making sure that our water, our rivers are cleaner, and that our air is purer."" Farmers will receive money for ""public goods"", such as investment in sustainable food production Farmers in the Cotswold Hills, where Mr Gove visited ahead of the consultation, were concerned about the deals that have yet to be struck. Organic farmer Rob Richmond, from Manor Farm in Chedworth, Gloucestershire, said: ""It's more important that we've got the trade deals are right, and that the core business is profitable."" Another farmer, Jeannie Hamilton, said: ""To keep the trade deals is more important - because we've got to have somewhere to sell our product."" National Farmers Union president Minette Batters told the BBC: ""Michael Gove has committed now to launching a national food plan, we've been lobbying for that for a long time. ""We feel that food has been taken for granted for far too long, and now is the time to take it seriously."" As well as environmental benefits, farmers would be given incentives to pilot schemes to improve animal welfare, or to trial new technology. Additionally, strong regulation of pesticides would be encouraged. Mr Gove has said that farmers will be given five years from the date that the UK leaves the EU to prepare for the change. The consultation on the Agriculture Bill runs for ten weeks, until the end of May.

Corbyn backs customs union membership,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn speaks to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg about his Brexit plans Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed the UK being in a permanent customs union with the EU in a speech setting out his approach to Brexit. He said this would avoid the need for a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland and ensure free-flowing trade for business. The policy shift could lead to Labour siding with Tory rebels to defeat Theresa May on her Brexit strategy. But a customs union after Brexit would be a ""complete sell out"", International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will argue. Mr Corbyn insisted in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg that his speech was a ""firming up"" of Labour's existing policy, which was to back customs union membership during the planned two-year transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Key quotes: And what he meant Read Laura Kuenssberg's analysis Brexit: All you need to know This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Brexit is what we make of it In his speech, at Coventry University, Mr Corbyn said Labour would be ""looking for a Brexit that puts the working people first"". In a shift from the party's policy at last year's general election, he said the UK should strike a new customs deal with the EU at the end of transition. ""Labour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union,"" he said. ""We have long argued that a customs union is a viable option for the final deal. ""So Labour would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure that there are no tariffs with Europe and to help avoid any need for a hard border in Northern Ireland."" Theresa May held key Brexit strategy talks at Chequers last week The prime minister has insisted the UK will leave both the single market and the customs union, allowing it to negotiate its own post-Brexit trade deals. Mrs May will give details in a speech on Friday of how her plan for a ""managed diversion"" from the EU will work in practice, after first briefing the cabinet. The Conservatives accused Mr Corbyn of ""betraying millions of Labour voters"" who had backed Brexit. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn has revealed a 'big' Brexit difference with Theresa May, the BBC's Chris Morris says. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Labour's ""confused policy would be bad for jobs and wages"". And in a speech on Tuesday, he will say the UK would find itself in a ""worse position"" than it is now if it leaves the existing customs union but negotiates a similar arrangement. A customs union allows free-flowing trade between member nations without making companies pay export taxes, or tariffs, at the border. However, the members normally have joint trade agreements with countries not in their customs union. A single market is a deeper form of co-operation, which effectively merges the economies of member states together, allowing the free movement of goods, services, money and people as if they were part of a single country. What's the difference between single market and customs union? Mr Corbyn rejected calls from pro-EU figures like Lord Mandelson and a number of his own backbenchers to commit to staying in the EU single market, saying instead that he wanted a ""close relationship"" with it. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out continuing with free movement of people between the UK and the EU in some form after Brexit, under Labour's plans, but he told BBC News it would have to be negotiated - as would any financial contribution the UK would make. He said the UK could work ""jointly"" with the EU after Brexit to strike trade deals with other nations - something the government insists is not possible. Analysis By BBC political correspondent Ian Watson So the dividing lines are clear politically - if less clear in practice. Clear politically, because the government is committed to coming out of the customs union. And in contrast Labour now says it wants to negotiate ""a new comprehensive customs union"" with the EU. That puts clear blue water between opposition and government - and may signal to Remain voters that Labour wants a 'softer' Brexit, staying closer to the EU. But in practice, there may be fewer differences than meets the eye.  Jeremy Corbyn wants a customs union that would still give the UK a say in EU-led trade deals - which the EU may resist. And Theresa May has spoken of a new ""customs arrangement,"" which would, er, allow independent trade deals.  But it's currently in the government and opposition's political interests to emphasise the differences,  not the similarities. Jeremy Corbyn refused to be drawn on whether his policy shift was an attempt to remove Theresa May from office and force a general election. Tory rebels have been tight-lipped about whether they would vote against Mrs May if it came down to a confidence vote in her premiership, saying that was unlikely to happen. But Labour MP Frank Field, who backed Leave and said Mr Corbyn was once more Eurosceptic than him, told the BBC that being in a customs union or the single market would be a ""deceit"" and dismissed suggestions Tory rebels could join with Labour to defeat the government as ""fairy tales"" and they would win any vote by a large majority. Labour's customs union policy 'evolves' Hunt rules out staying in customs union The customs union explained in 45 seconds - BBC News Mr Corbyn was an opponent of the EU when he was a backbench Labour MP, as he explained in his speech. ""I have long opposed the embedding of free market orthodoxy and the democratic deficit in the European Union, and that is why I campaigned to 'remain and reform' in the referendum campaign."" He said scepticism was ""healthy"" but ""often the term 'Eurosceptic' in reality became synonymous with 'anti-European' and I am not anti-European at all, I want to see close and progressive cooperation with the whole of Europe after Brexit"". He said this ""new relationship"" he wanted to negotiate with the EU would ensure Labour could deliver on its plans to nationalise public utilities, invest in industry and curb the outsourcing of public services. Mr Corbyn's speech was welcomed by Britain's largest trade unions while industry body, the CBI, said staying in a customs union would ""grow trade without accepting freedom of movement or payments to the EU"". Pro-European Labour MPs said he had not gone far enough and urged him to commit to staying in the single market. But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was the ""first step in a complete Labour sell-out"" while the DUP, the party Mrs May relies on to win key votes in the Commons, said it was ""cheap political opportunism"". Liberal Democrats leader Sir Vince Cable tweeted that Mr Corbyn's customs union stance was a ""small step to sanity"", but added: ""In #SingleMarket he is still following @theresa-may cake and eat it policy. Just wants red cherries rather than blue raisins."" Labour customs union shift confirmed Hunt rules out staying in customs union UK will leave customs union, No 10 insists What happens now that a deal's been done?

Far-right terror threat 'growing' in UKThe UK's top counter-terrorism police officer says four extreme-right plots were foiled last year11h11 hours agoUK,"This video can not be played Mark Rowley said four far-right terror attacks were foiled last year The retiring head of counter-terrorism policing in the UK has warned of the growing threat of far-right terrorism. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, who will retire from the Met Police next month, said four extreme-right terror plots were disrupted last year. Ten Islamist-inspired plots have been foiled since March last year, he added. In a speech made at Policy Exchange, the Met Police's Mr Rowley also warned that far-right extremists are working in similar ways to Islamist extremists. He said they create intolerance, exploit grievances, and generate distrust of state institutions. One of the four alleged far-right plots disrupted was that of white supremacist Ethan Stables. Earlier this month,he was convicted of plotting an axe and machete attack on a gay pride event at a pub in Barrow. The clues right-wing terrorists give away UK unveils extremism blocking tool Was 2017 the worst year for UK terrorism? Mr Rowley said: ""Islamist and right-wing extremism is reaching into our communities through sophisticated propaganda and subversive strategies creating and exploiting vulnerabilities that can ultimately lead to acts of violence and terrorism. ""Ten conspiracies of an Islamist nature were stopped since the Westminster attack. ""And I can tell you today that over the same period police have been able to prevent a further four extreme, right-wing inspired plots in the UK."" He said it was ""important we make these figures public in order to illustrate the growth of right-wing extremism"". Referring to the banned group National Action, he said: ""For the first time we have a home-grown proscribed white supremacist, neo-Nazi terror group, which seeks to plan attacks and build international networks."" Last year, the security service MI5 joined the fight against the right-wing terrorist threat. There are currently more than 600 live investigations and more than 3,000 people of interest at any one time. While they have not been involved directly in terrorism, he singled out Tommy Robinson, who founded the English Defence League (EDL), and Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, as voices from the far right who stir up tensions. Mr Rowley told the BBC: ""In the noise and focus on the global threat, and what we've wrestled with with Daesh [the Islamic State group], I don't think the change and growth in extreme right-wing terrorist threat has been explained or described well enough - and that's one of the things I wanted to do."" Aside from the attempted gay pride attack in Barrow, the other three alleged plots that were foiled last year are yet to come to trial. One allegedly involved a neo-Nazi buying a machete with the intention of murdering the Labour MP Rosie Cooper. Mr Rowley oversaw the response to five terror attacks in the UK last year, including at Westminster Mr Rowley said the ability of extremists and terrorists of all kinds to ""ply their trade"" through the internet was of great concern. He urged social media companies to do more to combat extremism. ""Many of them tried to argue for some that they simply provide pipes, they have no editorial responsibilities,"" he said. ""That argument was always in my view nonsense. They've stopped using that argument. They've started to try and take some responsibility. ""I think to be fair to them, they can't exert editorial control over everything that is published on their sites. ""But they can exert a massive amount of control both on the day-to -ay management of it, and I think more in the future about how they design their platforms and their operating systems and their products. ""Their products shouldn't simply be designed for maximising profit, they should be designed with a parallel objective around public safety."" Mr Rowley was also asked what should happen to two Londoners suspected of being members of an Islamic State cell - dubbed ""the Beatles"" by Western media because of their British accents. The gang was notorious for kidnapping Western hostages and filming their murders - often by beheading. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured in Syria in January and are accused of links to a string of hostage murders in Iraq and Syria. Mr Rowley said: ""The people who have done the most ghastly things overseas, the ones who don't fight to the death, we would all like to see them never able to do anyone any harm ever again.

Putin orders Syria 'humanitarian pause'Russia's president orders daily five-hour pauses in Syria's assault on the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta.11h11 hours agoMiddle East,"This video can not be played A doctor in Eastern Ghouta says there is still shelling, but ""the level is less than before"" Russia's President Vladimir Putin has ordered a daily five-hour pause in the Syrian government's assault on the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area. It will start on Tuesday, and include the creation of a ""humanitarian corridor"" to allow civilians to leave. The rebel enclave near Damascus, where 393,000 civilians are trapped, has been under intense bombardment by government forces with Russian support. More than 560 people have been killed in eight days, a monitoring group says. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu made the announcement about the ""humanitarian pause"", saying it would run from 09:00 until 14:00 local time (07:00-12:00 GMT) daily. In a further statement, the ministry said the Syrian Red Crescent would help set up the corridor and people would receive information about it via leaflets, text messages and videos. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? No. A UN Security Council resolution passed on Saturday demanded that ""all parties cease hostilities without delay for at least 30 consecutive days"" to allow humanitarian aid deliveries and medical evacuations of critically ill people. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday that the resolution needed to be implemented immediately, warning: ""Eastern Ghouta cannot wait. It's high time to stop this hell on Earth."" But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that the UN-mandated truce would ""start when all sides of the conflict agree on how to introduce it"". He said the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda would be excluded, as well as the major Islamist rebel factions Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam. Mr Lavrov called them ""partners of al-Nusra Front"" - the name of a former al-Qaeda affiliate whose latest incarnation is an alliance of jihadists called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It has a small presence in the Eastern Ghouta. By Jeremy Bowen, Middle East editor, BBC News If it works, President Putin's announcement of a daily humanitarian truce is the best news the hard-pressed people in the Eastern Ghouta have had since the bombardment intensified more than a week ago. However, it is not the full implementation of the UN Security Council resolution. That resolution was weakened by the compromises necessary to stop it being vetoed by the Russians, who are Syrian President Assad's most essential allies. No start date was agreed for the ceasefire demanded by the resolution. Instead, it used the wording ""without delay"". That leaves a lot of scope for Russia to impose conditions to buy more time for attacks on armed opposition groups. Operations against the jihadists of IS and al-Qaeda are excluded from the resolution. But Moscow also says it will continue to hit Jaysh al-Islam. It is by far the most powerful opposition group in the Eastern Ghouta, is backed by Saudi Arabia, and has been to the Geneva peace talks. Jaysh al-Islam has accepted the ceasefire, while reserving the right of self-defence. Russia and the Syrian government regard all the opposition groups as terrorists. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, says 36 people have been killed in the enclave since the UN resolution was passed at the weekend. On Monday, 22 people were killed in air and artillery strikes on the towns of Douma and Harasta, it reported. This video can not be played Rawaa has been living in a basement with around 75 others for months The Syria Civil Defence, a rescue organisation whose volunteers operate in rebel-held areas, said nine civilians had been killed in a strike on one building in Douma. The official Sana news agency meanwhile cited police as saying a civilian had been injured in the government-controlled Qassa area of Damascus by shells fired by Eastern Ghouta rebels. Government health official Zaher Hajjo told Reuters news agency that rebel shellfire had caused 36 deaths and a number of injuries in the last four days. Ambulance drivers reported a chlorine smell following reported a large explosion in the town of al-Shifuniya at around 18:30 (16:30 GMT). The opposition-run health directorate in the Eastern Ghouta said at least 18 people were treated after presenting symptoms consistent with exposure to a toxic chemical, including breathing difficulties, eye irritation and dizziness. One male infant died, while a four-month-old baby had to be put on a ventilator, it added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

None of the reports could be independently verified, and it was unclear whether the boy's death was related to exposure to a chemical or the initial explosion. Mr Lavrov said ""bogus stories"" about the use of chlorine were a ""provocation"" intended to sabotage the UN resolution. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. However, experts from the UN and the Organisations for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons say government forces used chlorine as a weapon at least three times between 2014 and 2015. They are also confident that government forces used the nerve agent Sarin in an attack on a northern rebel-held town last April, killing more than 80 people.

BBC Weather has warned of possibly hazardous conditions in southern England later in the week as a low pressure weather system moves up from the Bay of Biscay and hits the already ""exceptionally cold air"". Alina Jenkins, from the BBC's Weather service, said: ""Any precipitation will turn readily to snow, and with bitterly cold strong to gale force easterly winds, blizzards are likely."" Met Office meteorologist Charlie Powell said: ""Unusually for Britain, the snow is going to be quite dry, so it will blow around and gather in drifts and we could see some blizzard conditions."" He added that while he did not want to alarm people, the Met Office was urging people to be prepared for the so-called ""beast from the East"".

Cruise ship cocaine women plead guilty,"Melina Roberge (left) with Isabelle LagacÃ©, who was jailed last year Two Canadians have pleaded guilty to smuggling cocaine into Sydney, Australia on a cruise ship. Melina Roberge, 23, and Andre Tamine, 64, had initially denied their roles in the import of 95kg (210lb) of drugs on the MS Sea Princess in 2016. But they changed their pleas ahead of a trial that was due to start this week, Australian media reported. A third Canadian, 29-year-oldIsabelle LagacÃ©, was sentenced to jail in Novemberover her part in the crime. According to authorities, the cocaine had an estimated street value of A$21m (Â£12m; $17m), making it the largest seizure of its kind on a passenger boat in Australia. On social media, Roberge and LagacÃ© had posted images of themselves enjoying what appeared to be a seven-week holiday on a cruise from Southampton. But when the ship docked in Sydney, police sniffer dogs found 35kg of cocaine inside their shared cabin. A further 60kg was discovered in Tamine's cabin. It was unclear how the women and Tamine were connected, local media reported. Authorities have linked them to a ""well-organised syndicate"". All three were charged with importing a commercial quantity of cocaine, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of life in jail. LagacÃ© was given a sentence of seven and a half years in jail.The Sydney Morning Herald reported,externalshe had been trying to clear an A$20,000 debt. ""It pains me to know my most defining years of womanhood will be spent in jailâ¦ I feel remorse and anger at myself about being involved with people who are part of a dirty, dirty drug trade,"" LagacÃ© said in an affidavit, according to the newspaper. Roberge and Tamine will be sentenced later this year.

Saudi military chiefs sacked overnight,"King Salman (C) acceded to the throne in 2015 Saudi Arabia has sacked its top military commanders, including the chief of staff, in a series of late-night royal decrees. Saudi King Salman also replaced the heads of the ground forces and air defences. The news was published by the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA), but no reason for the sackings was given. They come as the war in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting rebels, is nearing the end of its third year. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is also the defence minister, is believed to be behind various recent shake-ups in the country. Last year dozens of prominent Saudi figures, including princes, ministers and billionaires, were locked up in Riyadh's five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel asthe prince led a drive against corruption and abuse of power. The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed? Profile: King Salman of Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia allows women to join army Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab Affairs Editor This is another sweeping overhaul of Saudi institutions that has become the hallmark of the reign of King Salman, although the driving force is once again his son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The Saudi intervention in the Yemen conflict was his initiative - one of the first indications of just how dramatically he was going to break away from the country's traditional caution. And it has so far failed, even if it has forced the Houthi rebels out of the south of Yemen and allowed the ousted government to re-establish a foothold. The cost for Yemen itself has been a humanitarian disaster, while it has also drained Saudi coffers in a time of austerity. The service of the chief of staff, General Abdul Rahman bin Saleh al-Bunyan, is among those ""terminated"", said the SPA. Various military figures have already been promoted to replace those sacked. A series of political appointments were announced at the same time, including the rare appointment of a female deputy minister of labour and social development, Tamadar bint Yousef al-Ramah. Prince Turki bin Talal was appointed new deputy governor of the south-west Asir province. He is the brother ofbillionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who was detained in the anti-corruption drive and released two months later.

Facebook Messenger used to fight extremism,"Facebook Messenger has been used to try to deradicalise extremists in a pilot project funded entirely by the company. People posting extreme far-right and Islamist content in the UK were identified and contacted in an attempt to challenge their views. Of the 569 people contacted, 76 had a conversation of five or more messages and eight showed signs it had a positive impact, researchers claim. Privacy campaigners say it means Facebook is straying into surveillance. Technology companies have been urged to do more to stop extremist material littering their sites following a series of cases involving people who were radicalised online. This pilot was led by the counter-extremism organisation Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), which says it was trying to mimic extremists' own recruitment methods. It told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme andBBC World Service's World Hacksit used software to scan several far-right and Islamist pages on Facebook for targets. It then manually looked at their profiles looking for instances of violent, dehumanising and hateful language. It employed 11 ""intervention providers"" - either former extremists, survivors of terrorism or trained counsellors, who were paid Â£25 per hour for eight hours' work a week. One was Colin Bidwell, who was caught up in the Tunisia terror attack in 2015. Under a fake profile, he spoke to people who appeared to support Islamist extremism, including some who may support the Tunisia gunman, and was tasked with challenging their views with chatty conversation and questions. ""I think I'm entitled to ask those questions after what I've been through,"" he explained. ""If there's the smallest chance that I could make some form of difference or awareness, for me I'm in."" Colin Bidwell was caught up in the Tunisia terror attack in 2015 Many did not respond, but some entered into long conversations. Mr Bidwell would talk a little about religion, about the effect the attack has had on his wife and how he worries for the future of his children in ""such a violent world"". ""One of the things I would say is, 'You can have your extreme beliefs, but when it gets to the extreme violence - that's the bit I don't understand',"" he said. Other intervention providers would use different tactics depending on their background - a former extremist targeted young women telling them she used to think like they did, but that violence was not the answer. Roughly half the people they chose to try and chat with had showed support for Islamist extremism and half had far-right sympathies. The group was also split evenly between men and women. The aim was to ""walk them back from the edge, potentially, of violence"", said Sasha Havlicek, the chief executive of the ISD. ""We were trying to fill a really big gap in responses to online recruitment and radicalisation and that gap is in the direct messaging space. Sasha Havlicek believes direct messaging can be used to counter extremism ""There's quite a lot of work being done to counter general propaganda with counter-speech and the removal of content, but we know that extremists are very effective in direct messaging,"" she explained. ""And yet there's no systematic work being done to reach out on that direct engagement basis with individuals being drawn into these groups."" Privacy campaigners are concerned about the project, especially that Facebook funded something that broke its own rules by creating fake profiles. Millie Graham Wood says any posts found promoting extremism should have been taken down Millie Graham Wood, a solicitor at the Privacy International charity, said: ""If there's stuff that they're identifying that shouldn't be there, Facebook should be taking it down. ""Even if the organisation [ISD] itself may have been involved in doing research over many years, that does not mean that they're qualified to carry out this sort of... surveillance role."" Facebook funded the initiative but would not disclose how much it had spent. It said it did not give ISD special access to its users' profiles. Its public policy manager, Karim Palant, said the company does not allow the creation of fake profiles - which the project relied on - and said that the research was done without Facebook interference. ""The research techniques and exactly what they did was a matter for them,"" he said. During conversations, the intervention providers did not volunteer the fact that they were working for the ISD, unless asked directly. This happened seven times during the project, and on those occasions the conversation ended, sometimes after a row. Overall, of the 569 people contacted, researchers claim eight of the people contacted showed signs, in the conversations, of rethinking their views. Despite the small numbers involved, the ISD argue the pilot showed online counter-extremism conversations can make a difference. It wants to now explore how it could be expanded both in the UK, and overseas, and how a similar method could be used on platforms such as Instagram, Reddit, and Twitter.

Florida school officer defends his actionsScot Peterson was branded a coward by President Trump for not confronting a school gunman.3m4 minutes agoUS & Canada,"Scot Peterson resigned after being suspended The armed school officer branded a coward by President Donald Trump has defended his actions during the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Scot Peterson was outside the school when a gunman killed 17 people, but did not go inside as shots rang out. His attorney, Joseph DiRuzzo, said his client believed the gunfire was coming from outside the school. He followed his training by taking cover and prompting a lockdown, the lawyer said. Mr DiRuzzo said it was ""patently untrue"" that Mr Peterson was a coward on the day. Mr Peterson, a veteran officer who had been assigned to guard the high school, resigned last week after his boss, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, suspended him without pay. Sheriff Israel said that footage from the scene had left him ""devastated"" and ""sick to my stomach"". School to close over church rifle event America's gun culture in 10 charts But Mr DiRuzzo accused the sheriff of ""at best, gross oversimplification"", saying he ""jumped to a conclusion"" about Mr Peterson's behaviour. Mr Peterson said he had originally ""received a call of firecrackers"". Only when he ran towards the sound, he said, did he realise it was gunshots. Broward Sheriff's Office had trained him to seek cover and assess the situation in the event of outdoor gunfire, his lawyer said. Mr Peterson did so, and then told the sheriff's office he had heard shots, prompting a ""Code Red"" lockdown of the school campus. Where US protest movements might go from here Six radical ways to stop US school shootings When police arrived, he told them he thought the gunman was outside - a belief backed up by ""radio transmissions [which] indicated that there was a gunshot victim in the area of the football field,"" Mr Peterson said, according to his lawyer. His attorney said in a statement: ""Let there be no mistake, Mr Peterson wishes that he could have prevented the untimely passing of the 17 victims on that day, and his heart goes out to the families of the victims in their time of need. ""However, the allegations that Mr Peterson was a coward and that his performance, under the circumstances, failed to meet the standards of police officers are patently untrue."" Meanwhile, Georgia Republicans are threatening Delta Air Lines after it joined a host of companies that have ended discounts for National Rifle Association (NRA) members in the wake of the Florida school shooting. The US state's Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle vowed to block legislation containing a lucrative jet fuel tax exemption that would benefit the carrier. ""I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA,"" Mr Cagle wrote on Twitter. ""Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back."" On Saturday, Delta and United Airlines stopped offering special rates to the more than five million NRA members. Car rental firms, banks, insurance firms and hoteliers have also withdrawn deals for the gun lobby group since the 14 February attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. On Monday, the president asserted that he would have run into the Florida high school if he had been there, even if he had not been armed. ""I really believe I'd run in there even if I didn't have a weapon,"" Mr Trump told a group of state governors at the White House on Monday. This video can not be played Trump: 'I would have run in even if I didn't have weapon' Mr Trump also said it was ""frankly, disgusting"" that officers apparently did not confront the suspect on 14 February. Broward County Sheriff's Office is reportedly also investigating why three of its deputies appeared to remain outside the building with their guns drawn as the attack unfolded. Mr Trump criticised those officers as well, saying they ""weren't exactly medal of honour winners""- a reference to the US military award for valour. Students, including activist Emma Gonzalez (L), returned to school on Sunday for the afternoon In Florida, students are preparing to return full-time to their classrooms on Wednesday after some attended a volunteer ""orientation"" on Sunday.

'Arm me with books' - the teachers saying no to guns The massacre was the second-deadliest ever shooting at a US school. Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former student at the school, has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. Police have said he admitted the shooting. In the aftermath of the attack, students from the school have founded a movement campaigning for gun control, which has seen them march on their state capitol.

Putin orders Syria 'humanitarian pause'Russia's president orders daily five-hour pauses in Syria's assault on the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta.6h6 hours agoMiddle East,"This video can not be played A doctor in Eastern Ghouta says there is still shelling, but ""the level is less than before"" Russia's President Vladimir Putin has ordered a daily five-hour pause in the Syrian government's assault on the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area. It will start on Tuesday, and include the creation of a ""humanitarian corridor"" to allow civilians to leave. The rebel enclave near Damascus, where 393,000 civilians are trapped, has been under intense bombardment by government forces with Russian support. More than 560 people have been killed in eight days, a monitoring group says. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu made the announcement about the ""humanitarian pause"", saying it would run from 09:00 until 14:00 local time (07:00-12:00 GMT) daily. In a further statement, the ministry said the Syrian Red Crescent would help set up the corridor and people would receive information about it via leaflets, text messages and videos. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? No. A UN Security Council resolution passed on Saturday demanded that ""all parties cease hostilities without delay for at least 30 consecutive days"" to allow humanitarian aid deliveries and medical evacuations of critically ill people. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday that the resolution needed to be implemented immediately, warning: ""Eastern Ghouta cannot wait. It's high time to stop this hell on Earth."" But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that the UN-mandated truce would ""start when all sides of the conflict agree on how to introduce it"". He said the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda would be excluded, as well as the major Islamist rebel factions Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam. Mr Lavrov called them ""partners of al-Nusra Front"" - the name of a former al-Qaeda affiliate whose latest incarnation is an alliance of jihadists called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It has a small presence in the Eastern Ghouta. By Jeremy Bowen, Middle East editor, BBC News If it works, President Putin's announcement of a daily humanitarian truce is the best news the hard-pressed people in the Eastern Ghouta have had since the bombardment intensified more than a week ago. However, it is not the full implementation of the UN Security Council resolution. That resolution was weakened by the compromises necessary to stop it being vetoed by the Russians, who are Syrian President Assad's most essential allies. No start date was agreed for the ceasefire demanded by the resolution. Instead, it used the wording ""without delay"". That leaves a lot of scope for Russia to impose conditions to buy more time for attacks on armed opposition groups. Operations against the jihadists of IS and al-Qaeda are excluded from the resolution. But Moscow also says it will continue to hit Jaysh al-Islam. It is by far the most powerful opposition group in the Eastern Ghouta, is backed by Saudi Arabia, and has been to the Geneva peace talks. Jaysh al-Islam has accepted the ceasefire, while reserving the right of self-defence. Russia and the Syrian government regard all the opposition groups as terrorists. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, says 36 people have been killed in the enclave since the UN resolution was passed at the weekend. On Monday, 22 people were killed in air and artillery strikes on the towns of Douma and Harasta, it reported. This video can not be played Rawaa has been living in a basement with around 75 others for months The Syria Civil Defence, a rescue organisation whose volunteers operate in rebel-held areas, said nine civilians had been killed in a strike on one building in Douma. The official Sana news agency meanwhile cited police as saying a civilian had been injured in the government-controlled Qassa area of Damascus by shells fired by Eastern Ghouta rebels. Government health official Zaher Hajjo told Reuters news agency that rebel shellfire had caused 36 deaths and a number of injuries in the last four days. Ambulance drivers reported a chlorine smell following reported a large explosion in the town of al-Shifuniya at around 18:30 (16:30 GMT). The opposition-run health directorate in the Eastern Ghouta said at least 18 people were treated after presenting symptoms consistent with exposure to a toxic chemical, including breathing difficulties, eye irritation and dizziness. One male infant died, while a four-month-old baby had to be put on a ventilator, it added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

None of the reports could be independently verified, and it was unclear whether the boy's death was related to exposure to a chemical or the initial explosion. Mr Lavrov said ""bogus stories"" about the use of chlorine were a ""provocation"" intended to sabotage the UN resolution. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. However, experts from the UN and the Organisations for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons say government forces used chlorine as a weapon at least three times between 2014 and 2015. They are also confident that government forces used the nerve agent Sarin in an attack on a northern rebel-held town last April, killing more than 80 people.

"Suicide after 'paedophile hunter' stingDavid Baker, 43, was found dead three days after being accused of trying to meet a 14-year-old.6h6 hours agoHampshire & Isle of Wight","David Baker killed himself after being arrested and released while inquiries continued A man killed himself three days after being confronted by a ""paedophile hunter"" group, an inquest has heard. David Baker, 43, was arrested after the Southampton Trap group, which posts footage of its ""stings"" on Facebook, accused him of trying to meet a 14-year-old at a supermarket car park. He was released while inquiries continued before taking an overdose of prescription drugs in October 2017, Winchester Coroner's Court was told. A verdict of suicide was recorded. Mr Baker, a gardener, was found dead at his home in Wickham, Hampshire, on 7 October after being held by police on 4 October on suspicion of arranging to meet a child aged under 16. His fiancÃ©e Kelly Davies told the inquest she found out about the ""sting"" through friends and posts on Facebook. She said: ""None of us knew anything. We just thought it was someone being sick. We didn't really believe it."" Ms Davies's daughter, Cherelle Stares, told the court her family's address had been posted on social media following the arrest. ""I didn't feel safe as there are idiots out there, and I didn't want a brick being put through the window with my mum and daughter there,"" she said. Coroner Grahame Short said: ""It's not for me to judge David's actions on 4 October or indeed the actions of Southampton Trap which led to his arrest. ""However I believe in this particular case the postings on social media after his arrest contributed to the stress on David, and to him being alone and isolated in his own home where he made his decision to end his own life. ""This was therefore a causative factor to what led to his death, at least in part.""
