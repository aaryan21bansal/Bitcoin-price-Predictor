Afghans begin uneasy transition,"A girl at second hand market in Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan. Some Afghans have been forced to sell their belongings to make ends meet At Balkh airfield in Mazar-i-Sharif, northern Afghanistan, Taliban fighters excitedly snap photos of a Russian-made MI-17 helicopter touching down. On board are senior Taliban officials. Sitting in the cockpit are their former enemies: pilots from the old Afghan air force. Maulvi Abdullah Mansour, the Taliban commander in charge of the airfield, shows me round the fleet he now controls. It includes attack helicopters and fighter planes, gifted to the previous government by international forces. Under the old government, the aircraft were often used to target the group. It's not clear how they will be used now that the war is over. ""If we ever need them in the future, they are here,"" Mansour says. As the Taliban advanced across Afghanistan ahead of its August victory, dozens of pilots fled the country in fear of their lives, taking their aircraft with them. But others stayed on and now work under the leadership of the Taliban, reassured, it appears, by assurances of an amnesty. I ask Maulvi Mansour how it feels to now be working alongside men he was once fighting against. ""We always knew in our hearts that we would conquer and liberate the country,"" he says, ""but we also knew that one morning we would sit down and work together because they are our countrymen."" Taliban fighters pose in front of former army helicopters at Balkh airfield. Sitting next to him is Gul Rahman, a helicopter pilot. He appears cautious in his answers, insisting that once he heard about the Taliban's amnesty he was never afraid of returning to work. ""It was inevitable this would happen one day,"" he says, ""we never thought we could continue on our separate paths forever â¦ We will leave the politics to the politicians and work together to develop the country."" Younger Taliban fighters mill around us in the hangar, looking on with curiosity at two MD-530 helicopters. Signs of a degree of underlying tension are visible as one of the Talibs quizzes a mechanic about his qualifications. ""You all got these jobs through personal connections, not because you're properly qualified,"" he says in an accusing tone. Nevertheless, overall the atmosphere seems amicable. PROFILES:Who's who in the Taliban leadership INVESTIGATION:Taliban kill civilians in resistance stronghold VOICES:Uncertain times ahead for Afghan women Elsewhere, the transition from old to new regime is going less smoothly. The country is facing an economic crisis, with foreign reserves frozen as the international community decides how to help Afghans but not the Taliban. There are restrictions on cash withdrawals and long queues at banks. Second-hand markets have sprung up in cities across the country, with desperate Afghans trying to sell their possessions just to be able to afford enough to eat. One woman, Shagufta, is sat on the roadside, rifling through the clothes she's brought to sell. ""Life has become an insult now, we are dying slowly,"" she tells us tearfully. She's weak because she didn't have any food for breakfast, or for dinner the night before. ""Everything I had I gave to my children,"" she says, ""now I am selling their finest clothes, what they used to wear to weddings â¦ If I get a good price I will buy oil, rice and flour."" Her story epitomises the deep-rooted inequalities in the country. Her husband retired from the police six years ago, but barely ever received his pension under the previous government. The family was just about able to cope as Shagufta worked washing and stitching clothes in her neighbourhood. With increased financial pressure though, even that work dried up. ""The Islamic Emirate is good, there's no theft or crime anymore,"" she says. ""We just have one problem, there's no work and no money."" Shagufta at the market in Mazar-i-Sharif. ""I am selling my children's finest clothes,"" she said. The second-hand market in Mazar-i-Sharif is teeming. Many of those we meet are government employees. Most public sector workers haven't received their salaries for at least two months now. The problem began under the previous government, but now they have no idea when or if they will be paid again. One teacher has already sold everything she can. ""I became a shopkeeper in my own house and sold all my belongings â¦ Whatever I earned I am using to buy food now. Whenever I come here and see the condition of the people I go home and cry."" Nonetheless, she says she's still turning up to work every day. Across the road is Mazar-i-Sharif's main hospital. It's now run by a Taliban official, but his deputy is continuing in the same position he held under the previous government. Staff haven't been paid since the Taliban takeover, with uncertainty over how the ministry of health will be funded, while the current reserve stock of medicine will only last for another month. The transition of power in Afghanistan ended up being much less violent and bloody than many had feared, but around half the country were already in dire need, and for many now the struggle to survive is getting even harder. Back in Kabul, we meet a former policeman trying to make ends meet. ""It makes no difference to me who's in the government,"" he says. He is now selling Taliban flags by the side of the road. ""There's no work around,"" he says. ""What else can I do?"" Additional reporting by Malik Mudasir and Shams Ahmadzai.

"No chance lights will go out, says government","This video can not be played Kwasi Kwarteng: Talk of the lights going out is âalarmist, unhelpful and completely misguided"" There is ""no question of the lights going out"" this winter as a result of huge rises in gas prices, the business secretary has said. Kwasi Kwarteng said he does ""not expect supply emergencies"" and described warnings about shortages as ""alarmist"". His statement comes as smaller energy providers battle to stay afloat due to gas price hikes making price promises to customers undeliverable. High demand for gas and reduced supply are behind a surge in wholesale prices. Customers are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which is the maximum price they can be charged on a standard tariff. However, the cap means energy firms are unable to pass on higher wholesale costs to their customers, which is forcing some - mostly smaller companies - to go out of business. So far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. On Sunday, the UK's sixth largest energy company,Bulb, announced it is seeking a bailout. The government has said it is considering offering emergency state-backed loans to surviving energy companies to encourage them to take on customers from bust firms. Mr Kwarteng said the government would ""not be bailing out failed companies"" and said the sector had seen a ""regular entry and exit"" over the past five to 10 years. ""The current global situation may see more suppliers than usual exiting the market but this is not something that should be any cause for alarm or panic,"" he said. ""The taxpayer should not be expected to prop up companies which have poor business models and are not resilient to fluctuations in price."" Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up' How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? 'UK not seeing risks to supplies right now' Are energy bills going up and what can I do? The business secretary said the government wanted to protect customers from ""price spikes"" and that the energy industry should not  return to the ""cosy oligopoly"" of years past where a few large suppliers ""dictated to customers conditions and pricing"". At the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK, but industry sources have said there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year. Mr Kwarteng added the UK benefited from having a ""diverse range of gas supply sources"" and had ""more than sufficient capacity, to meet demand"". Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned that UK families were going to be hit by a ""triple whammy"" of tax rises, fuel costs and the end of the Universal Credit uplift this winter. Industry group Oil & Gas UK has said wholesale prices for gas had increased by 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August. The increase has been blamed on several factors, including a cold winter which left stocks lower than usual, high demand for liquefied natural gas from Asia, and lower supplies from other countries. Low winds meaning less renewable energy is being generated and outages at some nuclear stations have also contributed. It has left some companies unable to provide their customers with the energy they have paid for. However, if a supplier fails, energy regulator Ofgem will ensure supplies continue for affected households, and they will not lose money owed to them. A new energy supplier would be responsible for taking on any credit balances a customer may have, but consumers may end up on more expensive tariffs when they are switched. Aside from gas prices driving up energy bills, millions of households in England, Wales and Scotland are already facing a 12% rise in their energy bills from October when a higher price cap comes into force. Some of the largest energy companies have argued the current price cap on tariff - supported by both Labour and Conservative politicians - has helped trigger the current crisis. ""You can legislate to protect the consumer - but that can bankrupt the supplier,"" said one senior industry source. However, Mr Kwarteng said the energy price cap was ""not going anywhere"". Ofgem will review the price cap in February. There has been speculation that the energy regulator could lift the cap between now and next year to allow firms to charge customers more to cope with rising wholesale gas prices. Stacey Stothard is waiting to see how much more she will have to pay Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity. She saved Â£300 - or so she thought. Her new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year. ""It is just like watching the meter go up and up,"" she says. ""I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record."" Read more about her story here. Earlier on Tuesday, several smaller energy firms wrote an open letter sent to the prime minister, chancellor, business secretary and Ofgem, which stated they felt there ""voice, as suppliers of all different sizes, has not been heard"". Signed by the likes of Green, AMPower, Neon Reef and Tru Energy, it called for a support package for all suppliers, a review of the price cap and for smaller firms to be included in future discussions on the future of the energy market. It was critical of Ofgem, saying it was ""currently unfit to regulate an industry they have appeared to have a vested interest in or turning a blind eye to the market returning to a selective monopoly and a reduction in competition"". In a joint statement on gas prices, Mr Kwarteng and Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley reiterated that the current crisis was ""not an issue of supply"". The pair said there was a consensus among energy suppliers and consumer groups that the ""top priority"" must be support for customers, ""especially the elderly and vulnerable"". ""In the event an energy supplier fails, we are committed that consumers face the least amount of disruption possible - and there are clear and well-established processes in place to ensuring this is the case,"" they added. As a result of gas prices booming, energy intensive fertiliser producers have shut down, which has created a shortage of the by-product of production, carbon dioxide. Food manufacturers and supermarkets have urged action because carbon dioxide is used to stun animals prior to slaughter and to keep food fresh for storage and transport. Supermarket Iceland's managing director Richard Walker told the BBC the carbon dioxide shortage must be prioritised to limit any potential disruption for supermarket supplies, which are also being affected due to a shortage in HGV drivers in the UK, partly caused by the pandemic and Brexit. Supermarket Ocado said it had ""limited stock"" of some frozen items due to gas shortages, while another supermarket told the BBC the situation was ""escalating quickly"". Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here.

Pimlico Plumbers sold to US firm Neighborly,"Charlie Mullins founded Pimlico Plumbers in 1979 Pimlico Plumbers has been sold to US home services group Neighborly. The deal will see founder Charlie Mullins offload his 90% stake in the group and is expected to be worth between Â£125m and Â£145m,according to the Financial Times.,external The entrepreneur's son, Scott Mullins, will retain a stake of about 10%, and continue his role as chief executive. The London-based firm currently makes nearly $70m (Â£50.7m) in revenue a year, and employs more than 400 workers. Founded in 1979, Pimlico's services include heating, plumbing, bathrooms, drainage and electrics. It completes an average of more than 100,000 service jobs for central London homeowners and businesses each year. From starting the plumbing business with a second-hand van and a box of tools, Mullins said he had received approaches from a number of buyers after hiring advisers from Cavendish Corporate Finance. ""We had various people who wanted to buy the business, and interest from all over the world, including France, America, and somewhere in the Middle East,"" Mullins told the BBC. The businessman often speaks publicly on economic matters and was an opponent of Brexit. Pimlico completes an average of more than 100,000 service jobs for central London homeowners and businesses each year He said the firm had experienced a strong year despite the coronavirus pandemic, with both in and out-of-hours calls increasing, as well as emergency call outs. ""Covid helped to lift the company to another level,"" he said, pointing to an increase to 2,000 to 3,000 jobs a week. ""It now needs to go international."" He added: ""The business will always be something I will cherish. It has been a lifetime of work, and what it has achieved is remarkable. Neighborly will take that to the next level."" Mr Mullins plans to use some of the income from the sale to back other ventures in music promotion and overseas property. Neighborly, founded in 1981, is a home services provider, serving more than 10 million residential and commercial customers. As well as plumbing, it provides pest control, cleaning, and home inspection services. The acquisition allows Neighborly to extend its international reach. Neighborly was bought by KKR from investment firm Harvest Partners just two months ago. Mike Bidwell, president of Neighborly, said: ""We are thrilled to be growing our global footprint with the addition of Pimlico as the next subsidiary brand to join our global family of home service professionals. ""Pimlico's wide array of trade services as well as its exceptional customer care perfectly align with Neighborly's purpose, which is to build an extensive service community known for providing excellent experiences.""

Community in race to buy remotest mainland pubLocals are facing a challenge from potential private buyers to purchase The Old Forge in Knoydart.Highlands & Islands,"Owner Jean-Pierre Robinet said the time was right to move on after 10 years as Britain's remotest mainland publican A community hoping to take over Britain's remotest mainland pub could know this week if it has the finances to make a bid for it. The Old Forge in Inverie is on the Knoydart Peninsula in Lochaber. The only way of reaching the village - and its pub - is by walking 18 miles (29km) or making a seven-mile (11km) sea crossing. Since it went up for sale earlier this year, a community group has been working to raise the funds to buy it. The Old Forge is on sale for offers over Â£425,000. Private buyers are also potentially interested in the property. Community bid for Britain's remotest mainland pub The pub's Belgian owner Jean-Pierre Robinet told locals in January he was selling up after running the business for 10 years. Since January, the small community which has a population of just over 100 people, has held a consultation on a community buyout. Seventy residents took part, with almost all backing the idea. The Old Forge Community Society was set up, and earlier this month it launched a community share offer. The rules mean 75% of the shares must be owned by locals, with a limited number owned by people living outside the area. In just days, the shares offer was climbing towards its target of Â£240,000. This week, the society hopes to learn if its application to the Scottish Land Fund for support has been successful. Local businesswoman Isla Miller has bought a share in the community buyout bid The Scottish government-funded land fund provides grants of up to Â£1m to support community and volunteer group-run projects. In 2019, the Black Bull in Gartmore, near Stirling, was purchased by the community with financial support from the Scottish Land Fund. The Old Forge Community Society has sought an undisclosed sum of money from the land fund to help cover renovation and other costs. Society secretary Stephanie Harris said the community had always known there was a risk of losing out to a private buyer, but added that the determination of the community could not be underestimated. Ms Harris told BBC Scotland: ""I have no doubt we will be able to raise the finance that we need. Time is the problem, and we are going as fast as we can."" Isla Miller, who runs a pottery and a tea room with her sister in Inverie, is among those hoping to buy a share. She said the pub was an important gathering place for the community, and welcomed the society's plan to keep the premises open all year round and not close it temporarily over winter as has happened previously. She said the pub was a community hub, describing how local mothers returning home by ferry to the peninsula from hospital would often stop at The Old Forge with their newborn babies, adding: ""It is where you would meet new additions to Knoydart, and then everyone would head off."" Mr Robinet said he fell in love with Knoydart after visiting 25 years ago, and was later encouraged to buy the pub by his late father. While he said he had not done much to change to the look of The Old Forge, Mr Robinet said he had made food a priority of the business and used locally caught seafood and Scottish beef in its meals. He said he made a commitment to run the premises for 10 years and after that spell ""as Britain's remotest mainland publican"" it was now the right time to move on. Mr Robinet said: ""My father died last year and my mother, who is very brave, is suffering being by herself and having severe illness."" He said it was time for ""a different phase of life"" and to help his sister look after their mother. Mr Robinet said the community bid for The Old Forge was a ""great idea"". The only way of reaching Inverie - and its pub - is by walking 18 miles or making a seven-mile sea crossing Knoydart's coast and mountains have been described as mainland Britain's last wilderness. The easiest route to Inverie is by boat from Mallaig. People who chose to walk from Kinlochhourn and Glenfinnan usually break the trip down to a journey of two to three days and are advised to contact the local ranger service for advice on the routes. In the middle of the 19th Century, the land on Knoydart was cleared of crofters and turned over to sheep and deer. In 1948, a group of crofters known as the Seven Men of Knoydart launched a ""land raid"" in a bid to seize back the land and live independently from the landlord system. They were unsuccessful, as the landowner obtained a court order to remove them. However, more than 20 years ago, the community achieved what the seven had set out to do when the Knoydart Foundation purchased 17,200 acres (6,960 ha) of estate land on the peninsula for Â£750,000.

She said the pub was a community hub, describing how local mothers returning home by ferry to the peninsula from hospital would often stop at The Old Forge with their newborn babies, adding: ""It is where you would meet new additions to Knoydart, and then everyone would head off."" Mr Robinet said he fell in love with Knoydart after visiting 25 years ago, and was later encouraged to buy the pub by his late father. While he said he had not done much to change to the look of The Old Forge, Mr Robinet said he had made food a priority of the business and used locally caught seafood and Scottish beef in its meals. He said he made a commitment to run the premises for 10 years and after that spell ""as Britain's remotest mainland publican"" it was now the right time to move on. Mr Robinet said: ""My father died last year and my mother, who is very brave, is suffering being by herself and having severe illness."" He said it was time for ""a different phase of life"" and to help his sister look after their mother. Mr Robinet said the community bid for The Old Forge was a ""great idea"". The only way of reaching Inverie - and its pub - is by walking 18 miles or making a seven-mile sea crossing Knoydart's coast and mountains have been described as mainland Britain's last wilderness. The easiest route to Inverie is by boat from Mallaig. People who chose to walk from Kinlochhourn and Glenfinnan usually break the trip down to a journey of two to three days and are advised to contact the local ranger service for advice on the routes. In the middle of the 19th Century, the land on Knoydart was cleared of crofters and turned over to sheep and deer. In 1948, a group of crofters known as the Seven Men of Knoydart launched a ""land raid"" in a bid to seize back the land and live independently from the landlord system. They were unsuccessful, as the landowner obtained a court order to remove them. However, more than 20 years ago, the community achieved what the seven had set out to do when the Knoydart Foundation purchased 17,200 acres (6,960 ha) of estate land on the peninsula for Â£750,000.

"LiveLiveTrudeau faces big test as Canadians vote2 minutes ago2 minutes ago First polls close, results expected soonFirst polls close, results expected soon20 minutes ago Ask Canada: Justine tired with Trudeau 'posturing'Ask Canada: Justine tired with Trudeau 'posturing'35 minutes ago What issues matter most to Canadians?What issues matter most to Canadians?Live Trudeau faces big test as Canadians vote  2 minutes ago","Votes are being counted after a snap election called by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Canadian media including CBC and CTV project his Liberal Party will form a minority government A campaign that cost C$610m ended with the status quo reinforced in parliament Conservative Erin O'Toole made clear he wants to stay on as Opposition leader to challenge Trudeau There were long lines in some places where pandemic restrictions meant fewer polling stations More than a million Canadians voted by mail, and those votes won't be counted until Tuesday After a 35-day race, the voters have spoken. And they've decisively chosen to stick to the status quo. After Canada's most expensive federal election in history, the electoral map is largely unchanged. Preliminary results show that the Liberals actually lost three seats in this election, over what they had won in 2019. It comes after then-and-still-Prime Minster Justin Trudeau declared a snap election last month, hoping to firm up his minority government and establish a majority. But despite not winning a majority, he is still the man in charge after winning his third term. Our coverage was brought to you by BBC Canada's Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Robin Levinson-King and Dan Lytwyn. After a long night of counting, Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party is projected to have won Monday's snap general election. The prime minister thanked voters for returning him to power for a third time. Justin Trudeau (C) - with his wife Sophie GrÃ©goire (L) and daughter Ella Grace (R) - waves to supporters as he celebrates his election victory It wasn't such a good night for the country's Conservative party, which came second and conceded defeat late into the night But Conservative leader Erin O'Toole - pictured here with his family watching the results come in - told supporters Canadian voters had also failed to give Trudeau the majority he wanted After weeks of campaigning - and millions of dollars spent - the initial reaction to the Canadian election results following Justin Trudeau's decision to call an early election has been somewhat scathing. ""In the end, this election was ultimately for nothing,"" University of Winnipeg politics professor Felix Mathieu told AFP, pointing to the projected seat count for each party as being similar to the split in the last parliament, with most incumbents re-elected. Pollster Tim Powers predicted a minority win for Trudeau's Liberal party, but asked: ""Is that a win for him?"" After all, he pointed out to news agency AFP, Trudeau had hoped for more than just a plurality of seats. This is also something Conservative leader Erin O'Toole noticed in his concession speech on the night. ""But tonight Canadians did not give Mr Trudeau the majority mandate he wanted,"" he said. Martin Pelletier, of investment firm Trivest Wealth Counsel, describes the election as a ""non-event"". ""The Conservatives and NDP were really focused on trying to
address the escalating cost of living crisis going on in the
country, especially in jurisdictions like Vancouver and Toronto,
whereas Justin Trudeau was heavily focused on climate change
initiatives. I thought that cost of living would resonate more
with voters,"" he told Reuters. ""This is a non-event. We're getting more of the same as what
we had before."" Thirty-six days and C$610m ($476m; Â£348m) later, it looks like Canadians are right back where they started. Justin Trudeau's snap election has delivered the status quo: another Liberal minority government. The situation up north bears some similarities to last week's recall election in California. An estimated C$352m ($276m; Â£201m) was spent while voters determined the fate of Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom. But after months of campaigning, voters in the Golden State also ended up with more of the same: two more years of Newsom. Although Justin Trudeau will stay on as Canada's prime minister, there have been a few upsets tonight. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Montreal, QuÃ©bec Trudeau (right) cast his ballot in Montreal, joined by his family Canadian elections may not get the same global attention as those in the US and Europe - but that doesnât mean that the outcome of todayâs vote wonât have a global impact. Whoever ends up in charge in Ottawa, the national capital and seat of the federal government, will be making decisions on matters like climate and free trade, where the next Canadian government will seek to deepen its economic partnerships. The Conservative leader, Erin OâToole, for example, has said he would push to join the US, UK and Australia in their recently announced security pact.  Heâs also supportive of pursuing the so-called Canzuk trade deal with Australia, New Zealand and the UK. Trudeau and the Liberals have pledged to deepen diplomatic, economic, and defence partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region. The country is also a G7 and G20 member and a partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato), in Norad, a maritime and aerospace advanced warning system with the US, and in the Five Eyes alliance. And Canada is an Arctic nation, sharing interest in the region with countries like Russia, the US, Norway and Sweden even as the north opens up due to a changing climate. How much of an emphasis Canada will place on its Arctic sovereignty and security could depend on who wins today's election. (The Liberal platform makes three mentions of the country's Arctic region, the Conservative platform has 30). Jessica MurphyBBC News, Montreal, QuÃ©bec After a five-week campaign, the parliament that Canadians have elected this time around looks strikingly similar to the one they voted for in 2019. Justin Trudeau has retained power but is still short of a majority. The Conservatives will have won the popular vote but failed to secure enough seats to topple Trudeau's Liberals. While results will continue to trickle in over the coming days as election officials tally the mail-in ballots, in the end little is projected to have changed in the overall seat count for each party beyond a few marginal wins and losses. Still, Trudeau painted this early election call as a victory in his speech to supporters in the early morning hours on Tuesday, telling them that ""what we've seen tonight is millions of Canadians [who] have chosen a progressive plan"". We saw an unusual sight for a Canadian election today: long lines. Some voters reportedly had to wait up to two hours while trying to cast their ballots - primarily due to voting modifications that were a result of the pandemic. But there's good news: Elections Canada has just announced that all Canadians waiting in line have been able to cast their ballots. Bernd DebusmannBBC News, Washington He managed to get another win for the Liberals this time, but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is likely to ""get out of the way"" in several years, according to Canadian author and political theorist David Moscrop. Moscrop told the BBC that the ""traditional trajectory"" would be to stay on for a period of time before allowing a new leader to come in and call an election. ""That would be a year or 18 months. That new leader would have a chance to get their own parliament, whether majority or minority,"" he said. Such an outcome, he added, would be ""fairly consistent with Canadian history"". In Trudeauâs case, Moscrop said that it is ""plausible"" that the Liberals choose Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland as their leader in the near future before heading to another election. ""We've all worked so hard over the last few weeks and the last few years. And we've come so far,"" Trudeau continues as he addresses supporters in Montreal. ""Let us not forget the past and the dark days we have come through together. But let us still look to the future and all that is still to come and all that we have still to build together,"" he says. ""Let us work together. And let us seize the promise of a brand new day."" With that, his speech has ended. Trudeau begins by thanking Canadians for voting ""to send Canada through this pandemic and to the brighter days ahead"". He mentions the issues important to his party's platform - climate action, affordable homes and childcare - and promises to continue to work on them. ""You have given this government and this parliament clear direction,"" he says. Switching between English and French, he addresses the nation from a hotel ballroom in Montreal, Quebec. The room is adorned in red, the colour of the Liberals. Trudeau thanks his political opponents: ""Thank you for being part of this important moment."" ""Political life isn't easy,"" he continues, adding: ""Thank you for your service."" Liberal Party Leader Justin Trudeau is now up on the stage. He is joined by his wife. It is his third time winning a federal election. He will remain Canada's prime minister, but he did not manage to take the majority of seats that he hoped to when he called a snap election last month. Robin Levinson KingBBC News, Toronto, Ontario NDP leader Jagmeet Singh For the first time in a decade, the NDP will have more seats in parliament than they had at the start of the election, picking up an additional three seats for a projected total of 27. The left-leaning party reached an all-time high in 2011, rising to be the official opposition when they won 103 seats in the House of Commons. They failed to keep up that momentum, losing seats in each subsequent election down to a low of 24 in 2019. Leader Jagmeet Singh has made small growth for the party by being a progressive voice in contrast to Trudeau's more centrist Liberals. ""We will never stop fighting for you,"" he said in his speech, promising to campaign for affordability and a tax on the rich. Singh made history by becoming the first non-white leader of a federal party in Canada in 2017. Recently, he picked up the endorsement of a fellow left-of centre politician, US Senator and former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders. Singh vowed to keep fighting New Democratic Party (NDP) Leader Jagmeet Singh takes the stage along with his pregnant wife. The pair are expecting their first child. Singh starts his remarks by congratulating Trudeau, and promising to ""keep fighting to make sure that the super wealthy pay their fair share"". ""We're gonna fight for you. We've seen you. We've heard your stories. We're going to fight for you,"" he says. He vows to address the climate crisis and healthcare. ""That's what the New Democrats are all about."" After he finishes speaking, the couple is joined on stage by dancing supporters and the music is cranked up. Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet is now speaking. ""The result is hard to comment on,"" he says in French, adding that the number of seats held by the party are approximately the same as what they had before this election. ""So what this all means isâ¦ we will have to do more and do better. The people of Quebec expect that we will do this,"" he adds. His party, which only runs candidates in Quebec, holds third place for seats in the House of Commons. He continues that provinces should not be ""held hostage"" to the federal government in Ottawa, and calls for ""more money for the healthcare system"". Holly HonderichBBC News, Oshawa, Ontario Erin O'Toole is getting his biggest applause of the night, promising to build a Conservative tent that includes all Canadians. This was central to O'Toole's election pitch: a more moderate, inclusive conservatism - especially on social issues like LGBT and women's rights. The Conservative party ""must have the courage to change"", he says. While O'Toole acknowledges his defeat, his tone is defiant. At times, the speech sounds more like a campaign launch than a concession. ""Whenever the next election comes, Iâll be ready to lead the Conservative party to victory,"" he says. One thing is clear: O'Toole has no plans to step down after tonight's loss. Holly HonderichBBC News, Oshawa, Ontario The Conservative leader starts his speech with a critique of Liberal leader Justin Trudeau and his snap election. Trudeau was looking for a ""quick power grab"", O'Toole says. ""But Canadians did not give Trudeau the majority mandate he wanted."" O'Toole, who will be Canada's opposition leader once again, is reframing his electoral loss as a win: he and his party denied Trudeau the majority he sought in calling the early election. He says the Conservatives are projected to win the popular vote once again, but concedes there is ""more work for us to do"" to hold government. It's a friendly crowd here at headquarters. O'Toole, 48, was met by a standing ovation as the crowd shouted his name. As he speaks, they're listening intently and cheering at each turn of O'Toole's speech. Erin O'Toole The Conservative leader Erin O'Toole has just taken the stage with his wife and two children. Earlier tonight he won his parliamentary seat, but his party has failed to win enough seats to prevent Trudeau's Liberal Party from staying in power. Moments ago, O'Toole is said to have called Trudeau to concede the race. We've just heard from the Green Party leader, and soon we'll go to the Conservatives. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole will address supporters imminently from his election night headquarters in Oshawa, Ontario. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau is due to speak at 00:30 EST (05:15 GMT) from a hotel in Montreal. Green Party leader Annamie Paul Green Party leader Annamie Paul has spoken to a group of her supporters after coming in fourth place in her own race. ""We're sending two hopefully three greens back to Ottawa,"" she said, saying the  party should celebrate that achievement. Â© 2025 BBC.

Fighting off hunger under the Taliban,"Most Afghans are now trying to feed themselves and their children after the economy collapsed Kabul is a city still waiting for its new life to take shape - a lot depends on the will and whims of its new Taliban masters. But it is hunger that could become the worst of Afghanistan's many crises. For the poor of the city, the majority, scraping together a few hundred Afghanis, a couple of dollars, to stave off starvation is the biggest challenge. Millions live in desperate poverty in a country that has received huge sums in foreign aid. The money left over that might help them, around $9bn in central bank reserves, is frozen by the Americans to keep it away from the Taliban. At dawn, hundreds of construction workers gather in one of Kabul's open-air markets with their tools looking for a day's work. Every day brings labourers looking for work - but there is little to go round Big building projects in the city have stopped. The banks are closed. The foreign money tap has been turned off. What is left amounts to a few drips. A handful of the construction workers get picked up for work. The rest are getting angry. One of the men, Hayat Khan, raged about the fortunes stolen by a corrupt elite in the last 20 years. ""Wealthy people think about themselves, not the poor. I can't even buy bread. Believe me I cannot find a single dollar and the rest of the rich people put the aid dollars from the West in their pockets. ""No-one cares for the poor people. When aid comes from outside, the people in power made sure it went to their relatives, not to the poor."" Hayat Khan says rich people stole aid money the West sent to Afghanistan Mohammed Anwar, lucky enough to have an office job, stopped to listen to my interviews with the building workers, and then chipped in, speaking English, accusing the Americans of theft. ""In the name of Allah, we call on America to give us the money they have taken from the Afghan government. It must be used to rebuild Afghanistan."" At that point a Taliban official, a forceful man with a bushy black beard intervened. He told us to leave the area, saying it was dangerous. I had not detected any sense of threat, but it was not the time and place to argue. He was shadowed by a Taliban bodyguard wearing wraparound sunglasses, in the US military style, and carrying a US-made assault rifle. The movement's fighters are very visible in the centre of the capital of the republic they have renamed as an Islamic emirate. At the airport they are dressed in American uniforms. Across the city they are more likely to wear much more familiar traditional dress like the shalwar kameez and dusty black turbans. All of them carry assault rifles. Taliban guards patrol the streets of Kabul The most common lament I heard in Kabul in the last week was about the price of food and the desperation of parents who are struggling to feed their children. Food prices are rocketing. Millions struggle to feed their families. TheWorld Food Programme (WFP) estimates 93% of Afghans are not getting enough food,externalto eat. Before the Taliban seized control last month the number was 80%. Markets have sprung up across the city, as people who had managed to accumulate a few trappings of prosperity in the old Afghanistan sell their possessions to raise a little cash, mostly for food. I saw carts arriving carrying the contents of peoples' homes, from valuable carpets or TVs to jumbles of crockery and cutlery. One man was selling a rubber plant. Many were selling and few were buying. There isn't the cash. The sprawling second-hand markets are full of despair. Threats to personal freedom, girls' education and the right of women to work have been condemned across the world. But the prospect of going to bed hungry has an urgency all of its own. Countries that want to help Afghans but reject the Taliban and all it stands for face a big dilemma. For people to be able to work to earn money, to live and to eat, the Taliban has to run a viable state in Afghanistan. But many in the US, Britain and the other countries that fought the Taliban would find it hard to stomach anything that looked like a success for their old enemies. The alternative might be worse; the prospect of more misery for the people, more refugees, more malnourished children, the risk that Afghanistan will once again become a failed state and a land of opportunity for jihadist extremists. ANALYSIS:Afghans begin uneasy transition to Taliban rule PROFILES:Who's who in the Taliban leadership INVESTIGATION:Taliban kill civilians in resistance stronghold VOICES:Uncertain times ahead for Afghan women A community high above the city carries the scars of 40 years of war. So do the families who live here. War punctuates all their stories. One of the families has had enough. Their flat was almost empty, the possessions sold at the second-hand markets to raise money for them all to leave for Pakistan. The mother, who I'm not going to name, was the only breadwinner, teaching students electrical engineering. They are all male, so the Taliban stopped her working, and also stopped her youngest daughter's education. She was composed and determined, but her voice thickened with sobs when I asked her how hard it was to leave her home. Going to bed hungry is the new reality in a country that has seen decades of war ""I am so sad. My heart has been burning since the day I made the decision to leave. How could I have done it - but what could I do? ""If we stay, I don't think they will let us work or allow us education. How can I feed my family? I can tolerate going hungry. But I can't watch my kids starve."" Their dreams were always fragile in a state riddled with corruption, which could not survive the departure of its foreign backers. Afghanistan's newest crisis is about fundamentals of life - food, security and hope - and the despair and anger when they have gone. This video can not be played There is anger at the Taliban in Kabul, but others in rural areas welcome the end of a deadly war Afghans begin uneasy transition to Taliban rule Taliban kill civilians in resistance stronghold Who are the Taliban?

Rich nations must increase climate funds - Johnson,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says November's COP26 summit is ""a turning point for the world"" Boris Johnson has renewed his call for richer countries to increase financial support to poorer ones fighting the effects of climate change. Speaking at a UN gathering in New York, the UK PM said he was ""increasingly frustrated"" at support offered to countries hit hard by global warming. He added many richer economies had pledged ""nowhere near enough"". A longstanding promise to give $100bn (Â£73bn) a year to poorer countries has not yet been met. Some 100 world leaders are meeting at the UN General Assembly this week, ahead of a key UN climate conference hosted in Glasgow next month. Mr Johnson said ""history will judge"" countries who ""lacked the courage to step up"" once the Glasgow conference, called COP26, has finished. Climate pledges will be tough to secure, PM warns PM aims to push for more climate action during trip As far back as 2009, the developed world agreed it would provide $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries deal with the effects of climate change. But the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently estimated that by 2019 the figure had reached just over $79bn. Addressing other leaders at the UN climate meeting, Mr Johnson said the gap between what had been promised and what had been delivered ""remains vast"". ""Too many major economies - some represented here today, some absent - are lagging too far behind,"" he added. On his way to New York, Mr Johnson had downplayed the chances of the $100bn target being hit by the Glasgow summit, saying it was ""six out of 10"". However, US President Joe Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, has since raised hopes it could be met, hinting his boss could announce more money during his speech to the UN assembly on Tuesday. Has climate pledge to poor countries been met? What do world leaders need to agree to stop climate change? Mr Kerry told Sky News: ""I think we're going to get it done by COP [26], and the US will do its part."" Asked if Mr Biden will announce more funds this week, he added: ""I'm telling you to stay tuned into the president's speech, and we'll see where we are."" The US presents a huge obstacle to the climate talks. President Biden says he wants to undo the harm caused by President Trump's withdrawal from the international climate agreement. But he's facing a very big bill to help developing nations cope with the effects of global heating, and it's not yet clear he can persuade Congress to stump up the cash. Rich nations have agreed to help poorer countries with a $100bn annual goal as of 2017-18. Recent research from the UK think tank the Overseas Development Institute foundthe US paid only 4% of its ""fair share"",external. It suggested $40bn would be a reasonable US contribution - and the president may pledge additional money at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. If the cash doesn't flow, major developing nations may resist making further emissions cuts themselves. China and India already feel aggrieved that they're being asked to curb emissions at a far earlier stage in their development than western nations. Asked about Mr Kerry's comments on Monday, Mr Johnson said an increased commitment from the United States would make a ""huge difference"". But he cautioned: ""We have been here before, we have all heard lots of pledges, lots of positive noises, let's see where we get to. ""We are not counting our chickens."" The UK, which has so far committed Â£11.6bn in international climate finance over the next five years, is under pressure to burnish its green credentials ahead of the Glasgow conference, beginning in just over a month. The lead author of a UN-commissionedexpert report,externalinto the pledge, Amar Bhattacharya, says among the G7 group of rich countries, the ""three countries that have been the leaders are Germany, Japan and France in that order"". The UK and Canada are slightly behind them - but the United States and, in particular, Italy, are regarded as the main two laggards.

"Increase climate commitments, PM to urge Biden","Boris Johnson is expected to urge US President Joe Biden to increase his country's climate commitments in a meeting at the White House. On Monday, the PM had said he was ""frustrated"" that richer countries were failing to financially support poorer ones fighting climate change. The two men are also likely to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. But the PM played down the chances of progress on a UK-US trade deal, calling US negotiators ""pretty ruthless"". Mr Johnson said he would ""rather get a deal that works for the UK than get a quick deal"", adding that the president had ""a lot of fish to fry"". Has climate pledge to poor countries been met? What do world leaders need to agree to stop climate change? The prime minister has travelled to the US for a meeting of the UN's General Assembly, which is being attended by over 100 world leaders. Addressing a UN climate meeting on Monday, the prime minister said richer economies had done ""nowhere near enough"" to support those nations suffering the impact of global warming. In 2009, developed countries agreed to provide $100bn (Â£73bn) a year to poorer countries to fight climate change. By 2019, the figure had reached just over $79bn that year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The lead author of a UN-commissioned expert report into the pledge, Amar Bhattacharya, says within the G7 [a group of rich countries], Germany, Japan and France have been the leaders in terms of meeting the target. The UK and Canada are slightly behind them while the United States and Italy are further behind. Mr Johnson told UN delegates ""the gulf between what has been promised, what is actually being delivered, and what needs to happenâ¦ remains vast"". The US's climate envoy John Kerry raised hopes that there could be progress towards the target, telling Sky News: ""I think we're going to get it done by COP [the climate conference to be held in Glasgow], and the US will do its part."" Asked if Mr Biden would announce more funds this week, he added: ""I'm telling you to stay tuned into the president's speech, and we'll see where we are."" Mr Johnson said it would ""send a massively powerful signal"" if the US did commit to more funding but insisted ""we are not counting our chickens"". On Monday, the prime minister also met Amazon boss Jeff Bezos. A Downing Street spokesman said they ""discussed the upcoming COP26 Summit and agreed there was an urgent need to mobilise more public and private money to help developing countries protect biodiversity"". The spokesman added that the PM ""raised the issue of taxation, and hoped progress could be in implementing the G7 agreement on tax"". Joe Biden and Boris Johnson met in Cornwall earlier this year The meeting with the president in the Oval Office will be the first time Mr Biden and Mr Johnson have met face-to-face since a G7 summit held in Cornwall earlier this year. The prime minister acknowledged that the US-UK relationship had experience some problems in recent years, referring to ""pebbles in the shoe"". But, he pointed to negotiation successes citing theend of the ban on British beef,andsuspension of US tariffs onScotch whisky. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Johnson described his own relationship with Mr Biden as ""genuinely terrific - we see eye to eye on all sorts of things"" adding that the two men had bonded over trains. ""He's a bit of a train nut,"" he added.

Fighting off hunger under the TalibanFor most Afghans staving off starvation is the biggest challenge since the Taliban returned to power.Asia,"Most Afghans are now trying to feed themselves and their children after the economy collapsed Kabul is a city still waiting for its new life to take shape - a lot depends on the will and whims of its new Taliban masters. But it is hunger that could become the worst of Afghanistan's many crises. For the poor of the city, the majority, scraping together a few hundred Afghanis, a couple of dollars, to stave off starvation is the biggest challenge. Millions live in desperate poverty in a country that has received huge sums in foreign aid. The money left over that might help them, around $9bn in central bank reserves, is frozen by the Americans to keep it away from the Taliban. At dawn, hundreds of construction workers gather in one of Kabul's open-air markets with their tools looking for a day's work. Every day brings labourers looking for work - but there is little to go round Big building projects in the city have stopped. The banks are closed. The foreign money tap has been turned off. What is left amounts to a few drips. A handful of the construction workers get picked up for work. The rest are getting angry. One of the men, Hayat Khan, raged about the fortunes stolen by a corrupt elite in the last 20 years. ""Wealthy people think about themselves, not the poor. I can't even buy bread. Believe me I cannot find a single dollar and the rest of the rich people put the aid dollars from the West in their pockets. ""No-one cares for the poor people. When aid comes from outside, the people in power made sure it went to their relatives, not to the poor."" Hayat Khan says rich people stole aid money the West sent to Afghanistan Mohammed Anwar, lucky enough to have an office job, stopped to listen to my interviews with the building workers, and then chipped in, speaking English, accusing the Americans of theft. ""In the name of Allah, we call on America to give us the money they have taken from the Afghan government. It must be used to rebuild Afghanistan."" At that point a Taliban official, a forceful man with a bushy black beard intervened. He told us to leave the area, saying it was dangerous. I had not detected any sense of threat, but it was not the time and place to argue. He was shadowed by a Taliban bodyguard wearing wraparound sunglasses, in the US military style, and carrying a US-made assault rifle. The movement's fighters are very visible in the centre of the capital of the republic they have renamed as an Islamic emirate. At the airport they are dressed in American uniforms. Across the city they are more likely to wear much more familiar traditional dress like the shalwar kameez and dusty black turbans. All of them carry assault rifles. Taliban guards patrol the streets of Kabul The most common lament I heard in Kabul in the last week was about the price of food and the desperation of parents who are struggling to feed their children. Food prices are rocketing. Millions struggle to feed their families. TheWorld Food Programme (WFP) estimates 93% of Afghans are not getting enough food,externalto eat. Before the Taliban seized control last month the number was 80%. Markets have sprung up across the city, as people who had managed to accumulate a few trappings of prosperity in the old Afghanistan sell their possessions to raise a little cash, mostly for food. I saw carts arriving carrying the contents of peoples' homes, from valuable carpets or TVs to jumbles of crockery and cutlery. One man was selling a rubber plant. Many were selling and few were buying. There isn't the cash. The sprawling second-hand markets are full of despair. Threats to personal freedom, girls' education and the right of women to work have been condemned across the world. But the prospect of going to bed hungry has an urgency all of its own. Countries that want to help Afghans but reject the Taliban and all it stands for face a big dilemma. For people to be able to work to earn money, to live and to eat, the Taliban has to run a viable state in Afghanistan. But many in the US, Britain and the other countries that fought the Taliban would find it hard to stomach anything that looked like a success for their old enemies. The alternative might be worse; the prospect of more misery for the people, more refugees, more malnourished children, the risk that Afghanistan will once again become a failed state and a land of opportunity for jihadist extremists. ANALYSIS:Afghans begin uneasy transition to Taliban rule PROFILES:Who's who in the Taliban leadership INVESTIGATION:Taliban kill civilians in resistance stronghold VOICES:Uncertain times ahead for Afghan women A community high above the city carries the scars of 40 years of war. So do the families who live here. War punctuates all their stories. One of the families has had enough. Their flat was almost empty, the possessions sold at the second-hand markets to raise money for them all to leave for Pakistan. The mother, who I'm not going to name, was the only breadwinner, teaching students electrical engineering. They are all male, so the Taliban stopped her working, and also stopped her youngest daughter's education. She was composed and determined, but her voice thickened with sobs when I asked her how hard it was to leave her home. Going to bed hungry is the new reality in a country that has seen decades of war ""I am so sad. My heart has been burning since the day I made the decision to leave. How could I have done it - but what could I do? ""If we stay, I don't think they will let us work or allow us education. How can I feed my family? I can tolerate going hungry. But I can't watch my kids starve."" Their dreams were always fragile in a state riddled with corruption, which could not survive the departure of its foreign backers. Afghanistan's newest crisis is about fundamentals of life - food, security and hope - and the despair and anger when they have gone.

"Rich nations must increase climate funds - JohnsonThe UK prime minister says he is ""increasingly frustrated"" at support offered to poorer countries.UK Politics","This video can not be played Boris Johnson says November's COP26 summit is ""a turning point for the world"" Boris Johnson has renewed his call for richer countries to increase financial support to poorer ones fighting the effects of climate change. Speaking at a UN gathering in New York, the UK PM said he was ""increasingly frustrated"" at support offered to countries hit hard by global warming. He added many richer economies had pledged ""nowhere near enough"". A longstanding promise to give $100bn (Â£73bn) a year to poorer countries has not yet been met. Some 100 world leaders are meeting at the UN General Assembly this week, ahead of a key UN climate conference hosted in Glasgow next month. Mr Johnson said ""history will judge"" countries who ""lacked the courage to step up"" once the Glasgow conference, called COP26, has finished. Climate pledges will be tough to secure, PM warns PM aims to push for more climate action during trip As far back as 2009, the developed world agreed it would provide $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries deal with the effects of climate change. But the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently estimated that by 2019 the figure had reached just over $79bn. Addressing other leaders at the UN climate meeting, Mr Johnson said the gap between what had been promised and what had been delivered ""remains vast"". ""Too many major economies - some represented here today, some absent - are lagging too far behind,"" he added. On his way to New York, Mr Johnson had downplayed the chances of the $100bn target being hit by the Glasgow summit, saying it was ""six out of 10"". However, US President Joe Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, has since raised hopes it could be met, hinting his boss could announce more money during his speech to the UN assembly on Tuesday. Has climate pledge to poor countries been met? What do world leaders need to agree to stop climate change? Mr Kerry told Sky News: ""I think we're going to get it done by COP [26], and the US will do its part."" Asked if Mr Biden will announce more funds this week, he added: ""I'm telling you to stay tuned into the president's speech, and we'll see where we are."" The US presents a huge obstacle to the climate talks. President Biden says he wants to undo the harm caused by President Trump's withdrawal from the international climate agreement. But he's facing a very big bill to help developing nations cope with the effects of global heating, and it's not yet clear he can persuade Congress to stump up the cash. Rich nations have agreed to help poorer countries with a $100bn annual goal as of 2017-18. Recent research from the UK think tank the Overseas Development Institute foundthe US paid only 4% of its ""fair share"",external. It suggested $40bn would be a reasonable US contribution - and the president may pledge additional money at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. If the cash doesn't flow, major developing nations may resist making further emissions cuts themselves. China and India already feel aggrieved that they're being asked to curb emissions at a far earlier stage in their development than western nations. Asked about Mr Kerry's comments on Monday, Mr Johnson said an increased commitment from the United States would make a ""huge difference"". But he cautioned: ""We have been here before, we have all heard lots of pledges, lots of positive noises, let's see where we get to. ""We are not counting our chickens."" The UK, which has so far committed Â£11.6bn in international climate finance over the next five years, is under pressure to burnish its green credentials ahead of the Glasgow conference, beginning in just over a month. The lead author of a UN-commissionedexpert report,externalinto the pledge, Amar Bhattacharya, says among the G7 group of rich countries, the ""three countries that have been the leaders are Germany, Japan and France in that order"". The UK and Canada are slightly behind them - but the United States and, in particular, Italy, are regarded as the main two laggards.

Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull,"Pig farmers fear they may soon have to start killing their animals because of a carbon dioxide shortage at abattoirs caused by soaring gas prices. CO2 is widely used in the food and drinks industry, including for stunning animals at abattoirs before slaughter. But some CO2 suppliers have halted production due to rising energy costs, creating a huge backlog of pigs that at some point will have to be killed. A food and drink trade body says the UK might need to subsidise CO2 production. Farmer Kate Morgan told the BBC on Monday ""thousands of pigs are backlogged on farms. If we can't kill our pigs in an abattoir, then unfortunately we will be resorting to killing them on farms"". Carbon dioxide used by the meat industry is aby-product of fertiliser production. The gas is also used to keep food fresh as well as in dry ice and fizzy drinks. CF Industries, the US-based business which produces about 60% of the UK's food grade CO2,has suspended production at two UK fertiliser plants. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories. Ms Morgan, who runs a pig farm near Driffield, east Yorkshire,told BBC 5 Live's Wake up to Money programmethe situation for the industry was already ""pretty dire"" because of labour shortages. Now, meat shortages at supermarkets are a real possibility, she said. ""Abattoirs have about a week's supply of gas. It's a chain: We have constantly got pigs coming out of the breeding herd that need to go in homes. Those homes need to be emptied."" Gas firms seek help amid higher energy bill fears Why are gas prices rising and what if my supplier goes bust? How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Her farm sends about 1,500 pigs each week to abattoirs. Killing her own animals is not something she can bear thinking about. ""I can't even begin to think how we would do it. I don't want to put people who work for us in that situation,"" Ms Morgan said. On-farm killing means the meat is not something that would be able to enter the food supply chain. ""It would be wasted,"" she said. It is estimated there are about 100,000 pigs left on farms that would otherwise have been sent for slaughter, with the backlog having started building up weeks ago because of staff shortages. Andrew Saunders, a director at the UK's biggest pig producer, Pilgrims Pride, said there is no alternative to stunning with CO2. ""It is an essential part of the process,"" he told the BBC. Mr Saunders, also chairman of the British Meat Processor Association, said: ""80% of pigs in the UK are slaughtered in about 10 abattoirs, and those abattoirs all use CO2 stunning systems. We already face some challenges regarding keeping those abattoirs operational - some shortage of labour in those plants."" He said pigs can be kept on farms for only ""a very short period of time. They go beyond their target slaughter weight, they're then unsuitable for size of packets we have for our customers"". He added: ""We hope the government can turn around to intervene to get these CO2 plants up and running again. The particular plants in question supply about 60% of all UK needs and something's required here to get this going pretty quickly."" It is not just the pig industry facing problems, however. On Monday, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) warned the whole sector faces disruption. In a letter to Environment Secretary George Eustice, the FDF's chief executive, Ian Wright, said: ""Important parts of the food and drink supply chain - already under significant pressure from the impacts of labour shortages, particularly HGV drivers - are now seriously compromised by disruptions in the supply of CO2. ""Across industry, there is a united view that the situation is worsening with little prospect of additional CO2 supply unless the UK government intervenes."" If ministers are considering financial help to support the energy sector, Mr Wright said then ""any subsidies made available must also be considered for the manufacturers of fertiliser to ensure there is no further deterioration across the UK food and drink supply, and production can be restored"". There are worries that food and drink shortages are starting to appear on supermarket shelves, with the problem expected to worsen in the run-up to Christmas without action. Richard Walker, managing director of Iceland, said his supermarket is building up stocks and while there is no immediate shortage problem, he told the BBC the CO2 situation needed to be sorted quickly. ""The thing that has shocked me is that 60% of [CO2] production is concentrated in two factories which are both owned by a foreign business. ""This is something that's clearly critical to national security - not just food but also healthcare as well. So it seems quite perplexing that it's at the whim of a private enterprise in terms of whether it's profitable or not and therefore whether they produce the stuff or not."" The British Soft Drinks Association said if manufacturers could not get hold of CO2 supplies, ""after their reserves have run out, production of certain products will have to cease"". Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, has held talks with the government over production at its two fertiliser plants, but the outcome is not clear. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted that he had met Mr Will and ""discussed the pressures the business is facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies, including to our food and energy industries"". Wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in New York for a UN General Assembly meeting, said the problem with wholesale prices was ""temporary"". He added that he was ""very confident"" in the UK's supply chains and that market forces should be ""very, very swift"" in fixing the issues but that government would help where it could. A statement from the government said: ""We continue to monitor supplies across critical sectors and are in regular contact with industry on their CO2 supplies. ""The UK benefits from having a diverse range of gas supply sources and we have sufficient capacity to more than meet demand. We do not expect gas supply emergencies this winter."" No chance lights will go out, says government How much are energy bills going up?

Why is Biden still banning Britons from US?,"As I am writing this, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in the air on his way to the US. A couple of dozen journalists will be on the plane with him. An advance party is already in Washington DC. Every one of those will be allowed in because the American authorities have granted them a National Interest Exemption. Without it, you cannot enter the US from the UK or the European Union. Period. But why? Or to put it simply, what possible justification is there for President Joe Biden to keep this travel ban in place? It's a blunt instrument that prevents family members from visiting sick relatives, grandparents meeting grandchildren, business-people (unless they have got bloody good connections) from coming into the country to invest. And on and on it goes. There are any number of big-ticket items for the two leaders to discuss when they get together on Tuesday at the White House - French anger over the submarine deal, the upcoming climate change conference in Glasgow, Afghanistan - and on and on. But there is also this one item that should be relatively easy to sort out, which I suspect is of more immediate concern to tens of thousands of Brits and millions of Europeans. How Europe's relationship with Joe Biden turned sour Afghanistan lays bare a not so special relationship The ban - understandably - was introduced by Donald Trump last March via a Presidential Proclamation, as the pandemic was starting to spread. There was much speculation that when President Biden visited Cornwall in June for the G7 international summit he would lift the ban. Certainly, the US tourism industry was hoping so. And I get more unsolicited emails on this subject than any other from British people frustrated beyond belief that they can't get to see elderly family members who are too sick to travel from the US. One man who got in touch bemoaned the fact that he couldn't get to see a relative dying of cancer, but he had seen on the Daily Mail website a picture of a Chelsea footballer during the summer frolicking on the beach in Florida. Elite sports teams seem to get waivers very easily. Normal mortals, not so much. Even British tennis player Emma Raducanu's parents couldn't come and watch their daughter play in the final of one of the highest-profile sporting events in the US. In 2019, the US was fourth most visited country by UK residents, according to Statista Four of top 10 holiday destinations booked for 2022 by Brits are in US, according to Skyscanner Drop in international visitor numbers in 2020 cost US economy 5.5m jobs and $139bn, according to World Trade and Travel Council I did an interview with President Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, before the gathering in Carbis Bay and he had two buckets of ice cold water to pour over the idea that there was to be an imminent lifting of the ban. He did his best to sound sympathetic - and said (entirely reasonably) that the US would be guided by the science, and working parties would be established to examine the issue. OK, I hear you say - that seems reasonable. But if entry into the US is being governed by epidemiological concerns about the risk from Covid, why are there no restrictions for people coming from countries which have a much higher incidence of the disease, like some nations in the Caribbean, or from those countries which have a far lower percentage of the population vaccinated, like Argentina? And if it is about concern over the spread of the Delta variant can someone explain to me the science that allows American citizens to freely come and go to the UK and Europe without any quarantine requirements when they return? A triumph savoured by Raducanu - but not witnessed by her parents Also the Delta variant is rampant throughout the US, made worse by certain sections of the population refusing to get vaccinated. Here's the political problem, and I think it is twofold. The first is this: Biden's approval ratings have been slipping over the summer. Yes, in Europe, the focus has been on the woeful misjudgements by the president over the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. But here, much more focus is on the latest coronavirus wave, which this administration had promised it would deal with so much more effectively than his predecessor. But instead, new cases, deaths and hospitalisations have been rising steeply. So, in that context, what is the political impetus for Joe Biden to lift the travel ban if it brings charges from your opponents that you've gone soft on tackling the disease? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Getting Covid in a land where no cases officially exist But I am not sure that really gets to the nub of it. It is more likely bureaucratic stasis. Politicians down the ages are the reverse of golfers - they have always preferred the long grass than closely trimmed fairways. Put the Covid ball into the deep stuff and let it stay there. The moment you hear working parties, inter-departmental cooperation you should feel anxious. On the US side, this travel ban is now a matter for the State Department, Health, Homeland Security, the Transportation Department, the Centers for Disease Control and National Security Council. I have probably left some bodies out of that. In other words no one person or department owns the decision; no one owns the policy. It is going to take someone to bang heads together and deal with this. And exasperated British officials that I have spoken to say they see no sign of that happening. I am told Johnson is intending to raise this with Biden at their meeting on Tuesday. Maybe his persuasive powers will lead to the US president rescinding the proclamation. But more likely, I'm hearing, is - at best - a slight tinkering with the terms of the agreement. Remember there is a far higher percentage of Britons double-vaccinated than Americans. Could that be made a criterion of entry? And if not now then when? Is the administration really saying that it won't lift the ban until Covid is eliminated from the planet - although if you route yourself through Buenos Aires or Barbados for a couple of weeks you can enter the US? Isn't that just nuts? By all means be driven by the science, but the science can't be applied to Britain and Europe alone.

Food and drink warning over CO2 gas shortages,"There could be an ""availability issue"" if production is cut, says one food processor One of Britain's largest chicken processors says it will have to cut production unless two UK carbon dioxide plants restart. Last week, CF Industries, the UK's biggest CO2 producer,stopped production in Teesside and Cheshiredue to ""high natural gas prices"". Food giant 2 Sisters processes about a million chickens each week at its plant in Flintshire in north Wales. It warned production across its nine UK sites could fall by 10% within days. ""You'd see an availability issue within a week,"" said 2 Sisters Food Group founder and president Ranjit Singh Boparan. ""We've got four to five days left, then we'll have to reduce our production by 10% - over half a million chickens a week. ""The knock on effect for farmers is horrific - some farmers won't survive."" The CO2 gas is used to stun chickens prior to slaughtering, and also in the packaging process. 2 Sisters' Anglesey plant is the only one in the UK to process whole large chickens In addition to its largest poultry processing plant at Sandycroft on Deeside, 2 Sisters also operates the only UK factory to handle large whole chickens at its site at Llangefni on Anglesey. The food company has seven more poultry-processing plants dotted around the UK, and its president also took over the Bernard Matthews turkey business in 2016. Mr Boparan told the BBC the food production sector was already facing challenges with workforces and labour supply. ""This is another issue that could have been avoided,"" said. ""We have to get these two plants up and running, save Christmas and save the food supply chain."" What can I do about energy bills? Is it cruel to stun animals with CO2? Carbon dioxide used to lure mosquitoes Fears for beers: No CO2 poses a challenge for brewers such as Wrexham Lager's Martyn Jones It is not just poultry production where there are concerns. Carbon dioxide gas is used in carbonated drinks and beers. Martyn Jones, president of Wrexham Lager Brewing Company, said they will be struggling if the CO2 situation continues. The brewer said a delivery due on Monday was already two weeks late from their supplier. ""Now they're promising a delivery today, but we know it's not going to be as much as we need, because they're trying to supply everyone,"" said Mr Jones. Mr Jones, the former Labour MP for Clwyd South, said they had enough gas to last a week, and then they will have to stop filling beer kegs. ""If we don't have it, we're going to be in real trouble,"" he said. Kathryn Jones from Castell Howell food wholesaler said they were waiting to hear about CO2 supplies In Carmarthenshire, food service wholesaler Castell Howell said it has been guaranteed a three-week supply of CO2 gas - but is waiting to hear what will happen afterwards. ""In our processing plant we do use CO2 for packing cooked hams on a daily basis, that go out to wholesale and retail markets,"" said director Kathryn Jones. She said they expected to learn on Thursday how much more gas they can expect. ""The government has had a lot of time to deal with this. This issue has built up in the background."" Supermarket chain Iceland said it was bolstering stocks - but was not overly concerned Richard Walker, the managing director of Welsh-based supermarket chain Iceland Foods, said his company was already building up food stocks for its stores. ""We're in hourly and daily contact with some of our biggest suppliers, and none of them have any issues at the moment, but some of them are very concerned,"" he said. But he stressed: ""Our supply lines are very robust, and actually, we are building up extra stock in anticipation of this potentially becoming an issue. ""So, it doesn't affect us perhaps as much as it does other competitors."" But Mr Walker said, taken together with ongoing problems with a shortage of HGV drivers across the industry, action was needed. ""I think the government absolutely needs to prioritise CO2 supplies and financing for food production to limit the disruption to supermarket supplies,"" he said. ""It's absolutely essential that this gets sorted as quickly as possible."" From fizzy drinks to packaging processes - CO2 plays a major role in the food industry CF Industries provides 60% of the UK's carbon dioxide, which is a by-product of the fertiliser industry. Its chief executive has held crisis talks with UK ministers, but said it did not ""have an estimate for when production will resume"". The BBC has also been told that officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy have been ""working with"" the company in recent days. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwartengtweeted,externalthat he had met Tony Will, the chief executive of CF Industries, and ""discussed the pressures the business is facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies, including to our food and energy industries"". The shortage of CO2 could have "" deep and wide ranging impacts on food and drink businesses in Wales"", said the Welsh Food and Drink Industry Board. Its chairman Andy Richardson added: ""It's far deeper than just asking if turkeys or beer will be available this Christmas. All food and drink manufacturers could be affected significantly.""

US lifts Covid travel ban on UK and EU citizens,"The White House says the ban on UK and EU travellers coming to the US will be lifted in November The ban has been in force since March 2020 when the pandemic began gathering pace The move has been welcomed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, along with UK airlines and airports On Monday the UK recorded 36,100 new Covid cases and 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test A booster shot is being offered to all adults over 50 across the UK from today Children aged 12 to 15 in England and Scotland are also now able to get a Covid vaccine The roll-out is also beginning in Wales this week, while in Northern Ireland it is likely to be offered from October Edited by Rob Corp Thanks for joining us - we'll be back first thing tomorrow morning. Your live page writers today were Doug Faulkner, Victoria Lindrea and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Rob Corp. Our main story on the ending of the US travel ban for many overseas passengers will continue to be updatedhere. That's pretty much it from us for today, but before we close the live page, here is a quick look at today's main headlines: Case numbers and hospital admissions have continued to fall in the UK, albeit slowly - despite most school pupils in England returning two weeks ago. However deaths are increasing, from a low point over the summer. The seven-day average is 142 deaths. Both first and second vaccinations are very low.  First vaccinations on Sunday were the lowest on record:14,586 - although typically weekend figures are low. Sunday's figure for second doses - 35,131 - was also  the lowest since 14 March.  We have some reaction from the airline industry on the other side of the Atlantic. Trade organisation Airlines for America says it applauds the decision to begin reopening international travel. Its president Nicholas E Calio says: ""US airlines have been strong advocates for a stringent, consistent policy and are eager to safely reunite the countless families, friends and colleagues who have not seen each other in nearly two years, if not longer. ""Todayâs announcement marks a positive step in our nationâs recovery, and we look forward to working with the administration over the coming weeks to implement this new global system."" Meanwhile Doug Parker. chairman of American Airlines, says: ""We welcome the Biden administrationâs science-based approach to begin lifting the restrictions on travel to the US that were put into place at the start of the pandemic. ""With the shared goals of health and safety always at the forefront, weâre looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends."" Independent air transport consultant John Strickland says the lifting of the travel ban in the US is of ""massive importance to two UK airlines who heavily rely on the US-UK route"". He says: ""For Virgin Atlantic its more than 80% of its business, for British Airways itâs over 30%. They are long haul airlines by nature and this is the largest and most revenue critical market for each of them. ""There have been two lost summers already and this will save the tail end of the second and help them provide capacity for important, albeit reduced business traffic."" Until recently there has been a skeleton cargo operation with nominal passenger numbers, before the UK opened up to vaccinated US passengers, he says, adding: ""But this will restore a higher volume of traffic with access to UK/European travellers."" Back to the House of Commons and Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon is responding to Grant Shapps - who earlier confirmed that UK citizens who are fully vaccinated will be allowed into the US from November. He says that despite the changes to the UK's international travel system, announced last week, ""no-one should believe that the travel industry is back to normal nor that our borders are any safer from new variants coming in to the country"". He says while Labour supports scrapping the ""confused"" traffic light system it still has not been shown the evidence that decisions on travel are ""based on sound science and not politics"". McMahon says his party has a serious concern that of the more than 11,000 positive tests from travellers arriving during the summer only around 3,000 were sent for genomic sequencing ""leaving us open to new variants"". We told you earlier about the impact on British airline and aviation shares following the announcement that UK and EU citizens will once again be able to travel to the US from November. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the
FTSE-100, closing 10% higher, while EasyJet was up 4%, and jet engineer Rolls-Royce advanced 4.2%. On the European exchanges, Air France shares surged 5.6% and Lufthansa
gained more than 6% on the back of the announcement. The upward trend builds on strong gains for travel stocks at
the end of last week after UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed a
shake-up of travel rules in England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is giving a statement in the House of Commons. He confirms today's announcement from the White House that from early November fully vaccinated UK travellers will be able to go to the US. He goes on to say the UK will extend its policy of ending quarantine for fully vaccinated passengers to arrivals from more countries, including Canada and Japan, from 4 October. Shapps says that as one of the world's most vaccinated countries the UK must use that to its advantage to restore freedoms lost over the past 18 months. ""Recovery is the best way to support the aviation sector,"" he says British Airways boss Sean Doyle says news of the end of the US travel ban after 18 months marks ""an historic moment"" which will provide a ""huge boost for global Britain as it emerges from this pandemic"". ""We are immensely grateful to the prime minister and his government for all the hard work that's gone into securing this deal with the US, and which builds upon last Friday's announcement on the lifting of many travel restrictions,"" he says. ""Our customers should now feel that the world is re-opening to them and they can book their trips with confidence."" More reaction now from the UK aviation industry following that US announcement that it will end its ban on travellers from Britain and EU countries in November. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, says the move represents a ""major breakthrough"" for UK aviation. ""The US is one of our most important markets and the air corridor is worth billions of pounds a year in trade and tourism - safeguarding thousands of jobs,"" he says. ""Things are moving in the right direction and ministers deserve credit for getting us to this point."" He says the industry is looking forward to seeing the full details and says there is still more to be done - such as relaxation of restrictions on unvaccinated passengers - but says ""there is light at the end of the tunnel following 18 months of unprecedented uncertainty"". Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye says connectivity between the US and UK is ""part of the bedrock of the global economy"". ""The prime minister has secured a massive win for global Britain in getting these links restarted,"" he says.  The US has said it will start letting fully vaccinated travellers from the UK enter the country from November. They will, however, need to take part in testing and contact tracing. A ban forbidding UK travellers from entering the US, except under exceptional circumstances, or where residency or dual citizenship was held, has been in force since March 2020 when the pandemic began. The news comes days after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the travel rules were changing for people in England - removing the 'fit-to-fly' test and replacing the post-arrival PCR test with a cheaper lateral flow test from October. So who is allowed to travel and where - and what are the latest quarintine requirements?We have everything you need to know.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is delighted by the US decision to lift a travel ban on arrivals from the UK. Johnson, who was born in the US, describes the move as ""a fantastic boost for business and trade"" and  says it is ""great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again"".

The UK's ambassador to the United States, Dame Karen Pierce, says the travel announcement is great news for families and firms on both sides of the Atlantic. ""We are grateful the US has recognised the progress the UK has made against Covid-19, including high vaccination rates and declining cases,"" she says. ""This decision means that more Brits can reunite with loved ones in the United States, more British holidaymakers can spend their hard-earned pounds in the American tourism sector, and more business activity can boost both of our economies."" There
have been a further 36,100 cases of coronavirus
reported in the UK today,according to the latest government figures.,external There have been a further 49 deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days. It takes the total UK Covid death toll to 135,252.  Reaction is already coming in to that announcement on overseas travel from the US. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss says it is ""a major milestone"" in the reopening of travel at scale. ""As the UK forges its recovery from the pandemic, the reopening of the transatlantic corridor and the lifting of Presidential Order 212F acknowledges the great progress both nations have made in rolling out successful vaccine programmes,"" he says. Weiss adds that the UK will be able to strengthen ties with its most important economic partner ""boosting trade and tourism as well as reuniting friends, families and business colleagues"". Jon SopelBBC North America Editor For months a joint working party has been looking at ways to relax the travel ban. The work, Iâm told, has been detailed and assiduous. But last Friday in Washington next to no-one (not even in the Biden administration) was expecting todayâs announcement. So whatâs changed? The Biden administration is aware of the growing disquiet among European allies about a range of issues â Afghanistan notably, but in recent days French fury over the Aukus submarine deal. And remember France is Americaâs oldest ally. This week Joe Biden will be meeting not only Boris Johnson, but a whole pile of EU leaders during the UN General Assembly in New York. And all had it on their dance cards to raise the travel ban. According to one diplomatic source, the US over the weekend just weighed the countervailing forces: annoy some Americans with a policy that could be characterised as being weak on Covid; or continue to alienate your European allies who are growing increasingly irritable. With the data no longer supporting the ban, this weekend came a decision. Out of the blue in one way, but quite logical in another. The White House says it will lift most restrictions which bar foreign nationals who have been in the UK, and other countries including China and Brazil, from travelling to the US. But foreigners flying to the US will face a requirement to be fully vaccinated from early November. The White House also says US citizens who are not vaccinated will face stricter Covid testing requirements. Airline shares have flown higher after reports that the US
government is set to relax travel requirements for UK and EU citizens. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the FTSE-100, up
as much as 10% on the day, while EasyJet climbed 2.6% higher, and jet engineer
Rolls-Royce advanced 4.6%. Fully-vaccinated passengers look set to be able to travel to the US
from November. An announcement from the Biden administration is expected as
soon as Monday afternoon. The move will mark the end of an 18-month travel ban which has been in force since
17 March 2020. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent Delta Airlines jets at New York's JFK airport This is really early days, we are still waiting to have that official announcement from the US government but my understanding from speaking to industry sources is that some of these airlines are now being briefed a change will happen. Of course this is a much-awaited change for the industry - they have been desperate to get the US-UK lines connected again. If you happen to be from the the US coming into the UK you have been able to come in if you have been double jabbed in the US since August - and not have to quarantine - so that has opened up for people travelling in one direction. But at the moment you can't travel from the UK to the US unless you have a green card or you have a special stipulation or a US passport as well. That has really limited things for businesses which rely on being able to go back and forth between the US and UK, but of course crucially for families who have been disconnected during this time and haven't been able to visit. A lot of these long-haul airlines really rely on UK-US routes and that has been closed pretty much since the beginning of the pandemic so that is a long time without that source of income. Jon SopelBBC North America Editor The travel ban for
people living in the UK and EU, that was introduced last March by Donald Trump,
is finally going to be relaxed. An announcement is expected later today from
the US administration. It looks as though those who can demonstrate they have
been double-vaccinated will, from November, be allowed to enter the US. One
British official told me the decision had come completely out of the blue. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been planning to raise it tomorrow in his meeting at the
White House with the president, but with little hope of making progress. Though details have not been given, it is thought that the relaxation of the
rules will come in time for people to travel over Thanksgiving. This has been
something that had been demanded by the travel industry â but more importantly
for the thousands of families whoâve been unable to see loved ones for 18
months as a result of the restrictions introduced at the height of the
pandemic. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
US opens up to fully vaccinated travellers,"The new air travel rules will come into effect in November The US is easing its coronavirus travel restrictions, reopening to passengers from the UK, EU and other nations. From November, foreign travellers will be allowed to fly into the US if they are fully vaccinated, and undergo testing and contact tracing. The US has had tough restrictions on travel in place since early last year. The move answers a major demand from European allies, and means that families and friends separated by the restrictions can be reunited. ""It's a happy day - Big Apple, here I come!"" French entrepreneur Stephane Le Breton told the Associated Press news agency, as he looked forward to a trip to New York City that had been put on hold because of the restrictions. White House Covid-19 co-ordinator Jeff Zients announced the new rules on Monday, saying: ""This is based on individuals rather than a country-based approach, so it's a stronger system."" ""Most importantly, foreign nationals flying to the US will be required to be fully vaccinated,"" he said. US restrictions were initially imposed on travellers from China in early 2020, and then extended to other countries. The current rules bar entry to most non-US citizens who have been in the UK and a number of other European countries, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil within the last 14 days. Under the new rules, foreign travellers will need to demonstrate proof of vaccination before flying, obtain a negative Covid-19 test result within three days of travelling, and provide their contact information. They will not be required to quarantine. Officials said there would be some exceptions to the new policy, including for children who are not eligible to be vaccinated. It was not immediately clear if the new rules applied only to US-approved vaccines, with Mr Zients saying this would be determined by the US Centers for Disease Control. A White House source told the BBC that the question of whether people who have had the AstraZeneca vaccine or 12- to 18-year-olds who have only had one jab would be allowed in under the new rules was a level of ""granular detail"" that was still being worked out, though this would affect millions. Americans who are not fully vaccinated will still be able to enter, but they will need to be tested before their return to the US, and after they arrive home. Mr Zients said the policy would come into effect in early November, but did not give an exact date. The new rules do not apply to land borders, meaning that restrictions continue to apply to cross-border travel with Canada and Mexico. IN CHARTS:Where are Covid cases the highest?

""It's a fantastic boost for business and trade, and great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Phil White, a British entrepreneur who lives in the US, said the decision would allow him to see his 23-year-old daughter who lives in London for the first time since the pandemic started. ""We haven't been able to see our daughter over this time. And that has been very, very, very difficult for us,"" he told AFP news agency. He said he immediately booked a flight for her daughter after the news about the change was confirmed.  ""[A]s a family we're going to be together for Thanksgiving, which is amazing,"" he added.

France pulls out of UK defence talks amid row,"This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China France's defence minister has cancelled talks with her UK counterpart as the row continues over a new security deal between Britain, the US and Australia. Paris is angry after Australia signed the Aukus pact to build nuclear-powered submarines, pulling out of a major contract with France in the process. UK PM Boris Johnson said France had nothing to worry about from the deal. But Florence Parly's meeting with UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace in London this week has been called off. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Wallace said there had been ""absolutely no intent.... to slight, upset or drive a wedge between us and France"". ""Britain and France on many issues are joined at the hip,"" he added. Lord Ricketts, a former British ambassador to France who was due to co-chair the two days of talks, confirmed the meeting between Mr Wallace and Ms Parly had been ""postponed to a later date"". Earlier, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told BBC Breakfast that ""all bilateral relationships go through periods of tension"", but added: ""I have absolutely no doubt that ultimately our relationship with France will endure."" He said the pact with Australia and the US was intended to ""strengthen and deepen"" the relationship with two long-standing defence partners and to support high-tech manufacturing and technology companies across the UK. The Aukus agreement brokered last week, widely seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea, ended a deal worth $37bn (Â£27bn) signed by Australia in 2016 for France to build 12 conventional submarines. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has described it as a ""stab in the back"" that constitutes ""unacceptable behaviour between allies and partners"". And in a rare step among allies, French President Emmanuel Macron ordered the recall of the French ambassadors to Washington and Canberra. Submarine deal delivers France some hard truths Aukus pact could signal power shift in Asia-Pacific The European Union has said it was ""analysing"" the impact of the Aukus agreement on its trade negotiations with Australia, which are due to resume in October. BBC Brussels correspondent Jessica Parker said it appeared the EU had hardened up its position over the weekend, as the extent of France's anger became clear. She said the European Commission wouldn't elaborate on what ""analysing"" the impact of Aukus could actually mean for the trade talks with Australia - but the language might lead to speculation that negotiations could even be suspended. Speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York, where he is taking part in the UN General Assembly, Mr Johnson said the UK and France had a ""very important and indestructible relationship"". ""Of course we'll be talking to all our friends about how to make the Aukus pact work so that it's not exclusionary, it's not divisive - and it really doesn't have to be that way,"" he told reporters. ""This is just a way of the UK, the US and Australia sharing certain technologies because that is the sensible thing to do in the world in which we find ourselves. ""But that does not in any way mean that we wish to be adversarial to anybody else, or exclusive, or crowding anybody else out."" Mr Johnson is being joined on the trip with new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who launched her own defence of the agreement in anarticle for the Sunday Telegraph,external. Ms Truss said the deal showed the UK's readiness to be ""hard-headed"" in defending its interests and had the potential to create hundreds of new skilled jobs. Liz Truss became foreign secretary in this week's reshuffle Meanwhile,Australia has defended scrapping its dealwith France in favour of the Aukus pact. Prime Minister Scott Morrison rejected accusations that Australia had lied, saying France should have been aware it was prepared to break the deal. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Morrison said: ""Ultimately, this was a decision about whether the submarines that were being built, at great cost to the Australian taxpayer, were going to be able to do a job that we needed it to do when they went into service and our strategic judgement based on the best possible of intelligence and defence advice was that it would not."" The agreement means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. The pact will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies. But it has been criticised by China, which has accused the three powers of having a ""Cold War mentality"". And on Monday, North Korea, which has its own closely-watched nuclear weapon and missile programmes, warned it could spark a ""nuclear arms race"". ""These are extremely undesirable and dangerous acts which will upset the strategic balance in the Asia-Pacific region,"" state media KCNA quoted a foreign ministry official as saying.

Gas firms seek help amid higher energy bill fears,"This video can not be played Kwasi Kwarteng: Talk of the lights going out is âalarmist, unhelpful and completely misguided"" There is ""no question of the lights going out"" this winter as a result of huge rises in gas prices, the business secretary has said. Kwasi Kwarteng said he does ""not expect supply emergencies"" and described warnings about shortages as ""alarmist"". His statement comes as smaller energy providers battle to stay afloat due to gas price hikes making price promises to customers undeliverable. High demand for gas and reduced supply are behind a surge in wholesale prices. Customers are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which is the maximum price they can be charged on a standard tariff. However, the cap means energy firms are unable to pass on higher wholesale costs to their customers, which is forcing some - mostly smaller companies - to go out of business. So far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. On Sunday, the UK's sixth largest energy company,Bulb, announced it is seeking a bailout. The government has said it is considering offering emergency state-backed loans to surviving energy companies to encourage them to take on customers from bust firms. Mr Kwarteng said the government would ""not be bailing out failed companies"" and said the sector had seen a ""regular entry and exit"" over the past five to 10 years. ""The current global situation may see more suppliers than usual exiting the market but this is not something that should be any cause for alarm or panic,"" he said. ""The taxpayer should not be expected to prop up companies which have poor business models and are not resilient to fluctuations in price."" Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up' How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? 'UK not seeing risks to supplies right now' Are energy bills going up and what can I do? The business secretary said the government wanted to protect customers from ""price spikes"" and that the energy industry should not  return to the ""cosy oligopoly"" of years past where a few large suppliers ""dictated to customers conditions and pricing"". At the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK, but industry sources have said there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year. Mr Kwarteng added the UK benefited from having a ""diverse range of gas supply sources"" and had ""more than sufficient capacity, to meet demand"". Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned that UK families were going to be hit by a ""triple whammy"" of tax rises, fuel costs and the end of the Universal Credit uplift this winter. Industry group Oil & Gas UK has said wholesale prices for gas had increased by 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August. The increase has been blamed on several factors, including a cold winter which left stocks lower than usual, high demand for liquefied natural gas from Asia, and lower supplies from other countries. Low winds meaning less renewable energy is being generated and outages at some nuclear stations have also contributed. It has left some companies unable to provide their customers with the energy they have paid for. However, if a supplier fails, energy regulator Ofgem will ensure supplies continue for affected households, and they will not lose money owed to them. A new energy supplier would be responsible for taking on any credit balances a customer may have, but consumers may end up on more expensive tariffs when they are switched. Aside from gas prices driving up energy bills, millions of households in England, Wales and Scotland are already facing a 12% rise in their energy bills from October when a higher price cap comes into force. Some of the largest energy companies have argued the current price cap on tariff - supported by both Labour and Conservative politicians - has helped trigger the current crisis. ""You can legislate to protect the consumer - but that can bankrupt the supplier,"" said one senior industry source. However, Mr Kwarteng said the energy price cap was ""not going anywhere"". Ofgem will review the price cap in February. There has been speculation that the energy regulator could lift the cap between now and next year to allow firms to charge customers more to cope with rising wholesale gas prices. Stacey Stothard is waiting to see how much more she will have to pay Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity. She saved Â£300 - or so she thought. Her new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year. ""It is just like watching the meter go up and up,"" she says. ""I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record."" Read more about her story here. Earlier on Tuesday, several smaller energy firms wrote an open letter sent to the prime minister, chancellor, business secretary and Ofgem, which stated they felt there ""voice, as suppliers of all different sizes, has not been heard"". Signed by the likes of Green, AMPower, Neon Reef and Tru Energy, it called for a support package for all suppliers, a review of the price cap and for smaller firms to be included in future discussions on the future of the energy market. It was critical of Ofgem, saying it was ""currently unfit to regulate an industry they have appeared to have a vested interest in or turning a blind eye to the market returning to a selective monopoly and a reduction in competition"". In a joint statement on gas prices, Mr Kwarteng and Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley reiterated that the current crisis was ""not an issue of supply"". The pair said there was a consensus among energy suppliers and consumer groups that the ""top priority"" must be support for customers, ""especially the elderly and vulnerable"". ""In the event an energy supplier fails, we are committed that consumers face the least amount of disruption possible - and there are clear and well-established processes in place to ensuring this is the case,"" they added. As a result of gas prices booming, energy intensive fertiliser producers have shut down, which has created a shortage of the by-product of production, carbon dioxide. Food manufacturers and supermarkets have urged action because carbon dioxide is used to stun animals prior to slaughter and to keep food fresh for storage and transport. Supermarket Iceland's managing director Richard Walker told the BBC the carbon dioxide shortage must be prioritised to limit any potential disruption for supermarket supplies, which are also being affected due to a shortage in HGV drivers in the UK, partly caused by the pandemic and Brexit. Supermarket Ocado said it had ""limited stock"" of some frozen items due to gas shortages, while another supermarket told the BBC the situation was ""escalating quickly"". Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here.

Demolition to start on Wales' most polluted street,"Twenty-three houses on Hafodyrynys Road are due to be demolished Work to demolish an entire block of houses on Wales' most polluted street will begin on Monday. A demolition firm will start preparing the site, near Crumlin, before the homes are pulled down in mid-October. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels on Hafodyrynys Road have been the highest in the UK outside central London. Caerphilly County Borough Council was due to begin demolition work in May but said ithad to be postponeddue to the impact of the Covid pandemic. Preparation work by Wales and West Utilities to remove gas supplies to the 23 homes due for demolition began last week and is expected to last another week, leading to a lane closure and temporary traffic lights. Life on Wales' most polluted road 'Demolish homes now' says resident This video can not be played ""It's just upsetting to see people in, what I still call my house, people going in there, without permission..."" Hafodyrynys Road was named the UK's most polluted street outside of central London in 2016 due to recorded nitrogen dioxide levels. Pollution gets trapped between the houses and trees opposite from vehicles travelling between Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent and parts of Caerphilly county. Wales' most polluted stretch of road is on the main route between Pontypool and Newbridge The compulsory purchase of these properties at 50% above the market rate was agreed by the council's cabinet in 2019. Demolition was originally expected to start in May 2021 but has since been pushed back twice, leading to criticism from residents. The council previously said the coronavirus pandemic had ""inevitably impacted the scheme"" and that it had to ""undertake preparatory works such as ecological surveys, structural surveys and asbestos removal works"".

"Chelsea Flower Show back with autumnal bloomsAfter a year out due to Covid, this year's show is being held four months later than is traditional.","The Chelsea Flower Show is back - showcasing autumnal blooms The Chelsea Flower Show is ready for the opening of a one-off autumn version. Final preparations were made to the displays on Monday ahead of the event opening to the public on Tuesday. The world-famous show is normally held in May, but this year it was delayed due to coronavirus restrictions. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) cancelled the event in 2020 and took it online as the UK endured its first coronavirus lockdown. BBC Two at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show Dame Judi Dench shares a joke with Chelsea Pensioners during an event held at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show ahead of its opening on Tuesday Holding it in the autumn means the show will have a different look, featuring blooms such as asters and dahlias, trees full of fruit and berries, grasses and seed-heads, and autumn bulbs such as nerines. The RHS is keen to highlight that autumn is an important season for gardening - although it intends to revert to its traditional May date next year. Celebrities including Gemma Collins enjoyed the blooms Call the Midwife star Helen George blooms in the Florence Nightingale Garden The Psalm 23 garden looks like it impressed actor Sally Phillips Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sue Biggs, RHS director general, said: ""It's wonderfully different and I'm like a Cheshire Cat at the moment because I can't stop grinning. To be back after such a traumatic time is just so wonderful."" She said what was different was the colours as the light in autumn was different to spring and that it bathed everything in a golden glow. This year's colours are different to normal as the event is being held in autumn rather than summer Chrysanthemums are some of the blooms on show It's not just flowers and plants on show - vegetables are also having a moment in the spotlight ""On the planting side, there are lots of oranges and reds and yellows which just create a completely different feel to the very cool, fresh colours of spring of white and purple."" Later at the event Ms Biggs said: ""Whilst everyone associates spring with being the time to garden and grow plants, there is much that can be done now as well, like dividing herbaceous perennials, planting spring-flowering bulbs and collecting seeds to create colour in your garden next summer."" Princess Anne attended with the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent and Princess Alexandra On Monday, members of the Royal Family, including Princess Anne, and various flower-loving celebrities had a first glimpse of the show a day ahead of its public opening. Dame Judi Dench said the show looked ""as always, immaculate"". Environment Secretary George Eustice and other ministers toured the Cop26 garden, an area of the show which highlights the climate crisis in the run-up to key UN climate talks being held in Glasgow in November. Environment Secretary George Eustice looked at the garden which explores the impact of the climate crisis - and what gardeners can do to help The garden is divided into four sections exploring different aspects of the climate crisis, including negative garden practices such as paving over areas, ways to cope with temperature changes such as planting for drought, measures to support the environment and working with nature. Its co-designer Marie-Louise Agius said she hoped the garden, which features composting, a wildlife garden, leaving edges of lawns long for nature and ways to manage water better, would be informative, educational and inspirational. Visitors Tara (left) and Valerie Pain fit in with the Parsley Box Garden The largest plot at the show will be the Queen's Green Canopy Garden, which aims to highlight the vital importance of trees and woodland. It will boast 21 trees and more than 3,500 plants. The display forms part of efforts to promote theQueen's Green Canopy project,external, an initiative to encourage people to plant trees for the monarch's Platinum Jubilee next year. DJ Crystal entertained the florists and gardeners in the green room exhibit Also at the show is the Guide Dogs' 90th Anniversary Garden and the Florence Nightingale Garden, which marks the bicentenary of the birth of the trailblazing nurse and celebrates the importance of the nursing profession in the 21st Century. The Florence Nightingale Garden features seed heads of foxgloves - Nightingale's favourite plant The Florence Nightingale Garden will be relocated to St Thomas' Hospital in Westminster in 2022 to a spot currently being used as a Covid-19 testing and vaccination centre. Within the great pavilion of the show there is a piazza featuring fruit and vegetables such as pumpkins to mark the harvest season, and a two-metre high wall of clay beehives within pollinator-friendly planting. Florist Judith Blacklock puts the finishing touches to a floral carousel installation in Halkin Arcade.

US opens up to fully vaccinated travellersThe move answers a major demand from European allies at a time of strained diplomatic relations.US & Canada,"The new air travel rules will come into effect in November The US is easing its coronavirus travel restrictions, reopening to passengers from the UK, EU and other nations. From November, foreign travellers will be allowed to fly into the US if they are fully vaccinated, and undergo testing and contact tracing. The US has had tough restrictions on travel in place since early last year. The move answers a major demand from European allies, and means that families and friends separated by the restrictions can be reunited. ""It's a happy day - Big Apple, here I come!"" French entrepreneur Stephane Le Breton told the Associated Press news agency, as he looked forward to a trip to New York City that had been put on hold because of the restrictions. White House Covid-19 co-ordinator Jeff Zients announced the new rules on Monday, saying: ""This is based on individuals rather than a country-based approach, so it's a stronger system."" ""Most importantly, foreign nationals flying to the US will be required to be fully vaccinated,"" he said. US restrictions were initially imposed on travellers from China in early 2020, and then extended to other countries. The current rules bar entry to most non-US citizens who have been in the UK and a number of other European countries, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil within the last 14 days. Under the new rules, foreign travellers will need to demonstrate proof of vaccination before flying, obtain a negative Covid-19 test result within three days of travelling, and provide their contact information. They will not be required to quarantine. Officials said there would be some exceptions to the new policy, including for children who are not eligible to be vaccinated. It was not immediately clear if the new rules applied only to US-approved vaccines, with Mr Zients saying this would be determined by the US Centers for Disease Control. A White House source told the BBC that the question of whether people who have had the AstraZeneca vaccine or 12- to 18-year-olds who have only had one jab would be allowed in under the new rules was a level of ""granular detail"" that was still being worked out, though this would affect millions. Americans who are not fully vaccinated will still be able to enter, but they will need to be tested before their return to the US, and after they arrive home. Mr Zients said the policy would come into effect in early November, but did not give an exact date. The new rules do not apply to land borders, meaning that restrictions continue to apply to cross-border travel with Canada and Mexico. IN CHARTS:Where are Covid cases the highest? EXPLAINED:Travel update: Can we go to the US now? FEATURE:Getting Covid in a land where no cases officially exist The easing of travel rules came as a surprise to many, after the US government last week said it was not the right time to lift the restrictions. One British official told the BBC on Monday that the decision had come completely out of the blue. Following the announcement, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""delighted"". ""It's a fantastic boost for business and trade, and great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again,"" he wrote on Twitter. German Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz also welcomed the change, saying it was ""great news for German and European investments, our exports and transatlantic relations"". For months a joint working party has been looking at ways to relax the travel ban. The work, I'm told, has been detailed and assiduous. But last Friday in Washington next to no one (not even in the Biden administration) was expecting today's announcement. So what's changed? The Biden administration is aware of the growing disquiet among European allies about a range of issues - Afghanistan notably, but in recent days French fury over the Aukus submarine deal. And remember France is America's oldest ally. This week Joe Biden will be meeting not only Boris Johnson, but a whole pile of EU leaders during the UN General Assembly in New York. And all had it on their dance cards to raise the travel ban. According to one diplomatic source, the US over the weekend just weighed the countervailing forces: annoy some Americans with a policy that could be characterised as being weak on Covid; or continue to alienate your European allies who are growing increasingly irritable. With the data no longer supporting the ban, this weekend came a decision. Out of the blue in one way, but quite logical in another. Airline shares rose in response to the new travel rules, with British Airways owner IAG up as much as 10%. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss called the move ""a major milestone"" for travel recovery. Doug Parker, chairman and CEO of American Airlines, said he welcomed the ""science-based approach"" to lifting travel restrictions. ""With the shared goals of health and safety always at the forefront, we're looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends,"" he said. Travellers also celebrated the changes. Phil White, a British entrepreneur who lives in the US, said the decision would allow him to see his 23-year-old daughter who lives in London for the first time since the pandemic started. ""We haven't been able to see our daughter over this time. And that has been very, very, very difficult for us,"" he told AFP news agency. He said he immediately booked a flight for her daughter after the news about the change was confirmed.  ""[A]s a family we're going to be together for Thanksgiving, which is amazing,"" he added. The US has recorded more than 42 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, and over 670,000 deaths. In an interview with BBC World News on Monday, White House coronavirus adviser Dr Anthony Fauci urged more Americans to get vaccinated.

France pulls out of UK defence talks amid rowParis is angry after Australia cancelled a submarine contract in favour of a deal with the UK and US.UK,"This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China France's defence minister has cancelled talks with her UK counterpart as the row continues over a new security deal between Britain, the US and Australia. Paris is angry after Australia signed the Aukus pact to build nuclear-powered submarines, pulling out of a major contract with France in the process. UK PM Boris Johnson said France had nothing to worry about from the deal. But Florence Parly's meeting with UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace in London this week has been called off. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Wallace said there had been ""absolutely no intent.... to slight, upset or drive a wedge between us and France"". ""Britain and France on many issues are joined at the hip,"" he added. Lord Ricketts, a former British ambassador to France who was due to co-chair the two days of talks, confirmed the meeting between Mr Wallace and Ms Parly had been ""postponed to a later date"". Earlier, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told BBC Breakfast that ""all bilateral relationships go through periods of tension"", but added: ""I have absolutely no doubt that ultimately our relationship with France will endure."" He said the pact with Australia and the US was intended to ""strengthen and deepen"" the relationship with two long-standing defence partners and to support high-tech manufacturing and technology companies across the UK. The Aukus agreement brokered last week, widely seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea, ended a deal worth $37bn (Â£27bn) signed by Australia in 2016 for France to build 12 conventional submarines. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has described it as a ""stab in the back"" that constitutes ""unacceptable behaviour between allies and partners"". And in a rare step among allies, French President Emmanuel Macron ordered the recall of the French ambassadors to Washington and Canberra. Submarine deal delivers France some hard truths Aukus pact could signal power shift in Asia-Pacific The European Union has said it was ""analysing"" the impact of the Aukus agreement on its trade negotiations with Australia, which are due to resume in October. BBC Brussels correspondent Jessica Parker said it appeared the EU had hardened up its position over the weekend, as the extent of France's anger became clear. She said the European Commission wouldn't elaborate on what ""analysing"" the impact of Aukus could actually mean for the trade talks with Australia - but the language might lead to speculation that negotiations could even be suspended. Speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York, where he is taking part in the UN General Assembly, Mr Johnson said the UK and France had a ""very important and indestructible relationship"". ""Of course we'll be talking to all our friends about how to make the Aukus pact work so that it's not exclusionary, it's not divisive - and it really doesn't have to be that way,"" he told reporters. ""This is just a way of the UK, the US and Australia sharing certain technologies because that is the sensible thing to do in the world in which we find ourselves. ""But that does not in any way mean that we wish to be adversarial to anybody else, or exclusive, or crowding anybody else out."" Mr Johnson is being joined on the trip with new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who launched her own defence of the agreement in anarticle for the Sunday Telegraph,external. Ms Truss said the deal showed the UK's readiness to be ""hard-headed"" in defending its interests and had the potential to create hundreds of new skilled jobs. Liz Truss became foreign secretary in this week's reshuffle Meanwhile,Australia has defended scrapping its dealwith France in favour of the Aukus pact. Prime Minister Scott Morrison rejected accusations that Australia had lied, saying France should have been aware it was prepared to break the deal. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Morrison said: ""Ultimately, this was a decision about whether the submarines that were being built, at great cost to the Australian taxpayer, were going to be able to do a job that we needed it to do when they went into service and our strategic judgement based on the best possible of intelligence and defence advice was that it would not."" The agreement means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. The pact will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies. But it has been criticised by China, which has accused the three powers of having a ""Cold War mentality"". And on Monday, North Korea, which has its own closely-watched nuclear weapon and missile programmes, warned it could spark a ""nuclear arms race"". ""These are extremely undesirable and dangerous acts which will upset the strategic balance in the Asia-Pacific region,"" state media KCNA quoted a foreign ministry official as saying.

Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up',"Stacey Stothard is waiting to see how much more she will have to pay Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity. She saved Â£300 - or so she thought. Her new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year. ""It is just like watching the meter go up and up,"" she says. ""I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record. ""I tried to protect myself from this turbulence. Now I've just had to order a lot of logs for the burner."" Gas firms seek help amid higher energy bill fears Why are gas prices rising and what if my supplier goes bust? She is in a position already faced by hundreds of thousands of people, and which could also be the fate of many, many more homeowners and renters. Ms Stothard's supplier was Dorset-based Utility Point which had 220,000 customers and was among four to have ceased trading in recent weeks. At the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK, but industry sources have said there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year. Customers, like Ms Stothard, of collapsed firms are automatically transferred to another supplier. At present, given the crisis, it is likely that they will go to one of the UK's biggest energy companies. Their old deal is cancelled. When they are moved, the new supplier comes to an agreement with the regulator Ofgem about which tariff they will be placed on which, in all likelihood at the moment, will be more expensive. That is because the wholesale cost of gas has soared recently. They can switch again to another supplier of their choice to find a better deal, but only after initial the transfer is complete. Customers like Ms Stothard, who lives in Skipton, are seeing any decent deals disappear, leaving them without much of a choice. Some comparison sites have even suspended their service. Read more about Ofgem's rules when a company goes bust,external ""In that time the nearest comparable deal has become significantly higher. I've been instructed that I must wait to hear from my new supplier. With each passing day, the energy prices are increasing,"" she says. There is a backstop in place, called the energy price cap, which is set by the regulator Ofgem under government policy. The energy cap is the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. That cap will rise from its current level on 1 October. Those on standard tariffs, who use an average amount of gas and electricity, could see an increase of Â£139, from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year Pre-payment customers could see an increase of Â£153, from Â£1,156 to Â£1,309 Even though it is rising - a move that will affect an estimated 15 million people - it does mean suppliers cannot just charge customers as much as they like as their own costs rise. Current fixed rate deals for remaining suppliers must also be honoured. Geoff Ravenhall, from Rugby, faces paying a tariff at the price cap level. He switched away from British Gas, only to become a customer again after his supplier went bust. ""They are ridiculous prices. As people have less and less income, it is getting more expensive,"" he says. ""It will be a while before another supplier is brave enough to offer a competitive rate."" The vast majority of households pay their gas and electricity bills by direct debit. They pay the same amount each month, irrespective of how much energy they use. In the summer, they tend to pay for more than they use, so their credit balance builds up. Their supplier temporarily holds onto the overpayments until the winter when monthly payments tend not to cover the extra energy being used in the colder, darker months. Customers of firms which have collapsed at the end of the summer are worried that they might lose the credit which they have built up. The same is true among customers of firms on the brink, like John who contacted the BBC. ""I am about Â£500 in credit, I am concerned if they go bust and I lose my Â£500 credit,"" he says. A new supplier taking on customers of a collapsed firm will honour that credit, under Ofgem rules. The regulator, and Citizens Advice, recommend keeping evidence of statements and payments. But that may become expensive for surviving suppliers taking on the burden of new customers, which is why the big energy companies are lobbying the government to provide financial support. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here No chance lights will go out, says government How much are energy bills going up?

Firm seeks funds to stay afloat,"The UK's sixth largest energy company, Bulb, is seeking a bailout to stay afloat amid surging wholesale gas prices. The company, with 1.7m customers, is working with the investment bank Lazard to try to shore up its balance sheet. It is the latest energy company battling to avoid going bust, with at least four smaller UK firms expected togo out of business next week. High global demand for gas has caused a recent surge in wholesale prices. A bailout for Bulb could come as part of a joint venture or merger with another company, with a further option being a cash injection from investors, according to the Financial Times, who firstreported the story.,external In a statement, Bulb told the BBC: ""From time to time we explore various opportunities to fund our business plans and further our mission to lower bills and lower CO2. ""Like everyone in the industry, we're monitoring wholesale prices and their impact on our business."" US CO2 firm boss flies to UK for crisis gas talks 'UK not seeing risks to supplies right now' Are energy bills going up and what can I do? Industry group Oil & Gas UK said wholesale prices for gas had increased by 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August. The price hike has left some companies unable to provide their customers with the energy they have paid for. However, if a supplier fails, energy regulator Ofgem will ensure supplies continue for affected households, and they will not lose money owed to them. A new energy supplier would be responsible for taking on any credit balances a customer may have. Four small energy companies ceased trading in recent weeks, including Edinburgh-based People's Energy, which supplied gas and electricity to about 350,000 homes and 1,000 businesses, and Dorset-based Utility Point which had 220,000 customers. At the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK, but industry sources have said there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year. The rise in gas prices has not only affected companies supplying energy, but food firms and supermarkets who use gas, in particular carbon dioxide, to deliver and store produce. CO2 is also used to stun animals before slaughter and as a coolant agent in transport. US firm CF Industries, the UK's biggest CO2 producer, stopped production at its Teesside and Cheshire fertiliser plants due to the gas prices, which has sparked concern across the food production industry. Richard Walker, managing director of supermarket Iceland,tweeted,externalthat CO2 was ""essential for a wide range of food and medical uses"". ""Yet 60% of the UK's supply comes from only two sites, owned by one foreign company, who have decided to close due to profitability,"" he added. ""Surely matters of national security should be state-controlled?"" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has held talks over the gas shortages with the boss of the US company, Tony Will, whoflew into the UK on Sunday. Mr Kwarteng said he was ""confident security of supply can be maintained under a wide range of scenarios"". He said he would host further talks with the energy industry and consumer groups on Monday. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive Energy UK, the industry's trade body, said talks with the government focused on how companies got through the current period with as little impact on customers as possible. ""The whole of the energy sector is facing unprecedented prices,"" she told the BBC ""We are reliant on a volatile international commodity in the UK because we are highly dependent on gas both in our own homes where we burn it for heat. ""We do that at a level beyond our European neighbours, but also for our power sector and other uses in the economy, so when we get an unprecedentedly high price there are unprecedented impacts on the market.""

LiveLiveUS set to lift UK and EU Covid travel ban5 minutes ago,"The White House says the ban on UK and EU travellers coming to the US will be lifted in November The ban has been in force since March 2020 when the pandemic began gathering pace The move has been welcomed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, along with UK airlines and airports On Monday the UK recorded 36,100 new Covid cases and 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test A booster shot is being offered to all adults over 50 across the UK from today Children aged 12 to 15 in England and Scotland are also now able to get a Covid vaccine The roll-out is also beginning in Wales this week, while in Northern Ireland it is likely to be offered from October Edited by Rob Corp Thanks for joining us - we'll be back first thing tomorrow morning. Your live page writers today were Doug Faulkner, Victoria Lindrea and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Rob Corp. Our main story on the ending of the US travel ban for many overseas passengers will continue to be updatedhere. That's pretty much it from us for today, but before we close the live page, here is a quick look at today's main headlines: Case numbers and hospital admissions have continued to fall in the UK, albeit slowly - despite most school pupils in England returning two weeks ago. However deaths are increasing, from a low point over the summer. The seven-day average is 142 deaths. Both first and second vaccinations are very low.  First vaccinations on Sunday were the lowest on record:14,586 - although typically weekend figures are low. Sunday's figure for second doses - 35,131 - was also  the lowest since 14 March.  We have some reaction from the airline industry on the other side of the Atlantic. Trade organisation Airlines for America says it applauds the decision to begin reopening international travel. Its president Nicholas E Calio says: ""US airlines have been strong advocates for a stringent, consistent policy and are eager to safely reunite the countless families, friends and colleagues who have not seen each other in nearly two years, if not longer. ""Todayâs announcement marks a positive step in our nationâs recovery, and we look forward to working with the administration over the coming weeks to implement this new global system."" Meanwhile Doug Parker. chairman of American Airlines, says: ""We welcome the Biden administrationâs science-based approach to begin lifting the restrictions on travel to the US that were put into place at the start of the pandemic. ""With the shared goals of health and safety always at the forefront, weâre looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends."" Independent air transport consultant John Strickland says the lifting of the travel ban in the US is of ""massive importance to two UK airlines who heavily rely on the US-UK route"". He says: ""For Virgin Atlantic its more than 80% of its business, for British Airways itâs over 30%. They are long haul airlines by nature and this is the largest and most revenue critical market for each of them. ""There have been two lost summers already and this will save the tail end of the second and help them provide capacity for important, albeit reduced business traffic."" Until recently there has been a skeleton cargo operation with nominal passenger numbers, before the UK opened up to vaccinated US passengers, he says, adding: ""But this will restore a higher volume of traffic with access to UK/European travellers."" Back to the House of Commons and Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon is responding to Grant Shapps - who earlier confirmed that UK citizens who are fully vaccinated will be allowed into the US from November. He says that despite the changes to the UK's international travel system, announced last week, ""no-one should believe that the travel industry is back to normal nor that our borders are any safer from new variants coming in to the country"". He says while Labour supports scrapping the ""confused"" traffic light system it still has not been shown the evidence that decisions on travel are ""based on sound science and not politics"". McMahon says his party has a serious concern that of the more than 11,000 positive tests from travellers arriving during the summer only around 3,000 were sent for genomic sequencing ""leaving us open to new variants"". We told you earlier about the impact on British airline and aviation shares following the announcement that UK and EU citizens will once again be able to travel to the US from November. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the
FTSE-100, closing 10% higher, while EasyJet was up 4%, and jet engineer Rolls-Royce advanced 4.2%. On the European exchanges, Air France shares surged 5.6% and Lufthansa
gained more than 6% on the back of the announcement. The upward trend builds on strong gains for travel stocks at
the end of last week after UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed a
shake-up of travel rules in England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is giving a statement in the House of Commons. He confirms today's announcement from the White House that from early November fully vaccinated UK travellers will be able to go to the US. He goes on to say the UK will extend its policy of ending quarantine for fully vaccinated passengers to arrivals from more countries, including Canada and Japan, from 4 October. Shapps says that as one of the world's most vaccinated countries the UK must use that to its advantage to restore freedoms lost over the past 18 months. ""Recovery is the best way to support the aviation sector,"" he says British Airways boss Sean Doyle says news of the end of the US travel ban after 18 months marks ""an historic moment"" which will provide a ""huge boost for global Britain as it emerges from this pandemic"". ""We are immensely grateful to the prime minister and his government for all the hard work that's gone into securing this deal with the US, and which builds upon last Friday's announcement on the lifting of many travel restrictions,"" he says. ""Our customers should now feel that the world is re-opening to them and they can book their trips with confidence."" More reaction now from the UK aviation industry following that US announcement that it will end its ban on travellers from Britain and EU countries in November. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, says the move represents a ""major breakthrough"" for UK aviation. ""The US is one of our most important markets and the air corridor is worth billions of pounds a year in trade and tourism - safeguarding thousands of jobs,"" he says. ""Things are moving in the right direction and ministers deserve credit for getting us to this point."" He says the industry is looking forward to seeing the full details and says there is still more to be done - such as relaxation of restrictions on unvaccinated passengers - but says ""there is light at the end of the tunnel following 18 months of unprecedented uncertainty"". Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye says connectivity between the US and UK is ""part of the bedrock of the global economy"". ""The prime minister has secured a massive win for global Britain in getting these links restarted,"" he says.  The US has said it will start letting fully vaccinated travellers from the UK enter the country from November. They will, however, need to take part in testing and contact tracing. A ban forbidding UK travellers from entering the US, except under exceptional circumstances, or where residency or dual citizenship was held, has been in force since March 2020 when the pandemic began. The news comes days after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the travel rules were changing for people in England - removing the 'fit-to-fly' test and replacing the post-arrival PCR test with a cheaper lateral flow test from October. So who is allowed to travel and where - and what are the latest quarintine requirements?We have everything you need to know.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is delighted by the US decision to lift a travel ban on arrivals from the UK. Johnson, who was born in the US, describes the move as ""a fantastic boost for business and trade"" and  says it is ""great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again"".

The UK's ambassador to the United States, Dame Karen Pierce, says the travel announcement is great news for families and firms on both sides of the Atlantic. ""We are grateful the US has recognised the progress the UK has made against Covid-19, including high vaccination rates and declining cases,"" she says. ""This decision means that more Brits can reunite with loved ones in the United States, more British holidaymakers can spend their hard-earned pounds in the American tourism sector, and more business activity can boost both of our economies."" There
have been a further 36,100 cases of coronavirus
reported in the UK today,according to the latest government figures.,external There have been a further 49 deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days. It takes the total UK Covid death toll to 135,252.  Reaction is already coming in to that announcement on overseas travel from the US. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss says it is ""a major milestone"" in the reopening of travel at scale. ""As the UK forges its recovery from the pandemic, the reopening of the transatlantic corridor and the lifting of Presidential Order 212F acknowledges the great progress both nations have made in rolling out successful vaccine programmes,"" he says. Weiss adds that the UK will be able to strengthen ties with its most important economic partner ""boosting trade and tourism as well as reuniting friends, families and business colleagues"". Jon SopelBBC North America Editor For months a joint working party has been looking at ways to relax the travel ban. The work, Iâm told, has been detailed and assiduous. But last Friday in Washington next to no-one (not even in the Biden administration) was expecting todayâs announcement. So whatâs changed? The Biden administration is aware of the growing disquiet among European allies about a range of issues â Afghanistan notably, but in recent days French fury over the Aukus submarine deal. And remember France is Americaâs oldest ally. This week Joe Biden will be meeting not only Boris Johnson, but a whole pile of EU leaders during the UN General Assembly in New York. And all had it on their dance cards to raise the travel ban. According to one diplomatic source, the US over the weekend just weighed the countervailing forces: annoy some Americans with a policy that could be characterised as being weak on Covid; or continue to alienate your European allies who are growing increasingly irritable. With the data no longer supporting the ban, this weekend came a decision. Out of the blue in one way, but quite logical in another. The White House says it will lift most restrictions which bar foreign nationals who have been in the UK, and other countries including China and Brazil, from travelling to the US. But foreigners flying to the US will face a requirement to be fully vaccinated from early November. The White House also says US citizens who are not vaccinated will face stricter Covid testing requirements. Airline shares have flown higher after reports that the US
government is set to relax travel requirements for UK and EU citizens. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the FTSE-100, up
as much as 10% on the day, while EasyJet climbed 2.6% higher, and jet engineer
Rolls-Royce advanced 4.6%. Fully-vaccinated passengers look set to be able to travel to the US
from November. An announcement from the Biden administration is expected as
soon as Monday afternoon. The move will mark the end of an 18-month travel ban which has been in force since
17 March 2020. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent Delta Airlines jets at New York's JFK airport This is really early days, we are still waiting to have that official announcement from the US government but my understanding from speaking to industry sources is that some of these airlines are now being briefed a change will happen. Of course this is a much-awaited change for the industry - they have been desperate to get the US-UK lines connected again. If you happen to be from the the US coming into the UK you have been able to come in if you have been double jabbed in the US since August - and not have to quarantine - so that has opened up for people travelling in one direction. But at the moment you can't travel from the UK to the US unless you have a green card or you have a special stipulation or a US passport as well. That has really limited things for businesses which rely on being able to go back and forth between the US and UK, but of course crucially for families who have been disconnected during this time and haven't been able to visit. A lot of these long-haul airlines really rely on UK-US routes and that has been closed pretty much since the beginning of the pandemic so that is a long time without that source of income. Jon SopelBBC North America Editor The travel ban for
people living in the UK and EU, that was introduced last March by Donald Trump,
is finally going to be relaxed. An announcement is expected later today from
the US administration. It looks as though those who can demonstrate they have
been double-vaccinated will, from November, be allowed to enter the US. One
British official told me the decision had come completely out of the blue. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been planning to raise it tomorrow in his meeting at the
White House with the president, but with little hope of making progress. Though details have not been given, it is thought that the relaxation of the
rules will come in time for people to travel over Thanksgiving. This has been
something that had been demanded by the travel industry â but more importantly
for the thousands of families whoâve been unable to see loved ones for 18
months as a result of the restrictions introduced at the height of the
pandemic. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Gas firms seek help amid higher energy bill fearsThe business secretary is holding crisis talks as firms battle to stay afloat amid a surge in gas prices.,"This video can not be played Kwasi Kwarteng: Talk of the lights going out is âalarmist, unhelpful and completely misguided"" There is ""no question of the lights going out"" this winter as a result of huge rises in gas prices, the business secretary has said. Kwasi Kwarteng said he does ""not expect supply emergencies"" and described warnings about shortages as ""alarmist"". His statement comes as smaller energy providers battle to stay afloat due to gas price hikes making price promises to customers undeliverable. High demand for gas and reduced supply are behind a surge in wholesale prices. Customers are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which is the maximum price they can be charged on a standard tariff. However, the cap means energy firms are unable to pass on higher wholesale costs to their customers, which is forcing some - mostly smaller companies - to go out of business. So far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. On Sunday, the UK's sixth largest energy company,Bulb, announced it is seeking a bailout. The government has said it is considering offering emergency state-backed loans to surviving energy companies to encourage them to take on customers from bust firms. Mr Kwarteng said the government would ""not be bailing out failed companies"" and said the sector had seen a ""regular entry and exit"" over the past five to 10 years. ""The current global situation may see more suppliers than usual exiting the market but this is not something that should be any cause for alarm or panic,"" he said. ""The taxpayer should not be expected to prop up companies which have poor business models and are not resilient to fluctuations in price."" Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up' How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? 'UK not seeing risks to supplies right now' Are energy bills going up and what can I do? The business secretary said the government wanted to protect customers from ""price spikes"" and that the energy industry should not  return to the ""cosy oligopoly"" of years past where a few large suppliers ""dictated to customers conditions and pricing"". At the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK, but industry sources have said there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year. Mr Kwarteng added the UK benefited from having a ""diverse range of gas supply sources"" and had ""more than sufficient capacity, to meet demand"". Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned that UK families were going to be hit by a ""triple whammy"" of tax rises, fuel costs and the end of the Universal Credit uplift this winter. Industry group Oil & Gas UK has said wholesale prices for gas had increased by 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August. The increase has been blamed on several factors, including a cold winter which left stocks lower than usual, high demand for liquefied natural gas from Asia, and lower supplies from other countries. Low winds meaning less renewable energy is being generated and outages at some nuclear stations have also contributed. It has left some companies unable to provide their customers with the energy they have paid for. However, if a supplier fails, energy regulator Ofgem will ensure supplies continue for affected households, and they will not lose money owed to them. A new energy supplier would be responsible for taking on any credit balances a customer may have, but consumers may end up on more expensive tariffs when they are switched. Aside from gas prices driving up energy bills, millions of households in England, Wales and Scotland are already facing a 12% rise in their energy bills from October when a higher price cap comes into force. Some of the largest energy companies have argued the current price cap on tariff - supported by both Labour and Conservative politicians - has helped trigger the current crisis. ""You can legislate to protect the consumer - but that can bankrupt the supplier,"" said one senior industry source. However, Mr Kwarteng said the energy price cap was ""not going anywhere"". Ofgem will review the price cap in February. There has been speculation that the energy regulator could lift the cap between now and next year to allow firms to charge customers more to cope with rising wholesale gas prices. Stacey Stothard is waiting to see how much more she will have to pay Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity. She saved Â£300 - or so she thought. Her new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year. ""It is just like watching the meter go up and up,"" she says. ""I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record."" Read more about her story here. Earlier on Tuesday, several smaller energy firms wrote an open letter sent to the prime minister, chancellor, business secretary and Ofgem, which stated they felt there ""voice, as suppliers of all different sizes, has not been heard"". Signed by the likes of Green, AMPower, Neon Reef and Tru Energy, it called for a support package for all suppliers, a review of the price cap and for smaller firms to be included in future discussions on the future of the energy market. It was critical of Ofgem, saying it was ""currently unfit to regulate an industry they have appeared to have a vested interest in or turning a blind eye to the market returning to a selective monopoly and a reduction in competition"". In a joint statement on gas prices, Mr Kwarteng and Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley reiterated that the current crisis was ""not an issue of supply"". The pair said there was a consensus among energy suppliers and consumer groups that the ""top priority"" must be support for customers, ""especially the elderly and vulnerable"". ""In the event an energy supplier fails, we are committed that consumers face the least amount of disruption possible - and there are clear and well-established processes in place to ensuring this is the case,"" they added. As a result of gas prices booming, energy intensive fertiliser producers have shut down, which has created a shortage of the by-product of production, carbon dioxide. Food manufacturers and supermarkets have urged action because carbon dioxide is used to stun animals prior to slaughter and to keep food fresh for storage and transport. Supermarket Iceland's managing director Richard Walker told the BBC the carbon dioxide shortage must be prioritised to limit any potential disruption for supermarket supplies, which are also being affected due to a shortage in HGV drivers in the UK, partly caused by the pandemic and Brexit. Supermarket Ocado said it had ""limited stock"" of some frozen items due to gas shortages, while another supermarket told the BBC the situation was ""escalating quickly"". Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here.

Chelsea Flower Show back with autumnal blooms,"The Chelsea Flower Show is back - showcasing autumnal blooms The Chelsea Flower Show is ready for the opening of a one-off autumn version. Final preparations were made to the displays on Monday ahead of the event opening to the public on Tuesday. The world-famous show is normally held in May, but this year it was delayed due to coronavirus restrictions. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) cancelled the event in 2020 and took it online as the UK endured its first coronavirus lockdown. BBC Two at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show Dame Judi Dench shares a joke with Chelsea Pensioners during an event held at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show ahead of its opening on Tuesday Holding it in the autumn means the show will have a different look, featuring blooms such as asters and dahlias, trees full of fruit and berries, grasses and seed-heads, and autumn bulbs such as nerines. The RHS is keen to highlight that autumn is an important season for gardening - although it intends to revert to its traditional May date next year. Celebrities including Gemma Collins enjoyed the blooms Call the Midwife star Helen George blooms in the Florence Nightingale Garden The Psalm 23 garden looks like it impressed actor Sally Phillips Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sue Biggs, RHS director general, said: ""It's wonderfully different and I'm like a Cheshire Cat at the moment because I can't stop grinning. To be back after such a traumatic time is just so wonderful."" She said what was different was the colours as the light in autumn was different to spring and that it bathed everything in a golden glow. This year's colours are different to normal as the event is being held in autumn rather than summer Chrysanthemums are some of the blooms on show It's not just flowers and plants on show - vegetables are also having a moment in the spotlight ""On the planting side, there are lots of oranges and reds and yellows which just create a completely different feel to the very cool, fresh colours of spring of white and purple."" Later at the event Ms Biggs said: ""Whilst everyone associates spring with being the time to garden and grow plants, there is much that can be done now as well, like dividing herbaceous perennials, planting spring-flowering bulbs and collecting seeds to create colour in your garden next summer."" Princess Anne attended with the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent and Princess Alexandra On Monday, members of the Royal Family, including Princess Anne, and various flower-loving celebrities had a first glimpse of the show a day ahead of its public opening. Dame Judi Dench said the show looked ""as always, immaculate"". Environment Secretary George Eustice and other ministers toured the Cop26 garden, an area of the show which highlights the climate crisis in the run-up to key UN climate talks being held in Glasgow in November. Environment Secretary George Eustice looked at the garden which explores the impact of the climate crisis - and what gardeners can do to help The garden is divided into four sections exploring different aspects of the climate crisis, including negative garden practices such as paving over areas, ways to cope with temperature changes such as planting for drought, measures to support the environment and working with nature. Its co-designer Marie-Louise Agius said she hoped the garden, which features composting, a wildlife garden, leaving edges of lawns long for nature and ways to manage water better, would be informative, educational and inspirational. Visitors Tara (left) and Valerie Pain fit in with the Parsley Box Garden The largest plot at the show will be the Queen's Green Canopy Garden, which aims to highlight the vital importance of trees and woodland. It will boast 21 trees and more than 3,500 plants. The display forms part of efforts to promote theQueen's Green Canopy project,external, an initiative to encourage people to plant trees for the monarch's Platinum Jubilee next year. DJ Crystal entertained the florists and gardeners in the green room exhibit Also at the show is the Guide Dogs' 90th Anniversary Garden and the Florence Nightingale Garden, which marks the bicentenary of the birth of the trailblazing nurse and celebrates the importance of the nursing profession in the 21st Century. The Florence Nightingale Garden features seed heads of foxgloves - Nightingale's favourite plant The Florence Nightingale Garden will be relocated to St Thomas' Hospital in Westminster in 2022 to a spot currently being used as a Covid-19 testing and vaccination centre. Within the great pavilion of the show there is a piazza featuring fruit and vegetables such as pumpkins to mark the harvest season, and a two-metre high wall of clay beehives within pollinator-friendly planting. Florist Judith Blacklock puts the finishing touches to a floral carousel installation in Halkin Arcade. She co-designed it for the Belgravia in Bloom festival, an event that coincides with the Chelsea Flower Show The area of Chelsea is getting in on the act with celebratory blooms adorning the streets Pumpkins in first September Chelsea Flower Show Chelsea Flower Show to be delayed until September RHS Chelsea Flower Show 2021 'Prolific' Harold Hill shoplifter BANNED from entering busy roads for two years Acton man among four convicted  in fatal street stabbing US jobs data sparks Wall Street sell-off while pound slump continues Coroner demands answers as tests on dead bodies delayed for two years Gritting in Havering: Which of the borough's main roads are prioritised?

Top football agent broke rules by targeting minorsAidy Ward also tried to involve his then-client Raheem Sterling in a bid to attract an under-age player.UK,"A leading football agent who used to represent Raheem Sterling has broken Football Association rules by signing under-age players, according to evidence seen by BBC Panorama. Aidy Ward also asked Mr Sterling to speak to a 15-year-old, as part of an attempt by Mr Ward to sign him. Mr Ward, who owns Colossal Sports Management, said he could not comment. The FA prohibits agents offering deals before 1 January in the year of a player's 16th birthday. The BBC understands thatMr Ward is already under investigation by the FAin relation to this incident, but the association has yet to conclude its inquiry. Evidence seen by Panorama reveals how Mr Ward, at a dinner with a 15-year-old boy and his mother at a restaurant in London, video-called his most famous client Raheem Sterling and asked him to speak to the boy. Mr Sterling's lawyers told Panorama that as an England international he feels a responsibility to speak to aspiring players and has done so a couple of times at Mr Ward's request. However, he does not speak to them about agents or financial issues, and he supports FA rules designed to protect young players. Mr Sterling, who has a small shareholding in Colossal given to him by Ward, dropped him as an agent late last year. Mr Ward said he could not comment out of respect for the FA investigation. Ward negotiated Sterling's Â£49m move from Liverpool to Manchester City in 2015 Panorama has seen a series of leaked emails and messages that appear to show how Mr Ward has been trying to build his business by signing young players to his agency. The programme has spoken to the parents of seven under-age footballers, who all say that Colossal had approached them offering their services. Panorama has also seen the minutes of a Colossal meeting, which took place at a south London restaurant in 2017. The email includes a list of players the agency wanted to sign - six of whom were 14 or younger at the time. Mr Ward did not respond to these points when asked by Panorama. Panorama has also spoken to a Premier League scout, who said that agencies like Colossal can often use underhand tactics to sign players. Wishing to remain anonymous, he said: ""They target a single-mum family because it's easy. It all starts from a very, very young age."" One former youth player, Foday Nabay, now 23, told the programme he was approached by Mr Ward when he was just 12 years old. Mr Nabay, who was born in Sierra Leone and moved to England with his mother when he was six, was at the time playing with England's under-16 squad, having become a star of Birmingham City's youth academy. Mr Nabay said he was happy at Birmingham but Mr Ward suggested a move to Fulham, who were in the Premier League at the time. Mr Ward says he has never been Mr Nabay's agent, but Panorama has obtained a series of confidential emails from 2013 that appear to contradict his claim. In the emails, Fulham's academy director, Huw Jennings, Mr Ward and another agent he was working with discussed the terms of Mr Nabay's transfer, who was by then 14 years old. The negotiations concluded with an offer from Fulham's academy director to pay the agents their full fee - which was Â£120,000 - if the deal went through. When Mr Nabay found out there were agency fees involved, he told Fulham he would only sign if they were not paid. FA rules state an agent cannot request or receive any payment in relation to a transfer of an academy player before the year of their 16th birthday. Agents are also not allowed to make any approaches to the player or their family before that date. Fulham did not answer the BBC's detailed questions about Mr Nabay's transfer, but said that the club had neither paid, nor agreed to pay, Mr Ward or the other agent in relation to the player's registration with the club. The FA says it thoroughly investigates all allegations of rule-breaking by agents, and that about 50 have been sanctioned over the last three years. Mr Nabay signed with Fulham but was released by the club in March 2018, when he was 19. He says he felt manipulated by Mr Ward for pushing him into a move he was never happy with. ""I was in my room 24/7, didn't want to leave, I didn't want to do anything. I was really not in a good place,"" he said. Youth academies, which train talented players, can be big money-spinners. Last summer, Premier League clubs earned at least Â£250m from selling their academy graduates. Football finance expert Kieran Maguire said the problem goes beyond just one agent or one academy. ""The commoditisation of young footballers means they are now being viewed by some clubs as potential profit centres."" he said.

Your live page writers today were Doug Faulkner, Victoria Lindrea and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Rob Corp. Our main story on the ending of the US travel ban for many overseas passengers will continue to be updatedhere. That's pretty much it from us for today, but before we close the live page, here is a quick look at today's main headlines: Case numbers and hospital admissions have continued to fall in the UK, albeit slowly - despite most school pupils in England returning two weeks ago. However deaths are increasing, from a low point over the summer. The seven-day average is 142 deaths. Both first and second vaccinations are very low.  First vaccinations on Sunday were the lowest on record:14,586 - although typically weekend figures are low. Sunday's figure for second doses - 35,131 - was also  the lowest since 14 March.  We have some reaction from the airline industry on the other side of the Atlantic. Trade organisation Airlines for America says it applauds the decision to begin reopening international travel. Its president Nicholas E Calio says: ""US airlines have been strong advocates for a stringent, consistent policy and are eager to safely reunite the countless families, friends and colleagues who have not seen each other in nearly two years, if not longer. ""Todayâs announcement marks a positive step in our nationâs recovery, and we look forward to working with the administration over the coming weeks to implement this new global system."" Meanwhile Doug Parker. chairman of American Airlines, says: ""We welcome the Biden administrationâs science-based approach to begin lifting the restrictions on travel to the US that were put into place at the start of the pandemic. ""With the shared goals of health and safety always at the forefront, weâre looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends."" Independent air transport consultant John Strickland says the lifting of the travel ban in the US is of ""massive importance to two UK airlines who heavily rely on the US-UK route"". He says: ""For Virgin Atlantic its more than 80% of its business, for British Airways itâs over 30%. They are long haul airlines by nature and this is the largest and most revenue critical market for each of them. ""There have been two lost summers already and this will save the tail end of the second and help them provide capacity for important, albeit reduced business traffic."" Until recently there has been a skeleton cargo operation with nominal passenger numbers, before the UK opened up to vaccinated US passengers, he says, adding: ""But this will restore a higher volume of traffic with access to UK/European travellers."" Back to the House of Commons and Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon is responding to Grant Shapps - who earlier confirmed that UK citizens who are fully vaccinated will be allowed into the US from November. He says that despite the changes to the UK's international travel system, announced last week, ""no-one should believe that the travel industry is back to normal nor that our borders are any safer from new variants coming in to the country"". He says while Labour supports scrapping the ""confused"" traffic light system it still has not been shown the evidence that decisions on travel are ""based on sound science and not politics"". McMahon says his party has a serious concern that of the more than 11,000 positive tests from travellers arriving during the summer only around 3,000 were sent for genomic sequencing ""leaving us open to new variants"". We told you earlier about the impact on British airline and aviation shares following the announcement that UK and EU citizens will once again be able to travel to the US from November. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the
FTSE-100, closing 10% higher, while EasyJet was up 4%, and jet engineer Rolls-Royce advanced 4.2%. On the European exchanges, Air France shares surged 5.6% and Lufthansa
gained more than 6% on the back of the announcement. The upward trend builds on strong gains for travel stocks at
the end of last week after UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed a
shake-up of travel rules in England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is giving a statement in the House of Commons. He confirms today's announcement from the White House that from early November fully vaccinated UK travellers will be able to go to the US. He goes on to say the UK will extend its policy of ending quarantine for fully vaccinated passengers to arrivals from more countries, including Canada and Japan, from 4 October. Shapps says that as one of the world's most vaccinated countries the UK must use that to its advantage to restore freedoms lost over the past 18 months. ""Recovery is the best way to support the aviation sector,"" he says British Airways boss Sean Doyle says news of the end of the US travel ban after 18 months marks ""an historic moment"" which will provide a ""huge boost for global Britain as it emerges from this pandemic"". ""We are immensely grateful to the prime minister and his government for all the hard work that's gone into securing this deal with the US, and which builds upon last Friday's announcement on the lifting of many travel restrictions,"" he says. ""Our customers should now feel that the world is re-opening to them and they can book their trips with confidence."" More reaction now from the UK aviation industry following that US announcement that it will end its ban on travellers from Britain and EU countries in November. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, says the move represents a ""major breakthrough"" for UK aviation. ""The US is one of our most important markets and the air corridor is worth billions of pounds a year in trade and tourism - safeguarding thousands of jobs,"" he says. ""Things are moving in the right direction and ministers deserve credit for getting us to this point."" He says the industry is looking forward to seeing the full details and says there is still more to be done - such as relaxation of restrictions on unvaccinated passengers - but says ""there is light at the end of the tunnel following 18 months of unprecedented uncertainty"". Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye says connectivity between the US and UK is ""part of the bedrock of the global economy"". ""The prime minister has secured a massive win for global Britain in getting these links restarted,"" he says.  The US has said it will start letting fully vaccinated travellers from the UK enter the country from November. They will, however, need to take part in testing and contact tracing. A ban forbidding UK travellers from entering the US, except under exceptional circumstances, or where residency or dual citizenship was held, has been in force since March 2020 when the pandemic began. The news comes days after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the travel rules were changing for people in England - removing the 'fit-to-fly' test and replacing the post-arrival PCR test with a cheaper lateral flow test from October. So who is allowed to travel and where - and what are the latest quarintine requirements?We have everything you need to know.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is delighted by the US decision to lift a travel ban on arrivals from the UK.

The UK's ambassador to the United States, Dame Karen Pierce, says the travel announcement is great news for families and firms on both sides of the Atlantic. ""We are grateful the US has recognised the progress the UK has made against Covid-19, including high vaccination rates and declining cases,"" she says. ""This decision means that more Brits can reunite with loved ones in the United States, more British holidaymakers can spend their hard-earned pounds in the American tourism sector, and more business activity can boost both of our economies."" There
have been a further 36,100 cases of coronavirus
reported in the UK today,according to the latest government figures.,external There have been a further 49 deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days. It takes the total UK Covid death toll to 135,252.  Reaction is already coming in to that announcement on overseas travel from the US. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss says it is ""a major milestone"" in the reopening of travel at scale. ""As the UK forges its recovery from the pandemic, the reopening of the transatlantic corridor and the lifting of Presidential Order 212F acknowledges the great progress both nations have made in rolling out successful vaccine programmes,"" he says. Weiss adds that the UK will be able to strengthen ties with its most important economic partner ""boosting trade and tourism as well as reuniting friends, families and business colleagues"". Jon SopelBBC North America Editor For months a joint working party has been looking at ways to relax the travel ban. The work, Iâm told, has been detailed and assiduous. But last Friday in Washington next to no-one (not even in the Biden administration) was expecting todayâs announcement. So whatâs changed? The Biden administration is aware of the growing disquiet among European allies about a range of issues â Afghanistan notably, but in recent days French fury over the Aukus submarine deal. And remember France is Americaâs oldest ally. This week Joe Biden will be meeting not only Boris Johnson, but a whole pile of EU leaders during the UN General Assembly in New York. And all had it on their dance cards to raise the travel ban. According to one diplomatic source, the US over the weekend just weighed the countervailing forces: annoy some Americans with a policy that could be characterised as being weak on Covid; or continue to alienate your European allies who are growing increasingly irritable. With the data no longer supporting the ban, this weekend came a decision. Out of the blue in one way, but quite logical in another. The White House says it will lift most restrictions which bar foreign nationals who have been in the UK, and other countries including China and Brazil, from travelling to the US. But foreigners flying to the US will face a requirement to be fully vaccinated from early November. The White House also says US citizens who are not vaccinated will face stricter Covid testing requirements. Airline shares have flown higher after reports that the US
government is set to relax travel requirements for UK and EU citizens. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the FTSE-100, up
as much as 10% on the day, while EasyJet climbed 2.6% higher, and jet engineer
Rolls-Royce advanced 4.6%. Fully-vaccinated passengers look set to be able to travel to the US
from November. An announcement from the Biden administration is expected as
soon as Monday afternoon. The move will mark the end of an 18-month travel ban which has been in force since
17 March 2020. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent Delta Airlines jets at New York's JFK airport This is really early days, we are still waiting to have that official announcement from the US government but my understanding from speaking to industry sources is that some of these airlines are now being briefed a change will happen. Of course this is a much-awaited change for the industry - they have been desperate to get the US-UK lines connected again. If you happen to be from the the US coming into the UK you have been able to come in if you have been double jabbed in the US since August - and not have to quarantine - so that has opened up for people travelling in one direction. But at the moment you can't travel from the UK to the US unless you have a green card or you have a special stipulation or a US passport as well. That has really limited things for businesses which rely on being able to go back and forth between the US and UK, but of course crucially for families who have been disconnected during this time and haven't been able to visit. A lot of these long-haul airlines really rely on UK-US routes and that has been closed pretty much since the beginning of the pandemic so that is a long time without that source of income. Jon SopelBBC North America Editor The travel ban for
people living in the UK and EU, that was introduced last March by Donald Trump,
is finally going to be relaxed. An announcement is expected later today from
the US administration. It looks as though those who can demonstrate they have
been double-vaccinated will, from November, be allowed to enter the US. One
British official told me the decision had come completely out of the blue. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been planning to raise it tomorrow in his meeting at the
White House with the president, but with little hope of making progress. Though details have not been given, it is thought that the relaxation of the
rules will come in time for people to travel over Thanksgiving. This has been
something that had been demanded by the travel industry â but more importantly
for the thousands of families whoâve been unable to see loved ones for 18
months as a result of the restrictions introduced at the height of the
pandemic. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Your live page writers today were Doug Faulkner, Victoria Lindrea and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Rob Corp. Our main story on the ending of the US travel ban for many overseas passengers will continue to be updatedhere. That's pretty much it from us for today, but before we close the live page, here is a quick look at today's main headlines: Case numbers and hospital admissions have continued to fall in the UK, albeit slowly - despite most school pupils in England returning two weeks ago. However deaths are increasing, from a low point over the summer. The seven-day average is 142 deaths. Both first and second vaccinations are very low.  First vaccinations on Sunday were the lowest on record:14,586 - although typically weekend figures are low. Sunday's figure for second doses - 35,131 - was also  the lowest since 14 March.  We have some reaction from the airline industry on the other side of the Atlantic. Trade organisation Airlines for America says it applauds the decision to begin reopening international travel. Its president Nicholas E Calio says: ""US airlines have been strong advocates for a stringent, consistent policy and are eager to safely reunite the countless families, friends and colleagues who have not seen each other in nearly two years, if not longer. ""Todayâs announcement marks a positive step in our nationâs recovery, and we look forward to working with the administration over the coming weeks to implement this new global system."" Meanwhile Doug Parker. chairman of American Airlines, says: ""We welcome the Biden administrationâs science-based approach to begin lifting the restrictions on travel to the US that were put into place at the start of the pandemic. ""With the shared goals of health and safety always at the forefront, weâre looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends."" Independent air transport consultant John Strickland says the lifting of the travel ban in the US is of ""massive importance to two UK airlines who heavily rely on the US-UK route"". He says: ""For Virgin Atlantic its more than 80% of its business, for British Airways itâs over 30%. They are long haul airlines by nature and this is the largest and most revenue critical market for each of them. ""There have been two lost summers already and this will save the tail end of the second and help them provide capacity for important, albeit reduced business traffic."" Until recently there has been a skeleton cargo operation with nominal passenger numbers, before the UK opened up to vaccinated US passengers, he says, adding: ""But this will restore a higher volume of traffic with access to UK/European travellers."" Back to the House of Commons and Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon is responding to Grant Shapps - who earlier confirmed that UK citizens who are fully vaccinated will be allowed into the US from November. He says that despite the changes to the UK's international travel system, announced last week, ""no-one should believe that the travel industry is back to normal nor that our borders are any safer from new variants coming in to the country"". He says while Labour supports scrapping the ""confused"" traffic light system it still has not been shown the evidence that decisions on travel are ""based on sound science and not politics"". McMahon says his party has a serious concern that of the more than 11,000 positive tests from travellers arriving during the summer only around 3,000 were sent for genomic sequencing ""leaving us open to new variants"". We told you earlier about the impact on British airline and aviation shares following the announcement that UK and EU citizens will once again be able to travel to the US from November. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the
FTSE-100, closing 10% higher, while EasyJet was up 4%, and jet engineer Rolls-Royce advanced 4.2%. On the European exchanges, Air France shares surged 5.6% and Lufthansa
gained more than 6% on the back of the announcement. The upward trend builds on strong gains for travel stocks at
the end of last week after UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed a
shake-up of travel rules in England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is giving a statement in the House of Commons. He confirms today's announcement from the White House that from early November fully vaccinated UK travellers will be able to go to the US. He goes on to say the UK will extend its policy of ending quarantine for fully vaccinated passengers to arrivals from more countries, including Canada and Japan, from 4 October. Shapps says that as one of the world's most vaccinated countries the UK must use that to its advantage to restore freedoms lost over the past 18 months. ""Recovery is the best way to support the aviation sector,"" he says British Airways boss Sean Doyle says news of the end of the US travel ban after 18 months marks ""an historic moment"" which will provide a ""huge boost for global Britain as it emerges from this pandemic"". ""We are immensely grateful to the prime minister and his government for all the hard work that's gone into securing this deal with the US, and which builds upon last Friday's announcement on the lifting of many travel restrictions,"" he says. ""Our customers should now feel that the world is re-opening to them and they can book their trips with confidence."" More reaction now from the UK aviation industry following that US announcement that it will end its ban on travellers from Britain and EU countries in November. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, says the move represents a ""major breakthrough"" for UK aviation. ""The US is one of our most important markets and the air corridor is worth billions of pounds a year in trade and tourism - safeguarding thousands of jobs,"" he says. ""Things are moving in the right direction and ministers deserve credit for getting us to this point."" He says the industry is looking forward to seeing the full details and says there is still more to be done - such as relaxation of restrictions on unvaccinated passengers - but says ""there is light at the end of the tunnel following 18 months of unprecedented uncertainty"". Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye says connectivity between the US and UK is ""part of the bedrock of the global economy"".

US CO2 firm boss in UK for talks,"The boss of a US company that supplies 60% of the UK's food-grade carbon dioxide supply has held crisis talks with the government over shortages. Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, arrived in the UK earlier after the firm stopped production at its two fertiliser plants because of soaring wholesale gas prices. Food firms are warning a shortage of CO2 is threatening produce supplies. High global demand for gas has been blamed for the recent surge in prices. Carbon dioxide is used to stun animals prior to slaughter and in dry ice form to keep food fresh for storage and transport. It is a by-product of fertiliser manufacturing. Last week, CF Industries, the UK's biggest CO2 producer, stopped production at its Teesside and Cheshire fertiliser plants ""due to high natural gas prices"". Wholesale gas prices have jumped by 250% since January, according to Oil & Gas UK, the industry group. Carbon dioxide 'threatens food security' Gas prices: Are energy bills going up and what can I do? CF Industries said it did not ""have an estimate for when production will resume"". The BBC has also been told that officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy have been ""working with"" the company in recent days. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwartengtweeted,externalthat he had met Mr Will and ""discussed the pressures the business is facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies, including to our food and energy industries"". Food producers and supermarkets have warned of the impact CO2 shortages are having on the industry. Ranjit Singh Boparan, owner of UK poultry giant 2 Sisters Food Group, said the decision by CT Industries to halt operations, was a ""massive body blow"" for the food sector and placed it ""at breaking point"". Adam Couch, the boss of pork producer Cranswick said the industry was ""already at tipping point ahead of the demanding Christmas period"". ""We have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep food on the shelves, but there is a real risk of product shortages across the country if the government does not act immediately to address these issues,"" he added. Supermarket Ocado said it had ""limited stock"" of some frozen items due to gas shortages, while another supermarket told the BBC the situation was ""escalating quickly"". One supermarket executive told the BBC the CO2 issue is ""escalating quickly"" and was causing a ""big supply issue"". ""The big meat suppliers are saying they have two to three days' supply and are now having to prioritise how they use what they have,"" he said. He said the problem ""compounds"" supply issues the food, drink and supermarket industries are already facing due to shortages of HGV drivers in the UK, caused partly by the pandemic and Brexit. The British Poultry Council said that the supply chains will ""inevitably slow down"" if CO2 supplies become tighter and more unpredictable in the next five to seven days. A spokeswoman said product types might be reduced as meat companies streamline production to try to cut down the impact of shortages. Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, stressed that the UK was not going to run out of food, but said there would be ""major concerns"" over supply to supermarkets and other food outlets. He suggested the government would need to take an ""innovative"" approach to dealing with the shortage of CO2, such as perhaps subsidising companies who produce the gas over the next four or five weeks. ""Or the knock-on effects of this may well be felt right the way through to the end of the year and particularly over the key Christmas trading period,"" said Mr Wright. Mr Kwarteng has been in talks with energy suppliers as well as the energy regulator Ofgem over the weekend amid fearsmore small companies could go bust in the coming days. COP26 president Alok Sharma told BBC's Andrew Marr Show that people should not be concerned about the risk to the supply of gas. And he said the energy price cap and warm homes discount - two cost-limiting measures - would protect people. An Ofgem spokesperson said: ""Ofgem continues to work closely with government and industry to ensure consumers continue to be protected while global gas prices are high and will speak further on these issues at the industry roundtable [on Monday].""

Your live page writers today were Doug Faulkner, Victoria Lindrea and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Rob Corp. Our main story on the ending of the US travel ban for many overseas passengers will continue to be updatedhere. That's pretty much it from us for today, but before we close the live page, here is a quick look at today's main headlines: Case numbers and hospital admissions have continued to fall in the UK, albeit slowly - despite most school pupils in England returning two weeks ago. However deaths are increasing, from a low point over the summer. The seven-day average is 142 deaths. Both first and second vaccinations are very low.  First vaccinations on Sunday were the lowest on record:14,586 - although typically weekend figures are low. Sunday's figure for second doses - 35,131 - was also  the lowest since 14 March.  We have some reaction from the airline industry on the other side of the Atlantic. Trade organisation Airlines for America says it applauds the decision to begin reopening international travel. Its president Nicholas E Calio says: ""US airlines have been strong advocates for a stringent, consistent policy and are eager to safely reunite the countless families, friends and colleagues who have not seen each other in nearly two years, if not longer. ""Todayâs announcement marks a positive step in our nationâs recovery, and we look forward to working with the administration over the coming weeks to implement this new global system."" Meanwhile Doug Parker. chairman of American Airlines, says: ""We welcome the Biden administrationâs science-based approach to begin lifting the restrictions on travel to the US that were put into place at the start of the pandemic. ""With the shared goals of health and safety always at the forefront, weâre looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends."" Independent air transport consultant John Strickland says the lifting of the travel ban in the US is of ""massive importance to two UK airlines who heavily rely on the US-UK route"". He says: ""For Virgin Atlantic its more than 80% of its business, for British Airways itâs over 30%. They are long haul airlines by nature and this is the largest and most revenue critical market for each of them. ""There have been two lost summers already and this will save the tail end of the second and help them provide capacity for important, albeit reduced business traffic."" Until recently there has been a skeleton cargo operation with nominal passenger numbers, before the UK opened up to vaccinated US passengers, he says, adding: ""But this will restore a higher volume of traffic with access to UK/European travellers."" Back to the House of Commons and Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon is responding to Grant Shapps - who earlier confirmed that UK citizens who are fully vaccinated will be allowed into the US from November. He says that despite the changes to the UK's international travel system, announced last week, ""no-one should believe that the travel industry is back to normal nor that our borders are any safer from new variants coming in to the country"". He says while Labour supports scrapping the ""confused"" traffic light system it still has not been shown the evidence that decisions on travel are ""based on sound science and not politics"". McMahon says his party has a serious concern that of the more than 11,000 positive tests from travellers arriving during the summer only around 3,000 were sent for genomic sequencing ""leaving us open to new variants"". We told you earlier about the impact on British airline and aviation shares following the announcement that UK and EU citizens will once again be able to travel to the US from November. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the
FTSE-100, closing 10% higher, while EasyJet was up 4%, and jet engineer Rolls-Royce advanced 4.2%. On the European exchanges, Air France shares surged 5.6% and Lufthansa
gained more than 6% on the back of the announcement. The upward trend builds on strong gains for travel stocks at
the end of last week after UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed a
shake-up of travel rules in England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is giving a statement in the House of Commons. He confirms today's announcement from the White House that from early November fully vaccinated UK travellers will be able to go to the US. He goes on to say the UK will extend its policy of ending quarantine for fully vaccinated passengers to arrivals from more countries, including Canada and Japan, from 4 October. Shapps says that as one of the world's most vaccinated countries the UK must use that to its advantage to restore freedoms lost over the past 18 months. ""Recovery is the best way to support the aviation sector,"" he says British Airways boss Sean Doyle says news of the end of the US travel ban after 18 months marks ""an historic moment"" which will provide a ""huge boost for global Britain as it emerges from this pandemic"". ""We are immensely grateful to the prime minister and his government for all the hard work that's gone into securing this deal with the US, and which builds upon last Friday's announcement on the lifting of many travel restrictions,"" he says. ""Our customers should now feel that the world is re-opening to them and they can book their trips with confidence."" More reaction now from the UK aviation industry following that US announcement that it will end its ban on travellers from Britain and EU countries in November. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, says the move represents a ""major breakthrough"" for UK aviation. ""The US is one of our most important markets and the air corridor is worth billions of pounds a year in trade and tourism - safeguarding thousands of jobs,"" he says. ""Things are moving in the right direction and ministers deserve credit for getting us to this point."" He says the industry is looking forward to seeing the full details and says there is still more to be done - such as relaxation of restrictions on unvaccinated passengers - but says ""there is light at the end of the tunnel following 18 months of unprecedented uncertainty"". Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye says connectivity between the US and UK is ""part of the bedrock of the global economy"". ""The prime minister has secured a massive win for global Britain in getting these links restarted,"" he says.  The US has said it will start letting fully vaccinated travellers from the UK enter the country from November. They will, however, need to take part in testing and contact tracing. A ban forbidding UK travellers from entering the US, except under exceptional circumstances, or where residency or dual citizenship was held, has been in force since March 2020 when the pandemic began. The news comes days after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the travel rules were changing for people in England - removing the 'fit-to-fly' test and replacing the post-arrival PCR test with a cheaper lateral flow test from October. So who is allowed to travel and where - and what are the latest quarintine requirements?We have everything you need to know.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is delighted by the US decision to lift a travel ban on arrivals from the UK. Johnson, who was born in the US, describes the move as ""a fantastic boost for business and trade"" and  says it is ""great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again"".

Weiss adds that the UK will be able to strengthen ties with its most important economic partner ""boosting trade and tourism as well as reuniting friends, families and business colleagues"". Jon SopelBBC North America Editor For months a joint working party has been looking at ways to relax the travel ban. The work, Iâm told, has been detailed and assiduous. But last Friday in Washington next to no-one (not even in the Biden administration) was expecting todayâs announcement. So whatâs changed? The Biden administration is aware of the growing disquiet among European allies about a range of issues â Afghanistan notably, but in recent days French fury over the Aukus submarine deal. And remember France is Americaâs oldest ally. This week Joe Biden will be meeting not only Boris Johnson, but a whole pile of EU leaders during the UN General Assembly in New York. And all had it on their dance cards to raise the travel ban. According to one diplomatic source, the US over the weekend just weighed the countervailing forces: annoy some Americans with a policy that could be characterised as being weak on Covid; or continue to alienate your European allies who are growing increasingly irritable. With the data no longer supporting the ban, this weekend came a decision. Out of the blue in one way, but quite logical in another. The White House says it will lift most restrictions which bar foreign nationals who have been in the UK, and other countries including China and Brazil, from travelling to the US. But foreigners flying to the US will face a requirement to be fully vaccinated from early November. The White House also says US citizens who are not vaccinated will face stricter Covid testing requirements. Airline shares have flown higher after reports that the US
government is set to relax travel requirements for UK and EU citizens. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the FTSE-100, up
as much as 10% on the day, while EasyJet climbed 2.6% higher, and jet engineer
Rolls-Royce advanced 4.6%. Fully-vaccinated passengers look set to be able to travel to the US
from November. An announcement from the Biden administration is expected as
soon as Monday afternoon. The move will mark the end of an 18-month travel ban which has been in force since
17 March 2020. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent Delta Airlines jets at New York's JFK airport This is really early days, we are still waiting to have that official announcement from the US government but my understanding from speaking to industry sources is that some of these airlines are now being briefed a change will happen. Of course this is a much-awaited change for the industry - they have been desperate to get the US-UK lines connected again. If you happen to be from the the US coming into the UK you have been able to come in if you have been double jabbed in the US since August - and not have to quarantine - so that has opened up for people travelling in one direction. But at the moment you can't travel from the UK to the US unless you have a green card or you have a special stipulation or a US passport as well. That has really limited things for businesses which rely on being able to go back and forth between the US and UK, but of course crucially for families who have been disconnected during this time and haven't been able to visit. A lot of these long-haul airlines really rely on UK-US routes and that has been closed pretty much since the beginning of the pandemic so that is a long time without that source of income. Jon SopelBBC North America Editor The travel ban for
people living in the UK and EU, that was introduced last March by Donald Trump,
is finally going to be relaxed. An announcement is expected later today from
the US administration. It looks as though those who can demonstrate they have
been double-vaccinated will, from November, be allowed to enter the US. One
British official told me the decision had come completely out of the blue. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been planning to raise it tomorrow in his meeting at the
White House with the president, but with little hope of making progress. Though details have not been given, it is thought that the relaxation of the
rules will come in time for people to travel over Thanksgiving. This has been
something that had been demanded by the travel industry â but more importantly
for the thousands of families whoâve been unable to see loved ones for 18
months as a result of the restrictions introduced at the height of the

Food and drink warning over CO2 gas shortagesOne of Britain's biggest poultry processors says there needs to be urgent action within days.,"There could be an ""availability issue"" if production is cut, says one food processor One of Britain's largest chicken processors says it will have to cut production unless two UK carbon dioxide plants restart. Last week, CF Industries, the UK's biggest CO2 producer,stopped production in Teesside and Cheshiredue to ""high natural gas prices"". Food giant 2 Sisters processes about a million chickens each week at its plant in Flintshire in north Wales. It warned production across its nine UK sites could fall by 10% within days. ""You'd see an availability issue within a week,"" said 2 Sisters Food Group founder and president Ranjit Singh Boparan. ""We've got four to five days left, then we'll have to reduce our production by 10% - over half a million chickens a week. ""The knock on effect for farmers is horrific - some farmers won't survive."" The CO2 gas is used to stun chickens prior to slaughtering, and also in the packaging process. 2 Sisters' Anglesey plant is the only one in the UK to process whole large chickens In addition to its largest poultry processing plant at Sandycroft on Deeside, 2 Sisters also operates the only UK factory to handle large whole chickens at its site at Llangefni on Anglesey. The food company has seven more poultry-processing plants dotted around the UK, and its president also took over the Bernard Matthews turkey business in 2016. Mr Boparan told the BBC the food production sector was already facing challenges with workforces and labour supply. ""This is another issue that could have been avoided,"" said. ""We have to get these two plants up and running, save Christmas and save the food supply chain."" What can I do about energy bills? Is it cruel to stun animals with CO2? Carbon dioxide used to lure mosquitoes Fears for beers: No CO2 poses a challenge for brewers such as Wrexham Lager's Martyn Jones It is not just poultry production where there are concerns. Carbon dioxide gas is used in carbonated drinks and beers. Martyn Jones, president of Wrexham Lager Brewing Company, said they will be struggling if the CO2 situation continues. The brewer said a delivery due on Monday was already two weeks late from their supplier. ""Now they're promising a delivery today, but we know it's not going to be as much as we need, because they're trying to supply everyone,"" said Mr Jones. Mr Jones, the former Labour MP for Clwyd South, said they had enough gas to last a week, and then they will have to stop filling beer kegs. ""If we don't have it, we're going to be in real trouble,"" he said. Kathryn Jones from Castell Howell food wholesaler said they were waiting to hear about CO2 supplies In Carmarthenshire, food service wholesaler Castell Howell said it has been guaranteed a three-week supply of CO2 gas - but is waiting to hear what will happen afterwards. ""In our processing plant we do use CO2 for packing cooked hams on a daily basis, that go out to wholesale and retail markets,"" said director Kathryn Jones. She said they expected to learn on Thursday how much more gas they can expect. ""The government has had a lot of time to deal with this. This issue has built up in the background."" Supermarket chain Iceland said it was bolstering stocks - but was not overly concerned Richard Walker, the managing director of Welsh-based supermarket chain Iceland Foods, said his company was already building up food stocks for its stores. ""We're in hourly and daily contact with some of our biggest suppliers, and none of them have any issues at the moment, but some of them are very concerned,"" he said. But he stressed: ""Our supply lines are very robust, and actually, we are building up extra stock in anticipation of this potentially becoming an issue. ""So, it doesn't affect us perhaps as much as it does other competitors."" But Mr Walker said, taken together with ongoing problems with a shortage of HGV drivers across the industry, action was needed. ""I think the government absolutely needs to prioritise CO2 supplies and financing for food production to limit the disruption to supermarket supplies,"" he said. ""It's absolutely essential that this gets sorted as quickly as possible."" From fizzy drinks to packaging processes - CO2 plays a major role in the food industry CF Industries provides 60% of the UK's carbon dioxide, which is a by-product of the fertiliser industry. Its chief executive has held crisis talks with UK ministers, but said it did not ""have an estimate for when production will resume"". The BBC has also been told that officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy have been ""working with"" the company in recent days. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwartengtweeted,externalthat he had met Tony Will, the chief executive of CF Industries, and ""discussed the pressures the business is facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies, including to our food and energy industries"". The shortage of CO2 could have "" deep and wide ranging impacts on food and drink businesses in Wales"", said the Welsh Food and Drink Industry Board. Its chairman Andy Richardson added: ""It's far deeper than just asking if turkeys or beer will be available this Christmas. All food and drink manufacturers could be affected significantly.""

The Crown and Ted Lasso dominate Emmy Awards,"This video can not be played Olivia Colman beat her co-star Emma Corrin to be named best lead actress in a drama series Netflix's royal drama The Crown and Apple TV comedy Ted Lasso were the big winners at Sunday's Emmy Awards. The Crown's prizes included best drama series and four acting wins - for Gillian Anderson, Olivia Colman, Josh O'Connor and Tobias Menzies. ""What a lovely end to the most extraordinary journey with this lovely family,"" Colman said of her final series playing Queen Elizabeth II. ""I loved every second of it and I can't wait to see what happens next."" Becoming emotional, she added: ""I wish my dad was here to see this. I lost my daddy during Covid, and he would've loved all of this."" The Crown's victory in the best drama series category is not the first time a streaming service has won the top prize at the Emmys, but it does mark the first victory for Netflix. The Crown's Josh O'Connor was named best drama actor for his performance as Prince Charles Anderson won for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher, Menzies for the Duke of Edinburgh, and O'Connor for Prince Charles. Many of this year's nominated actors from The Crown left the show after its most recent series, including Emerald Fennell, who played the Duchess of Cornwall, and Colman, who will be replaced as the Queen in the forthcoming fifth season by Imelda Staunton. In pictures: The Emmy Awards red carpet Emmy Awards 2021: The winners and nominees What's the big deal about Ted Lasso? The 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards took place in Los Angeles on Sunday and saw most nominees attend in person, although many British nominees appeared from a separate hub in London. UK winners included Michaela Coel, who won outstanding writing for a limited series for her consent drama I May Destroy You. ""I dedicate this story to every single survivor of sexual assault,"" she said as she collected her award. Michaela Coel stars in her own creation, I May Destroy You Coel also used her speech to address aspiring writers, telling them: ""Write the tale that scares you, that makes you feel uncertain, that isn't comfortable, I dare you."" She said staying away from social media could help them to create their best work. ""Do not be afraid to disappear, from it, from us, for a while, and see what comes to you in the silence,"" she said. The British writer and actress was one of the few non-white stars to score a win at the awards, which was criticised online for its lack of diversity. While many black actors were nominated, when it came to the ceremony itself, white performers took home all 12 acting awards across the comedy, drama and limited series categories.

In contrast, three black stars were among the four winning guest actors at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmys, a prelude to this Sunday's main event - namely Saturday Night Live hosts Dave Chappelle and Maya Rudolph, and Lovecraft Country's Courtney B Vance. The host of RuPaul's Drag Race, RuPaul Charles, however, did manage to become the most-awarded black artist in Emmy history on Sunday, bagging his 11th award for the outstanding competition programme. If MJ Rodriguez from drag ball drama Pose had beaten Colman to the lead actress award, she would have become the first transgender performer to win in a lead acting category. Kate Winslet was named best lead actress in a limited series for Mare of Easttown Kate Winslet and Ewan McGregor were named best limited series actress and actor for Mare of Easttown and Halston respectively. Winslet said: ""I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees in this decade that has to be about women having each other's backs. I support you, I salute you, I am proud of all of you. The HBO crime drama saw the actress play a police detective who is investigating the murder of a girl in a working-class community in Pennsylvania. ""Mare of Easttown was this cultural moment, and it brought people together and gave people something to talk about other than a pandemic, and I want to thank everybody for watching our show,"" Winslet said. Paying tribute to writer and creator Brad Ingelsby, she added: ""You created a middle-aged, imperfect, flawed mother, and you made us all feel validated."" Her Mare of Easttown co-stars Evan Peters and Julianne Nicholson also both won supporting actor and actress for their performances in the show. Brett Goldstein and Hannah Waddingham won best supporting actor and actress for Ted Lasso Jason Sudeikis was named best lead comedy actor for his performance in Ted Lasso, while his British co-stars Hannah Waddingham and Brett Goldstein won best supporting actress and actor. ""This show is about family, it's about mentors and teachers, it's about team-mates,"" Sudeikis said. ""And I wouldn't be here without those three things in my life."" His co-star Waddingham, a successful theatre actress, called for more stage stars to be given TV roles during her acceptance speech. ""West End musical performers need to be on screen more,"" she told the audience. ""Please give us a chance because we won't let you down."" She paid tribute to co-star and fellow nominee Juno Temple, saying she wished she could share the prize with her. Goldstein won outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series for his portrayal of cantankerous club captain Roy Kent. The 41-year-old said starring in the show had been ""one of the greatest honours"" of his life. Ted Lasso, which first aired on Apple TV last year, tells the story ofa US football coach who moves to the UK to coach a fictional Premiership team.

As well as taking the top drama prize of the night, The Crown's Peter Morgan and Jessica Hobbs also won for writing and directing respectively. Collecting the writing prize, Morgan said: ""I'm very proud, I'm very grateful, we're going to party. Goodnight."" Hobbs thanked other female directors and her mother, who she said is still directing at the age of 77. Menzies was not present to collect his award. Gillian Anderson won best drama supporting actress for her portrayal of British prime minister Margaret Thatcher British comic John Oliver, host of US late night show Last Week Tonight, continued his Emmy streak when his show picked up its sixth straight win in the outstanding variety talk series category. The final award of the night, outstanding limited or anthology series, went to Netflix's chess drama The Queen's Gambit. In a highly competitive category, it won ahead of I May Destroy You, Mare Of Easttown, The Underground Railroad and WandaVision. Netflix's combined total of 44 wins this year meant it towered above its nearest competitor - HBO and its HBO Max streaming service with 19. That makes this year the first time Netflix had won more Emmys than HBO, which has dominated the ceremony for years. Disney+ was third on 14, while Apple TV won 10. This year's In Memoriam section included tributes to stars including Larry King, Michael Apted, Alex Trebek, Helen McCrory, Jessica Walter, Cicely Tyson and Michael K Williams. The ceremony, hosted by US comedian Cedric the Entertainer, was held after a year of increased TV viewing prompted by lockdown restrictions around the world.

"Climate pledges will be tough to secure, PM warns","There is a ""six out of 10"" chance of getting other countries to sign up to financial and environmental targets ahead of November's key COP26 climate change conference, the UK PM has said. Boris Johnson is in the US for a UN meeting where he will urge leaders to take ""concrete action"" on the issue. But he said it would be ""tough"" to persuade allies to meet their promise to give $100bn a year to developing nations to cut carbon emissions. The UK is hosting COP26 in Glasgow. Mr Johnson also defended new International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan over her past social media posts that rejected the science of climate change, acknowledging that he himself had not always supported action on global warming but ""the facts change and people change their minds"". With some 100 world leaders expected in New York at the UN General Assembly this week, Mr Johnson will seek to galvanise action during a series of high-level meetings. Speaking during his flight, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""I think getting it all done this week is going to be a stretch. But I think getting it all done by COP, six out of 10. ""It's going to be tough but people need to understand that this is crucial for the world."" Has climate pledge to poor countries been met? What do world leaders need to agree to stop climate change? Downing Street has said developed countries have ""collectively failed"" on their annual $100bn (Â£73bn) target, with OECD figures last week showing that only $79.6bn in climate finance was mobilised in 2019. The US presents a huge obstacle to the climate talks. President Biden says he wants to undo the harm caused by President Trump's withdrawal from the international climate agreement. But he's facing a very big bill to help developing nations cope with the effects of global heating, and it's not yet clear he can persuade Congress to stump up the cash. Rich nations have agreed to help poorer countries with a $100bn annual goal as of 2017-18. Recent research from the UK think tank the Overseas Development Institute foundthe US paid only 4% of its ""fair share"",external. It suggested $40bn would be a reasonable US contribution - and the president may pledge additional money at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. If the cash doesn't flow, major developing nations may resist making further emissions cuts themselves. China and India already feel aggrieved that they're being asked to curb emissions at a far earlier stage in their development than western nations. COP26 president Alok Sharma, who is with the PM, earlier revealed that Chinese President Xi Jinping had not yet committed to attending the conference. PM aims to push for more climate action during trip Climate report is 'code red for humanity' Mr Johnson said Mr Sharma had had ""some great conversations already with his Chinese counterparts about the things they want to do"". ""I think China is massively important to this and I think China shows real signs of making progress,"" he added. Mr Johnson also insisted new International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan would do an ""outstanding job"" after social media posts emerged showing her previously denying climate change. ""I don't want to encourage you but if you were to excavate some of my articles from 20 years ago you might find some comments I made... about climate change that weren't entirely supportive of the current struggle,"" he said. ""But the facts change and people change their minds and change their views."" Mr Johnson will also travel to Washington where he will meet US President Joe Biden in the White House for the first time. The prime minister is likely to push for a restoration of UK-US travel, with Mr Biden's administration having maintained a ban despite travel restrictions being eased elsewhere.

Arrests made at fresh motorway climate protests,"Insulate Britain climate change protesters blocked the exit slip road of the M25 at junction 18 Forty-one people have been arrested after climate activists held fresh motorway protests. Insulate Britain blocked the anti-clockwise exit slip road at junction 18, Chorleywood, Herts, on Monday. A separate protest took place near junction four (Stanborough Interchange) of the A1(M), near Hatfield. A third incident saw Kent Police prevent protesters from gaining access to the M25 carriageway at junction 1a, the Dartford River Crossing. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, called the protests ""irresponsible"" and ""dangerous"".

LiveLiveBooster doses and jabs for 12 to 15-year-olds begin6 minutes ago,"The White House says the ban on UK and EU travellers coming to the US will be lifted in November The ban has been in force since March 2020 when the pandemic began gathering pace The move has been welcomed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, along with UK airlines and airports On Monday the UK recorded 36,100 new Covid cases and 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test A booster shot is being offered to all adults over 50 across the UK from today Children aged 12 to 15 in England and Scotland are also now able to get a Covid vaccine The roll-out is also beginning in Wales this week, while in Northern Ireland it is likely to be offered from October Edited by Rob Corp Thanks for joining us - we'll be back first thing tomorrow morning. Your live page writers today were Doug Faulkner, Victoria Lindrea and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Rob Corp. Our main story on the ending of the US travel ban for many overseas passengers will continue to be updatedhere. That's pretty much it from us for today, but before we close the live page, here is a quick look at today's main headlines: Case numbers and hospital admissions have continued to fall in the UK, albeit slowly - despite most school pupils in England returning two weeks ago. However deaths are increasing, from a low point over the summer. The seven-day average is 142 deaths. Both first and second vaccinations are very low.  First vaccinations on Sunday were the lowest on record:14,586 - although typically weekend figures are low. Sunday's figure for second doses - 35,131 - was also  the lowest since 14 March.  We have some reaction from the airline industry on the other side of the Atlantic. Trade organisation Airlines for America says it applauds the decision to begin reopening international travel. Its president Nicholas E Calio says: ""US airlines have been strong advocates for a stringent, consistent policy and are eager to safely reunite the countless families, friends and colleagues who have not seen each other in nearly two years, if not longer. ""Todayâs announcement marks a positive step in our nationâs recovery, and we look forward to working with the administration over the coming weeks to implement this new global system."" Meanwhile Doug Parker. chairman of American Airlines, says: ""We welcome the Biden administrationâs science-based approach to begin lifting the restrictions on travel to the US that were put into place at the start of the pandemic. ""With the shared goals of health and safety always at the forefront, weâre looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends."" Independent air transport consultant John Strickland says the lifting of the travel ban in the US is of ""massive importance to two UK airlines who heavily rely on the US-UK route"". He says: ""For Virgin Atlantic its more than 80% of its business, for British Airways itâs over 30%. They are long haul airlines by nature and this is the largest and most revenue critical market for each of them. ""There have been two lost summers already and this will save the tail end of the second and help them provide capacity for important, albeit reduced business traffic."" Until recently there has been a skeleton cargo operation with nominal passenger numbers, before the UK opened up to vaccinated US passengers, he says, adding: ""But this will restore a higher volume of traffic with access to UK/European travellers."" Back to the House of Commons and Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon is responding to Grant Shapps - who earlier confirmed that UK citizens who are fully vaccinated will be allowed into the US from November. He says that despite the changes to the UK's international travel system, announced last week, ""no-one should believe that the travel industry is back to normal nor that our borders are any safer from new variants coming in to the country"". He says while Labour supports scrapping the ""confused"" traffic light system it still has not been shown the evidence that decisions on travel are ""based on sound science and not politics"". McMahon says his party has a serious concern that of the more than 11,000 positive tests from travellers arriving during the summer only around 3,000 were sent for genomic sequencing ""leaving us open to new variants"". We told you earlier about the impact on British airline and aviation shares following the announcement that UK and EU citizens will once again be able to travel to the US from November. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the
FTSE-100, closing 10% higher, while EasyJet was up 4%, and jet engineer Rolls-Royce advanced 4.2%. On the European exchanges, Air France shares surged 5.6% and Lufthansa
gained more than 6% on the back of the announcement. The upward trend builds on strong gains for travel stocks at
the end of last week after UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed a
shake-up of travel rules in England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is giving a statement in the House of Commons. He confirms today's announcement from the White House that from early November fully vaccinated UK travellers will be able to go to the US. He goes on to say the UK will extend its policy of ending quarantine for fully vaccinated passengers to arrivals from more countries, including Canada and Japan, from 4 October. Shapps says that as one of the world's most vaccinated countries the UK must use that to its advantage to restore freedoms lost over the past 18 months. ""Recovery is the best way to support the aviation sector,"" he says British Airways boss Sean Doyle says news of the end of the US travel ban after 18 months marks ""an historic moment"" which will provide a ""huge boost for global Britain as it emerges from this pandemic"". ""We are immensely grateful to the prime minister and his government for all the hard work that's gone into securing this deal with the US, and which builds upon last Friday's announcement on the lifting of many travel restrictions,"" he says. ""Our customers should now feel that the world is re-opening to them and they can book their trips with confidence."" More reaction now from the UK aviation industry following that US announcement that it will end its ban on travellers from Britain and EU countries in November. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, says the move represents a ""major breakthrough"" for UK aviation. ""The US is one of our most important markets and the air corridor is worth billions of pounds a year in trade and tourism - safeguarding thousands of jobs,"" he says. ""Things are moving in the right direction and ministers deserve credit for getting us to this point."" He says the industry is looking forward to seeing the full details and says there is still more to be done - such as relaxation of restrictions on unvaccinated passengers - but says ""there is light at the end of the tunnel following 18 months of unprecedented uncertainty"". Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye says connectivity between the US and UK is ""part of the bedrock of the global economy"". ""The prime minister has secured a massive win for global Britain in getting these links restarted,"" he says.  The US has said it will start letting fully vaccinated travellers from the UK enter the country from November. They will, however, need to take part in testing and contact tracing. A ban forbidding UK travellers from entering the US, except under exceptional circumstances, or where residency or dual citizenship was held, has been in force since March 2020 when the pandemic began. The news comes days after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the travel rules were changing for people in England - removing the 'fit-to-fly' test and replacing the post-arrival PCR test with a cheaper lateral flow test from October. So who is allowed to travel and where - and what are the latest quarintine requirements?We have everything you need to know.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is delighted by the US decision to lift a travel ban on arrivals from the UK. Johnson, who was born in the US, describes the move as ""a fantastic boost for business and trade"" and  says it is ""great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again"".

The UK's ambassador to the United States, Dame Karen Pierce, says the travel announcement is great news for families and firms on both sides of the Atlantic. ""We are grateful the US has recognised the progress the UK has made against Covid-19, including high vaccination rates and declining cases,"" she says. ""This decision means that more Brits can reunite with loved ones in the United States, more British holidaymakers can spend their hard-earned pounds in the American tourism sector, and more business activity can boost both of our economies."" There
have been a further 36,100 cases of coronavirus
reported in the UK today,according to the latest government figures.,external There have been a further 49 deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days. It takes the total UK Covid death toll to 135,252.  Reaction is already coming in to that announcement on overseas travel from the US. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss says it is ""a major milestone"" in the reopening of travel at scale. ""As the UK forges its recovery from the pandemic, the reopening of the transatlantic corridor and the lifting of Presidential Order 212F acknowledges the great progress both nations have made in rolling out successful vaccine programmes,"" he says. Weiss adds that the UK will be able to strengthen ties with its most important economic partner ""boosting trade and tourism as well as reuniting friends, families and business colleagues"". Jon SopelBBC North America Editor For months a joint working party has been looking at ways to relax the travel ban. The work, Iâm told, has been detailed and assiduous. But last Friday in Washington next to no-one (not even in the Biden administration) was expecting todayâs announcement. So whatâs changed? The Biden administration is aware of the growing disquiet among European allies about a range of issues â Afghanistan notably, but in recent days French fury over the Aukus submarine deal. And remember France is Americaâs oldest ally. This week Joe Biden will be meeting not only Boris Johnson, but a whole pile of EU leaders during the UN General Assembly in New York. And all had it on their dance cards to raise the travel ban. According to one diplomatic source, the US over the weekend just weighed the countervailing forces: annoy some Americans with a policy that could be characterised as being weak on Covid; or continue to alienate your European allies who are growing increasingly irritable. With the data no longer supporting the ban, this weekend came a decision. Out of the blue in one way, but quite logical in another. The White House says it will lift most restrictions which bar foreign nationals who have been in the UK, and other countries including China and Brazil, from travelling to the US. But foreigners flying to the US will face a requirement to be fully vaccinated from early November. The White House also says US citizens who are not vaccinated will face stricter Covid testing requirements. Airline shares have flown higher after reports that the US
government is set to relax travel requirements for UK and EU citizens. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the FTSE-100, up
as much as 10% on the day, while EasyJet climbed 2.6% higher, and jet engineer
Rolls-Royce advanced 4.6%. Fully-vaccinated passengers look set to be able to travel to the US
from November. An announcement from the Biden administration is expected as
soon as Monday afternoon. The move will mark the end of an 18-month travel ban which has been in force since
17 March 2020. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent Delta Airlines jets at New York's JFK airport This is really early days, we are still waiting to have that official announcement from the US government but my understanding from speaking to industry sources is that some of these airlines are now being briefed a change will happen. Of course this is a much-awaited change for the industry - they have been desperate to get the US-UK lines connected again. If you happen to be from the the US coming into the UK you have been able to come in if you have been double jabbed in the US since August - and not have to quarantine - so that has opened up for people travelling in one direction. But at the moment you can't travel from the UK to the US unless you have a green card or you have a special stipulation or a US passport as well. That has really limited things for businesses which rely on being able to go back and forth between the US and UK, but of course crucially for families who have been disconnected during this time and haven't been able to visit. A lot of these long-haul airlines really rely on UK-US routes and that has been closed pretty much since the beginning of the pandemic so that is a long time without that source of income. Jon SopelBBC North America Editor The travel ban for
people living in the UK and EU, that was introduced last March by Donald Trump,
is finally going to be relaxed. An announcement is expected later today from
the US administration. It looks as though those who can demonstrate they have
been double-vaccinated will, from November, be allowed to enter the US. One
British official told me the decision had come completely out of the blue. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been planning to raise it tomorrow in his meeting at the
White House with the president, but with little hope of making progress. Though details have not been given, it is thought that the relaxation of the
rules will come in time for people to travel over Thanksgiving. This has been
something that had been demanded by the travel industry â but more importantly
for the thousands of families whoâve been unable to see loved ones for 18
months as a result of the restrictions introduced at the height of the
pandemic. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Two new London Underground stations openThe Northern line extension serves new stations at Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station.,"The first train left Battersea Power Station just before 05:30 BST Two new Tube stations have opened in the first major expansion of the London Underground this century. The first train on the new Â£1.1bn Northern line route departed from Battersea Power Station in south London at 05:28 BST. It called at the other new station, Nine Elms, before reaching the existing station of Kennington. London mayor Sadiq Khan said the services would play ""a major role"" in the capital's recovery. The gates open for the first time at Battersea Power Station to excited crowds Mr Khan said he was ""proud and grateful"" to be joined by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps on one of the first trains to serve Battersea Power Station. The pair have been embroiled in along-running rowover funding for Transport for London (TfL). Mr Khan said: ""It's great to see the difference teamwork makes, it's great to see the difference investing in infrastructure makes in relation to unlocking jobs and homes. ""Most of the things we're using today were built around the country. Every pound we spend on the Underground, 55 pence goes to the rest of the country."" By Harry Low, BBC London A band of train enthusiasts, TfL staff and journalists gathered before sunrise beneath the silhouette of Battersea Power Station. When the gates opened to the public for the first time just after 05:20 BST, more than 100 people bustled down to the platform to catch the first service to Kennington. Amid the blur of high-vis jackets and Tube map facemasks, the plethora of smartphones indicated this was a journey worth documenting. Although the trains themselves were not new, the first stop showcased Nine Elms - a second freshly constructed Tube station - to bring the south London station tally above 30. Who wakes up before sunrise to ride the new Tube? This is the first major expansion of the Tube since the Jubilee line was extended in the late 1990s. Wood Lane and Heathrow Terminal 5 stations opened in 2008. The Greater London Authority borrowed Â£1bn for the latest project, which will be funded through business rates from the local area and about Â£270m of contributions from developers. The opening of two new stations brings the total number on the network to 272 Major construction on the two-mile twin railway tunnel between Kennington and Battersea began in 2015. There will initially be a peak-time service of six trains an hour, falling to five an hour during off-peak periods. The frequency of services will be doubled by the middle of next year. TfL estimated that the new services would support 25,000 new jobs and 20,000 new homes. Mr Shapps said: ""Ahead of the opening of the Elizabeth line next year, these upgrades extend vital connectivity across the greatest city in the world and show the power of transport connections."" TfL commissioner Andy Byford said he was ""stunned"" and ""couldn't be more proud"". He said: ""The biggest thing is seeing the delight on customers' faces. That makes this all worthwhile. It's a bit like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis."" Billions of pounds of investment have been pumped into the area in recent years, including through the redevelopment of Battersea Power Station for residential and business use, and the building of the new US embassy in Nine Elms.

Arrests made at fresh motorway climate protestsInsulate Britain activists have caused disruption at the M25 and A1(M) in Hertfordshire.,"Insulate Britain climate change protesters blocked the exit slip road of the M25 at junction 18 Forty-one people have been arrested after climate activists held fresh motorway protests.

A separate protest took place near junction four (Stanborough Interchange) of the A1(M), near Hatfield. A third incident saw Kent Police prevent protesters from gaining access to the M25 carriageway at junction 1a, the Dartford River Crossing.

"Climate pledges will be tough to secure, PM warnsBoris Johnson says he has a ""six out of 10"" chance of securing pledges before the COP26 conference.","There is a ""six out of 10"" chance of getting other countries to sign up to financial and environmental targets ahead of November's key COP26 climate change conference, the UK PM has said. Boris Johnson is in the US for a UN meeting where he will urge leaders to take ""concrete action"" on the issue. But he said it would be ""tough"" to persuade allies to meet their promise to give $100bn a year to developing nations to cut carbon emissions. The UK is hosting COP26 in Glasgow. Mr Johnson also defended new International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan over her past social media posts that rejected the science of climate change, acknowledging that he himself had not always supported action on global warming but ""the facts change and people change their minds"". With some 100 world leaders expected in New York at the UN General Assembly this week, Mr Johnson will seek to galvanise action during a series of high-level meetings. Speaking during his flight, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""I think getting it all done this week is going to be a stretch. But I think getting it all done by COP, six out of 10. ""It's going to be tough but people need to understand that this is crucial for the world."" Has climate pledge to poor countries been met? What do world leaders need to agree to stop climate change? Downing Street has said developed countries have ""collectively failed"" on their annual $100bn (Â£73bn) target, with OECD figures last week showing that only $79.6bn in climate finance was mobilised in 2019. The US presents a huge obstacle to the climate talks. President Biden says he wants to undo the harm caused by President Trump's withdrawal from the international climate agreement. But he's facing a very big bill to help developing nations cope with the effects of global heating, and it's not yet clear he can persuade Congress to stump up the cash. Rich nations have agreed to help poorer countries with a $100bn annual goal as of 2017-18. Recent research from the UK think tank the Overseas Development Institute foundthe US paid only 4% of its ""fair share"",external. It suggested $40bn would be a reasonable US contribution - and the president may pledge additional money at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. If the cash doesn't flow, major developing nations may resist making further emissions cuts themselves. China and India already feel aggrieved that they're being asked to curb emissions at a far earlier stage in their development than western nations. COP26 president Alok Sharma, who is with the PM, earlier revealed that Chinese President Xi Jinping had not yet committed to attending the conference. PM aims to push for more climate action during trip Climate report is 'code red for humanity' Mr Johnson said Mr Sharma had had ""some great conversations already with his Chinese counterparts about the things they want to do"". ""I think China is massively important to this and I think China shows real signs of making progress,"" he added. Mr Johnson also insisted new International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan would do an ""outstanding job"" after social media posts emerged showing her previously denying climate change. ""I don't want to encourage you but if you were to excavate some of my articles from 20 years ago you might find some comments I made... about climate change that weren't entirely supportive of the current struggle,"" he said. ""But the facts change and people change their minds and change their views."" Mr Johnson will also travel to Washington where he will meet US President Joe Biden in the White House for the first time. The prime minister is likely to push for a restoration of UK-US travel, with Mr Biden's administration having maintained a ban despite travel restrictions being eased elsewhere.

Your live page writers today were Doug Faulkner, Victoria Lindrea and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Rob Corp. Our main story on the ending of the US travel ban for many overseas passengers will continue to be updatedhere. That's pretty much it from us for today, but before we close the live page, here is a quick look at today's main headlines: Case numbers and hospital admissions have continued to fall in the UK, albeit slowly - despite most school pupils in England returning two weeks ago. However deaths are increasing, from a low point over the summer. The seven-day average is 142 deaths. Both first and second vaccinations are very low.  First vaccinations on Sunday were the lowest on record:14,586 - although typically weekend figures are low. Sunday's figure for second doses - 35,131 - was also  the lowest since 14 March.  We have some reaction from the airline industry on the other side of the Atlantic. Trade organisation Airlines for America says it applauds the decision to begin reopening international travel. Its president Nicholas E Calio says: ""US airlines have been strong advocates for a stringent, consistent policy and are eager to safely reunite the countless families, friends and colleagues who have not seen each other in nearly two years, if not longer. ""Todayâs announcement marks a positive step in our nationâs recovery, and we look forward to working with the administration over the coming weeks to implement this new global system."" Meanwhile Doug Parker. chairman of American Airlines, says: ""We welcome the Biden administrationâs science-based approach to begin lifting the restrictions on travel to the US that were put into place at the start of the pandemic. ""With the shared goals of health and safety always at the forefront, weâre looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends."" Independent air transport consultant John Strickland says the lifting of the travel ban in the US is of ""massive importance to two UK airlines who heavily rely on the US-UK route"". He says: ""For Virgin Atlantic its more than 80% of its business, for British Airways itâs over 30%. They are long haul airlines by nature and this is the largest and most revenue critical market for each of them. ""There have been two lost summers already and this will save the tail end of the second and help them provide capacity for important, albeit reduced business traffic."" Until recently there has been a skeleton cargo operation with nominal passenger numbers, before the UK opened up to vaccinated US passengers, he says, adding: ""But this will restore a higher volume of traffic with access to UK/European travellers."" Back to the House of Commons and Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon is responding to Grant Shapps - who earlier confirmed that UK citizens who are fully vaccinated will be allowed into the US from November. He says that despite the changes to the UK's international travel system, announced last week, ""no-one should believe that the travel industry is back to normal nor that our borders are any safer from new variants coming in to the country"". He says while Labour supports scrapping the ""confused"" traffic light system it still has not been shown the evidence that decisions on travel are ""based on sound science and not politics"". McMahon says his party has a serious concern that of the more than 11,000 positive tests from travellers arriving during the summer only around 3,000 were sent for genomic sequencing ""leaving us open to new variants"". We told you earlier about the impact on British airline and aviation shares following the announcement that UK and EU citizens will once again be able to travel to the US from November. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the
FTSE-100, closing 10% higher, while EasyJet was up 4%, and jet engineer Rolls-Royce advanced 4.2%. On the European exchanges, Air France shares surged 5.6% and Lufthansa
gained more than 6% on the back of the announcement. The upward trend builds on strong gains for travel stocks at
the end of last week after UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed a
shake-up of travel rules in England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is giving a statement in the House of Commons. He confirms today's announcement from the White House that from early November fully vaccinated UK travellers will be able to go to the US. He goes on to say the UK will extend its policy of ending quarantine for fully vaccinated passengers to arrivals from more countries, including Canada and Japan, from 4 October. Shapps says that as one of the world's most vaccinated countries the UK must use that to its advantage to restore freedoms lost over the past 18 months. ""Recovery is the best way to support the aviation sector,"" he says British Airways boss Sean Doyle says news of the end of the US travel ban after 18 months marks ""an historic moment"" which will provide a ""huge boost for global Britain as it emerges from this pandemic"". ""We are immensely grateful to the prime minister and his government for all the hard work that's gone into securing this deal with the US, and which builds upon last Friday's announcement on the lifting of many travel restrictions,"" he says. ""Our customers should now feel that the world is re-opening to them and they can book their trips with confidence."" More reaction now from the UK aviation industry following that US announcement that it will end its ban on travellers from Britain and EU countries in November. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, says the move represents a ""major breakthrough"" for UK aviation. ""The US is one of our most important markets and the air corridor is worth billions of pounds a year in trade and tourism - safeguarding thousands of jobs,"" he says. ""Things are moving in the right direction and ministers deserve credit for getting us to this point."" He says the industry is looking forward to seeing the full details and says there is still more to be done - such as relaxation of restrictions on unvaccinated passengers - but says ""there is light at the end of the tunnel following 18 months of unprecedented uncertainty"". Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye says connectivity between the US and UK is ""part of the bedrock of the global economy"". ""The prime minister has secured a massive win for global Britain in getting these links restarted,"" he says.  The US has said it will start letting fully vaccinated travellers from the UK enter the country from November. They will, however, need to take part in testing and contact tracing. A ban forbidding UK travellers from entering the US, except under exceptional circumstances, or where residency or dual citizenship was held, has been in force since March 2020 when the pandemic began. The news comes days after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the travel rules were changing for people in England - removing the 'fit-to-fly' test and replacing the post-arrival PCR test with a cheaper lateral flow test from October. So who is allowed to travel and where - and what are the latest quarintine requirements?We have everything you need to know.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is delighted by the US decision to lift a travel ban on arrivals from the UK. Johnson, who was born in the US, describes the move as ""a fantastic boost for business and trade"" and  says it is ""great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again"".

The UK's ambassador to the United States, Dame Karen Pierce, says the travel announcement is great news for families and firms on both sides of the Atlantic. ""We are grateful the US has recognised the progress the UK has made against Covid-19, including high vaccination rates and declining cases,"" she says. ""This decision means that more Brits can reunite with loved ones in the United States, more British holidaymakers can spend their hard-earned pounds in the American tourism sector, and more business activity can boost both of our economies."" There
have been a further 36,100 cases of coronavirus
reported in the UK today,according to the latest government figures.,external There have been a further 49 deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days. It takes the total UK Covid death toll to 135,252.  Reaction is already coming in to that announcement on overseas travel from the US. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss says it is ""a major milestone"" in the reopening of travel at scale. ""As the UK forges its recovery from the pandemic, the reopening of the transatlantic corridor and the lifting of Presidential Order 212F acknowledges the great progress both nations have made in rolling out successful vaccine programmes,"" he says. Weiss adds that the UK will be able to strengthen ties with its most important economic partner ""boosting trade and tourism as well as reuniting friends, families and business colleagues"". Jon SopelBBC North America Editor For months a joint working party has been looking at ways to relax the travel ban. The work, Iâm told, has been detailed and assiduous. But last Friday in Washington next to no-one (not even in the Biden administration) was expecting todayâs announcement. So whatâs changed? The Biden administration is aware of the growing disquiet among European allies about a range of issues â Afghanistan notably, but in recent days French fury over the Aukus submarine deal. And remember France is Americaâs oldest ally. This week Joe Biden will be meeting not only Boris Johnson, but a whole pile of EU leaders during the UN General Assembly in New York. And all had it on their dance cards to raise the travel ban. According to one diplomatic source, the US over the weekend just weighed the countervailing forces: annoy some Americans with a policy that could be characterised as being weak on Covid; or continue to alienate your European allies who are growing increasingly irritable. With the data no longer supporting the ban, this weekend came a decision. Out of the blue in one way, but quite logical in another. The White House says it will lift most restrictions which bar foreign nationals who have been in the UK, and other countries including China and Brazil, from travelling to the US. But foreigners flying to the US will face a requirement to be fully vaccinated from early November. The White House also says US citizens who are not vaccinated will face stricter Covid testing requirements. Airline shares have flown higher after reports that the US
government is set to relax travel requirements for UK and EU citizens. British Airways owner IAG led the risers on the FTSE-100, up
as much as 10% on the day, while EasyJet climbed 2.6% higher, and jet engineer
Rolls-Royce advanced 4.6%. Fully-vaccinated passengers look set to be able to travel to the US
from November. An announcement from the Biden administration is expected as
soon as Monday afternoon. The move will mark the end of an 18-month travel ban which has been in force since
17 March 2020. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent Delta Airlines jets at New York's JFK airport This is really early days, we are still waiting to have that official announcement from the US government but my understanding from speaking to industry sources is that some of these airlines are now being briefed a change will happen. Of course this is a much-awaited change for the industry - they have been desperate to get the US-UK lines connected again. If you happen to be from the the US coming into the UK you have been able to come in if you have been double jabbed in the US since August - and not have to quarantine - so that has opened up for people travelling in one direction. But at the moment you can't travel from the UK to the US unless you have a green card or you have a special stipulation or a US passport as well. That has really limited things for businesses which rely on being able to go back and forth between the US and UK, but of course crucially for families who have been disconnected during this time and haven't been able to visit. A lot of these long-haul airlines really rely on UK-US routes and that has been closed pretty much since the beginning of the pandemic so that is a long time without that source of income. Jon SopelBBC North America Editor The travel ban for
people living in the UK and EU, that was introduced last March by Donald Trump,
is finally going to be relaxed. An announcement is expected later today from
the US administration. It looks as though those who can demonstrate they have
been double-vaccinated will, from November, be allowed to enter the US. One
British official told me the decision had come completely out of the blue. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been planning to raise it tomorrow in his meeting at the
White House with the president, but with little hope of making progress. Though details have not been given, it is thought that the relaxation of the
rules will come in time for people to travel over Thanksgiving. This has been
something that had been demanded by the travel industry â but more importantly
for the thousands of families whoâve been unable to see loved ones for 18
months as a result of the restrictions introduced at the height of the
pandemic. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Two new London Underground stations open,"The first train left Battersea Power Station just before 05:30 BST Two new Tube stations have opened in the first major expansion of the London Underground this century. The first train on the new Â£1.1bn Northern line route departed from Battersea Power Station in south London at 05:28 BST. It called at the other new station, Nine Elms, before reaching the existing station of Kennington. London mayor Sadiq Khan said the services would play ""a major role"" in the capital's recovery. The gates open for the first time at Battersea Power Station to excited crowds Mr Khan said he was ""proud and grateful"" to be joined by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps on one of the first trains to serve Battersea Power Station. The pair have been embroiled in along-running rowover funding for Transport for London (TfL). Mr Khan said: ""It's great to see the difference teamwork makes, it's great to see the difference investing in infrastructure makes in relation to unlocking jobs and homes. ""Most of the things we're using today were built around the country. Every pound we spend on the Underground, 55 pence goes to the rest of the country."" By Harry Low, BBC London A band of train enthusiasts, TfL staff and journalists gathered before sunrise beneath the silhouette of Battersea Power Station. When the gates opened to the public for the first time just after 05:20 BST, more than 100 people bustled down to the platform to catch the first service to Kennington. Amid the blur of high-vis jackets and Tube map facemasks, the plethora of smartphones indicated this was a journey worth documenting. Although the trains themselves were not new, the first stop showcased Nine Elms - a second freshly constructed Tube station - to bring the south London station tally above 30. Who wakes up before sunrise to ride the new Tube? This is the first major expansion of the Tube since the Jubilee line was extended in the late 1990s. Wood Lane and Heathrow Terminal 5 stations opened in 2008. The Greater London Authority borrowed Â£1bn for the latest project, which will be funded through business rates from the local area and about Â£270m of contributions from developers. The opening of two new stations brings the total number on the network to 272 Major construction on the two-mile twin railway tunnel between Kennington and Battersea began in 2015. There will initially be a peak-time service of six trains an hour, falling to five an hour during off-peak periods. The frequency of services will be doubled by the middle of next year. TfL estimated that the new services would support 25,000 new jobs and 20,000 new homes. Mr Shapps said: ""Ahead of the opening of the Elizabeth line next year, these upgrades extend vital connectivity across the greatest city in the world and show the power of transport connections."" TfL commissioner Andy Byford said he was ""stunned"" and ""couldn't be more proud"". He said: ""The biggest thing is seeing the delight on customers' faces. That makes this all worthwhile. It's a bit like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis."" Billions of pounds of investment have been pumped into the area in recent years, including through the redevelopment of Battersea Power Station for residential and business use, and the building of the new US embassy in Nine Elms.

Call to help youth services amid gang threat,"Experts said services needed to be radically reformed to ensure they survived for all children to access in the future New laws are needed to secure the future of ""fragile"" youth services in Wales to stop vulnerable young people being put at risk, experts have warned. Youth workers have spoken of children falling intogangs and struggling as clubs remained closed during Covid-19. A panel of experts has warned a radical overhaul is needed to save vital services, with their future needing to be guaranteed by law. Education Minister Jeremy Miles said the report showed ""challenging"" issues. In recent years, more than 160 youth clubs have beenclosed by councils, due to restructuring and cuts, while restrictions meant many buildings were unable to reopen and hold sessions during Covid. Young people who spoke to BBC Wales said youth services were vital and more needed to be done to allow them to access support and advice, as well as providing a safe space off the streets. Youth clubs 'key to tackling gang rise' Reality check: Have youth service cuts led to more crime? Out-of-work young in Wales 'face being scarred' Youth work covers a wide range of services run by councils and voluntary organisations for 11 to 25-year-olds, from youth clubs, to tackling homelessness and mental health problems. On Thursday, a report, published by the Interim Youth Work Panel, highlighted issues with safeguarding, staffing issues, and ""inconsistent"" services across Wales after years of cuts. The panel called for ministers to radically transform the sector into a service shaped by young people, with the creation of a national governing body led by young people. Set up by the Welsh government to examine the sector after areport found an alarming decline in services, the panel of experts said while youth workers were working hard under extreme pressure, some were ""fragile"". However, it said years of issues had been heightened by Covid, with youth workers furloughed or moved to different services, and the current situation was ""unsustainable"". This video can not be played Young people at the Sydic youth club in Senghenydd, Caerphilly, talked about the group being one big family. It called for a new law to be introduced, to make providing youth services a legal requirement, to stop them being classed as a ""luxury"" and left exposed to cuts. Care leavers 'should be told about' their social services file Social workers fear a 'generation of traumatised children' The panel, who spoke to youth workers and young people during the three-year inquiry, called on the Welsh government to commit to an independent review of funding of youth services, amid concerns not all cash was making its way to being spent on young people. It also urged the Welsh government to urgently appoint a minister for young people aged under 25, to sit in the cabinet, saying the lack of a formal seat at the table meant their voices were not always heard. Halyna Soltys said working with young people was really rewarding and their voices needed to be heard After starting at Rainbows when she was five, Halyna Soltys now works with young people to help share their stories online, championing issues and campaigns on ProMo-Cymru. ""I wouldn't be the person I am without youth services,"" the Cardiff University graduate said. ""When you interact with a service that just wants to encourage you to be the best you can be and try new things, then the whole world opens up for you."" The 23-year-old said growing up in the Girlguiding community helped her develop strong skills for university and work. But she said there was a lack of guidance from the Welsh government for youth workers and a more consistent message was needed to make sure no young person missed out. Rhodri Lewis, who spoke to the panel about young people's experiences, said being part of a club had given him real life skills Rhodri Lewis said he was very shy when he first joined the young farmers' club and ""barely spoke to anyone"", but was now acting as a treasurer, a member of the Urdd, and representing Wales in tug-of-war. The 18-year-old, who lives in Pembrokeshire, said being unable to meet during the Covid pandemic had shown him how important the clubs were. He said young people were facing challenging futures, with issues getting jobs, accessing services, and having to move away from home due to a lack of affordable housing, and it was vital they got support. ""It's 2021 - the way we look at young people and listen to them needs to change,"" he said. Keith Towler, chairman of the Interim Youth Work Board for Wales and former Children's Commissioner, said young people had told the panel how accessing the services had transformed and even saved their lives. He said while there was a lot of good work going on, the current system was ""broken"" and did a disservice to hard-working youth workers. He added if services were not safeguarded by law, he feared they would be cut to death. Mr Towler said making sure youth services survived was vital, for all 11 to 25-year-olds to have someone to turn to and trust outside their homes and school, and it would ""be the saddest thing"" if they needed that and had nowhere to go. ""The consequences of not providing these services will end up putting a strain on services elsewhere,"" he said. Responding to the report, Education Minister Jeremy Miles said youth workers had faced ""immense difficulties"" during the pandemic. Mr Miles said: ""The sector has truly demonstrated the importance and the need for innovative youth work services in Wales."" He said the report's recommendations were ""ambitious and challenging"" and work was already under way to help services post-pandemic, with Â£2.5m announced for services in 2021-22.

Public women always thinking about security - MPRosie Duffield says she will not be attending Labour's conference because of fears about her safety.UK Politics,"A Labour MP wants a meeting with Sir Keir Starmer to clarify where the party stands on transgender issues. Rosie Duffield, who has clashed with campaigners over her views on self identification for trans people, said the party's position was unclear. But a senior Labour MP said it was ""being used as a wedge issue"" when the party should be focused elsewhere. Ms Duffield also confirmed she would not attend this week's party conference after online threats to her safety. The abuse has been widely condemned by politicians and activists, who called it ""utterly unacceptable"". Last week, Labour's shadow equalities minister Marsha de Cordova resigned from her post, saying she wanted to focus more of her time in her marginal constituency of Battersea, and shadow women's minister Charlotte Nichols also stepped down. It is not known if the debate within the party over transgender issues had anything to do with their resignations, but it leaves a gap on the party's frontbench when it comes to issues of equality and women's rights. What does transgender mean and what does the law say? Duffield calls for ""change of tone"" and more women at top of government Three trans journeys: 'I spent so long hiding' Canterbury MP Ms Duffield has regularly used social media to outline her own position on transgender issues. She believes that biological females should have protected spaces where biological males are not allowed to go, such as domestic violence refuges and prisons, and she is against people being able to self-identify as trans to gain access to those spaces. Ms Duffield has said she is ""completely supportive of trans rights"", but she has been condemned by some LGBT+ groups for her position - which say trans men and women should be treated the same as biological men and women - as well as for endorsing controversial tweets on the issue. Andtwo of her staff members resigned,externalfrom her office over her views. A senior Labour MP, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC they were frustrated with the ""oxygen"" being given to the subject, calling it ""a stupid, pointless, manufactured row about rights"" that was distracting from the issues that needed debating. They added: ""Let's talk about how every single trans person awaiting NHS treatment is having their rights to see a specialist in 18 weeks under the NHS constitution breached, for example, rather than whether Rosie Duffield thinks everyone should have their genitals and chromosomes checked to go to the toilet."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Duffield said she and other female MPs had asked for a meeting with Sir Keir to discuss transgender rights and women-only spaces, but it had not yet taken place. ""Lots of women have been asking to meet with Keir Starmer in groups or one-to-one about this issue and obviously he is incredibly busy, but it would be good to just clarify what our position is as a party and just to discuss how we go forward with this issue,"" she said. ""He's always positive about trying to organise a meeting, it just hasn't happened yet. I think it is really necessary that we actually talk about this."" Asked what sort of threats she had received as a result of her views, Ms Duffield said the ""levels of vitriol are pretty horrible"". She added: ""Women have every right to voice their opinions. I have seen tweets by male colleagues that have been identical to mine about Labour policy for example, and the comments under mine and other women's tweets are very different. ""This is is a cross-party issue. All women in public life, anyone who puts their head above the parapet... just gets abuse for the way we look, what we say and it is really horrible and it always turns to violence when its women. ""We always get the violence, pictures of guns, pictures of mocked up nooses, that's the kind of thing we get on social media."" By Ione Wells, BBC political correspondent There are two key issues at play here. Firstly, Rosie Duffield has taken a stance on an emotive topic that gives rise to controversy, around people's identities, the right to self-identify and gain access to certain spaces. That has, and will, open her up to scrutiny, as taking any strong opinion in politics can do. That is particularly the case with this issue when there are live debates around whether gender recognition laws need to be changed. Secondly, what politicians of all stripes agree on is that no one in public life should fear for their safety if some critics turn legitimate criticism into abuse. Online abuse of women in public life, and the threat of this translating into offline abuse, is also nothing new. So while Labour clarifying to MPs its stance on self-identification may help resolve internal party conflicts over this topic, it's not clear - or likely - this would prevent people like Rosie Duffield and other women in public life receiving online and real-life threats. After the news Ms Duffield would not be attending the Labour Party conference in Brighton was reported by theSunday Times,external, a number of public figures spoke out against the abuse she had received. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said too many people had been ""targeted for their opinion or the office they hold"", adding: ""In order to protect democracy, we need to ensure those participating can do so without threats of intimidation."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""unacceptable"" she felt unsafe, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""We must be able to have this conversation in a civilised way."" This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: ""It's unacceptable that anybody feels unsafe going to Labour Party conference"" And the LGBT+ Labour group put out a statement, saying it ""totally condemns the abuse and physical threats"" the MP had faced. It added: ""We have made clear our political disagreements with Rosie on policy affecting trans people, but political disagreement should never result in abuse or physical threats. It is utterly unacceptable."" The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, also took to Twitter to speak out against the abuse, posting: ""Absolutely everybody has the right to be safe from abuse, threat or harm. That includes Rosie Duffield and the transgender community. ""It's about time we looked for our shared humanity in our dealings with others, rather than the division.""

Putin's party leads vote amid fraud claimsThe pro-Kremlin United Russia party is on course for a majority in a parliamentary vote.Europe,"Opponents of President Vladimir Putin have accused Russian authorities of mass election fraud Russian President Vladimir Putin's party has won a parliamentary majority following an election marred by reports of fraud. With almost all of the votes counted, the United Russia party had won nearly 50% of the vote, marking a slight drop in support from the previous election. Mr Putin's biggest critics were barred from running, and there were reports of ballot stuffing and forced voting. Russia's electoral commission rejected claims of widespread irregularities. With more than 99% of votes counted, United Russia's closest rival, the Communist Party, had about 19% of the vote, according to the election commission. United Russia's victory means it will have more than two-thirds of the 450 seats in the country's parliament, officials say. However, despite easily retaining its majority in parliament, the party did lose some ground. In 2016, the party won 54% of the vote. The Communists, who broadly support Mr Putin's initiatives in the parliament, saw their support grow by about 6%. But their leader, Gennady Zyuganov, has alleged widespread violations, including ballot-stuffing, according to the Associated Press news agency. The final results will be announced on Friday, Russia's Electoral Commission head Ella Pamfilova said. Concerns over living standards and allegations of corruption from jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny have likely affected support for Mr Putin's party. But he remains popular with many Russians who credit him with standing up to the West and restoring national pride. In a TV address on Monday, Mr Putin thanked voters for their trust and said United Russia had confirmed its role as the leading party. Supporters of Mr Navalny have called for protests and condemned the result as illegitimate. For Russia's party of power, it's job done. United Russia is confident that it has retained its parliamentary majority, albeit with a slightly smaller share of the vote than last time round. Judging by last night's celebrations at party headquarters, the party faithful are more than pleased with the result. United Russia insists it won this race fair and square. But even before the first ballots were cast in the marathon vote, this election looked anything but fair. The Kremlin's most vocal critics had been barred from running - among them, supporters of Mr Navalny. Then there was the voting process itself. Over three days of polling there were allegations of widespread electoral fraud, including ballot box stuffing and threats against election observers. Video widely shared online showed people stuffing papers into ballot boxes. Mr Navalny and his allies had called on Russians to vote tactically, in many cases for Communist Party candidates they believed could defeat incumbents from United Russia. But this has not prevented the Kremlin's party from securing a large slice of the new parliament. The election saw a number of cities introduce electronic voting. One such city was the capital, Moscow, where some Communist Party candidates lost leads when electronic votes were declared at the last minute. ""I know that such a result is simply not possible,"" one defeated Communist candidate, Mikhail Lobanov, wrote on Twitter. This video can not be played Footage has emerged which allegedly shows fraud taking place during Russia's election For the first time since 1993, election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were not present due to limitations imposed by Russian authorities. A European Union spokesman said the elections were not properly monitored, nor conducted in a free and fair way. The governments of the UK, Germany and the US echoed this. On Monday, independent vote monitoring group Golos - which the Russian authorities have branded ""a foreign agent"" - said it had received about 5,000 reports of possible voting violations. Russia's interior ministry, meanwhile, told reporters it had not registered any ""significant violations"". During the three-day vote, videos published on social media had shown long queues outside some polling stations. Interfax news agency reported this was especially the case outside police stations. But the Kremlin spokesman rejected claims that it was an indication of people being put under pressure to vote. The vote took place over three days But Golos said it had received""numerous messages"" from people who said they were being forced,externalby their employers to vote, as well as allegations of electoral fraud. In parts of east Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists, residents with Russian citizenship were allowed to vote, with some crossing the border to visit Russian polling stations. There has also been anger after a Smart Voting app, devised by Mr Navalny, wasremoved from Apple and Google stores on the day Russians started voting. Russian authorities had threatened the two companies with big fines if they refused to drop the app, which told users who could unseat ruling party candidates. It is not yet clear whether the app had any impact on how people voted. Opposition crushed ahead of managed polls Russia bans Navalny-linked organisations ""This is truly unbelievable,"" Mr Navalny's spokesperson Kira Yarmysh told AFP. ""I remember the feeling in 2011, when they stole the election. The same is happening right now."" Mr Navalny led mass protests against the government in 2011 following parliamentary elections critics said were riddled with fraud. President Putin thanked voters for putting trust in his party, United Russia One Moscow pensioner, who gave his name only as Anatoly, told Reuters news agency he voted for the ruling party as he appreciated Mr Putin's efforts to restore Russia's influence on the world stage. ""Countries like the United States and Britain more or less respect us now like they respected the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 70s. The Anglo-Saxons only understand the language of force,"" he said. But with official turnout reported to be about 52%, there were signs of widespread indifference. ""I don't see the point in voting,"" said one Moscow hairdresser who gave her name as Irina. ""It's all been decided for us anyway.""

Judging by last night's celebrations at party headquarters, the party faithful are more than pleased with the result. United Russia insists it won this race fair and square. But even before the first ballots were cast in the marathon vote, this election looked anything but fair. The Kremlin's most vocal critics had been barred from running - among them, supporters of Mr Navalny. Then there was the voting process itself. Over three days of polling there were allegations of widespread electoral fraud, including ballot box stuffing and threats against election observers. Video widely shared online showed people stuffing papers into ballot boxes. Mr Navalny and his allies had called on Russians to vote tactically, in many cases for Communist Party candidates they believed could defeat incumbents from United Russia. But this has not prevented the Kremlin's party from securing a large slice of the new parliament. The election saw a number of cities introduce electronic voting. One such city was the capital, Moscow, where some Communist Party candidates lost leads when electronic votes were declared at the last minute. ""I know that such a result is simply not possible,"" one defeated Communist candidate, Mikhail Lobanov, wrote on Twitter. This video can not be played Footage has emerged which allegedly shows fraud taking place during Russia's election For the first time since 1993, election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were not present due to limitations imposed by Russian authorities. A European Union spokesman said the elections were not properly monitored, nor conducted in a free and fair way. The governments of the UK, Germany and the US echoed this. On Monday, independent vote monitoring group Golos - which the Russian authorities have branded ""a foreign agent"" - said it had received about 5,000 reports of possible voting violations. Russia's interior ministry, meanwhile, told reporters it had not registered any ""significant violations"". During the three-day vote, videos published on social media had shown long queues outside some polling stations. Interfax news agency reported this was especially the case outside police stations. But the Kremlin spokesman rejected claims that it was an indication of people being put under pressure to vote. The vote took place over three days But Golos said it had received""numerous messages"" from people who said they were being forced,externalby their employers to vote, as well as allegations of electoral fraud. In parts of east Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists, residents with Russian citizenship were allowed to vote, with some crossing the border to visit Russian polling stations. There has also been anger after a Smart Voting app, devised by Mr Navalny, wasremoved from Apple and Google stores on the day Russians started voting. Russian authorities had threatened the two companies with big fines if they refused to drop the app, which told users who could unseat ruling party candidates. It is not yet clear whether the app had any impact on how people voted. Opposition crushed ahead of managed polls Russia bans Navalny-linked organisations ""This is truly unbelievable,"" Mr Navalny's spokesperson Kira Yarmysh told AFP. ""I remember the feeling in 2011, when they stole the election. The same is happening right now."" Mr Navalny led mass protests against the government in 2011 following parliamentary elections critics said were riddled with fraud. President Putin thanked voters for putting trust in his party, United Russia One Moscow pensioner, who gave his name only as Anatoly, told Reuters news agency he voted for the ruling party as he appreciated Mr Putin's efforts to restore Russia's influence on the world stage. ""Countries like the United States and Britain more or less respect us now like they respected the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 70s. The Anglo-Saxons only understand the language of force,"" he said. But with official turnout reported to be about 52%, there were signs of widespread indifference. ""I don't see the point in voting,"" said one Moscow hairdresser who gave her name as Irina. ""It's all been decided for us anyway.""

Public women always thinking about security - MP,"A Labour MP wants a meeting with Sir Keir Starmer to clarify where the party stands on transgender issues. Rosie Duffield, who has clashed with campaigners over her views on self identification for trans people, said the party's position was unclear. But a senior Labour MP said it was ""being used as a wedge issue"" when the party should be focused elsewhere. Ms Duffield also confirmed she would not attend this week's party conference after online threats to her safety. The abuse has been widely condemned by politicians and activists, who called it ""utterly unacceptable"". Last week, Labour's shadow equalities minister Marsha de Cordova resigned from her post, saying she wanted to focus more of her time in her marginal constituency of Battersea, and shadow women's minister Charlotte Nichols also stepped down. It is not known if the debate within the party over transgender issues had anything to do with their resignations, but it leaves a gap on the party's frontbench when it comes to issues of equality and women's rights. What does transgender mean and what does the law say? Duffield calls for ""change of tone"" and more women at top of government Three trans journeys: 'I spent so long hiding' Canterbury MP Ms Duffield has regularly used social media to outline her own position on transgender issues. She believes that biological females should have protected spaces where biological males are not allowed to go, such as domestic violence refuges and prisons, and she is against people being able to self-identify as trans to gain access to those spaces. Ms Duffield has said she is ""completely supportive of trans rights"", but she has been condemned by some LGBT+ groups for her position - which say trans men and women should be treated the same as biological men and women - as well as for endorsing controversial tweets on the issue. Andtwo of her staff members resigned,externalfrom her office over her views. A senior Labour MP, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC they were frustrated with the ""oxygen"" being given to the subject, calling it ""a stupid, pointless, manufactured row about rights"" that was distracting from the issues that needed debating. They added: ""Let's talk about how every single trans person awaiting NHS treatment is having their rights to see a specialist in 18 weeks under the NHS constitution breached, for example, rather than whether Rosie Duffield thinks everyone should have their genitals and chromosomes checked to go to the toilet."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Duffield said she and other female MPs had asked for a meeting with Sir Keir to discuss transgender rights and women-only spaces, but it had not yet taken place. ""Lots of women have been asking to meet with Keir Starmer in groups or one-to-one about this issue and obviously he is incredibly busy, but it would be good to just clarify what our position is as a party and just to discuss how we go forward with this issue,"" she said. ""He's always positive about trying to organise a meeting, it just hasn't happened yet. I think it is really necessary that we actually talk about this."" Asked what sort of threats she had received as a result of her views, Ms Duffield said the ""levels of vitriol are pretty horrible"". She added: ""Women have every right to voice their opinions. I have seen tweets by male colleagues that have been identical to mine about Labour policy for example, and the comments under mine and other women's tweets are very different. ""This is is a cross-party issue. All women in public life, anyone who puts their head above the parapet... just gets abuse for the way we look, what we say and it is really horrible and it always turns to violence when its women. ""We always get the violence, pictures of guns, pictures of mocked up nooses, that's the kind of thing we get on social media."" By Ione Wells, BBC political correspondent There are two key issues at play here. Firstly, Rosie Duffield has taken a stance on an emotive topic that gives rise to controversy, around people's identities, the right to self-identify and gain access to certain spaces. That has, and will, open her up to scrutiny, as taking any strong opinion in politics can do. That is particularly the case with this issue when there are live debates around whether gender recognition laws need to be changed. Secondly, what politicians of all stripes agree on is that no one in public life should fear for their safety if some critics turn legitimate criticism into abuse. Online abuse of women in public life, and the threat of this translating into offline abuse, is also nothing new. So while Labour clarifying to MPs its stance on self-identification may help resolve internal party conflicts over this topic, it's not clear - or likely - this would prevent people like Rosie Duffield and other women in public life receiving online and real-life threats. After the news Ms Duffield would not be attending the Labour Party conference in Brighton was reported by theSunday Times,external, a number of public figures spoke out against the abuse she had received. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said too many people had been ""targeted for their opinion or the office they hold"", adding: ""In order to protect democracy, we need to ensure those participating can do so without threats of intimidation."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""unacceptable"" she felt unsafe, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""We must be able to have this conversation in a civilised way."" This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: ""It's unacceptable that anybody feels unsafe going to Labour Party conference"" And the LGBT+ Labour group put out a statement, saying it ""totally condemns the abuse and physical threats"" the MP had faced. It added: ""We have made clear our political disagreements with Rosie on policy affecting trans people, but political disagreement should never result in abuse or physical threats. It is utterly unacceptable."" The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, also took to Twitter to speak out against the abuse, posting: ""Absolutely everybody has the right to be safe from abuse, threat or harm. That includes Rosie Duffield and the transgender community. ""It's about time we looked for our shared humanity in our dealings with others, rather than the division.""

Ted Lasso wins comedy categories at Emmy Awards,"This video can not be played Olivia Colman beat her co-star Emma Corrin to be named best lead actress in a drama series Netflix's royal drama The Crown and Apple TV comedy Ted Lasso were the big winners at Sunday's Emmy Awards. The Crown's prizes included best drama series and four acting wins - for Gillian Anderson, Olivia Colman, Josh O'Connor and Tobias Menzies. ""What a lovely end to the most extraordinary journey with this lovely family,"" Colman said of her final series playing Queen Elizabeth II. ""I loved every second of it and I can't wait to see what happens next."" Becoming emotional, she added: ""I wish my dad was here to see this. I lost my daddy during Covid, and he would've loved all of this."" The Crown's victory in the best drama series category is not the first time a streaming service has won the top prize at the Emmys, but it does mark the first victory for Netflix. The Crown's Josh O'Connor was named best drama actor for his performance as Prince Charles Anderson won for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher, Menzies for the Duke of Edinburgh, and O'Connor for Prince Charles. Many of this year's nominated actors from The Crown left the show after its most recent series, including Emerald Fennell, who played the Duchess of Cornwall, and Colman, who will be replaced as the Queen in the forthcoming fifth season by Imelda Staunton. In pictures: The Emmy Awards red carpet Emmy Awards 2021: The winners and nominees What's the big deal about Ted Lasso? The 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards took place in Los Angeles on Sunday and saw most nominees attend in person, although many British nominees appeared from a separate hub in London. UK winners included Michaela Coel, who won outstanding writing for a limited series for her consent drama I May Destroy You. ""I dedicate this story to every single survivor of sexual assault,"" she said as she collected her award. Michaela Coel stars in her own creation, I May Destroy You Coel also used her speech to address aspiring writers, telling them: ""Write the tale that scares you, that makes you feel uncertain, that isn't comfortable, I dare you."" She said staying away from social media could help them to create their best work. ""Do not be afraid to disappear, from it, from us, for a while, and see what comes to you in the silence,"" she said. The British writer and actress was one of the few non-white stars to score a win at the awards, which was criticised online for its lack of diversity. While many black actors were nominated, when it came to the ceremony itself, white performers took home all 12 acting awards across the comedy, drama and limited series categories.

In contrast, three black stars were among the four winning guest actors at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmys, a prelude to this Sunday's main event - namely Saturday Night Live hosts Dave Chappelle and Maya Rudolph, and Lovecraft Country's Courtney B Vance. The host of RuPaul's Drag Race, RuPaul Charles, however, did manage to become the most-awarded black artist in Emmy history on Sunday, bagging his 11th award for the outstanding competition programme. If MJ Rodriguez from drag ball drama Pose had beaten Colman to the lead actress award, she would have become the first transgender performer to win in a lead acting category. Kate Winslet was named best lead actress in a limited series for Mare of Easttown Kate Winslet and Ewan McGregor were named best limited series actress and actor for Mare of Easttown and Halston respectively. Winslet said: ""I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees in this decade that has to be about women having each other's backs. I support you, I salute you, I am proud of all of you. The HBO crime drama saw the actress play a police detective who is investigating the murder of a girl in a working-class community in Pennsylvania. ""Mare of Easttown was this cultural moment, and it brought people together and gave people something to talk about other than a pandemic, and I want to thank everybody for watching our show,"" Winslet said. Paying tribute to writer and creator Brad Ingelsby, she added: ""You created a middle-aged, imperfect, flawed mother, and you made us all feel validated."" Her Mare of Easttown co-stars Evan Peters and Julianne Nicholson also both won supporting actor and actress for their performances in the show. Brett Goldstein and Hannah Waddingham won best supporting actor and actress for Ted Lasso Jason Sudeikis was named best lead comedy actor for his performance in Ted Lasso, while his British co-stars Hannah Waddingham and Brett Goldstein won best supporting actress and actor. ""This show is about family, it's about mentors and teachers, it's about team-mates,"" Sudeikis said. ""And I wouldn't be here without those three things in my life."" His co-star Waddingham, a successful theatre actress, called for more stage stars to be given TV roles during her acceptance speech. ""West End musical performers need to be on screen more,"" she told the audience. ""Please give us a chance because we won't let you down."" She paid tribute to co-star and fellow nominee Juno Temple, saying she wished she could share the prize with her. Goldstein won outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series for his portrayal of cantankerous club captain Roy Kent. The 41-year-old said starring in the show had been ""one of the greatest honours"" of his life. Ted Lasso, which first aired on Apple TV last year, tells the story ofa US football coach who moves to the UK to coach a fictional Premiership team. Left-right: The Queen's Gambit stars Moses Ingram, Anya Taylor-Joy and Marielle Heller 11 - The Crown 11 - The Queen's Gambit 8 - Saturday Night Live 7- Ted Lasso 7- The Mandalorian 6- Love, Death & Robots 5- RuPaul's Drag Race 4- Mare Of Easttown Includes Creative Arts Emmys, which were awarded last week Jean Smart was named best lead actress in a comedy series for her performance in Hacks. As well as taking the top drama prize of the night, The Crown's Peter Morgan and Jessica Hobbs also won for writing and directing respectively. Collecting the writing prize, Morgan said: ""I'm very proud, I'm very grateful, we're going to party. Goodnight."" Hobbs thanked other female directors and her mother, who she said is still directing at the age of 77. Menzies was not present to collect his award. Gillian Anderson won best drama supporting actress for her portrayal of British prime minister Margaret Thatcher British comic John Oliver, host of US late night show Last Week Tonight, continued his Emmy streak when his show picked up its sixth straight win in the outstanding variety talk series category. The final award of the night, outstanding limited or anthology series, went to Netflix's chess drama The Queen's Gambit. In a highly competitive category, it won ahead of I May Destroy You, Mare Of Easttown, The Underground Railroad and WandaVision. Netflix's combined total of 44 wins this year meant it towered above its nearest competitor - HBO and its HBO Max streaming service with 19. That makes this year the first time Netflix had won more Emmys than HBO, which has dominated the ceremony for years. Disney+ was third on 14, while Apple TV won 10. This year's In Memoriam section included tributes to stars including Larry King, Michael Apted, Alex Trebek, Helen McCrory, Jessica Walter, Cicely Tyson and Michael K Williams. The ceremony, hosted by US comedian Cedric the Entertainer, was held after a year of increased TV viewing prompted by lockdown restrictions around the world.
